113,Such a great hotel,I had lunch here last week & had a fantastic meal. The staff were super friendly but very professional with it. I love this place-it‚Äôs slightly off the beaten track which I think makes it so much better than the bigger more impersonal central London hotels.,5,2024,10,20
113,The BEST experience,"My family and I visited London and chose The Kensington Hotel as our place to stay this time. I have no words to describe the warmth and care the staff here have provided us through the entire stay. 
We want to thank everyone who has gone above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. 
I would like to acknowledge 
1) Miss Almire: She is a perfect host and thought of every detail including for our twins. She thought about a fun night theme for the kids and made it absolutely memorable with gifts, popcorn and foot tapping music. Kids had a blast. Almire is absolutely a joy and gem to this establishment.
2) Mr. Thomas Keating: He is such a wonderful manager. He made us feel special everyday. He showed through his actions how much he cared. He along with Miss Almire made our kids have that extra special night of fun. We are absolutely overjoyed seeing this hospitality. 
3) Mr. Emiliano: He is one of the most organized persons I have come across. He organized all of our day trips and took extra care to help us with it. Thank you so much. 
4) Mr. Mario: He went out of his way everyday to ensure we had the best transportation. He was extremely attentive to our needs. He would greet us with a smile every time we walked in and out which made it so nice. He is extremely courteous.
5) Mr. Pavel: Another wonderful person in the organization who helped us along with Mr. Emiliano. Always with a smile. He even advised my husband regarding getting wonderful shoes. 
6) Ms. Genesis: I had been communicating with Ms. Genesis regarding organizing a high tea for me and my friends. She was so patient with my planning and helped me get it done. Thank you!
7) Mr. Mateo: He is a thorough gentleman. My friends and I will always remember how he helped procure us vegetarian dishes for the afternoon tea in a matter of minutes.  
8) Mr. Gurcan: Always helpful and attentive with a smile. Very courteous. 
9) Front desk reception: Every single member of the team is outstanding. 
9) Housekeeping: Absolutely fantastic. 

Thank you again for creating this absolutely wonderful place for travelers and taking into account every detail to make our stay an enjoyable and memorable experience. Look forward to coming back here again.",5,2022,08,12
113,Best hotel,"The Kensington Hotel in London is a delightful blend of elegance and comfort, making it a perfect retreat in the heart of the city. From the moment we arrived, the staff stood out with their exceptional hospitality. They were not only friendly but went above and beyond to ensure our stay was memorable, offering personalized recommendations and prompt assistance with our requests.",5,2024,10,16

113,Best Concierge staff I've ever met,"I cannot express enough the quality of the customer service at the Kensington. The concierge team (Emiliano and Silvio) were extremely helpful, kind and supportive in a very difficult situation. Our car suffered a breakdown in front of the hotel's entrance last night and needed to be towed away. Silvio at the time was very compassionate about the situation and offered us the chance to use the hotel restrooms until the breakdown company arrives. Unfortunately, the towing company showed up with the wrong tow truck and they put an order for a different truck which would take around 3 hours. It was already 1 am and we had to get home due to work. Silvio kindly agreed to keep the car key at the hotel reception's safe place to allow us to go home whilst the towing company make their way to collect the car. The towing company took several hours and Silvio kindly liaised with Emiliano to continue looking after the keys until the car is picked up. The team continued voluntarily to give us regular updates about the status of the car and continued to reassure us that they will make sure it is picked up nicely. Few hours late the towing company showed up and Emiliano gave us a call to confirm that everything is sorted. This is so humane from the concierge who understood what it is like to suffer such an incident late night in London. I cannot be grateful enough and recommend them as a hotel and leisure destination. Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart.",5,2024,10,10
113,Amazing stay !!,"Staying at The Kensington is always a great experience. The staff is very friendly, Special shout out to Emiliano, from the concierge team.

113,Not very good!,"I‚Äôve both stayed at the hotel and dined there many times from lunch to dinner, drinks and afternoon tea. Ad most other touristy locations, the place is overpriced, overrated and the service is down right awful! 
The food is average if you can wait an hour to get a drink and food, rooms are as small as broom closets for ¬£400 a night,",3,2024,10,06
113,"Stunning quaint hotel , exceptional staff !","This was my first international solo journey. When I arrived, I was amazed by the stunning hotel. Mario welcomed me with a smile and attended to my needs. Emiliano and Arman went above the norm to help me plan my seven-day itinerary; it was perfectly done. I had a week filled with culture, art, and history. A special thanks to George for the private tour of BClub London. I  definitely got the Royal treatment.

With my sincere gratitude,

Emiliano, concierge, spent hours, helping me with the steps to obtain an emergency passport, rebook my airline flights, making sure I could spend the extra night in the room I was in. Thomas was attentive, in making us feel welcome each day. His friendly face greeted us often. Each day the staff were friendly and  seemed happy to work there.  The lobby, restaurants, and lounge areas were good for relaxation or meeting to talk. The rooms were compact, but adequate for such a great location. Close to Museums, shopping, and exellent restaurants. I enjoyed sitting on the outside porch to people watch and read a book.

Couple shout outs: The concierge George made our stay so special, with great recommendations around the city and always welcomed us by name after a long day exploring the city.

113,What a superb stay!!!!!  What a hotel.   What a team!! Wonderful,"We came up to London to celebrate my wife's birthday.

We often stay in hotels.  Not every weekend.  But often enough to know what a good hotel looks like.   The Kensington is way beyond good, and they should be proud (as I‚Äôm sure they are) of their hotel and their team.

The hotel was magical, in so many ways:

-	The staff effortlessness care, attention, love for the hotel and its guests,  helpfulness and willingness to go that extra mile.  Very special indeed
-	The hotel d√©cor, cleanliness and layout
-	The amazing food (and errrrm drink üòâ )
-	The warm ambience

Our stay, albeit short, will live very long in the memory

I would like to give a big shout out to:

- Thomas Keating.    One of life's good guys.   Friendly, warm and helpful
- Daisy.   Exceptionally helpful.  You can't help but like her.  Wonderful manager.  
- Addy (cocktail bar).  Really helpful and friendly
- Young girl at breakfast.   Cannot remember her name.  So friendly and helpful*

*Thomas - not sure what her name was. Early 20s. Please pass on my thanks

The whole team were simply brilliant.   To the extent that I would do everything that I could to stay there again.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone.   It's more of a boutique hotel than a large hotel, but it doesnt really feel small inside.  The decor is amazing.

Thanks once again to the team at The Kensington.  Showing your competitors how it should be dine",5,2024,09,15
113,Terrible receptionist,"I had a terrible reception and service from the night receptionist. She simply said there were no rooms available and even tried to blame booking.com. The conversation escalated, and suddenly, rooms became available. However, she still tried to place us in inferior rooms. It‚Äôs hard to believe I had to go through this situation with my wife at a place I used to visit, but I definitely won‚Äôt be returning.‚Äù",1,2024,09,13
113,Outstanding Experience,"We stopped in London on the way to Toronto and stayed in The Kensington Hotel as we have done many times in the past.

113,Stay here,"Highly recommend a stay here. It was my first time in London and I will go back to purposely stay here. The hotel is immaculate. The food menu although not my taste, did look nice. The staff are genuinely warm and welcoming giving an overall inviting feel. I'd like to give a special mention to the lovely doorman who was particularly nice and I'm sorry I didn't get his name. Hotel staff are very helpful as regards directions, advice and accommodating dietary needs.",5,2024,09,10

113,"Nice hotel, great location","I stayed with my teen daughter at this lovely hotel for 2 nights.  It is a beautiful luxurious property. The lobby and surrounding common areas are stunning. And that big front balcony/entrance to the hotel. Really lovely. We were warmly welcomed on arrival.  We had a queen room for our stay. It was small, a bit worn to me, but clean and comfortable. Nice bathroom. Our room rate included the daily breakfast which I was looking forward to because my husband and I stayed here some years ago and I remember the daily breakfast being fantastic. But for our recent stay, it was just okay.  The first morning we had scrambled eggs that were almost inedible.  Service at breakfast was very good though. The waitstaff took good care of us. The location of the hotel is stellar. Walking distance from the museums we all want to go to, the tube station is right there and lots of shops and dining options and green spaces within easy reach.  Overall a pretty decent stay.",4,2024,09,04
113,Fabulous!,"Beautiful hotel! My son and I thoroughly enjoyed our wonderful 5 night stay. The service of this hotel is stellar.  We were greeted by name by the friendly front desk staff as we arrived at check-in. We have had a long travel day, and felt warmly welcomed and instantly at home at The Kensington. Harvey, the bellman attended to our luggage and parcels throughout the trip and offered taxis, thoughtful tips and great neighborhood advice. The restaurant was also fantastic for breakfast each morning.  The rooms were comfortable, clean and quiet.  Can‚Äôt wait to come back!",5,2024,09,03
113,Super 5 star experience. Amazing staff!,A Saturday stopover at The Amazing Kensington. On arrival were greeted by the most warm reception from everyone. So many smiles and good wishes. We were expected and Ronnie knew who we were somehow! Check in was a breeze and our bag was taken to our lovely room. We ate locally nut had predinner drinks in the super special K Bar. We were treated as we were celebrating a special event which was so kind. Our room was perfect and breakfast was sumptuous in the morning. Ronnie took care of our bag whilst we went off to an event and when we returned the kind doorman ( didn't get his name) worked hard to find us a cab. All in all a truly 5 star experience made possible by amazing staff. Loved it. If you are needing a special base when in the South Ken area you must stay at The Kensington.,5,2024,09,01

And the cost was less expensive than other not as grand hotels in the area - can't wait to visit again!",5,2024,08,24
113,Wonderful boutique hotel,"Wonderful boutique style hotel. Perfect spacious character room with modern bathroom having powerful shower. Location second to none in Kensington with many restaurants and bars nearby plus two of Londons best museums.

113,Best Hotel in London!,"We have been to London a few times and stayed all over the city, however, this was our first time at The Kensington.  It was the best hotel we have been to yet!  From the moment we arrived until the very end.  We were visiting London from the states.  We had a long overnight flight and arrived about 8:30 AM London time.  We arrived to the hotel just expecting to drop our bags before the long day ahead.  Fortunately, this is when we met Ali!  He was able to have our room ready for us in less than 30 minutes.  And he upgraded us to a suite!  I can't tell you how thankful we were for a shower and a brief rest before the day ahead.  We had drinks later in the bar which were excellent and the setting stunning.  Everyone on staff was pleasant and accommodating.  You could tell that the attitude by everyone on staff was to make it the best stay possible.  No detail was overlooked, from the treat left for us in the evening, to the electrical adaptor left for us in the room, or the Nespresso machine.  And can I just mention the shower - ahhhhh a true spa experience with excellent water pressure (something I have found hard to find in London).  We will definitely be back and recommend The Kensington to all.  Finally, the pictures are exactly as the place presents.  Just beautiful!",5,2024,08,21

113,The Kensington: Quiet Neighborhood But London Sightseeing Is Within Easy Reach,"Our family stayed at The Kensington hotel for nine nights and LOVED it. The hotel is in a terrific neighborhood for tourists...within walking distance of three first-class museums, Kensington Palace and Hyde Park, Harrods, restaurants, pubs, and the South Kensington Tube station. Traveling to all parts of the city was extremely easy via the Tube. We also took a short taxi ride to Stamford Bridge and the Chelsea football stadium. The hotel itself if stately, elegant and beautiful but with great warmth and character inside. The rooms might be a bit small, but they're a delight to be in with our rooms having nice views of Queen's Gate. The hotel, though, is a cut above all others because of the delightful personalities of staff members. Everyone is very friendly, helpful and attentive. We were met with smiles and greetings from everyone from the moment we arrived. Tom and Daisy were truly wonderful. The concierge staff members were extremely helpful, too. We very much hope to return to London in the near future and, without a doubt, would reserve rooms again at The Kensington.",5,2024,08,18

Two recent stays in July and August 2024 reinforced our fond memories of a previous stay some years ago. The high level of professionalism and courtesy from all the staff was incredible. We apologise for not being able to name all the staff however special thanks to Ali and Michael on reception and all the concierges, especially Harvey who were all so kind and helpful and the wonderful breakfast, restaurant and bar staff.
There are so many reasons why we would highly recommend staying at this hotel. The beds are very comfortable, the breakfasts are superb and
 the restaurant and bar are definitely worth visiting.  The hotel is in an excellent location. Close to both the underground and buses however far enough away not to be bothered by noise. The ambience of the hotel is beautiful. We truly look forward to a return visit.",5,2024,08,13

The service is consistently focused and caring, from the bellman to the concierge,  They are incredibly attentive. I want to especially acknowledge our server Chandan, who, on the night we dined in helped me with my cold. She made sure that I had tea with lemon and some turmeric and sent me back to the room with a pot of tea for the night. She was incredibly caring and warm. We will be back here anytime we are in london!",5,2024,08,10
113,A 70th birthday treat,"I stayed at the Kensington Hotel as part of a 70th birthday treat. This also included a trip to the proms. As a venue it is ideally suited for the Royal Albert Hall.

113,The best and friendliest hotel stay in London I‚Äôve ever experienced. I will be going back to this hotel.,"The staff was extremely friendly, accommodating, and professional. Harvey especially went out of his way to help us with the smallest little details. He was also anticipatory of not only my needs, but every guests needs as well.

113,The perfect hotel for a London stay!,We very much enjoyed our stay at The Kensington. The staff was delightful and the breakfasts and tea were delicous.  The location was perfect for our stay and South Kensington felt clean and safe to walk in the evenings. We will definitely be back.,5,2024,08,02
113,Perfect location but not five star,"I spent 10 days in London and the Kensington stay came at the end of my trip. I‚Äôd had a busy week so wanted peace, relaxation and a little luxury. I definitely got peace. My room was 519. At the top floor and to the rear of the hotel. It was very quiet at night. 
This was one of the oddest experiences I have had at a hotel. I certainly wouldn‚Äôt have believed it was five star. The room is small. Not only small but so badly laid out that it was actually annoying. The is no where to hang a towel in the bathroom. Not even a hand towel. There is no ventilation in the bathroom making it impossibly hot and unpleasant. The bed is placed so close to the wardrobe that you cannot open the doors comfortably making it impossible to use. There is a tea/coffee station and a mini bar that i defy anyone to use as it‚Äôs impossible to access. 
As i was staying three nights I did ask if a better room was available but was told only other equally small rooms were available. 
We had breakfast on 3 mornings. The food choice is good. The food is good. The service is not. Numerous staff passed us each morning ignoring us until they were ready to give us a table. Another couple waiting were equally shocked by this. Each morning something was missing. No tea spoon! I got the wrong breakfast meaning my husband was finished by the time my correct dish appeared. There are numerous staff but I think a lot may be new and not used to working together. 
The breakfast room is charming and the lobby has numerous areas to sit and relax which is lovely. 
I found it very strange that there regularly wasn‚Äôt a doorman. 
On checking out the receptionist told me they had been trying to contact me to offer an upgrade! I slept in the hotel every night. Was in my room by 10. I had breakfast every morning. I sat in the lobby numerous occasions. Laughable to say they couldn‚Äôt contact me. Would have been better to say nothing! 
Overall it was a pleasant stay. I know and love the area. But it most definitely is not five star standards.",3,2024,07,30
113,Great bar experience,"Thomas at the Bar was amazing, very knowledgeable.
He is one of most professional bar man I have ever met.he is not only knowledgeable, but passionate and with an incredible service spirit.
He made our night at the bar a most memorable one. 
I will be back for sure",5,2024,07,28
113,Business trip that remains so pleasant thanks to those at the Kensington,"And yet again another extremely pleasant stay in the Kensington! I have constantly come back to the Kensington, not that it is near to my work but the welcome, cosiness and relaxing nature of the hotel and neighbourhood is what drives me to return! Let us not forget the numerous friendly and helpful staff such as Marie-Sophie, Harvey, Anju and please I cannot forget the such polite and helpful Anna who is on the other end of the phone when calling the service for assistance! I am looking forward to my next visit in October. Thanks to all at the Kensington for making my stays so pleasant! See you soon!",5,2024,07,24
113,Wonderful stays at The Kensington!,"We recently had two wonderful stays at The Kensington! One was with a group of family and friends and the other was with our children. We were extremely warmly welcomed, and the rooms were already set up with the rollaway we had requested. Thomas and his team were so kind to us, even giving our daughters some toys to take with them for the next leg of our trip.

113,"Experience of a lifetime! The Kensington, London","The Kensington Hotel, London was wonderful! The staff was perfect! We had a great experience staying with them for eight days while we enjoyed Wimbledon! 

The concierges, Pavil and Arman were thorough and extremely helpful. I was emailed restaurant suggestions (50+) before our trip. I was able to look into their suggestions and make choices. They booked ALL of our reservations and they were great! They even figured out that we had a mistaken arrival date (due to an overnight flight) and corrected our driver pickup from Heathrow Airport! Awesome!

The gentlemen who greeted us, at every turn, George and Harvey, were stellar. I‚Äôm not sure of their titles, bellman, greeters, etc. but they were welcoming and kind! They addressed us by name every time we approached the lobby! Very helpful gentlemen and so very friendly! 

I greatly appreciate ALL of the personal attention we received from everyone at The Kensington Hotel London! We would choose to stay with them again in less than a minute! Top notch!",5,2024,07,21

113,"Great for Wimbledon, but bad room service","Very good hotel and great to stay and attend Wimbledon Championships.

113,You should stay here when going to London.,"From the moment of our arrival to stepping into the taxi, we couldn't have asked for more.

113,The BEST hotel experience in London,"My partner and I booked a two-night stay at The Kensington Hotel to conclude our anniversary trip in the United Kingdom. We saved the best for last, and this experience did not disappoint. The guest service was impeccable, with Michael, Emiliano, and Silviu warmly welcoming us each evening after our busy days of sightseeing. Upon check-in, Thomas even gave us a brief tour of the hotel and shared its fascinating history.

The rooms are spacious, clean, and beautifully decorated. When I mentioned our anniversary to Michael, he went above and beyond to create a special setting for us. Upon entering our room, we were delighted to find it adorned with rose petals on the bed, celebratory balloons, a decadent cake, and chilled champagne. It was a memorable highlight of our stay, made even more special by the incredible customer service.

The restaurant and lounge were exceptional as well, especially during the morning breakfast service. The restaurant accommodated our allergy requests and even crafted cocktails for us on our anniversary night. 

Our stay at The Kensington Hotel was one of the best hotel experiences we have ever had in London. We certainly plan to return!",5,2024,07,04

The standout of our visit was Adi, whose exceptional service made us feel special from the moment we arrived. Despite the bar being busy, Adi's attentiveness and warm demeanor made us feel like VIPs.

The bar‚Äôs elegant ambiance and extensive cocktail selection added to the experience. Each drink was crafted to perfection, matching the sophisticated setting.

Adi‚Äôs service and the overall atmosphere made our night unforgettable. We can‚Äôt wait to return and highly recommend it for a refined cocktail experience.",5,2024,07,04
113,The most extraordinary experience,"Having never been to London we weren‚Äôt sure where to stay. We booked two different hotels -the first being The Kensington. After our first night at The Kensington, we cancelled our reservation with the second hotel for the last leg of our visit to Europe because the service was so amazing. 

The experience is second to none. From the warm and inviting bar to the library breakfast rooms the environment makes you feel welcomed and appreciated.

Let me just say a few words about the staff - inviting, wonderful, sincere - I could go on and on. Mario‚Äôs greetings, knowledge, and authenticity made me feel right at home in a city I am unfamiliar with. George‚Äôs kindness, warm smile, and genuine caring made me feel like I was a long lost friend. Every single person I encountered was happy and personable. 

I highly recommend this hotel - 5 star x 10.",5,2024,07,04

113,Excellent first time stay at the Kensington.,"Shall definitely be returning to this property, I have stayed at many hotels in Kensington bit nothing comes close to this one.  Could not fault a thing about this place. Felt very relaxed there. ",5,2024,07,01
113,Fancy hotel but a couple of frustrating experiences,"I arrived around noon and check-in is 3pm. When I was leaving my baggage there, I was told that I would be texted when my room was ready but that the previous people had already left and that it wouldn't be much longer. I went and walked around for about an hour and came back to the lobby. I waited for 2 more hours in the lobby until 3pm and went up to the desk to get my key. The man at the counter seemed flustered when I told him I already had a reservation. The guy at the front door had to go up and explain to him that I had already been there and was just waiting for my key. I felt like I wasted a few hours when it was clear that my room indeed was ready and I wasn't ready. That day was also my birthday, and another guest was greeted by staff saying happy birthday. Of course, they didn't mention it to me. That's fine, but still made me feel like dirt. ",2,2024,06,29
113,Dinner at town house,"We had a beautiful evening at town house restaurant in kensington hotel, the scallops, arancini and the crab were amazing, all the staff were really nice but Binit made our night,it was a 10/10, we will definetly come back.

113,A Perfect Hotel for a London trip,"We were in London for a week to watch the Phillies, see friends and theater, and just enjoy the City. This was our first time staying at The Kensington. It was an excellent experience. Wonderful Service, a delicious breakfast, and an above average High Tea. 
Not an inexpensive experience, but well worth the cost if you get the right room. after not being satisfied with the room we were assigned, the staff was very good at finding us a room that was a little larger, had adequate closet and storage space, as well as a nice view of Queens Gate which is a very nice street and not noisy.
The Kensington is in a choice location with easy access to the East Kensington Tube Station and a very nice residential neighborhood. Could not have been happier with our choice.",5,2024,06,19

113,Outstanding Staff and memorable stay,"My husband and I stayed at the Kensington hotel on Saturday and Sunday night last. Went for the weekend to explore and navigate our way around the city.  I would highly recommend this hotel for its location, set on a beautiful street of old Georgian town houses and just around the corner are restaurants, cafes, and small supermarkets and the South Kensington tube is only a five minute walk from the hotel. The hotel itself is charming, old world style, very relaxing to come back to in the evening. Breakfast was excellent with full service which we loved. No messing with self service here thankfully. Very good choice on the menu.  Staff were fantastic.The beds,and pillows are extremely comfortable. The rooms are smallish as it is a old townhouse but everything was provided in our room that we required.

We loved it here - this is now our London hotel of choice!",5,2024,05,28
113,Disappointing experience,"The positives are the staff who are polite and helpful. We stayed in a deluxe room with king bed, which is advertised on the hotel website as having a marble bathroom as a highlight. This is completely misleading as it had a tiny shower room, which although had marble walls, was tired with nowhere to hang wet towels. The breakfast experience over a number of days wasn‚Äôt great. The cooked order being served at the same time as the cereal/fresh fruit, having to repeatedly ask for a second cup of coffee ( provide a pot ) and every day having to ask for a side plate/knife even though they knew we had ordered toast of pastries. Given the cost of the room and breakfast this definitely wasn‚Äôt a five star experience.",3,2024,05,28

The hotel itself was also beautiful. I would definitely stay here again next time I‚Äôm in London. I can‚Äôt think of one negative thing to say. Absolutely 10/10.",5,2024,05,25

113,Look no further,"The moment we pulled up to the hotel, we knew it was going to be a great place to stay. From check-in to experiencing our first afternoon tea, was a delight and all employees were so nice and accommodating. A special thanks to Harvey who practically took care of our transportation needs while we were staying at The Kensington. There were a couple of times we were running late and he ensured that we would be okay and went beyond the call of duty to flag uber drivers or the black cab. Talking to him was like talking to a close friend! We'll never forget him! Thank you Harvey for your hospitality and to everyone who made our short stay a memorable one. We are definitely coming back to this wonderful city and hotel. You all were so great!",5,2024,05,17

113,Family trip with 8 month old,"Upon arrival to the Kensington hotel, we were warmly greeted by Harvey, one of the many kind concierge. Harvey quickly helped us with our luggage and got us settled into our room. He shared that he had an infant at home and understood our immediate needs. He was also very helpful in providing places to go with our baby (from parks to restaurants). He proactively offered to schedule tea time for us, steam our clothes, and shine my husband‚Äôs shoes.  Needless to say, we enjoyed all his recommendations! 

The remainder of the staff were all friendly and greeted us every time we came and went from the hotel. The food and drinks at the Townhouse restaurant were also stellar.  We like the tea time at the hotel more than the one at the Kensington palace. Special shout out to the restaurant hostess whose name we can‚Äôt remember but she loved on our baby very much and accommodated our dinner reservations.  Benit kindly served us during dinner. 

We booked the luxury suite which was newly renovated and beautifully decorated. Our room was very clean and the baby cot was delightful.

The best part of our stay was meeting the concierge, George Boyan. He made the trip so much more memorable every time we'd walk in and out of the hotel. He went above and beyond our entire trip! He gave us so many recommendations in London, provided locations for when I come back with my fiance in September for wedding photos, and had a cab ready for our early morning flight. Thank you Kensington and George for an amazing stay!!",5,2024,05,10

113,Something Special Happening Here,"Came rather late for check-in, however was greeted warmly and supported to park the car.

After a little confusion, was placed in a lovely suite. 

There are always a few items in any hotel that can be improved, especially decor or faulty kit, but getting the service right can be some of the most challenging aspects, in my experience.

The service here is incredibly person-centred, from reception, concierge or management. Nothing was too much trouble and staff seemed genuinely interested in how the stay went and motivated to assist.  I was pleasantly surprised by how well the team worked for each other and covered any shortcomings.  

Whatever improvements management wish to make, please do not change the team, it is special.",5,2024,04,28

I would recommend The Kensington to anyone wanting a comfortable & luxurious stay in the heart of South Kensington.",5,2024,04,15
113,Perfect stay,"Everything was perfect from start to finish, the staff are so friendly and go above and beyond to make your stay perfect.

113,Amazing !!!!,"My stay at The Kensington has been exquisite, from the friendly welcome on arrival, to the well appointed room and the wonderfully decorated common areas, everything has been high class. Special mentions go to Dan in the restaurant who made sure that our breakfasts are a 5 star experience and to Adrian who emerged us in the intricat stories behind the newly crafted Reflections menu and made us feel at home in the K Bar. A wonderful experience all together!",5,2024,04,13
113,Best night ever thanks you!!!,"Met George George of the dough is one of the best and he was very hospitable, when we came to visit the hotel, he welcomed us with a smile.

Thank you  and he is an asset to your company. Thank you Georgeüíó",5,2024,04,12
113,Excellent,"Amazing, I cannot rate this hotel enough. We received such a wonderful welcome from the reception, Gabi, so informative.

113,Above and Beyond!,"I recently stayed at The Kensington with my daughter. From the moment I checked in, they went above and beyond to ensure that my stay was comfortable and enjoyable.

He is a true asset to your team and made my experience memorable. Five stars all around!",5,2024,04,03
113,Return visit to this fabulous boutique hotel,"This was our second time staying at this gorgeous hotel. A special night away for my husband and myself. 
Greeted warmly at reception and given lovely hot towels while checking in. The signature Doyle fragrance welcomes you and I only wish my house smelt this good. Must purchase some of their candles  to recreate the vibe. Our room wasn't quite ready so we left our luggage and wondered up to Harrods and did some browsing. When we returned a few hours later our luggage was in our room with a lovely card and bottle of Prosecco- we were celebrating a special occasion üçæ .
The room was beautiful  bright and luxurious . The bed so comfortable, we had a great nights sleep. 
Dinner was delicious and had the best cocktails üç∏ in the K Bar.
Breakfast was relaxed and we did not feel rushed and enjoyed fresh Granola,coffee and cooked breakfast.
Special mention to 
Anita, Michael, Pavel
And the K Bar team
Khrish & Aiden.
Already looking  forward to our next visit.
",5,2024,04,01
113,Fantastic stay at a luxury hotel,"Simply buzzing from this weekend and felt very compelled to thank the team at The Kensington. 

We stayed this weekend for my wife‚Äôs special Birthday and were made to feel extremely special from the minute we arrived. We were greeted by Harvey who insisted on carrying our bags into reception and ushered us to the front desk where we were met by Gabi who made the checkin process super smooth and confirmed our hotel dinner reservation. 

We were then met by Thomas who presented flowers to my wife that had been arranged and proceeded to take us on a tour of this lovely hotel. My wife studied history at uni so what followed was totally unexpected for a hotel. Thomas gave us a 15 minute tour of the history of the building, how the areas had evolved and how the Earls and Countesses would have used the rooms when this was all originally 4 large homes. From the stone staircase with the original family mirror, to the century old Post Office doors shipped in from Dublin to the elephant ornaments, everything had a wonderful story behind it. 

We were then shown to our room, cases already delivered and were delighted with all the extras you get. 

We went for a long stroll around town, including Harrods and when we returned were greeted with Prosecco and Birthday cake in the room. 

Dinner in the hotel restaurant was also lovely. Guinness bread (one of the reasons we booked), the leanest fillet steak I‚Äôve had in a long time and lovely black cod were all highlights. 

We went out for another after dinner walk in this lovely area and came back just in time for last drinks at the K Bar. I won‚Äôt spoil it for you but they have a cocktail menu that you won‚Äôt have seen anywhere else and Khrish took great care to make sure our cocktail choices were carefully considered. Delicious!!

Breakfast in the morning was outstanding, smoked salmon, poached eggs and avocado. 

Everything went like clockwork and the whole experience can only be described as magical in a traditional English setting.",5,2024,04,01
113,We look forward to retruning to the Kensington,"My family and I recently stayed in the Kensington Hotel on a weekend trip to London. This was our second family trip to this hotel having stayed here in November 2023. We returned to the Kensington because of the wonderful experience we had the first time. And again this trip did not disappoint. The return welcome was lovely and warm, our 3 kids felt at home immediately! As did we. We ate in the hotel bar restaurant when we arrived and the staff here were fab, nothing was an issue and the food was excellent. 
The guest relations team joined us briefly here to give the children some thoughtful welcome gifts (lovely touch) then left us to enjoy a relaxed and chilled-out lunch. 

Our connecting rooms were ideal and spacious. Some delicious fruit and goodies were waiting for us here. Spotless room, comfortable beds and good lighting. Noise levels were good too (did not hear street noises nor did we hear noise from corridors etc). It was the perfect stay for our weekend. 

We will be back as a family, whenever that will be. The Kensington will be top of mind when we next visit London. Thank you to all.",5,2024,04,01
113,I will never stay in another London hotel again,"I was recommended this hotel by someone who frequently stays in 5star London hotels..she said ‚Äòthe Kensington will definitely look after you‚Äô..and they certainly did!
A special mention to Daniela and Enrico at breakfast who made my daughter‚Äôs stay unforgettable and to Harvey who even gave me his coat each night so I wouldn‚Äôt get cold..he even delivered it to our room!
The location, food, cleanliness and decor is all 10/10 but it is the service and personality of the every single member of staff which has guaranteed by loyalty to this amazing hotel!",5,2024,03,31
113,Terrible rooms,"The Kensington would be fine for lunch or a drink but the guest rooms are the worst I've seen in London - so small you can barely move around the bed or bathroom, with mattresses & sound insulation so poor you will barely sleep a wink.

The 100 Queen's Gate Hotel across the road offers much better value, or for proper luxury the nearby Baglioni is exceptional.",1,2024,03,30
113,Exceptional,"I recently stayed at The Kensington Hotel with my daughter for a weekend trip, and everything exceeded our expectations, including the service which was exceptional. I couldn‚Äôt recommend it highly enough. 
I would like to particularly thank and praise Harvey for his assistance. I will definitely be returning to The Kensington in the future.",5,2024,03,29
113,Truly amazing stay,"We have stayed in many hotels in London but this is now our favourite. The location, the staff, the decor, the whole ambience, the K bar and the breakfast in the restaurant were all 10/10. We were made to feel very special and everyone was so welcoming. Always smiling. 
We cannot fault our stay at The Kensington and we are already looking to book again. 
Thank you! ",5,2024,03,25
113,Such a perfect stay at The Kensington!,"Such a wonderful stay at The Kensington! 

My husband and I chose this perfect hotel for our first visit to London from the states. Everything was just perfect! From the warm welcome when we first arrived, and each day/evening we returned, we were greeted warmly by the staff. They always remembered where we went each day(the concierge was always helpful when we needed directions and guidance around London and our day trip to Windsor) and followed up asking how we enjoyed our day. 
The hotel is in the perfect location. Close to the tube, always able to get a taxi, but just enough away from too much noise, and in such a nice neighborhood. 
The Kensington is just how you would envision a stay in London.  A classy place with attention to detail and wonderful service. 
The rooms and hotel are clean, comfortable and the staff will help you feel as if you stepped back in time when service was important!  
The breakfast was suburb and dinner was also very good. 
We would go back and stay again and really miss being there. The Kensington made our stay in London exceptional!!",5,2024,03,25
113,Fantastic breakfast experience thanks IKRAM,"We have spent some magnificent days at the Kensington hotel. Beautiful, it is like returning to golden times and the attention of the staff is super, especially Miss IKRAM, an example of professionalism, friendliness, education and efficiency. Always smiling, fast and making us feel at home.
Thank you very much IKRAM for your attention, you have convinced us to return to this hotel.",5,2024,03,24
113,Fabulous Hotel that I Can‚Äôt Wait to Return to,"This is the loveliest hotel my husband and I have ever stayed in and we have stayed in Ritz Carlton hotels, the Bellagio, etc.  Firstly, the hotel is beautifully appointed and very relaxing.  The staff are also very welcoming and helpful.  Mario, Kumar and Bryan R were standouts, among many other outstanding employees.   Our room was lovely and Housekeeping made sure it was perfect at all times.  The breakfast was an additional special treat.  The meals were superb and the fruit was always very fresh.  Don‚Äôt get me started on the coffee!  What more can I say, other than when may I come back??",5,2024,03,22
113,Our Home Away From Home!!,"Our second wonderfully perfect visit to The Kensington is about to come to an end.  
We were fortunate to have chosen this hotel last autumn as our base for almost a week's long visit to London.  Everything about our stay was exquisite and our return, a mere 5 months later was a foregone conclusion.
The Kensington will now be our 'home away from home' as we base ourselves here for visits to our family who now live in London.  There is nothing to say about our experience here except to rave about the accommodations, the food, the sitting rooms, and of course, the service.
The rooms are beautiful and clearly maintained to the highest degree; the many meals that we had in the beautiful dining room were terrific, and the stunning sitting rooms allowed us to relax and enjoy the hotel in a different setting than our glorious room.
But perhaps it is the ladies and gentlemen who work at The Kensington that truly sets it apart.  Every single one of them clearly goes out of their way to assist in every way possible.  And every one of them does it not only with a smile, but with a sincere attitude that it is their pleasure to help.  They all make us feel as though we are treasured guests which is a very rare travel experience indeed.  
Of course we have already booked our next visit in a few months and look forward to returning again and again.",5,2024,03,17
113,Great hotel & Staff,"Great hotel !
I will surely choose it again next time.
Location and service were great.
Especially Gurcan was very helpful from the beginning of my stay until my check out day.
He assisted me in every situation with a great attitude and patience.
He was very kind , friendly and helpful. 
I feel very appreciated because of him,
Thank you Gurcan once again. 
Also the room which I stayed in was very nice and comfy. 
I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2024,03,17
113,Outstanding Customer Experience,"While the rooms were lovely and clean, the most outstanding feature was the customer experience. The staff were all very friendly and professional. They were focused on creating a relaxing, fun holiday for us by providing whatever assistance was needed. It was a pleasant surprise to be greeted by name!",5,2024,03,16
113,Outstanding visit. We will definitely recommend the hotel to our friends and family.,The visit was spectacular! The service was impeccable. The staff was so friendly and accommodating. Emiliano was very helpful and friendly. He and the entire concierge staff were always available for questions and  directions. The wait staff was efficient and friendly. The facility was beautiful. The room was always clean and anything we needed was immediately provided for us. There is not a single thing I could say to improve because my wife and I were so blown away by our whole experience.,5,2024,03,15
113,A home from home,"We have been staying at The Kensington with our young daughter for almost 3 years now. The experience of being a guest here is without a doubt among the most enjoyable times I have had in London. I would like to personally mention, and thank Thomas and his team; Boyan, Anita, Sofia, Nnamdi, for making every stay unforgettable. Our young daughter is obsessed with‚ÄúFrozen‚Äú and not only had they arranged a number of toys and activity books to greet us on arrival in our room but Sofia and Nnamdi were dressed up as the two main characters to greet us on arrival. Our daughter was speechless, as were we. The attention to detail and guest services is like nothing I have ever known and we truly feel part of the family. I hosted my Baby Shower there last weekend and the team including Katherine ensured it went seamlessly and the service headed by Lauren was faultless. All the incredible things they have organised for us as a family in the last 3 years have been so thoughtful and creating these memories for us and particularly our daughter will forever be enormously appreciated. Thank you everyone for all your care and attention. See you soon with baby number 2 in tow! S, E and I :)",5,2024,03,10
113,Amazing stay,"Exceptional service throughout from door staff to reception and service as well as stunning rooms and great location - definitely looking forward to getting back
Again soon as it is a real treat to stay there and walk to Knightsbridge and Chelsea",5,2024,03,07
113,A blissful and warm embrace!,"As you approach this beautiful, historic, charming hotel you're instantly transported into a blissful and warm embrace. I've stayed here a few times, either visiting someone who lives in the neighborhood or with family. You can see the beautiful and inviting decor in all of the versatile sitting areas on the first floor, be swept away with mouth watering food, and sleep on a cloud. This is by far one of my favorite hotels to visit and to escape! The staff feel like family. They are truly dedicated, warm, and passionate about their service.  My entire family group shared many great moments with so many of the great staff - Chadan shared a special Indian dish that she made with my family; we all laughed with Harvey and George; when our exit was derailed and we had to extend our stay, Thomas welcomed us back. Also, the entire front desk welcomed our return and made sure we were comfortable. I am returning this month with another family member and can't wait to be there.",5,2024,03,06
113,Mother/Daughter Getaway,"I cannot say enough positive things about our stay at The Kensington! My daughter and I had a mother/daughter getaway to London and I am so happy that I chose this as our hotel. All of the staff were very welcoming, friendly and accommodating all throughout our stay. I apologize that I do not recall all of their names but each and every one of them were excellent at what they did. 
The hotel is beautiful, the rooms exquisite, and the food exceptional.  The location is perfect for walking around to visit some of the sights. 
We enjoyed several drinks in the K Bar and Stefano was very kind and patient in explaining the special cocktails and the long process involved with coming up with the different mixes. It was quite interesting. 
Thank you for a truly memorable stay.  I‚Äôm looking forward to being able to come back again, hopefully soon!",5,2024,03,06
113,Excellent Celebratory Dinner,"Went for dinner with 3 schoolfriends to celebrate our 60th‚Äôs. Excellent menu, difficult to choose from, it all sounded so tempting. Our waiter, Binit, was very thoughtful & helpful, giving good suggestions. We shared a couple of starters & then the blackened cod which was delicious‚Ä¶plus a few desserts. A memorable evening.",5,2024,03,04
113,Theatre trip overnight stay in London,"Our first experience of staying at one of the Doyle group‚Äôs hotels. It did not disappoint.  It‚Äôs expensive that has too be mentioned but luxurious and exceeds your expectations on many fronts. 
Staff were in plentiful supply and very attentive.  The decor of hotel and rooms were amazing and the bar and lounge areas are positioned so well you just don‚Äôt want to leave.  
I have to say it seems so rare these days to experience a service or brand that actually exceeds customer expectations post COVID but the Doyle chain does exactly that and for that I applaud them. 
Please if visiting London and your budget allows try this amazing hotel. 
We can wait to try another in their collection or even return to the same hotel and room. üôèüëå",5,2024,03,03
113,Dinner and Cocktails,"The Kensington is a comfortable and delightfully welcoming hotel that is located a stone‚Äôs throw from the Royal Albert Hall, the Victoria and Albert Museum and Hyde Park.  A friend and I had dinner recently in its intimate restaurant ‚ÄòTown House‚Äô.  (It has only around ten tables.)  Prices there are a tad on the high side, and the dim lighting makes reading the menu difficult.  But the food and the service are very good indeed.  My lentil soup, grilled salmon fillet and cr√®me br√ªl√©e were delicious. So, too, was the bottle of Italian red wine we chose, the cherry-based ‚ÄòRiserva Armigero‚Äô.  After the meal, we repaired to the hotel bar.  Known as ‚ÄòK Bar‚Äô, it is also intimate and, at night anyway, darkly lit. Its speciality  is a range of cocktails.  The service there is very cordial and efficient.  Our waiter, a young Hungarian guy called Laszlo, was enthusiastic, knowledgeable and very friendly.  He explained the cocktail menu to my friend and me patiently and in detail and helped us with our two choices each.  I started with a ‚ÄòPangea‚Äô, a rum, banana and coconut-based drink.  After that I opted for a ‚ÄòMe, Myself and I‚Äô, a slightly less sweet and more fragrant cocktail whose principal ingredients are bourbon and absinthe.  Both drinks were first rate. Prices for most of the sixteen cocktails on the menu are in the ¬£20-25 range (the norm these days for drinks of that sort in swish hotel bars like this one in central London), though one, a Johnnie Walker-based drink, was actually ¬£42! 

The whole experience was very pleasant and congenial and I shall certainly pop into the hotel again when I am in the area.",4,2024,03,02
113,Family Trip to Hotel,Stayed at this hotel recently and was absolutely thrilled with my experience. Food was amazing and wanted to say thank you to Binit & Joyce (not sure if i‚Äôve spelled those right) they were so attentive & made me feel so welcome. Someone give them a raise!,5,2024,03,02

113,Great meeting place for drinks,"Lovely bar area to relax in.  Very attentive service.  Good quality food at reasonable prices.  Highly recommend it as a great meeting place for after work drinks or brunch at weekends.  When asked to recommend a wine, the waiter suggested   house wine  which was delicious.  No up selling which was refreshing.  Thank you Lasslo!",5,2024,02,29
113,My loveley stay!,"I loved this hotel! Highly recomended! It was a home a way from home for 2 weeks. Staff was very attentive, the breakfast was exceptional and environment is very chic and cozy at the same time. Location is superb ",5,2024,02,28

113,The best concierge,"I would like to thank Gurcan for his openness to the clients and desire to solve anything so you will enjoy and won't think about anything during your stay! Forget cable? No problem! Rainy? Here is the umbrella! Order the taxi? Or recommend the fastest way? Always there! Thank you Gurcan for your admiration and for your desire to make your job perfect! It was a pleasure! 
Olga",5,2024,02,25

113,An extra special London hotel.,"The Kensington has a real guest focussed culture. Every staff member has a genuine and helpful approach to interacting with guests. It makes a stay at The Kensington feel so extra special. Huge thank you to Emiliano, the Concierge who helped us to get tickets for The Chanel exhibition at the V and A. We loved the exhibition. 
Public spaces at the hotel are relaxing luxurious spaces that are wonderful for chilling out in.",5,2024,02,25

The drinks were splendid and the atmosphere amazing . The combination of low lights and soft beat music gave the room exactly what everyone seeks in a bar .",5,2024,02,22
113,Lovely evening prior to Christmas,"Dined in the hotel lobby as restaurant was full. Food was good but the seating was a bit low for the tables. Beauifully decorated and nice ambience, fires were lit and tree was up. Pleasant staff. Have had drinks here many times but first time to dine, would prefer to be inrestaurant next time.",4,2024,02,20

113,Sleep is key,"I would to say that my review is based on the room & quality of sleep not the service.

Always best to start positive & the staff at the Kensington are wonderful, everyone is upbeat and so helpful, the house keeping are great.

The hotel decor is classic and luxurious. The stair case is beautiful so if you can use it.

Sadly ‚Ä¶ the rooms are not very good. The beds alone are only a double so very very small, the mattress was rock hard are hips where aching all night from tossing and turning and the crunchy thin feather pillows are useless and uncomfortable. 

At one point i considered just leaving in the night and driving back home so i could sleep. 

You couldn‚Äôt relax and drift off like you should sleeping in a 5 star hotel, this hotel is 4 star but the rooms are a 3. 

I will say the dressing gowns are very soft and comfortable.

We left feeling absolutely exhausted which was not the plan. 

Disappointing to have our night away spoiled,",2,2024,02,07
113,Great service but poor rooms,"Let me start by saying the staff are very good at this hotel and do go out of their was to help you , the bar is also excellent and the downstairs is very nice . The problem lays in the rooms which ultimately is what you‚Äôre paying for .. on arrival we were given the key and opened the door to a very small drab room which stank of solvent .   Small details like the sockets have been painted over , the back of the bed has paint all over it , old carpet and most importantly a tiny bed which is extremely hard with pillows like sandbags .  We left very disappointed and feeling like we wasted money .",2,2024,02,07
113,A must visit,"We have just stayed here and found the hotel to be good throughout.
It‚Äôs nicely decorated, well equipped and the staff were very attentive.
The front desk manager went out of her way to make sure we enjoyed our staff.
Lastly I found the doorman very welcoming and certainly adds to the visit!
Will definitely return.",5,2024,02,04
113,Every comfort in quiet luxury,"My daughter and I had a very comfortable stay. Everything was thought off. From our initial telephone call to make our reservation we were treated with courtesy and consideration by Ali.  He welcomed us on arrival and showed us kind attention throughout our stay.
The rooms are very well appointed and the food was fresh and delicious, but it was the staff that made the Kensington special for us.",5,2024,02,01
113,Family trip,"Central and quiet area. Location close to tube stations Gloucester Road and South Kensington. Lovely entrance and nice decor throughout the hotel.  Even though the room and bathroom was small we enjoyed our stay. Nice toiletries too. 

The staff at reception, concierge, porters and restaurant staff all were friendly and accommodating. The bar looks impressive and had breakfast each morning at the hotel.  Also had 80 Days Around the World themed afternoon tea.",5,2024,01,29
113,Christmas at The Kensington,"From start to finish we had a great trip. This is a stylish boutique hotel that was beautifully decorated for Christmas. The purpose of my visit to London was for Christmas shopping so this was the icing on the cake. Really put us in the mood. The atmosphere and ambiance was very special. Service was excellent from the moment we arrived. A genuinely warm welcome and nothing was too much trouble. Our bedroom was beautifully appointed, had a stunning en suite bathroom, free standing bath with the added treat of a TV!  I also witnessed great engagement between a hotel guest  and staff members She told us this is her ‚Äòhome from home‚Äô when she visits London and the only place she‚Äôll stay! I can see why!  Highly recommend!",5,2024,01,24

113,Lovely Lunch,"A friend and I had lunch today at The Town House, in the Kensington.  We had just come from seeing the exceptional Chanel exhibition at the V&A and were equally looking forward to our visit at Town House.  

Service as always was impeccable.  The set lunch service was seamless and we would like to highlight Daniela who was a delight, providing a caring but unobtrusive service.  

The Kensington went the extra mile to ensure that our experience was the best it could be and I really appreciated the special touch recognising my birthday and realise that I sadly left my signed birthday card in the table!  So sorry, this was me being completely forgetful!

Thank you!
We will be back for sure.",5,2024,01,20
113,Convenient and comfortable hotel,"Stayed at the Kensington during a long weekend in London, and it was a lovely stay. The common areas are cute and full of character. The daily breakfast was a great start to the day ‚Äî very friendly and accommodating service. The fruit was fresh, the French toast had good texture, and the yogurt and granola was also good. The front desk/concierge are also friendly and provide great service. The rooms are what I would call ‚Äútiny but mighty.‚Äù I stayed in a room with a queen bed, and it was small but used the space very efficiently. The room was overall comfortable, but the bed sloped a bit in the middle. Other than that, highly recommend the hotel.",4,2024,01,15
113,Great stay again at The Kensington,Great beds for sleeping and the service is impeccable .  Especially shout out to Harvey & Gurjek (I think his name) but all the staff are lovely and helpful.   We stay here for business & with family .,5,2024,01,15
113,Outstanding,"I have stayed at The Kensington before but like to check the alternative hotels to compare offers before booking.  The Kensington always wins!  The cost of their rooms are pretty consistent to the local competition but the staff & service far exceed the others.  The atmosphere is calm & confident, nothing is too much trouble. I highly recommend staying at The Kensington.",5,2024,01,15

113,Special Birthday Weekend,"Fabulous birthday weekend with friends at The Kensington Hotel.  A delightful, elegant hotel in South Kensington, just 5 mins from the tube station.  

From the minute we arrived every member of the Kensington team made us feel extremely welcome and went all out to make my birthday celebrations very special indeed.  Every aspect of the hotel gets a 5-star rating from me ‚Äì from the stylish and comfortable bedrooms, beautiful lounge and dining areas, decadent cocktail bar to the extremely friendly and professional staff.  Special thanks to Tom in Guest Relations, who is most definitely the beating heart of The Kensington.  

We couldn‚Äôt have asked for a more welcoming and comfortable stay and I would definitely recommend The Kensington ‚Äì you won‚Äôt be disappointed.  Thank you.",5,2024,01,10
113,Stay at The Kensington,"Best service I've ever experienced at a hotel. Everyone we encountered addressed us by name, and they were so thoughtful, kind and happy. The Bar K is a fantastic spot to have cocktails. We will 100% return!",5,2024,01,05
113,Wonderful Stay in South Kensington!,"This hotel made our London trip so much better! The staff was courteous and attentive, the hotel was beautifully decorated (for the holidays and in general) and the rooms were lovely. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was spacious and spotless. The housekeeping was always on top of it, and they even left treats for us for NYE. All in all, it was an absolutely wonderful stay and holds up to its high rating.",5,2024,01,05
113,Perfection at this Hotel !,"Back to this wonderful hotel it‚Äôs our favourite in Kensington it‚Äôs our 5th time back here, it‚Äôs spotless rooms are lovely and Thomas the Manager always greets us just so lovely and perfect here we stay a few days before we fly off from Gatwick.",5,2024,01,05
113,Exceptional customer service,Stayed here last week as part of surprise birthday trip to London organised by my wife and she could not have picked a better hotel. Great in terms of style and comfort and a walk to the tube. The bar is a must for an evening drink but the real stars of the show were the staff. From start to finish Tom and team could not have been more friendly and attentive. Everyone was genuinely interested in their customers and making their stay better. A couple of extra birthday treats were most appreciated. Can‚Äôt imagine staying anywhere else on future London visits.,5,2024,01,04
113,Amazing stay,"We spent a family weekend in London for NYE at The Kensington.  I can't say enough good things about our stay.  Our three children are already asking to go back!  Breakfast was delicious, the service is impeccable and staff are professional and kind.  The rooms are very well appointed and very comfortable.  Our kids loved the daily treats and presents left for them including hand-written notes!  Location is away from crowds but within walking distance to museums and transportation.  We were happy to come back there every night!",5,2024,01,03
113,Fabulous hotel- Great for families ,"Our family just spent a week in London at the Kensington Hotel. This hotel is excellent! The children ranged from 9-14 and everyone really enjoyed the lovely very English ambiance of the hotel. The location is great. Easy walking distance to the Victoria & Albert, Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. The Underground is a couple of blocks away and we used it to travel to the major sites-- very easy to navigate. There are plenty of family friendly restaurants in the neighborhood for dinner. We had the breakfast included package which I highly recommend. 
The staff was extremely helpful. 
",5,2024,01,01
113,Amazing experience!,"My daughter and I stayed at the Kensington over Christmas. Simply put, it was one of the best hotel experiences ever. The staff were hospitable and the breakfast amazing.  There were many charming and special added touches.  Can‚Äôt wait to return!",5,2023,12,31
113,Such a wonderful Christmas stay! ,"I stayed for the 2nd time at the Kensington and what an amazing experience!! We were there with my son and my father for Christmas, so warm, so full of attention from all the staff who is soooo nice‚Ä¶ Special mention to Santa Claus aka Guzlan, and also George who‚Äôve taken such great care of us. Will definitely be back soon! ",5,2023,12,27
113,10/10 Christmas stay,"The Kensington made us feel like royalty from start to finish. We were there for two nights during Christmas and the staff at The Kensington made us feel right at home. They were able to upgrade our room which was a surprise and when we casually mentioned we were on a belated honeymoon they brought up a bottle of complimentary champagne for us. Everyone we interacted with was personable and went out of their way to help us (Harvey and others). We found the area to be very convenient, quiet, and accessible by foot to great restaurants, the Natural History Museum, and Hyde Park. Thank you for making our Christmas stay so magical!",5,2023,12,27
113,Luxurious and cozy,"From the gorgeous Christmas decor throughout to the personal attention, this was a lovely small hotel that made it feel like home away from home for 5 nights. Note that the base-level rooms are teensy (not uncommon for London or NY but really only liveable for one person); only one sitting chair and no bureaus for putting away folded clothes. I suppose that‚Äôs why many guests spend their reading time etc down in the (lovely) common rooms. ",5,2023,12,24
113,Personalized visit ,"This is hotel you need to stay in if you want the personal touch. We've stayed in many posh hotels, but very few make you feel at home we attributed to the amazing staff. They are who give The Kensington its personality, from the door stars to house keeping. They are a fantastic group of people who really care. ",5,2023,12,22
113,Above and Beyond: A Stellar Stay with Michael's Exceptional Service!,"Exceptional Stay with Outstanding Service from Michael! Our experience at the hotel was truly remarkable, thanks to Michael's exceptionally friendly service. He went above and beyond to ensure our stay was memorable. The positive impression and warm vibes from the hotel left us thoroughly impressed. Highly commendable!",5,2023,12,19
113,Highly recommend ,Really nice hotel with good location! I am so impressed by the service from Michael Zhang! Leading us to the room and detail explained everything! The whole atmosphere is so nice and chill place in south Kensington! Highly recommend family vocation ,5,2023,12,19
113,Perfection,"From the moment I stepped out of the taxi I was exceptionally well looked after and made to feel at home. Every single member of staff I met was welcoming, friendly and highly professional. 

A really comfortable room, as a GHA Titanium member I benefit from a double room upgrade, which is always welcome, as was the plate of macarons which were delivered to my room affter check-in - just delightful! I ate in the restaurant that evening and enjoyed three courses of really well prepared, delicious food. The stadout was the duck, which was so tasty and enjoyable. 

Breakfast was a delight, cooked to order from a fine menu, I was also really happy to note that their breakfast marmalade is supplied by my favourite producer, ‚ÄòNaked Jam‚Äô - just set my day off perfectly! 

Highly recommend and will stay again next time I‚Äôm in London.",5,2023,12,16
113,"Fabulous weekend break at the Kensington Hotel, London","Fabulous experience at the Kensington for a weekend to celebrate a friends birthday. Five star treatment from all of the staff who went out of their way to make sure everything was perfect for us. The hotel is perfectly situated in a quiet location but a short walk to the tube and there are plenty of nearby restaurants and bars, although none were better than the restaurant and bar in the hotel. Also close to the Natural History museum and V&A museum and easy enough to get the tube to the west end and on to the theatres. Would definitely recommend for a stay in London and special thanks to Tom in guest relations who made us feel very welcome and special guests.",5,2023,12,14
113,Fabulous for Weekend with Friends ,"The Kensington did not disappoint. We were made very welcome by Thomas and his team on arrival who were all very personable. Both the public areas and bedrooms are extremely comfortable, stylish and clean. The breakfast and cocktails were excellent. I honestly don't think I have stayed in a better London hotel. Thanks to all who made our overnight stay so enjoyable.",5,2023,12,13
113,Lovely neighborhood and charming hotel,"The hotel is very well located with many options to eat nearby and the tips from the concierge were accurate and nice! 
The classical room is not that big for a couple, but enough to enjoy London as it should be.
The only point is that the shower could have a little bit more pressure.",5,2023,12,13
113,Wonderful Stay ,"Just back from The Kensington after  a 2 night stay and it was simply wonderful. The hotel is beautifully decorated for Christmas and is very stylish. Our room was perfect for our needs and spotless. The staff are excellent and are extremely friendly and the overall atmosphere is warm and very welcoming. The breakfast is beautifully presented and the we ate twice in the Hotel; it was so good that we returned for lunch on the day of our departure.  All the staff made a huge effort especially Thomas and the wonderful French gentleman at the  door. We are already planning our next trip back with family to celebrate my sister's 60th next December. This is going to be our hotel of choice for our annual trip to London for Christmas.
Anne and Peter,Ireland.",5,2023,12,12
113,Generally a quality experience and hotel,"This was our 2nd stay at the Kensington. Generally an excellent visit, particularly great service from Harvey, Silviu & Thomas. We were staying in a queen style room that could do with freshening up (paint and carpets looking a bit tired). We do plan to book again for Dec 24. ",4,2023,12,12
113,"Nice hotel, appalling room","The hotel and staff were great. The room was dingy, sparsely decorated, the shower didn't work and more in keeping with a 3 star establishment, notwithstanding having spent almost ¬£600 per night. I will not be staying again. Really bad value for money. ",2,2023,12,11
113,Nice Christmas Stay at Kensington,"Nice and cosy place. Good location. Beaitiful Christmas decorations. Quiet and safe area.
Very good menus, for breakfast,  dinner and tea time.
Service average.
Very comfortable room, space, Very clean. Nice bathroom.

113,Best afternoon tea in London! ,"We had an amazing time thanks to Thomas that has first welcomed us and the whole team who is very accessible, taking care of yo during your tume at the Kensington Hotel! Afternoon tea was delicious, a very special moment in a very beautiful salon! It was my friend birthday and all the thoughtful attentions were so kind! We‚Äôll keep a beautiful souvenir of this moment! ",5,2023,12,10
113,Dream come true ,"Dream come true is absolutely the right title to give for this amazing Hotel, since when we arrived we had a really warm welcome from the lovely Michal at the Reception witch gives us all the important information about all the services and also showed us the way to the lift. Even upon check out was super professional and called us to the room and asked if we needed help with luggage. This place is for sure 10 out of 10 all the staff are e meet was super professional and friendly from the porter at the door to the reception to the restaurant to the welcomer and the housekeeping. Wish to be back soon :) ",5,2023,12,10
113,Near perfect but....,"Lovely hotel on arrival, really well designed and decorated. Staff were particularly friendly at the door and at reception. Rooms not particularly spacious, but okay, and very well presented. Some nice little touches including macaroons and chocolates left for us. More nice touches later on including that somebody attended our room in the evening when we were out, tidied up and put slippers by the bed etc! We didn‚Äôt have dinner there but had breakfast. It‚Äôs not buffet-style, which is really unfortunate. They say they don‚Äôt have room but i can‚Äôt believe this.
There were a few mistakes with breakfast on day 1, despite the staff‚Äôs apparent best efforts and friendliness. Breakfast in particular was cold. On day 2 I specifically asked for my breakfast to come on a hot plate, to which the waiter said ‚Äòyes no problem‚Äô, but the plate came stone cold, how hard can it be‚Ä¶
Another complaint, there is a small green light above the door, which upon Googling i find to indicate the exit in the event of a fire. But in the night this tiny green light did light up the whole room, and i couldn‚Äôt sleep, it was horrible not to be able to relax in the night whilst on holiday. I didn‚Äôt ask them if they could turn it off, i‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd have said no for health and safety reasons. 
I'd also add that they had Peroni in the mini-bar in the room, but only served some random lager in the bar that wasn't very nice. Would be good to have Peroni in the bar.

Nice place, but please bring the breakfast buffet back - they admit they used to do this. Serve the breakfast on hot plates.  And get rid of those green lights.

113,"An excellent stay, will definitely return","Stayed at The Kensington during a weekend visit to London. The Kensington is an elegant property located in beautiful South Kensington . 

All team members encountered from the front desk to the restaurant delivered an excellent guest experience. Service was 10/10.

I stayed in a ‚Äúcosy room‚Äù which was perfect for a weekend break. The room was quiet, comfortable and housekeeping standards were excellent. 

Desk space is limited in the ‚Äúcosy room‚Äù, so for a business stay or longer stay it may be worth selecting a larger room type.

Food and beverage staff were very knowledgeable and accommodating for food allergies. I would especially like to recognise Robert for his attention to detail in this area during breakfast service.",5,2023,12,10
113,Beautiful Hotel with a Warm Welcome,"Stayed 2 nights for a Christmas Break, the staff give such a warm welcome and treat you like a family member. Rooms are luxurious and great breakfast in the morning with lots of choices. You will feel very special when staying here..",5,2023,12,09

113,The most magical wedding weekend!,"We would like to share our wonderful experience with The Kensington Hotel, we had our wedding weekend held here in this superb hotel, it was completely magical, absolutely were all made to feel so special, the hospitality here is second to none, I have to start with the amazing staff, so many to name, but I can a few , from Shenaz, Gerard the general manager, Alex, and the most charming Thomas, who went above and beyond to help us with all arrangements, the amazing Gabrielle, Lazzo the fun barman and our wonderful waiting staff, just everyone here is so welcoming, they all made our stay so memorable and so special, the organisation of our wedding was amazing and our wedding room was so beautiful, dinner outstanding, Alex the chef done us proud, Thankyou Thankyou, our guests had the best time, hotel is so beautiful, extremely comfortable, relaxing and luxurious, we will return here time and time again, and I think a lot of our guests will too, 100% recommend The Kensington to anyone, we are so pleased we had our Wedding Day with you!!

113,Exactly What I Was Looking For,"Great location - just minutes from South Kensington tube station. Beautiful hotel inside & out. Welcoming staff. Standard queen room bath is a bit small, but beds are very comfortable. We are already booked to come & stay again. ",5,2023,12,05
113,holiday stay,"absolutely lovely stay at the holidays! great location in south kensington, very near the tube stations luckily. Had the pleasure of great staff and harvey at the front desk is particularly helpful and kind :)",5,2023,12,03
113,Amazing as always.,"I‚Äôve had the pleasure of staying at The Kensington three times now, and it remains my top choice. The hotel‚Äôs prime location, paired with the exceptional service, makes it a standout. The rooms are not only cozy, but the beds are incredibly comfortable, ensuring a restful stay each time. The staff, particularly Gurcan at the concierge, deserves special mention for their warmth and attentiveness. Gurcan goes above and beyond, always welcoming and creating a delightful atmosphere. It‚Äôs not just a stay at The Kensington; it‚Äôs a genuine experience of comfort and hospitality. During my recent stay at The Kensington, I decided to try their breakfast for the first time, and it was an absolute delight. The delicious spread and impeccable service further added to the overall positive experience. It‚Äôs evident that the hotel excels not only in providing a comfortable stay but also in delivering a memorable dining experience. Highly recommended!",5,2023,12,02
113,Pleasantly surprised,"Hotel stays for business can be rather mundane and I often opt for apartments instead for that home away from home feeling, as I feel hotels often have no real warmth or character. My usual apartment was already booked so my PA booked me into the The Kensington due to proximity to my meetings; I was not happy about this however upon arrival I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel is beautiful and very well kept, food was delicious and the service was impeccable. A gentleman by the name of Harvey I believe, was particularly attentive he's customer focus, care and knowledge were outstanding it was almost as if he could read my mind and knew what I wanted before or just as I was about to ask. This was very comforting and has certainly changed my mind about hotel stays. Everything I needed Harvey was on hand to sort, with relative ease and composure. 

I didn't get a chance to thank him before I left so I just wanted to take the opportunity now to say a massive thank you to Harvey for making a stressful trip a fulfilling one. I look forward to returning to the Kensington and hope I experience the same level of warmth from whoever I come into contact with.

",5,2023,11,29
113,A disappointing experience,"I know this is London but for close to ¬£1000 for room, dinner and breakfast for one night should be better. Checked in online and expected Swift access to room keys. Nope, still took 10-15 minutes of credit card authorisation and form signing. Online check-in a bit pointless really. Room was very small but well decorated and clean. Dinner was ok but reception on arrival confused as no record of our on-line booking or allergy. They found it eventually after 5 minutes hovering amongs stayed guets. Dinner was fine. Breakfast very slow as they were clearly under-staffed. ",3,2023,11,27
113,Amazing stay at the Kensington ,"After a long layover, miserable flight attendants and a nightmare at customs, I thought I was in for a war at the hotel too (knowing my luck). However I was greeted warmly and made to feel like I could leave all my troubles at the door. Staff was amazing, especially Harvey who always took a genuine interest in how we were feeling and if we needed anything (tip off the cap to you sir). Accommodation was luxurious, and the food was great. It really helped to salvage a trip that looked destined for failure.",5,2023,11,26
113,The Kensington is my home away from home!,"Whenever I travel to London, the Kensington is my home away from home! Perfectly situated in the heart of beautiful South Kensington, the hotel is close to both museums and the tube. It is a boutique hotel that I have been staying at for many years. The rooms and suites are meticulously clean, the beds are more comfortable than our beds at home and the staff is top notch! Upon arrival, I am always welcomed by familiar faces- and that says a great deal in these days where 
keeping employees is very difficult. The doorman, Mario and the front desk team always greet you with a warm welcome and smiles and the concierge team of Emiliano, Arman, 
Pavel And Lucian are absolutely the best!! Even before we arrived, they scheduled our dinner and show reservations, and once we were there, they were so helpful answering all our questions and assisting us with everything. We look forward to returning to this gem of a hotel! Thank you for everything!

We look forward to returning",5,2023,11,26
113,A Fabulous Stay @ The Kensington,"The Hotel is super welcoming. The beds are incredibly comfy, the service is excellent. We especially loved Mario at the front door, who knew EVERYTHING. We were cooking Thanksgiving dinner for friends and he sent us to the best grocers, fishmongers and butchers as well as leading us to best pubs and restaurants in the neighborhood. We also loved Emiliano, who booked us theater tickets (flawlessly) and also cabs. Fantastic service. The bar is excellent, if pricey. Breakfast is also great. We stayed for two weeks and always had plenty of choices for breakfast. This hotel is, simply, superb.",5,2023,11,26
113,comfort in an older London,"We chose the Kensington wanting a more traditional British experience and were satisfied.  An eclectic mix of design within the common spaces, a friendly staff, and comfortable sleeping accommodations in South Kensington.  With train or cab we were less than 30 minutes away from the main theatres door-to-door.",5,2023,11,25
113,I recommend,"Very good quality accommodation in London. We will definitely be back one day. Great hotel facilities, the only thing missing to our satisfaction was ironing facilities. Really beautiful property and Afternoon tea was perfect.",5,2023,11,22
113,Brilliant ! We love this hotel The staff are amazing. ,"This is a beautiful hotel with an undestated elegance throughout. The beds are so comfortable and the linen is good quality. This was our fourth trip. The customer experience is like nothing I have been exposed to any where in the world. They treat you like one of the family. The food is good quality should you choose to eat there but it is well located for all manner of cusine. I will never tire of coming to this hotel, although this is my first  review. We attended a concert at the Royal Albert Hall which was about 15 mins by foot. ",5,2023,11,20
113,Exceptional Experience!!!,"What an incredible hotel!!
From the minute I walked through the door, I was made to feel extremely welcomed.
The attention to detail is exceptional and the service was incredible.
The staff REALLY go that extra mile to make your stay memorable. The perfect mix of professionalism and friendliness.
Special mention to Emiliano and Silviu from the concierge, who both made a lasting impression on me during my stay.
They are a credit to the Kensington and I look forward to seeing them both again on my next visit.
Faultless experience from start to finish!!!",5,2023,11,20
113,Family weekend,"Amazing facilities, attention to detail and the staff really went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. Lego gift sets and books for the kids were unexpected and only added to the home away from home experience. 

We already look forward to our next visit!",5,2023,11,17

113,A wonderful 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è experience ,We had the most wonderful 3 day  break in the hotel a  wonderful welcome from Fintan at reception who looked after us with early check in and friendly chat   Room was amazing our breakfast was delicious and our server Levante was so courteous and friendly    Couldn‚Äôt fault any of the staff excellent customer service from start to finish it definitely was the 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è experience look forward to visiting again soon ,5,2023,11,17
113,Magical Hotel with Incredible Staff,"The Kensington is my favorite hotel in the world. It's a lovely hotel in a phenomenal location. However, there are plenty of nice hotels with good locations. What separates this place is the true kindness and attention to detail from the staff. 

We've stayed here three times now (twice as a couple and once with our 5-year old). From the minute you walk in, you are welcomed like an old friend. Every element of the check-in procedure is seamless. The hotel lobby and restaurant area is immaculately decorated year-round, but is especially magical at Christmastime. 

On our last trip, we stayed in the family room in March for my 5-year old daughter's birthday. We were a little unsure about bringing her to such a nice hotel, but the amount of things this hotel and the staff did for her was INCREDIBLE! They had a teepee set up for her to sleep in, they had a cake for her one day, they had books and presents galore every time we returned from our day's activities. Every time we walked into the lobby, the staff greeted her by name and wished her Happy Birthday or asked how she was doing. We broke our trip up (3 nights in London and then we went to another country before returning for a final night) and when we arrived in our room, they found a stuffed animal she had left behind and had it sitting right on her bed! It was amazing and so incredibly thoughtful and kind. She still talks about this trip and the hotel and we‚Äôve been back for 8 months!

The staff in general have been amazing every time we‚Äôve stayed, but Thomas Keating in particular should be commended--he really outdid himself. It's truly the best customer service I have ever received in my life. Things like that make you want to come back to a place again and again. We look forward to more wonderful stays at The Kensington.",5,2023,11,13
113,Stunning Hotel,"Beautiful hotel, staff were amazing, nothing too much trouble, very friendly and accommodating. 
Especially Silviu who went above and beyond to make our stay the best it could be. 
Would definitely come back and I highly recommend this hotel. Great location also.",5,2023,11,13
113,Accolades to The Kensington team.,"The Kensington Hotel made our first trip to London spectacular in every way.
Firstly, the bed was so comfortable we didn't even notice jet lag. The room was a delight of floral wallpaper with matching drapes which drew us in to an English garden. The bathroom floor was luxuriously heated. We had everything we needed to be at home in our temporary residence. 
Our concierges Arman and Pavel were able to pull the rabbit out of the hat when they got me a ticket to the sold out Gabrielle Chanel exhibit at the Victoria & Albert Museum. For a discounted price no less. And, on our return to the hotel, as an unexpected and lovely gesture, Guest Relations Manager‚ÄîTom Keating‚Äîpresented me with the lovely Gabrielle Chanel book that accompanied the exhibit. I was so touched. Earlier in our stay, Mr. Keating had gifted us A Nation in Bloom published by the Royal Horticultural Society after a wonderful conversation about our garden at home and his experience with English gardens. 
Pavel and Arman also reserved for us, same day tickets to Wicked‚Äîcenter section, 10th row‚Äîexcellent seats reasonably priced $250 for two. In LA that would have been per person. They din't have scalpers in London, apprently.
The dining rooms were so comfortable with wonderful fresh culinary choices.  My fav was from the drawing room. A Chargrilled Sirloin Ciabatta, caramelised onions, rocket & Stilton. So good that I ordered it a second time! 
We loved loved loved the Kensington's location. Very centrally located and we walked or taxied around. Tom Keating made sure everything we needed was available to us, ensuring a lovely stay and a desire to return. Thank you Kensington team for a very memorable visit.
",5,2023,11,12
113,Hotel with very good Concierge Emiliano,"Emiliano best concierge service. We really wanted to see the Coco Chanel show at the V&A and the concierge desk and especially Emiliano help source and secure the tickets. I could have done this without Emiliano and his assistant Arman help. 
Hotel is very friendly with lovely staff and ideally situated.",5,2023,11,10
113,Gurcan is your guy here !,"Lovely stay overall. 
Love the hotel decor, very inviting. 
Bed and pillows very comfortable. 
Wasn‚Äôt to happy with my bath, prefer showers. 
Breakfast is really nice ! 
Excellent service overall, but especially from Gurcan - he was incredible, he exceeded our expectations!",5,2023,11,09
113,Sisters Weekend in London,"I have visited London many times in my life and specifically wanted to stay in Kensington area on this trip with my sister to celebrate our birthdays. It was first my stay at The Kensington and the hotel exceeded my expectations. The staff and the public spaces are first rate, only our room was a bit tired, although it was neat and tidy. The lobby and bar have a wonderful energy and it was a pleasure to be a guest at The Kensington Hotel. Special shout out to Harvey. Congrats on your new baby!",5,2023,11,07
113,Great place  to stay,"Excellent pllace to stay, lovely hotel, friendly staff and great location.  I would recommend it to anyone for pleasure or business.  Very near the tube station and great restrauants nearby.  While close to the city staying in south Kensington feels like you are staying in a neighbourhood.",5,2023,11,07
113,Most Exceptional Hotel after 3 months of Travelling ,We travelled  3 months through Europe myself and stayed in some pretty amazing 5 star hotels along the way. The Kensington Hotel was an absolute stand out! - Thank you to Tom and his team of staff - Exceptional Sevice - 10 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è ,5,2023,11,03
113,Made to Feel a Queen,"From the time one arrives you are treated like royalty!  Luxury without pretension and the staff so friendly and helpful, it is genuine, not ""put-on"" professionalism.  For many years I have traveled extensively in GB always beginning & ending in London, have stayed in countless hotels from the highest to mid-range and have finally found my home away from home in London.  I intend to stay exclusively at the Kensington going forth.  I hesitate to write this review as I want to assure ""availability"" on future visits.  The location is excellent, close to Kensington Palace, The Natural History Museum, the V&A, shopping at Harrod's and Harvey Nic's plus the all important South Kensington tube stop.  The lobby, bar and dining room are beautifully appointed, very tasteful.  The restaurant and menu are outstanding.  The breakfast goes from traditional English style to the more modern Avacado Toast, which is sublime!  The rooms are spacious with modern bathrooms, elegant decor and most importantly the best bedding available.  The sheets are to die-for!  Should you decide to have a stay here, I suggest you make yourself known to the wonderful Guest Relations Manager, Thomas Keating who will treat you as the ""star"" your are!  From the time I made my reservations by phone with the lovely and gracious Anita, til my final good byes with the terrific doormen, among them, Gurcan, Harvey and Mario (always so welcoming & kind) I was made to feel like the Queen I am....lol.  General Manager and gentleman supreme, Gerrard Sintes is to be congratulated on running such a stellar operation.  Bravo!!!!",5,2023,10,31
113,Not a Five-Star Hotel,"This review has been edited due to pressure on TripAdvisor from The Kensington. This is not the full story, which the hotel is aggressively suppressing. 

Very expensive, and simply not worth it. $5,000 for a five-night stay. Staff was pleasant and seemed to want to be helpful, but at the end of the day struggled with basic service at a level that would be expected at any hotel, much less a supposed five-star hotel. For example, room service orders were never correct, not once, and in strange ways: missing plates, no forks, never a newspaper despite being marked prominently on the breakfast order door tag. One morning, breakfast showed up with no tea, couldn‚Äôt get a response on the phone, so I got dressed and went downstairs to see about getting tea sent up, in a completely pleasant manner. Instead of a simple, ‚ÄúOf course, it‚Äôll be sent up,‚Äù the food manager went to get the door-tag that I had filled out to try to prove to me that no tea had been ordered. The door-tag clearly indicated that it had been. So, not only incompetent service, but actually confrontational and aggressive.",1,2023,10,31
113,A hotel to return to time and again....,"The Kensington Hotel in London is a gem.  Great location, beautiful appointed hotel with superb service which is what sets this hotel apart from others.  From the General Manager to the amazing doormen, we were pampered and shown such consideration and kindness.  Shout out to Harvey, Gurgan and Mario...THANK YOU for all the assists and your beautiful smiles!",5,2023,10,30
113,Would not return,"We travel a lot and stay at nice places.  We stayed 5 nights (well over $2,000) here.  We did not hang around the hotel during the days, so we cannot comment on that.  Generally, we left in the am, returned mid-day, and then left for the evenings.  The latter part of our stay, we experienced some issues.  The two major issues concerning: (1)  the bar staff, who we found to be rude when there was confusion over a drink order, and more importantly, (2) the upkeep of our room.  On the issue of the upkeep of our room, we left one morning around 9 am and returned mid-day and the room had not been made up.  No clean-up, no new towels, no refreshment of soaps and no emptying of trash.  We called to the operator and told her, and we talked directly to the concierge.  Then, we left for the afternoon/evening.  The concierge assured us that the room would be attended to while we were out for dinner and a show.  We returned between 10 and 11 pm to a room that again had not been touched.  We called and went down to the desk to ask for towels, soap, etc.  They sent two men who were very helpful--but, this was 11 pm at night.  They gave us towels and took out the trash. We felt badly for them, as they were stuck with a problem and no one with any authority stepped up to speak with us, etc.  When we checked out in the am, the fellow at the desk (who was one of the employees who we talked to face to face the night before) said they were aware of the issues and would address them--that was a week ago as of this writing (and no word from the hotel, and we do not expect them to try to make up to us these inconveniences at this point).  Our feeling is that we paid for 5 nights and got value of 3.5--we filled out a review that the hotel sent us and mentioned these issues,  and never heard back.  We liked the location and the building was clean (except for our room which they did not clean every day), and we were soured on the service and responsiveness.  We love boutique hotels, but would not return to this one.  They had chances to rectify the issues, but either neglected them or decided that we did not really matter in the grand scheme.

113,The Kensington,"Our review of our stay at the Kensington in London for 5 nights recently.  It is truly  one of the most amazing and beautiful hotels that we have ever been lucky enough to stay in.  Thank you to all the helpful, kind and friendly staff.",5,2023,10,25
113,great location,"high end hotel experience and not too spiteful considering the location, very clean and modern room with nice quality tv and choice of channels, spotless bathroom, helpful team.
doorman and reception staff very charming, looked after our luggage and made sure we had everything we needed",5,2023,10,23
113,Charm and warmth in central London,"Relax in magnificent splendour with  personal attention in the centre of London. On arrival, Harvey, Gurcan and Mario will give you the warmest of welcomes. No request is too much and assistance is just an arm's length away. At breakfast  Petronella had a bright smile every morning as our breakfast came fresh and to perfection.
Thomas the manager has that distinct Irish charm and friendly humour. Rather appreciate for a Doyle hotel.
Overall, 10/10 to all the team.",5,2023,10,22
113,Gorgeous Breakfast!,"Spent a 1 night pitstop in London at the Kensington before our flight home.  I was very impressed with the public areas of the hotel.  The dining rooms, lounges, libraries and bar are absolutely stunning, thoughtfully designed, beautiful, and comfortable.  The staff really go above and beyond.  The breakfast is not to be missed (it is pricey, so try to get a booking that includes the breakfast).  Give yourself a good hour to linger over the meal, and just enjoy the gorgeous space.  Its quite something!

Our room (408) was fine- a bit on the small side and just a bit dated, however the bed was super comfortable and I appreciated the turndown service in the evening!  

One tip- Kensington is on the west side on London, so its very convenient for getting to/from Heathrow.  ",5,2023,10,22
113,A Wonderful Hotel With An Incredible Staff,"Our whole experience at The Kensington was just beyond anything we had hoped and this was our first time in London. We have never experienced such amazing service as we did at this hotel. The rooms, the breakfast, the staff, the concierge --- everything was wonderful and tailored to our time at The Kensington. There was such thoughtfulness that went into every part of our stay and we so appreciated this especially since we were traveling with children who now just keep asking to go back. A big thank you to the entire team including Gabi, Arman, Mario, Pavel, Thomas (and the list goes on) for an incredible stay. ",5,2023,10,19
113,Home away from home,"The Kensington Hotel was like a real home away from home. It's in a fantastic spot, super close to Kensington Park, the Natural History Museum, and the Victoria & Albert Museum. There are tons of great restaurants and cafes around.

Our room was a stunner with a view of a charming street and lovely buildings. And let me tell you, the bed was so comfy that we slept like babies.

The staff were just awesome, from the moment we walked in until we left. Big shoutout to receptionist Marie ‚Äì she's the one who welcomed us and gave us all the info we needed. 

Ronnie was another superstar. He made us feel at home with his warm welcomes every day.

Pavel was a lifesaver, giving us the lowdown on where to go and how to get there. Seriously, that guy knows the city inside out.

And the restaurant crew? They were fantastic, and always ready to make our dining experience top-notch.

We can't wait to come back here in the future.",5,2023,10,19
113,The best customer service from Harvey and Anita!,"The room we ended up on we absolutely perfect. Harvey took incredible care of us from start to finish, and went above and beyond the call of duty to make sure we were settled in perfectly. Anita helped ensure that we were in the very best room possible, and we are now completely satisfied. Everything is now just the way it needs to be to celebrate my mother's birthday; and we are so grateful to the staff for ensuring that it is so! ",5,2023,10,18
113,An Outstanding Hotel,"My husband and I are just back from the most enjoyable weekend stay at The Kensington.  Everything about this hotel was outstanding, but its greatest asset is its staff, who all went above and beyond to ensure our stay was memorable and enjoyable.  In particular, it was a pleasure to meet Thomas Keating, who made us feel so welcome and at home during our stay. 

The interior decor of the hotel is beautiful and all areas of the hotel were extremely clean and well maintained.  The Hotel is also very well located, particularly for those who would like to explore that part of the city on foot.  I cannot wait for a return visit!",5,2023,10,17
113,Great experience,Everything was great and the hotel staff was personable and very accommodating. Food was great. Gurcan offered outstanding concierge services. Would definitely return to this hotel if we visit London again. ,5,2023,10,16
113,Fantastic!,"Fantastic stay at The Kensington!  I've been to London many times but this was my first stay here, for three nights on a business trip.  The Kensington is a classic English hotel with a beautiful lobby, dining room and bar, more cozy than large, all impeccably maintained.  Service was superb throughout, from check-in to departure.  They really want to make sure you are having a good stay.  It's the details that matter--for example, on a rainy day I used the umbrella that is thoughtfully provided in the room.  When I returned to the hotel, the doorman took my wet umbrella so I wouldn't track water through the lobby and gave me a dry one to take back to the room.  Now that's thoughtful service.

The hotel is in a quiet neighborhood and just around the corner from a street full of stores and restaurants.  It's within a few minutes‚Äô walk to two tube stops, the South Kensington and Gloucester Station.  Couldn't be more convenient.

I had booked a Classic Queen room, one of the cheapest categories.  It had everything you would find in a luxury hotel:  bathrobes, slippers, coffee maker and kettle with all the fixings, room safe, and plenty of free still and sparkling bottled water.  There was a stocked mini bar, which I didn‚Äôt use and didn‚Äôt bother to ask the hotel if they could empty it.   Not surprisingly the room was small, with just enough room for a bed with a night table on each side, a chair and side table, and a thin desk.  No dresser or even drawers for folded clothes.  The size didn‚Äôt bother me since I was solo and out for most of the day but to be honest I think it would have been uncomfortable with two people or even one large person.  This is of course no fault of the hotel, it's just the way European hotels were constructed.  The bathroom was also small but the shower water pressure was great.  There was one window, which was doubled paned and even though I was on the third floor I couldn't hear any street noise below.

Breakfast was included with my room so I ate in the dining room a couple days.  Everything is ala carte from the menu, no buffet.  The food was very good but breakfast took over an hour due to slow service (probably a bit understaffed).

The fitness room on the second level was surprisingly large--two adjoining rooms--and well stocked with cardio and weight equipment.

The room rate was certainly reasonable compared to other London hotels of this caliber, and the free breakfast made it a no brainer.  I was able to get a good deal by booking through their website and joining the free membership club.  All in all a great stay and I would return!",5,2023,10,14
113,Proposal Weekend,"The team provided a luxurious
and comfortable atmosphere and went above and beyond to help me plan a
momentous event in my life‚Äîthe proposal to the love of my life.

From the moment I arrived at the hotel, I was immediately struck by
the warm and welcoming ambience. The staff's attention to detail and
commitment to ensuring a remarkable stay was evident in every
interaction I had. Each team member, from the front desk to the
restaurant staff, demonstrated professionalism and courtesy that
exceeded my expectations.

I want to extend a special thank you to Sofia, Thomas and Gabi, who
played an instrumental role in helping me plan the proposal. Their
creativity, enthusiasm, and willingness to go the extra mile to ensure
everything went smoothly touched my heart. The proposal went off
without a hitch, and it was an incredibly emotional and memorable
moment that I will cherish for the rest of my life.

The room upgrade was exceptional, and I was treated to the utmost
comfort and luxury. The dining experience the restaurant was
equally outstanding, with delicious cuisine and impeccable service.

Our stay at The Kensington was nothing short of perfection, and I am
genuinely grateful for the role the team played in making it all
possible.

We already looking forward to returning to The Kensington in the
future and reliving the magical moments created during my stay. The
Kensington will forever hold a special place in my heart.",5,2023,10,13
113,Wonderful ,Great room and wonderful! Especially George the photographer :). Every detail was thought of from water to slippers to helping us get to the airport for a very early flight. Would stay there again if I get back to London. ,5,2023,10,12
113,We had the best time at this hotel!,"We stayed at The Kensington Hotel for 4 days and could not have been more pleased with the hotel. The service was superb. We were treated like royalty with every need met with a high level of service. Harvey was very responsive, friendly and professional and it felt as if he truly was anticipating every single need we might have. He made sure a birthday cake was delivered to our room which was a lovely gesture. The staff at the front desk, the concierge, porters and wait staff all were friendly and so accommodating - greeting each guest like a long lost friend.
The room was luxurious - the bathroom was huge! Bed was comfortable, all amenities were available. We used the laundry service and our clean clothes were hung in our closet (by Harvey of course!) when we had returned.
We ate dinner at The Townhouse restaurant and had Afternoon Tea in the drawing room. Each a great experience.
If you like staying in South Kensington and enjoy the luxuries of impeccable service and plush surroundings, I highly recommend The Kensington Hotel. We could not be more pleased with how we were treated by Harvey, Petronella, and the staff.",5,2023,10,12
113,Best vacay ever!,The hotel was amazing! First time in London and it did not disappoint. The staff (including George) were helpful with restaurant recommendations and every assistance needed. Highly recommend as it is in a great location and easy to navigate the city. *****,5,2023,10,12
113,Wonderful People! ,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Kensington! The bar, caf√©, and lounge were simply wonderful and the location was perfect! Undoubtedly, the most unforgettable part of our stay was the staff. Be sure to make acquaintance with Harvey on your stay. He was the first to greet my wife and I and immediately made us feel like we had known him for a long time. We looked forward to interacting with Harvey each day and were genuinely sad to find out he would not be at the Kensington for our final day. 
Thank you, to all the wonderful staff and thank you to Harvey for making The Kensington a place we eagerly await the chance to return. 
",5,2023,10,09
113,Great service!,Phenomenal stay. The service and valets were just top notch. I would love to come back again in 2024. They treated my mother like she was absolute royalty. The bar was also gorgeous and a lovely place to hang at night. ,5,2023,10,08
113,Wonderful hospitality!,"My mother (who has mobility issues) and I stayed 4-5 days and the entire staff was lovely. We received eager assistance in hailing a cab every time, and the room was very clean. Always a bonus: there is a lift!",5,2023,10,05

113,Go to the Kensington You deserve it! ,"Go to the Kensington You deserve it! 

I rarely write reviews but have been traveling the past 35 years mostly to 4 and 5 star resorts and hotels in the US Canada and Europe.  

This was a 10 day post covid anniversary trip - stayed in 2 other 5 stars (more expensive) first -  my wife was feeling very disappointed - she felt unwelcome - commenting that no matter how much you spend and how ""famous"" a hotel you stay in they treat you are an inconvenience.

Arriving at the Kensington saved the whole trip.  From the moment you arrive at the front door  - everyone treats you like they are glad you are there.   One of the assistant hotel managers Dario even gave us a short tour of the hotel and showed us to our lovely room where several welcome and anniversary treats and notes were waiting for us!

To the bellman, front desk, cleaning, restaurant staff and to the hotel manager thank you for a wonderful stay.    

I give the Kensington 6 stars!",5,2023,09,27
113,Our  two week stay at the Kensington Hotel was wonderful and memorable,"Our two week stay at the Kensington Hotel in London was fantastic! It exceeded our expectations in the quality of the staff who were so kind, so helpful and so professional, the accommodations were fantastic, the location was brilliant being close to museums, shops and wonderful for strolling, the restaurant was great and we ate there several times. Perhaps the best part was the superb concierge service especially Emiliano who got us hard to get tickets for the just opened ‚ÄúChanel‚Äù at the Victoria & Albert museum. The also helped us get tickets to a new play with Ian McKlellen and Roger Allam and book train tickets to the country north. The staff made our stay in London memorable. Leslie &  Norm",5,2023,09,26
113,The Best Staff Ever!,"We visited London and was initially booked at a different hotel across the street from this hotel. Our experience was awful and we checked out after only one night. We were able to get a king room R the last minute and immediately checked in. I was greeted by very kind staff who understood our situation and went about and beyond to make sure the rest of our stay was amazing! 

The front desk clerk ( Gabriela) was AWESOME! Harvey- the Trip Advisor was incredible, helpful, attentive to our request. George - guest staff was very nice and helpful. They turned a potential NEGATIVE into. POSITIVE!
I couldn‚Äôt be more pleased. The entire staff was amazing! 
The room was nice, hotel was beautiful. I plan to come back to London and stay here again.",5,2023,09,21
113,Fabulous stay at the Kensington in London,"I cannot say enough about the hotel Kensington.  Wonderful Restaraunt with free breakfast.   The food was exceptional, service was perfect.  I also loved the bar on the ground floor for cocktails late night.  Harvey was always an incredible help.  If we needed assistance with a taxi, or directions to the subway, where to go for breakfast, or help with our bags.  I think he works with the consierge.. we were there for 4 days and he always found us immediately with a huge smile and figured out what we wanted.  I will absolutely stay there again.

113,Great Hotel in London,"The Kensington was a wonderful hotel to stay at. The staff was so nice to deal with and made sure our stay was extra special. Harvey, in particular, was very helpful and professional. Overall, I would highly recommend staying at this hotel. ",5,2023,09,20
113,Wonderful hotel in quiet area,"Everything about our visit was terrific. London was our first stop on our vacation journey. The hotel was ready for our check-in early, and everything in the room was perfect.  It was exceptionally warm in London during our visit, but the room was comfortably cool.  They sent us a lovely welcome gift to our room for our anniversary. All of the staff that we encountered was exceptional. Everyone is willing to help regardless of their ‚Äòjob‚Äô. This is truly a team effort. Concierge support for recommendations and reservations was fantastic. Breakfast is good with many options, depending upon your needs. The K-Bar is a great spot for a cocktail/snack before heading out to dinner or after returning from a long sight-seeing day. The cocktails are all very good and if you‚Äôre sitting at the bar, they love testing new recipes with you. Overall, I‚Äôd highly recommend the hotel. We truly enjoyed our stay ne wer always made to feel very welcome and at home.",5,2023,09,14
113,The ideal hotel in London,"I noticed the Kensington in 2022 as I walked nearby my hotel and decided to go in and check it out. I was greeted warmly as if I were a treasured guest and ended up having a delicious dinner in the elegant and spacious lobby, which feels like a comfortable living room. When plans evolved to return to London in 2023, I looked to book online, but prices were high. I decided to call the hotel directly and ended up booking a reasonably priced classic queen room, their most basic level - but it was anything but basic. The room was cozy but decorated beautifully, with a nice sized marble bathroom, and breakfast was included. The staff provide a truly remarkable level of service, greeting you by name once they‚Äôve met you and offering to help with whatever you may need. The concierge is one of the best I‚Äôve ever encountered. All in all, I can‚Äôt imagine staying anywhere else in London.",5,2023,09,09
113,Best hotel in London,Couldn‚Äôt say enough lovely things about this hotel. It is perfect for couples or for families. My boyfriend and I had the best time in London and the staff was so helpful in recommending places and ensuring we had a great stay. This hotel does not disappoint! ,5,2023,09,04
113,Perfect place for families in London,"I took my family to London a few weeks ago, and our stay at the Kensington was a highlight.  The hotel itself is excellent, with well-appointed rooms and a fantastic restaurant, Town House. The location is perfect, with wonderful restaurants, shops and a neighborhood feel while still being very close to the South Kensington tube stop. More importantly, the staff at the Kensington made our entire family feel at home. Thomas and his guest services team even went through the trouble of asking about our sons' interests prior to our visit so that they could prepare some special keepsakes from London for them upon our arrival. I could not recommend the Kensington more highly. ",5,2023,08,30
113,Amazing!,"Fantastic location , excellent staff, amazing stay !
A special thank you for the welcome and the assistance in every detail to Emiliano, the head of Concierge‚Äôs.

113,An comfortable and enjoyable stay,"My family (including 2 children) stayed in a family room in The Kensington during summer holiday.  We received a warm welcome upon arrival.  The family room is lovely and very comfortable.  I was impressed by the beautiful floral decoration and delicious welcome snacks.  The location of The Kensington is good too, quiet and peaceful surrounding areas, but easily accessible to nearby restaurants, Tube station and tourist attractions. 

Their concierge team‚Äôs service was remarkable, and services started before arrival.  They were able to secure Premier League tickets for us.  Just tell them what you need and they are ready to help.

Bill settlement was simple and accurate.   

The service from all hotel staff are incredible, which made our stay an unforgettable and relaxing one.  Thanks for everything.",5,2023,08,29
113,Amazing service!!! Been coming for years.,"Amazing stay!! Have come here year after year. What sets this hotel apart is the service, they truly go above and beyond.

Thank you Chandra",5,2023,08,27
113,Delicious afternoon tea in lovely surroundings,"My daughter took me here for afternoon tea today and it was a fantastic experience. All of the staff were friendly and welcoming without being intrusive. Their 80 Days Around the World themed afternoon tea was delicious with food from India, Yemen, Hong Kong & Singapore - something a little bit different to your usual afternoon tea and served in beautiful surroundings. We were talked through all of the items on the menu with enthusiasm and they would be more than happy to accommodate any allergies should you have any. Great food, great service - I would highly recommend a visit and will definitely be returning.",5,2023,08,23
113,"Unwelcoming, if you plan to use your tablet in their lounge, seriously?1","Popped to grab a bite on the go and do some work on my iPad. Unfortunately, I was told tablets ‚Äò computers are prohibited in the lounge area. The lounge was completely empty except for two people. Their policy seems to be wasteful. In this day and age, when wfh and on the move is the norm, it is a costly policy. ",3,2023,08,23

Great location for exploring London with wonderful restaurants very close by.  Lovely adjoining rooms and a delicious breakfast, highly recommend!",5,2023,08,19
113,Incredible customer service,"Gurcan was incredible. He was so kind to my best friend and I and so helpful. He was more than polite; he became one of our friends. I would come back just for him. George, as well, was remarkable. He spent a lot of time trying to find us a converter that would work in the room. As two women, we felt more that comfortable having him in our room and he really just was a sweet man. Again, would return just for the people. ",5,2023,08,17
113,"Beauty, warmth, and great care embodied!","Where do I begin? We traveled to London with our family of 4 (kids of 14 & 3) and had the most amazing experience at The Kensington. It's clear they hold a high bar for service and executed on that starting weeks before our arrival when Thomas from the concierge team reached out offering assistance to set us up with reservations or other bookings. Upon arrival we were greeted warmly and, when the staff realized we'd accidentally booked a room too small for our group, happily upgraded us to a larger room at a fraction of the usual cost. This was only the beginning...

Throughout our stay the concierge team, most notably Emiliano, Thomas, Harvey, Mario, George, and Pavel, took great care to attend to our every need. They did everything from book us into experiences that had been sold out for weeks, to walk us down the street to get us off in the right direction, to carrying my son's stroller down the stairs, to inviting my husband and I to a new members only night club underneath the hotel.. all while greeting us by name and showing genuine interest in our experience. Oh, and upon learning our two kids' interests, they brought them personalized gifts with handwritten notes. 

Housekeeping was also impeccable and the restaurant experience and staff were lovely... One special note here was that the bartender made me a personalized cocktail when he discovered my preferred spirit was not available. 

I can't say enough about this wonderful hotel and it's top notch staff. This was our first family trip to London, but we will absolutely stick with The Kensington for future trips. Thank you all!!",5,2023,08,15
113,Great service,"The service from all staff was exemplary, from arrival, to the restaurant, to the bar, to the room. Particular mention should go to Harvey who made us feel very welcome. We will definitely be back. Thanks all.",4,2023,08,12
113,Best hospitality ,"With Abdul's exceptional hospitality, I have found a true gem in The Kensington Hotel. His warm welcomes, personalized gestures, and genuine care have turned each visit into an unforgettable experience.

It's his remarkable commitment to ensuring our comfort and enjoyment that keeps us coming back, making The Kensington Hotel our top choice for a perfect getaway.",5,2023,08,12
113,The Finest Hotel In London,"The Kensington is the finest hotel in London. The hotel itself is stunning and impeccably maintained throughout the day. The neighborhood is unbeatable and right next to the underground rail station of South Kensington. But what separates the hotel from all the rest is the peerless service and staff. From the general manager John Mclean to the incredible guest relations and concierge team of Thomas Keating, Arman, Pavel, Mario, Emiliano, Lucian and Harvey to the desk team of Alessandro, Mary-Sophie, Anita, the night desk team, and those who are in the breakfast room and K-Bar including Chandra. I wish I could name every person we came into contact with at the hotel because they were all so warm and professional. The concierge team was able to secure us incredible seats for the Arsenal v. Man City tickets at Wembley for the Community Shield match. Thomas orchestrated a special surprise delivery of the tickets to our children to surprise them along with kits (!!!) and a sendoff to the game that provided the family with memories that will last a lifetime. The concierge team also got us Churchill War Rooms tickets, phenomenal drivers to and from Heathrow and reservations to the best restaurants around Kensington. The breakfast service was fantastic and our family looked forward to the peaceful breakfast each day. We stayed at the hotel for almost 10 days and each one was an absolute pleasure. Our family is so thankful for The Kensington team for an unforgettable stay and the memories from our travels to London. It was phenomenal!",5,2023,08,09
113,Beyond amazed and so thankful,"There are not enough words to describe the amazing way that the staff took care of my family, and my autistic son, from the moment we stepped into the hotel. 

The Manager gave me his card with his cell and said to call him even on his day off if we needed anything. He had the staff go out and get lactose-free milk for my son. That was just the beginning. Within minutes of getting settled in our room, Thomas brought up a Sonic t-shirt for my son after learning that he loved Sonic the Hedgehog. And soon after this, Tom delivered flowers. They just knew and anticipated everything. I have never had an experience like this and will always remember their kindness and generosity. 

In the middle of our stay, Tom surprised my son again and completely blew me away, with art supplies waiting on him when we came back into our room from a day of touring the city. My son was beyond happy. This was priceless. 

The feeling of knowing that we were a priority made me smile every single day. 

The room, food, and amenities were equally amazing. Harvey even made sure we got great guidance on where to go and how to get there. 

Everything was beyond our expectations. This is their standard. They all live this and thank goodness for them. 

We‚Äôll be back to London and this is where we‚Äôll stay.",5,2023,08,07

113,The BEST hotel,"The Kensington was in the perfect location for our mother daughter trip to London. It was very close to the train station, quiet, clean, and safe. There was no shortage of great restaurants, pubs, coffee shops within walking distance from the hotel. 
The service we received in the hotel was top notch. Our room was spacious and elegantly appointed. The beds and linens were extremely comfortable, we had the best sleep. We even received chocolate covered strawberries with a note welcoming us to London. It was a small touch that we found so nice. The entire staff from the reception, doorman, concierge, restaurant staff, and housekeepers were first rate. We were only there for a short stay but they greeted us by name which made us feel so welcome. This is the sort of treatment you don‚Äôt get at big hotels. Our next trip to London will surely include staying at The Kensington. ",5,2023,08,06

We had an excellent night of sleep in our very comfortable room and the breakfast was very good too. We would definitely stay there again.",5,2023,08,02
113,Rip off,"Afternoon tea. Poor. Very expensive. 
Scones would have made good door stops. Seriously, didn't your grandmother teach you how to bake a decent scone? One sandwich had no filling. Strange experience all round. 
Depressed guests.. not a single happy face. As we left, there were tables vacated with remains of the teas left....interesting no one chose to parcel up the leftovers to share with others. We certainly didn't want to take that home. As per  usual a typical London rip off. Tourists, get away from London and enjoy the rest of the country.....we can bake properly!

113,Highly Recommend,"My husband, 1 year old daughter, and I recently visited London this past June and stayed at the Kensington Hotel. It is a great hotel in our favorite part of the city, South Ken. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and what made it wonderful were the people at the hotel. They were always helping me with my stroller and bags and truly made our experience over the top.  Harvey was wonderful to us, along with many other staff members. Would highly recommend the Kensington!",5,2023,07,27
113,Family trip to London,"This hotel is located in a perfect location for a family trip, close to Underground, quite,  clean ..and with a lot of pubs and restaurants ..
The service in the hotel was the best, reception, doorman all was giving us such a good feeling, and we will surely be back.",5,2023,07,24
113,"Some rooms ok, some not","I‚Äôve stayed at The Kensington twice in recent months.  The first time: a nice, if modest room, and consistently great service.  Seemed like a very solid value.  The second time I had a small inner courtyard room with an afterthought of a window, a bathroom so small that the shower door couldn‚Äôt open outward as it hit the toilet (truly an uncomfortably cramped bathroom - and a shower that didn‚Äôt have properly hot water). That room would have been ok at a much more modest, lower priced hotel. But it doesn‚Äôt come close to meeting expectations at > 400 pounds per night.",2,2023,07,21
113,Exceptional ,"I stayed at the Kensington Hotel as I had business in London the next day, I was met by Emiliano the Concierge. Emiliano was exceptional in his delivery of customer service, he showed Mr around and arranged dinner for me that evening. The bar is stunning and so peaceful, the cocktails are out of this world and the bar staff so friendly. When I dined in the restaurant I was made to feel very welcome and the waiter was another exceptional member of staff, I'm sorry I can't remember his name. I believe he was French ",5,2023,07,18
113,Great stay at Kensington,"What a wonderful recent stay for my 80yo mother and myself. We were taking a long overdue trip to London to celebrate my mother's 80th birthday and realize a dream to see Wimbledon. We chose this hotel due to the neighborhood, classic atmosphere and proximity to Wimbledon. What a great stay! The hotel was very luxurious at the sam time as being very homey and cozy/ The best part of the stay had to be the staff. They are unfailingly polite, kind and friendly . Everyday we returned to a ""Welcome back"". Every request was "" Absolutely, of course"". There were so many kind attentive staff to mention but we were particularly impressed with the front door staff ( Mario and Gurcan). They gave great recommendations for places to walk in beautiful neighborhood as well as places to eat and see. We truly felt like we were cared for by family or close friends. Sad to leave them. We could not have found a better way to explore London. Enjoy a visit",5,2023,07,16

113,Refused To Serve Breakfast To Loyal Customer,"i went for breakfast this morning as i do every time i am in London as i have a flat near by. The restaurant had only 2 or 3 tables occupied. The waiter made me seat, but when he came to take my order he realised i wasn‚Äôt staying at the hotel and refused to take my order and kicked me out. he said he could not serve outsiders ‚Äúbecause of high occupancy‚Äù ‚Ä¶ but the restaurant was empty ‚Ä¶",1,2023,07,12

The hotel is a cozy townhouse where I regularly stay for business and this time added some personal time over the weekend.

Breakfast is lovely with classic and healthy choices.",5,2023,07,01

113,Excellent!,"The rooms are really excellent. The beds and pillows are really comfortable and everything is very sanitary. In addition to this, the lobby and entire ground floor is out of this world. For a hotel located in the heart of London, there is truly nothing missing! Furthermore, the staff is beyond friendly. All of your additional needs are met with a friendly smile. Without even having to ask for it, a delightful man named Harvey brought our bags inside of the trunk of our car. There are constantly friendly and helpful people like Harvey around to meet your every need and best of all, they do it with a smile! I would definitely recommend The Kensington Hotel to anybody visiting London.",5,2023,06,28
113,The Kensington for business,"Harvey the concierge at the door is lovely and helpful! The staff in general are very sweet! 
Good size hotel and amenities for business or leisure.  Would definitely return.  Price for my tiny room (no real place to put clothes except 8 inches of hanging space) was not really reasonable.  I booked last minute so you can‚Äôt really complain but it did feel overpriced for the room.",4,2023,06,28
113,An amazing stay,"My wife and I enjoyed our stay at the Kensington hotel, we were here attending the London Royal Ascot as we usually do. The entire staff are always so helpful and make our stay feel like home. Harvey especially made us feel so welcomed from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. We look forward to our next visit",4,2023,06,27

As parents, we greatly appreciated the hotel's attention to detail when it came to the safety and well-being of our children.

113,Friendly staff and nice stay,"A friend and I stayed here for a week.  We came to London for the Beyonce concert.  The hotel staff is super friendly, helpful and kind. We enjoyed breakfast in the drawing room when we first arrived and had room service a few nights. I loved how close the hotel is to the underground and there are many bus stops around so we took advantage of using public transit but also walked around a lot since places are easy to get to from there. We also looked forward to our chocolates every night after turn down service. Thanks for a great stay!",5,2023,06,09
113,Overpriced,"Rooms needed updating, there were works going on that mean the room was noisy, some areas were not clean.

More of a budget hotel",2,2023,06,04

On arriving back to the Hotel, we checked into our family room which was a lovely boutique looking room with two large double beds and an amazing bathroom and hallway. The beds were very comfy! The attention to detail in the room is second to none. 

Waiting on the bed were gifts for the children and birthday cake for me with a lovely personal note‚Ä¶. A lovely touch, thank you. 

The Hotel is very modern and well situated for exploring London but equally close to the Museum district. 

I would not hesitate to return here and would recommend to couples or families.

113,Great stay in a great location!,"The entire stay was excellent! Harvey and the entire team were incredibly kind, knowledgeable and did an amazing job.

113,It‚Äôs a joy to share the elegant comfort of the Kensington with the most sincerely helpful staff you could wish for.,"Beyond its perfect location, the Kensington Hotel has the most sincerely, pleasant leadership and staff that anyone could hope for.

I‚Äôve stayed many times, and many nights, and will happily continue to call the Kensington Hotel home whenever I‚Äôm in London. ",5,2023,05,29
113,London Magic,"The Kensington is beyond lovely. They take such good care of you.  Chandon is first rate. Our dinner experience with her as our wait staff was the best. Thank you for a beautiful experience.

The location is perfect. They took care of us for the Chelsea Flower Show.  Everyone welcomed us. Great experience.",5,2023,05,29

113,The very best Concierge I have ever met,"A large group of 15 women were traveling g to London for a week with the matriarch of our family.
Emiliano Del Pizzo was the concierge at this hotel and he was the most attentive professional   
Concierge I have ever met.
My husband and I travel extensively and we always feel a concierge can be your best friend and enhance your experience.
Emiliano did just that !
He went over and above with reservation assistance ,theatre recommendations , local knowledge and he created an atmosphere that was so very welcoming.
His kind and warm nature is an asset to The Kensington Hotel. They should be very proud of him!
Thank you Emiliano!!!",5,2023,05,23
113,A reliable and great choice in a great location,"We love the hotel, the staff, and the location. It has become our ‚Äúgo to‚Äù when in town. 

Great attention to you starts from walking in the door, through the registration process, and up to your room. Staff were consistently outgoing and helpful whether sorting out transportation or recommending day trips. 

Plenty of walkable dining options in the neighborhood. Two great museums just a few blocks away. And a tube station minutes away.",5,2023,05,22
113,"Kid tested, Mom approved","I travelled with my 3.5 year old and we had the best time staying at The  Kensington. I‚Äôm a dual US/UK national and have stayed at many London hotels. For this trip, I was specifically looking for one that had great reviews for kids. 

While the hotel is lovely, what really made the experience great was the service. Kiddo got special treats, including a beautiful bear we named Popcorn. When he woke up hungry after midnight one night, the hotel helped us sort out a kid friendly middle of the night snack that he still talks about. 

The hotel also took great care of me. I‚Äôm deaf and for perhaps only the second time in my many years of travel, the hotel made a fire safety plan for me without my asking. They also told us about the National Rail strike and prevented us from nearly missing our return flight. 

Kudos to Anita, Ronnie, and the entire team.",5,2023,05,18
113,An absolutely perfect hotel stay,"We stayed in London last minute for my 30th birthday and I could not praise our experience - and the staff - at the Kensington more. Thomas (Guest Relations Manager) was so incredibly kind - with surprise cakes and champagne in the room for my birthday and such an attention to detail that we have already planned our next visit back! Harvey (concierge) was another stand out, delivering faultless service with his own personal flair, guaranteeing we were both in gales of laughter. It was truly a perfect hotel stay - the ameneties are exactly as you would expect (super comfy beds, pillows, lovely bathrooms etc) for such a lovely hotel but what really sets The Kensington Hotel apart is their attention to detail and dedication to personal service. Thank you all so much - we cannot wait to come back!
Emily and Ben",5,2023,05,16
113,A treasured memory at a very special place,"I have recently celebrated a milestone birthday at the Kensington Hotel with my Family and friends. I chose the hotel based on the reviews I had read, in particular regarding how family friendly it was, so my expectation  bar was already set at a high level.  Oh my goodness, how my expectations were exceeded! From the moment we arrived, until the end of our stay, the warmth and hospitality of every member of the Kensington Team we came into contact with was truly exceptional. We were all made to feel so welcome and special and it is a memory we will treasure for ever. ",5,2023,05,15
113,Excellent Spring Break Here with Our Family,"After the retirement protests in Paris consolidated our trip from 5 days in London and 5 days in Paris to 10 days in London, we were lucky enough to spend it in the Kensington. The staff here was outstanding at making our boys (6 and 8) feel at home, especially with the brilliant easter egg scavenger hunt they scheduled. Highly recommend the hotel and the team for an extended stay with your family.",5,2023,05,15
113,A wonderful welcome,"We visited here today for an afternoon tea. The booking process was simple, I booked online and recieved an email to confirm. Any emails I sent were responded to promptly and were always helpful. We arrived and received a really friendly welcome, something which seems rare in London hotels these days. The interior was absolutely stunning, I was in awe! The seating was a little closer together but we managed and it wasn't overly busy. I was more worried about knocking the things off the table. Our waitor (apologies I didn't get his name) was incredibly helpful and charming. The only thing I wasn't sure about was the menu of the afternoon tea we were receiving. I don't recall booking an 'Around the world' afternoon tea, and I wouldn't have chosen an Indian themed one as we don't particularly eat Indian food. Thankfully it was all fine and we ate it all and enjoyed it! I liked that we were offered tea to takeaway in addition to what we had in the afternoon tea, a very kind gesture. The other small issue was I did have a voucher and despite this being worth ¬£100 I was still expected to cover the rest of the bill. I'm unsure what afternoon tea would cost more than this for two people, especially one I didn't choose to have. But we enjoyed it all the same. ",5,2023,05,13
113,The perfect London base,"This is a really welcoming and comfortable tradition London hotel in an excellent location. Public areas are really nicely done and it‚Äôs a great place to relax. The breakfast menu is excellent with a great range of options alongside the continental breakfast. (I had eggs Benedict and it was perfectly cooked and presented). Staff are so friendly and courteous, they seem really happy to be there and I cannot fault them.",5,2023,05,11
113,Gold Standard Staff,"Stayed here for five nights with my husband and 16 month old. We have never experienced such genuine hospitality and kindness from hotel staff. Every single person who worked at the hotel was so kind and helpful. 

Special shout out to Maryam for setting up the baby crib and preparing such a special welcome package for my daughters first time in London. The details and extra effort really went a long way. 

Ray helped us get settled in the room and walked us through all the important details. He remembered my name throughout my entire stay. So impressive! 

Harvey was so helpful and kind. My husband was taking care of our daughter solo while I was at work during the day and Harvey always made himself available to be an extra set of hands for him which was always so appreciated. 

We would absolutely come back to the Kensington next time we visit London. The kindest souls can be found here. Bravo!",5,2023,05,08
113,An amazing hotel,"An amazing hotel, super nice and gentle staff and a beautiful place. We‚Äôll surely come back again. They helped us with arranging everything etc. Food excellent and once again the staff was very friendly, helpful and nice.",5,2023,05,08
113,The Best Stay In London,"Emiliano and his concierge team were incredible. They arranged travel from Gatwick to the hotel with a car seat for our 6 month old son as well as a nail appointment for my partner after she was chatting to one of the front of house staff about not knowing where to go and when we came back later that day Pavel had found multiple locations in walking distance with appointments available for that evening. We were blown away! 

.From the moment we arrived all the staff were personal, friendly and so professional. The kitchen steamed veggies so we didn‚Äôt have to interrupt the weening process on holiday. Food from both the restaurant and bar was lovely and reasonable priced for the quality. The House Keeping team, the waiting & bar staff are so knowledgable and Salvatore in the K Bar made some amazing cocktails. Every member of the team greeted our 6 month old baby with the biggest smile and it was clear that our comfort was their main priority. We‚Äôd like to also say that the door staff and Mario in particular were some of the loveliest people we have met. 

The hotel itself is clean and truly gorgeous but the staff here are what you will come back for.  We will certainly be back. ",5,2023,05,06
113,Drinks with friend,"Me and my friend just went in to have drinks at the hotel and so I cannot comment on the quality of the rooms.

However I can say that our drinks were lovely, made promptly, and we enjoyed them sitting in their well decorated seating area. 

The staff there were all very friendly, one of the staff members called Gurcan was particularly helpful and enjoyable to be around, he was very open and easy to talk to.

Overall the small visit was enjoyable and I‚Äôd suggest other people to visit too.",5,2023,05,01
113,Wonderful hotel!,"What a great hotel!   It‚Äôs in a great location, 5 minute walk from the  underground station, where 3 train lines are available. We had a slight problem with our room when we first arrived, but Dario Pani was accommodating in rectifying our issue.  Our room was spacious, bed comfortable and shower stall wonderful.  The staff was friendly and very helpful.  The concierge, Emiliano, gave us a list of suggested restaurants.   We made reservations and ate in 5 of these over the 8 nights of our stay.   His suggestions were right on, the food was delicious!   We would highly recommend this hotel and my husband and I would stay here again during our next visit to London!  ",5,2023,04,30
113,Exceptional hotel,"An exceptional hotel, great location and really well-appointed.
Staff were excellent with the most amazing General.Manager a hotel could hope to have!!John McLean is the GM there who apparently is new to the hotel, but runs the hotel like he has been there for year's and so thoughtful. Our Little boy mentioned he loved Lego and when we git back from our day out, a present was delivered which was a lego set!! It made his stay!
All staff just so lovely including the guys at concierge who were all so helpful. Harvey was lovely and couldn't do enough. Araman was super helpful and Silviu the doorman was very helpful and patient with our 4yr old son.",5,2023,04,30

We will visit again soon. ",5,2023,04,26
113,Highly recommend ,"I just had an amazing stay at The Kensington hotel. I‚Äôve never had such an amazing experience with hotel staff. When I landed in the morning I called the hotel to ask if they can accommodate an early check in since I was tired. An hour later as I arrived at the hotel, Dario and Maryam had a room ready me. That was how my entire stay was. I ran the London marathon, and the staff sent me some sports drinks, snacks and a good luck card tue night before. I then ended up fracturing my ankle at the marathon and the staff cared for me like I was their own child. I truly felt at home and with family all weekend. I was blown away. ",5,2023,04,24

Close to wonderful shops, restaurants and only a block from a tube stop.  The staff are wonderful.  Everyone greeted us warmly by name each time we came or went from the property.   They are always friendly and ready to help.  The hotel is quiet, the rooms are comfortable and the food and drink are excellent.  Highly recommended.",5,2023,04,19
113,Amazing- 5 Star experience,"I have stayed at The Kensington many times over the past 10 years, and I can genuinely say it gets better every time.  The warm and friendly welcome when you arrive sets the tone for the entire stay.
All the staff  are very efficient and attentive without being intrusive.  
The rooms are really comfortable, and the beds and linen guarantee a great nights sleep.  It is obvious that a great detail of attention is given to maintaining the standard of  accommodation and housekeeping.   The turn down service in the evening is a real treat after a long day.
Tom from Guest Relations goes above and beyond all expectations and his efforts and attentive nature make every guest feel like they are the most important guest in the hotel.
Breakfast is a feast with a fantastic selection to choose from the menu. Lauren and Petronella were great hosts in the morning and it is obvious that they take great pride in their work.
I could easily spend the entire day reading the paper and drinking coffee downstairs.  It is so comfortable and relaxing you feel like you are at home.
I cannot praise the staff enough and unfortunately; I cannot remember all the names of the lovely people who made my stay so enjoyable but thank you all and please know that us guests really appreciate your hard work and how well you look after us.
I highly recommend The Kensington to anyone considering a trip to London whether for work or pleasure.  
Warmest wishes to all at The Kensington

113,Best hotel in Kensington,"We had afternoon tea at The Kensington, the experience was amazing, the tea around the world is absolutely tasty and the entire service is superb, and we interacted every day with the doorman Silviu because we stayed around the corner and he was always so kind providing us access to taxis and references on places to visit. He was so attentive and polite. The hotel is very well located in the charming area of Kensington in London with easy access to all typical attractions in the City. ",5,2023,04,17

113,Home Away from Home ,"The Kensington Hotel is our favorite hotel in London. We've stayed here many times over the years and always enjoy our experience. The staff is very friendly and the bar/restaurant is excellent! The rooms are clean and comfortable, and if you're staying for an extended period of time it's worth it to upgrade to a deluxe room for additional space. Our kids love that the hotel is within walking distance to great museums including The V&A, Natural History Museum, and the Science Museum. The hotel is in the heart of South Kensington and there are plenty of pubs and restaurants nearby (including Byron Burger which our son loves!) You can also easily walk to Hyde Park if it's a sunny day. My daughter brought her roller skates on the trip and enjoyed skating in the park. We were very happy with our decision to stay here!",5,2023,04,17

Mario was very welcoming and helpful with directions.  Arran rang ahead to our restaurant that we‚Äôd booked that evening to ensure we were looked after, and we were.  We were upgraded to a wonderful studio suite and Sophia arranged for complimentary birthday cake and wine for my husband‚Äôs birthday.  We met our family in the hotel bar and sampled fabulous cocktails.  All made very welcome.  Our room was so comfortable and we had the best night‚Äôs sleep in the comfiest bed.  Breakfast was very good and again a relaxing, unhurried experience. The location of the hotel is excellent.  We were only there for 1 night but we felt the whole experience made us so relaxed and pampered.  Very rejuvenating!  We have stayed at the River Lee hotel in Cork and The Kensington certainly lived up to this group‚Äôs great reputation.  Thank you so much and we are booking again to return in June for 2 nights.  Can‚Äôt wait.",5,2023,04,17
113,Best time ever !!,"I recently received a wonderful gift from my sister for my 60th birthday of a 3 night  stay in the Kengston hotel. From arrival we were treated as VIPs. The hotel service was excellent,food A* and the staff were attentive to all our needs. Especially Tom and Harvey who went beyond by giving me a very special birthday celebration which I will never forget. I hope that the the GM takes note of his amazing staff from front of house, waiters bar staff, concessour and especially Harvey who for me is an asset to the Kensington and Doyle company. I will return to London as a result of my stay at this wonderful establishment  and it's relaxing and welcoming vib. A*****",5,2023,04,16
113,The Kensington - A Must Visit!!,"We stayed at the Kensington for three nights (2 consecutive nights then one after a trip to Paris). Prior to arrival, I received an email from the hotel asking about our visit, our interests and the things my children enjoyed. I thought it was a nice touch but didn‚Äôt expect much beyond that.  When we arrived, our room had two video game books and a Suduko book for my boys. They also added a large chocolate egg and more chocolates for them.  My boys were so excited!  Ali at reception was responsible for obtaining all these goodies and genuinely appeared happy to have done it.  Harvey helped us with our luggage and immediately made a friend with my younger son by offering him a hot chocolate which he delivered while we waited.  The room was beautifully appointed, comfortable, clean and the right size for us.  Whenever we left the hotel or returned, we were offered assistance or a warm welcome while addressing us by our names. We ate at the breakfast buffet, indulged at the bar (the Hungarian bartender and the Italian waiter were both very friendly and attentive).. Each time we saw Harvey, he greeted us with a huge smile, asked us about our whereabouts, offered input if asked and even bought our family four delicious cupcakes that he sneakily put in our room.  You can‚Äôt teach someone that level of unsolicited customer service.   He is a rare find and will remain in our family‚Äôs memories as one of the best parts of our trip.  As someone who has traveled extensively through Europe, Asia and North America, it is quite uncommon to find such consistency and polish that the Kensington offers. It certainly isn‚Äôt the least expensive hotel but to have the experience we did, I‚Äôd pay what we did and more.  We will certainly be back and will likely try the other locations after this experience!!",5,2023,04,15

113,A true 5-star experience,"Absolutely perfect!  We spent 6 nights at The Kensington Hotel with our family of 4 (two boys 8 and 10) for a spring break holiday. 

The staff is exceptional, the service is thoughtful, warm, and you don‚Äôt have to ask for anything twice. Thoughtful measures that you don‚Äôt find often in hotels anymore.  

The rooms are spacious, impeccably clean and very updated. The location of the hotel makes it easy to get anywhere around the city. 

To Tom and the entire staff of The Kensington, thank you for a memorable experience.  We can‚Äôt wait to come back!",5,2023,04,14
113,Afternoon Tea at The Kensington Hotel,"Had a wonderful afternoon tea with my daughter on our trip to London. The theme was Around the World in 80 days.

113,Simply lovely and can‚Äôt wait to return!,"Absolutely lovely from start to finish.  The location is perfect, the space and decor is beautiful, and the staff is just lovely.  The decor is very ornate and rich, but doesn‚Äôt feel stuffy or old fashioned.  Everything feels fresh and the common areas have a lovely fragrance.  The bed was super comfortable, the amenities were great, and I really enjoyed the breakfast.",5,2023,04,12
113,Breath taking...,"To whom it may concern

I would like to take this opportunity to share with you my experience of my brief stay (one day) at the Kensington to celebrate my birthday

Firstly, on arrival, I was taken aback by the warm and welcoming greeting granted to my daughter and I, from the doormen to the ladies on reception, the young man who showed us to our room, and at dinner from our waiter who handled our meal so professionally with a smile on his face.

Your staff are amazing‚Ä¶

I so need to give a personal mention to your ‚ÄòGuest Experience Agent‚Äô Mr. Thomas Keating! Wow! I can only imagine, what a tough job it must be at times to keep your guests happy, but it never showed in his face‚Ä¶ Mr. Keating handled our stay with such tenderness and empathy taking our experience at the Kensington to whole new level that we had not anticipated. 

My daughter Chloe and I have not stopped smiling or talking about our experience with you, and telling our friends and family how they should try it out for themselves.

@ Tom, I saw what you did to make my stay/birthday, a pleasurable one and I truly thank you for everything that you did. I left the Kensington with a full heart. 

You have set a precedent‚Ä¶

Until we meet again, take very good care of yourself.

113,"Perfection, Excellence, and Welcoming ","Our family  just returned from the most lovely spring break holiday.  We booked The Kensington on part of the wonderful feedback we read on TripAdvisor and let me tell you it did not disappoint.  Emiliano greeted us upon our arrival and honestly everything just went seamless from there.  His kindness and expertise helped make our time in London even better then we planned.  Every member of the staff is friendly, helpful, and kind.  This hotel is absolutely exquisite.  The rooms are clean and comfortable, the decor and attention to detail is gorgeous.  Our breakfasts were delicious, and the afternoon tea was unique and exceptional.  We love to walk and the location was perfect to do so as well as catch any other transportation.  We fell in love with London during our time there and look forward to returning to The Kensington again!",5,2023,04,11

From the comfort of the hotel, the great food and dining services, and the exceptional service by the Kensington team, my stay at the hotel exceeded expectations. It was my second time returning to the hotel, and the experience was great again. Special thank you for Emiliano at the concierge for all the attention and help. ",5,2023,04,09

113,Amazing afternoon tea,"We had an amazing afternoon tea. It was unique and a new twist. Rather than just sandwiches and scones, we had all kinds of pastries and tarts and other savoury things from different parts of the world. The service was outstanding. Abdul and his team had such attention to detail and were so attentive. The only thing I'd ask for would be a Christmas-themed afternoon tea so we could come back with the whole family!",5,2023,04,03
113,Afternoon Tea - Excellent Experience,"So we visited yesterday for the wife's birthday. The service was impeccable and the surroundings were very plush and had a nice drawing room vibe. 

The service by all of the staff was second to none. I would like to particularly thank Abdul and Levento for their attention and care. Nothing was too much trouble despite two younger kids. 

The food was delicious and was a great homage to around the world flavours. We are already looking forward to going back. ",5,2023,04,02
113,A lovely place to dine ,"This is a place to go on a special
 occasion, it‚Äôs not cheap but the ambiance is great and the food is lovely. We had a great waiter called Abdul who was very enthusiastic about what we were eating and keen to please! ",5,2023,04,01
113,NEVER AGAIN,"This is not the first time we been at the Kensington, on our previous visit we only enjoyed the restaurant and afternoon tea, the level was so satisfying that we decide to take a room this time for our regular visit in London.
As soon we arrived we were welcome by Armand, his help during our stay was really important to us, he was able to make us comfortable instantly.
My wife booked a superior room that was located at the first floor, the room unfortunately didn‚Äôt reflect our expectations.
Really tiny toilette, very old decor.
The light into wardrobe were truly annoying during the night, we tried to close it but the lock wasn‚Äôt working!
During night we could hear music very loudly, we tried to reach the reception, the answer was that the music was coming from a ‚Äú CLUB‚Äù and they could not stop it!!
Unbelievable, nothing was offered to compensate the 
The morning after we were expecting someone from the management to come and apologies for what happen, but no one came to us.
It‚Äôs really a shame!
I personally approached the receptionist and ask to speak with the GM, the answer was that at the moment the hotel was without GM.
We had afternoon tea as well, as London tradition for us, this time the menu was inconsistent, flavourless and very badly presented.
On our previous visit, we notice that there were plenty of managers taking care of the guest, the explanation of the dishes was interesting and instructive, passionate and delivered with true smile.
This time, the service was awful, they forgot my wife birthday, truly not worst the price, we been waiting more than 25 minutes for the bill.

It‚Äôs really a shame to see how an establishment that in August was truly a little gem, became so  poor in delivering any kind of hotel experience in short period of time, a part for the concierge.
The hotel has 5 star, honestly more close to 3 than 5 at the moment!
They should reconsider the old management, because the new one, if there is one, is just putting down what was perfectly satisfying less that 8 month ago!
Never again!",2,2023,04,01
113,"Warm and friendly staff, stunning room.","Absolutely beautiful and spotlessly decorated room, warm and friendly staff and a lovely relaxed atmosphere. The staff couldn‚Äôt do enough to make sure we had everything we needed. The historic building is stunning. The cream tea was delicious, as was the breakfast. As we left, two log fires were burning and I really could have stayed all day. A perfect night away for busy parents. ",5,2023,03,30
113,"Birthday stay at The Kensington Hotel, London","Stayed for 2 nights for my birthday at The Kensington Hotel in London.    I was made to feel very special.   The hotel is beautiful and feels very comfortable, calm and welcoming.   The furnishings and decor are very tasteful.  Our room was lovely, large and comfortable with a gorgeous bathroom.   We had a terrace which was a real bonus as the weather was nice enough to sit outside on my actual birthday.   Coffee machine, kettle and mini bar in room.   All the staff were exceptional.  Very friendly, welcoming, informative and helpful.   Very easy to get around as only a few minutes walk to South Kensington station and many museums and Kensington Park.   Breakfast was very relaxed and efficiently served.  Would definitely recommend a stay there and can't wait to go and stay there ourselves again.",5,2023,03,29
113,Dated small rooms,"Stayed here a few years ago and it was perfect. This time not so perfect. As part of our Luxury Escapes package we were able to have an upgrade. The upgraded room although a king size was old, and depressing  at the back of the hotel. We opted to go back to the queen room which was a slight improvement in regards to being a little more modern but so small, you could barely fit your luggage. The bathroom was ridiculously small. It was very expensive for the room size, and we were overcharged by Luxury Escapes, who wouldn‚Äôt honour the price difference. Hotel location is fantastic and the room was clean. Breakfast was fine, with lots of options. Wouldn‚Äôt stay here again for the price, considering the dated small room. ",3,2023,03,28
113,Great Service,"I had great lunch yesterday at The Kensington Hotel. Abdul helped me decide which food to order and the service overall was amazing. The Ceasar salad was really big and tasty which is great, as I was really hungry. Definitely, I will be back. Thank you Abdul for a lovely experience. ",5,2023,03,28

113,A great stay - such wonderful service and ambience.,"I came down to join my husband at The  Kensington, he had been staying there for a few weeks with work, He was so impressed he wanted me to stay a few days - which turned into a week! 
It is such a charming boutique hotel with first class welcoming service  and it is this that particularly  makes it stand out. 
The general ambience is gorgeous, and the decor classic but light and welcoming. It is also extremely clean and efficiently run, and the beds are gloriously comfortable. The rooms are kept spotlessly  clean by a non intrusive room staff. 
We didn't have dinner there but an excellent breakfast menu offered both continental and cooked types, again with with helpful smiling staff ready for specific requirements. 
It is also very central and within easy tube distance to West end theatre and  Knightsbridge shopping.  It is  within  minutes from the big London museums and V&A. The door or desk staff will call you a taxi to arrive promptly. 
I want to give a personal shout out to Harvey who was always ready to go the extra mile to help or advise with a big smile.

113,Unforgettable Honeymoon Stay!,"My husband and I spent 6 weeks traveling all around Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and England for our honeymoon, and our very last stop was at London. We had made arrangements with a travel agency to book all of our hotels for us, and they had recommended The Kensington in London as a ""last hurrah"" for our trip.  And no wonder!! From the moment we checked in, we were treated like royalty and warmly greeted by name by every staff member. Tom Keating escorted us to our room, and explained that they had been talking about our arrival for weeks. In fact, they had upgraded our room to one of the best rooms they have -- and it was beautiful!! We were delightfully surprised by a gorgeous bouquet of flowers on the table, a delicious bowl of fresh fruit, and a lovely little card addressed to us both. There was also a cold bottle of champagne, but when we explained apologetically that we don't drink alcohol, the team went out of their way to craft some delicious mocktails for us instead! There were also cold bottled drinks for us, and Tom repeatedly asked us to please let them know if there was anything else at all that we needed.  The team greeted us by name on our way in and out of the hotel, and made us feel so special and welcomed. I really can't recommend this place enough! They made our last hotel stay of our honeymoon an unforgettable delight!",5,2023,03,25
113,Wonderful experience,The Kensington was an amazing experience. Perfect location and beautiful place! A total hidden gem in plain sight. The service was excellent! Thank you to Harvey for being so accommodating and friendly! Definitely recommend the negroni,5,2023,03,25

113,A perfect luxury London hotel,"You know what you are getting with The Doyle Collection of hotels, pure class and outstanding service. 

The team at the Kensington are all fantastic, and really go the extra mile to make every guest feel special and welcomed.

I‚Äôve stayed in the Westbury in Dublin a lot over the years and for me, the Kensington is the London equivalent, an iconic hotel that makes you feel exactly how you‚Äôd want to feel when staying in a quintessential part of London.",5,2023,03,24
113,Drinks,"I went to drink to meet a previous colleague working there Adrian (Great colleague) was o. Holiday.  I mee5 the bar guy Jonathan was exceptional.  The highlight was the doorman I think his name was Harvey his approachability and hospitality was by far the special note of the night

113,A Hidden Gem with an amazing staff,"While booking our first trip to London, we were looking for something very nice that we would remember for a long time. we cancelled a recommendation made by our travel agent. and after quite a bit of research , we found the Kensington.  We booked a king room with breakfast included which I am glad we did. When we arrived , we were greeted by Harvey who was very friendly and helpful getting us into the Hotel.  I believe Alex helped us at the front desk.  The hotel is very beautiful and elegant. After checking in we came down stairs and once again the friendliness and professionalism was great.  The different gentlemen working the concierge desk were all very helpful. We went by their desk daily for advice and directions to places we wanted to see. We stayed 7 nights.  The second morning we met Mario who was the doorman.  This man is a First Class Gentleman that made our stay truly exceptional. He had a great personality and greeted us every morning asking where we were headed. He gave us so much information and details daily that made this our best vacation.  He is very knowledgeable about London and all those special hidden places and the must do's like the Burrough and Portabello Markets.  I can't say enough about what a great asset to the Kensington Mario is.  I don't want to leave out everyone else but I'm sorry to say that I don't remember everyone's name.  Javid at the consierge desk made us a great dinner reservation at Gaucho which was excellent.  I don't want to leave out any of the restaurant and morning breakfast staff that were all very attentive and professional.  The breakfast addition when booking the room was a great choice.  Great food in an elegant setting.  The team at the Kensington is a great team, it's all about the guests. Great Job to the staff at this hidden gem.   ",5,2023,03,23
113,"AMAZING HOTEL, FANTASTIC PEOPLE, HOSPITALITY ON THE HIGHEST LEVEL!","From the moment we walked through the door until the last moments our stay at The Kensington Hotel we knew we are in 5 star hotel. We were welcomed by Alex Hotel Manager with a warm and very friendly approach. Check in process was very smooth, efficient and quick by Boyan at the reception. We were escorted to the room by Ali and everything was explained to us on the way to the room. Once we entered our incredible rooms we could not believe. All welcome amenities, hand made cards, all sweets, cold champagne, welcome gifts for our daughters everything was so nicely prepared. Hotel Manager took an effort to hand write welcome card in our language which is not the easiest task, amazing touch. Our younger daughter was spoiled with her own teepee bed and she was over the moon with that. Our older daughter interconnecting room was with a massive bath tub and together with luxury bath cosmetics was  such a experience. She was over the moon as well. Our luggage was delivered by Lucian Concierge who was full of energy really engaging and smiling through all times. The beds were really comfortable really up to our liking. Once we came back from our dinner we were welcomed on the corridor by smiling Carlos from housekeeping who prepare our rooms for a night turndown. Such a nice touch. Next day we started with a breakfast. We were professionally met by Barbara who was smiling all the way through our meal. Worth mentioning are Ronald and Andrea who took care of us during breakfast and take time to talk to us showing their interest in our plans for the day. The buffet at the bar was so much choice. The pastries were so tasty. I personally loved my full English breakfast, eggs were perfectly pouched as I have expected. Our daughters were spoiled with pancakes and got to say thank you personally to the Chef Gabi.
Once we were leaving Concierge Arman and Emiliano made sure we took everything and safely sat in a car.
I am sure we will be back as soon as we can to The Kensington Hotel.
Highly recommended to all.",5,2023,03,21
113,Great locations | Rooms can be small | close to the gardens ,"Good for business, the rooms can be super small and the service is a little slow as when I stayed they seemed under staffed. Make sure you ask for a larger room on one of the top floors...!! Great location in Kensington, a short walk to the gardens | high street and Knights Bridge (25 mins) ",3,2023,03,20
113,The best hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed in,"With no hyperbole, this hotel is the greatest I‚Äôve ever stayed in. The kindness, community, and vibe of everyone working there is divine. The food and drink is perfection, the rooms are pristine, best everything I‚Äôve experienced. Emiliano, Marilyn, the entire staff, you‚Äôre all doing an incredible job. No stuffiness, no sanctimonious Posh behavior even though the place is of the HIGHEST quality, there is nothing but a formal yet tight embrace between the guests and the staff. Don‚Äôt even get me started on the atmosphere closer to a Renaissance painting than a hotel. Wow. Just wow. The only criticism I have is that they need to hand out more of their delightful sugar cookies with each cup of tea. 2 or 3 is not enough. You‚Äôll want 20 with each sip. Don‚Äôt go anywhere else but this hotel. It is the real thing.",5,2023,03,09
113,Well meaning and kind but a lack of attention to detail,"We had a comfortable stay at The Kensington for 1 night. It was a birthday celebration and the family were staying in the museum district for the weekend. Before arriving I had arranged for a birthday cake to be provided in the room for arrival. This was done with additional champagne, balloons, cookies etc - all complimentary - was such a treat and the children loved it.

Unfortunately, we were put in the wrong room. Having confirmed a Junior Suite with four-poster, we were given a Family Room. This was fine, but it doesn't have a bath, which makes it difficult to wash toddlers and is smaller in size so we were snug. The children were promised teepees to sleep in and gift bags. Instead they received cot beds with roll bars and my son's gift bag was missing a present. 

At the end of a long day we didn't have the energy to change rooms so we stayed where we were. But for the price of a night's stay at The Kensington, I did expect to be provided with what was confirmed. The children had seen pictures of the teepees online and were disappointed with their beds. At the end of the day, the room was a standard hotel room, not the 'little camping' experience with the deep marble baths that would have topped off our birthday celebrations.

My advice is to double-check everything at every stage with the hotel and phone in advance to confirm before you arrive. If I had done so I'm sure we would have had an amazing stay.",2,2023,03,06
113,Incredible Hotel and Staff,"My family of 4 (2 kids ages 3 and 1) stayed at the hotel for 5 days. We received an email early on asking about our Childrens likes and dislikes for during our stay. 
Upon arrival, the staff were EXTREMELY kind and welcoming, even if my children who were a little tired and cranky from the flight.
Their willingness to help us with recommendations, room service, taxis, our children was amazing. They left us a ton of gifts for the kids, including painting, teddy bears, books, and more. Thank you Tom for taking care of our children and thank you especially to Gurcan! He was exceptional and extremely caring and helpful. All in all, we will be visiting again for sure.",5,2023,03,05

113,Wonderful hotel and staff,"What an amazing hotel experience. The staff are all very friendly and the manager Tom Keating and Almire at guest services stand out in particular (but all the staff there are lovely). They really do everything they can (above and beyond) to make your stay (however brief) spectacular.

113,A luxurious hotel that caters for all generations ü´∂üèª,"We were greeted with the most warm and wholehearted Irish welcome on arrival. Tom, Sophie, Ali and team made us feel so relaxed and at home straight away with a guided tour of this beautifully designed hotel to the comfort of our luxurious bedroom. 
An email prior to our arrival where the team asked about the children‚Äôs personalities opened so many delightful surprises for them, that we were lost for words many times with the thoughtfulness, kindness, fun and creative gifts the team carefully laid out for the children over our stay. My sons were blown away firstly that the hotel knew what football team they supported when they provided a team bed set and mug. I had mentioned they enjoyed art in their spare time and to their delight they came back to the room to see art materials- easels, paint trays, brushes and paints set up. My youngest loves teddies so much he drew the Kensington teddy present with his new paints straight away!
Tom is fondly adored as a hero for personally having sourced ‚ÄúPRIME‚Äù drinks for the visit. These drinks which are the latest craze are not available in ireland and only supplied in various locations in London/UK. We needed to source these on this break so you can imagine how blown away the children were to receive and how thankful as a parent I was that I didn‚Äôt have to individually contact and call to these stores. 
Children‚Äôs Books, chocolates, fruit, fresh flowers, personal card and email messages, greetings, smiles, and personal touches on top of what is a truly remarkable hotel in design and high end food has made this holiday the most precious trip for all ages! Thank you so much X",5,2023,02,19
113,Pre Valentines Drinks at the K Bar,"I'm delighted to have the opportunity to write a review for K bar and Adrian, the server who provided exceptional service during our visit. We had an enjoyable evening out.

K bar is a fantastic venue with a welcoming and cozy atmosphere, and the great selection of drinks really sets it apart. The drinks are expertly crafted, and the overall experience is enhanced by the friendly and attentive service of the staff. And Adrian was particularly outstanding during our visit, with his personable and attentive service really standing out.

Adrian's exceptional service truly helped to elevate our Valentines day evening, he was able to provide knowledgeable recommendations on drinks, and his friendly and engaging manner really helped to create a welcoming and enjoyable atmosphere.

Overall, I would highly recommend K bar and Adrian for anyone looking for a memorable night out. The combination of excellent drinks and exceptional service is hard to beat, and it's clear that K bar and Adrian are committed to providing their guests with an unforgettable experience.",5,2023,02,18
113,Top Notch in Every Way!,"Recently my colleagues and I stayed at The Kensington Hotel for 2 nights. The service and staff are simply the best. Thomas and the hotel made sure my friend had a room set up for her birthday with flowers, balloons, a cake and cards! It made for a wonderful entrance and start of her birthday. This was my second stay at The Kensington Hotel and I already feel at home there. I will be back whenever I travel to London.",5,2023,02,11
113,Top service with the human touch!,"A really nice hotel where the staff are its biggest asset. We were always met with a smile, they went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable, they were helpful and efficient, and they all seemed to know us! Liked the ambience of the hotel, traditional, comfortable lounges, bar and rooms. An excellent experience all round - and they upgraded us as we were celebrating a special occasion.",5,2023,02,01
113,Perfect base for a London weekend,"We have just got back from a weekend at The Kensington.  We were a group of 4 work colleagues (in the hospitality business ourselves) 2 of whom have young children and we were enjoying some 'family time"" in London and going to the museums, Albert Hall etc.

The Kensington was the perfect base for us all where everyone could relax.  Chic enough for adults to enjoy with good cocktails, a menu that kept everyone happy but the atmosphere also has an ease about it so nothing was too stuffy and formal - and the staff were charming with the children.

Perfect!

My only feedback for the hotel to check up on was that the housekeeping team seemed to turn the heat in the bedrooms to 29 degrees when they were doing turn down - which meant that on the first night the room was far too hot.  I don't think you can assume that everyone wants a room at that temperature",5,2023,01,30
113,Best in class hotel,"The Kensington hotel always shows attention and care! Make your stay memorable and with a hi degree of comfort. The service from all in the team is excellent. The hotel has a great character, the public areas as bar and restaurant are great. ",5,2023,01,19
113,A Gem of Hotel,"I am from London and until recently wouldn‚Äôt know what to say when someone asked for a hotel recommendation. The Kensington really is the perfect stay when in London. The location is amazing, it is so central and in such a beautiful area and yet is still quiet and peaceful. The style of the hotel is so beautifully designed, authentically English, in perfect condition and very high end. The food is fantastic and the service is superb. The staff are so kind and friendly and will do anything to help. We came just after getting engaged and the team upgraded our room to a suite which was honestly breathtaking. A great touch they had which a haven‚Äôt seen elsewhere in london is they had additional glass insulation on the windows so you couldn‚Äôt hear a thing from the street outside and the result was an incredibly peaceful stay and fantastic nights sleep. Can‚Äôt recommend this place enough and very excited to stay again.",5,2023,01,11
113,Best hotel stay we‚Äôve ever had,"The Kensington Hotel is hands down the best hotel in London. From the service to the food to the rooms‚Ä¶ it is all exceptional. Ali and Thomas made the stay even better with their incredible service. My fianc√© and I stayed for our engagement celebration (we actually met for the first time at the hotel bar 5 years ago), and it went better than we could have ever asked for. The staff made us feel like family and the location was unmatched! Make sure not to miss breakfast every morning - the truffle scrambled eggs were amazing. So was the buffet. 
We will be staying at The Kensington every time we are in London. Thank you to everyone on the team for making this such a memorable stay. 
Mimi and Ben xoxo",5,2023,01,11
113,The Kensington London.,The hotel was in a perfect location with walking distance to the tube and great restaurants including a pup and French bakery .Tom and Miriam were so hospitable serving us a bottle of champagne and delicious Uk cheese after hearing of our train workers strike fiasco.I would most definitely stay here on my next visit to UK.The gym included in our stay was by far the best gym I‚Äôve seen in any hotel and all the staff were helpful and friendly.,5,2023,01,10
113,Excellent choice for home away from home,"Excellent staff who are attentive, friendly, and knowledgable. Breakfast setting is beautiful with excellent food offerings, particularly appreciated the couple specialty juices and delicious avocado toast option. The hotel rooms are historic, but nicely appointed with on trend, modern amenities and items you want. I'm picky about water pressure, especially with older hotels, and found their shower pressure and temp the best I've found in a hotel in a long while. My teenagers were able to stay in two twin room right next door, and easily found their way around. We were able to grab a black cab within only a minute from the hotel when we needed it. The neighborhood around this hotel offered numerous delicious restaurants, little places for dessert and very short walk to tube station with another pocket of excellent shops & eateries. Extremely short walk to Victoria & Albert Museum or National History Museum - both free and endless features to roam. ",5,2023,01,09
113,Fantastic family of 4 stay at the Kensington,"Fantastic stay for our family of four from 12/27 to 1/6.  Friendly staff. Beautiful hotel.  Comfortable room.  Excellent food and drink.  Concierge made great recommendations and reservations.  They were key to a great visit to London.  Very well located away from the craziness of SoHo and Covent Garden.  Also, you think you want to be close to those places.  But the positive reality is that it‚Äôs very easy to get around the city (walk, tube, cab, ride share) and being away from the hot spots at day‚Äôs end is the enjoyable, surprise blessing that you‚Äôll appreciate if traveling with kids.  Highly recommend.  Will stay again!",5,2023,01,06
113,Twixmas Break,"This hotel was a regular for us many years ago. It‚Äôs a great location to museums, shops and central London. We found the hotel has now been extensively refurbished and it is a delight. We had really lovely 2 night break. Staff were friendly and attentive. A special thanks to Tom Keating for the note and welcome dropped into our room. We subsequently heard from one of your colleagues that you are a co Waterford man ( my roots are Dungarvan) Thanks Tom",5,2023,01,01
113,Excellent customer service,My family and I stayed at The Kensington in December. We enjoyed the most  exceptional and friendly customer service in particular by the front of house team. We would happily recommend this hotel to others. ,5,2023,01,01
113,Family trip to London,"This is our favourite hotel, the restaurant the bar, the lounge are all pleasant comfortable places to eat, drink and relax. The rooms are comfortable and well appointed, and if you are lucky have lovey views over Kensington. 
What makes the hotel special is the staff, it always feels like returning to family or close friends, nothing is too much and they remember your name which makes it more personal 
We have stayed many times and will keep coming back",5,2023,01,01
113,Fantastic stay,"We absolutely adored this hotel and its staff. From the moment you set foot on the beautifully decorated steps, you are made to feel welcome and well cared for. The concierge staff‚ÄîViktors and Emiliano‚Äîmade reservations for us and gave wonderful recommendations. Every staff member was friendly and helpful. We arrived on Christmas Eve and found mini-Christmas trees in our room for the kids to decorate, letters from Santa and treats. Santa also greeted them Christmas Day in the lobby and provided a little present. Christmas lunch was amazing and they made my son special selections to accommodate his food allergies. The family room we had was beautifully decorated. Stay here! You won‚Äôt regret it.",5,2023,01,01
113,The Townhouse: excellent service & cuisine,"A beautiful, British, luxurious hotel in the heart of Kensington. Within the hotel is a fabulous restaurant. The Townhouse is of a very high standard both in service & cuisine. There's a cosy cocktail bar adjacent with excellent mixologists. The decor is understated yet superb. All the staff are friendly and extremely knowledgeable. ",5,2022,12,26
113,Had a great time,"I had a great time in the K Bar. It had a very nice interior and the drinks and the vibe are very exquisite. I loved it and I highly recommend this place,I‚Äôll surely vist again on my next trip to london. And thanks to Adrish from K Bar for making my evening nice and had a great conversation with him. 
Thank you and cheers ü•Ç",5,2022,12,22
113,Nice but ignored,"Nothing to say other than it was a super hotel, clean and very professional 

Decor was very nice and the staff were very helpful 

The only issue was arriving at the hotel in my jeans, trainers and jacket I was ignored by the  door staff who turned away from me and addressed my colleague (and opened the food for him, and took his bags) who was in his suit. I guess they thought I was the driver or workman.  I was actually quite offended.

The next day in my suit I was treated great by the door staff 

My advice is turn up in your suit!",4,2022,12,18
113,The Best of the Best - Hotel Kensington in London,"The ‚Äòbest of the best‚Äô hotel my husband and I have ever stayed at - from the beautifully furnished and comfortable rooms to the restaurants and bars, the Kensington surpassed our every expectation.  The attention to detail and going above and beyond came natural to every single employee. And Vikktors, the concierge at Kensington, was second to none in every single detail.  I can‚Äôt imagine a better experience anywhere - if you‚Äôre going to London, the Kensington should be your choice.  
My husband and I will never stay anywhere else!!! I wish there were more stars to rate this hotel; they certainly would deserve it!  ",5,2022,12,18
113,The Kensington üëå,"I have been to several 5 star hotels and The Kensington is on another level. Nowhere has a patch in this place. Staff honestly could not do enough for us. My partner and I were celebrating our anniversary/ birthday and at every turn we were being showered with complimentary champagne and desserts. The bar staff Salvatore, Jonathan and Arbit provided amazing service and great craic. Tom the guest relations manager is not only a gentleman but a top professional. He greeted my teenage daughter with wonderful gifts when she joined us on our second night reducing her to tears of joy for being treated so special and decorated our room to celebrate our anniversary. The whole hotel was immaculate and the rooms were serviced twice a day. You really wanted for nothing. I will always come back to this hotel when staying in London.",5,2022,12,18
113,Best hotel in London,"We had the most wonderful stay in the Kensington for our anniversary/my fianc√©‚Äôs birthday. Staff could not have done more for us and Thomas, in particular, made it so special. I also blame Jonathan and Salvatore for our hangovers! We had our 12 year old daughter with us and she was so spoilt by the staff. 

 100% best hotel in London and we will never stay anywhere else when we visit. ",5,2022,12,18
113,Our New Home Away!,"There are places you travel to that leave an indelible mark on not only the journey but in your mind as well.  My wife and I were just here last week and while we've been fortunate to stay at many lovely accommodations, The Kensington is head and shoulders above.  From the first moment we contacted the Hotel via email we were treated as almost family, their messages we're always helpful and they followed up very timely on every question and request (we live in NY).  Our online booking was seamless, the team went out of their way to be helpful including booking dinner reservations both for the Hotel and for other recommended restaurants.  When we arrived (late due to train issues) everyone had a smile to share and were so very accommodating.  They even upgraded our room without us asking!  Our room was beautifully appointed with a king bed, large bathroom (with heated floors! - oh yeah!) and all the sundries and little extras too.  Turn down service was offered, and all our bathroom linens and supplies were refreshed and the staff was kind enough to leave extra bottles of water too.  We stopped into the main lounge and bar before dinner the first evening, a wonderfully cozy room with a polished winding bar and a great selection of beverages.  Dinner afterwards (at The Townhouse) was just spot on - served at a wonderful and friendly pace, delicious and well sized portions.  Wine list, while not expansive, certainly covered all our needs (I had the 2018 Rathfinny Ros√© Brut from East Sussex to start and Allegrini Amarone della Valpolicella Classico).  All the seating areas in the multiple lounges were very comfortably appointed.  I can see how a guest could while away a whole morning with little effort!  The Hotel is wonderfully located for walkers like my wife and I, but getting a cab or car was simple as well.  We also took tea one afternoon at the Hotel;  the theme was  ""Around the World in 80 Days""  and the food was all inspired by the cuisines from London, Paris, Rome and Cairo.  Just wonderful!  I think I may be running out of space to write, so let me end it with this, next time we travel to London, every time we travel to London, The Kensington will be our home away.  Thank you for all you did to make our stay brilliant!  ",5,2022,12,13
113,Amazing birthday experience!,We have just arrived home from an amazing stay at the Kensington.

113,"Amazing stay great staff and 10/10 service, highly recommend !!","Booked a stay for the weekend to celebrate our anniversary.   The hotel was amazing great Christmas atmosphere and I have to say all the staff were exceptional (especially Alli, Tom and the bar staff), they did lots of special touches for our anniversary and really made us feel special as soon as we walked through the entrance to the moment we left.  The staff are really well trained and seem to enjoy their job.  We have stayed in many a high end hotel in London and I place the Kensington right up there with the best if not our new favourite.  So much so we are thinking of returning again for our next stay in London.  Room was very high spec.  I highly recommend a stay!",5,2022,12,11

113,We love this Hotel and staff!,"Our experience with The Kensington was absolutely delightful.  From the moment our ride dropped us off in front of the hotel our experience began.  The personal service that we had for the entire time of our stay was simply unbeatable anywhere.   As with many of the Kensington's guests, we have been to many final destination resorts and other higher end hotels in many parts of the world, although this was our first UK experience.  The friendliness of the management and every single other person on the staff, housekeeping and restaurant genuinely cared and did everything they could possibly do to make our stay wonderful.  We only wish we could've stayed longer.  If we could give The Kensington a higher rating we would give it a 10.",5,2022,11,13
113,My stay at The Kensington,"I have been coming to this charming hotel many times.
I like its discreet, cozy and super attentive staff. 
The K Bar - is old school and kind of retro. It is what a bar should be.  
But the part I think you will enjoy the most will be breakfast. The menu is amazing from continental to the full English  breakfast (baked beans included). 
Rooms are comfortable and very well kept. The location of the hotel is great, within walking distance to South-Kensington tube station, Harrods and museums. There are good restaurants nearby. Plenty of choice. But if you prefer to eat at the hotel you won‚Äôt be sorry. Try the Dover sole and the endives salad.
The staff is incredible kind. I wish I could mention them all, because from the porters, reception desk, housekeeper, restaurant and bar they were all nice and helpful. Emiliano the concierge is always ready for recommendations regarding activities, restaurants and arranging transportation. 
Enjoy The Kensington experience!",5,2022,11,05
113,"Unparalleled experience, every single time. ","The Kensington Hotel is THE place to be in London, and for me it is My place. 

I have been going there for years, and every time I feel at home.

The hotel itself is a wonderfully decorated townhouse. The service is excellent. The staff is very attentive and takes care of everything for you.

Boyan is, particularly, my very favorite person  at the Kensington. He goes above and beyond every time I ask him anything.

I am about to return for the 4th time this year, and I am looking forward to it.

To Boyan and all the wonderful people at the Kensington, thank you for making The Kensington my home in London. ",5,2022,10,28

The Kensington is a stunning property with excellent staff. The public areas are gorgeous, and the rooms are unique and lovely. I was particularly pleased with the amount of storage in our room and bathroom! Breakfast was delicious (the vegetarian full English was great), and the bartenders at the K-bar were knowledgeable and friendly (Ardit in particular was wonderful!).

The lobby staff, especially Mohammed and Lucian, were kind, warm, and welcoming - they made our stay at the Kensington so special. 

Location-wise, it was so convenient - just a few minutes from South Kensington station, close to museums and with plenty of easy local dining. 

We were there for our honeymoon, and I couldn't imagine a more perfect experience. ",5,2022,10,26
113,Wonderful!,My partner and I were kindly booked a table by Emiliano (Concierge) in the Kbar on a Wednesday evening. As soon as we walked into this classy and cosy bar we were pleasantly surprised to discover they had a 3 piece band playing jazz and swing music which created the perfect environment to enjoy their range of negronis and order some delicious bar bites! Adrian (bar manager) and our (server) Salvatore were very attentive and welcoming. Overall this was a fantastic evening especially as it was our anniversary and we were spoilt by the Kensington team.

113,SERVICE!,"Prior to our recent stay, I emailed the hotel and Arman, the concierge graciously offered dining options, I made selections from the list he sent me, then he made all reservations for us.

This is why you stay at a Five Star Hotel like The Kensington; job well done all around!",5,2022,10,20

Firstly it was the warmest welcome from Nathalie on front desk and Mario, then the make comfortable room, the bed and bedding was so good, I slept like a baby both nights. I didn‚Äôt get to try breakfast but I did have a drink in The K Bar, the Classic Champagne Cocktail is a must! The flowers and the decor in the drawing room, and other public areas are so beautiful.

113,My favorite hotel in London,"I have been to London 40 times and stayed at so many wonderful hotels but this has been my go-to on the last five or six trips. Lovely ambiance, beautiful lounges, wonderful service, nice restaurant, bedrooms small but nice, terrific housecleaning, and a great neighborhood near lots of interest, but at the same time it's far from the madding crowd. Close to two good tube stations. And lots of fun little restaurants and shops nearby. ",5,2022,10,13
113,Exceptional service!,"The Kensington is a great place to stay while in London. Highly recommend and I do hope to return. The dining options are great as well as the lounge/sitting rooms.  I had the unfortunate luck of breaking my ankle while traveling to UK but the Kensington staff made what I felt to be extraordinary measures to help navigate.  Arranging for wheelchair, assisting with ramp and also just maneuvering from room to dining/lounge area in addition to always making sure I was comfortable if sat in dining room. They were always so kind and 1 step ahead.  For that reason I will make it a point to return when I‚Äôm fully capable.  I wish I made note of all the names (there were so many) but the standout was Emiliano! Who assisted my family & I until it was time to get in the car and head to Heathrow.",5,2022,10,11
113,Outstanding boutique hotel experience! The Kensington is tucked away in a lovely neighborhood & offers excellent service,"The moment we stepped into the lovely hotel lobby we were whisked into a beautiful living room with a lit fireplace, seated for our check-in & offered a glass of champagne. The rest of our stay followed suit. Our hotel room was light, with up to date fixtures & amenities, the hotel bar was cozy, with wood paneled walls & comfortable chairs. There are many cozy spots on the main floor to curl up with a book, have a cup of tea & read the newspaper or share drinks with friends. The food is very good and there are several options for dining, as well as, an excellent afternoon tea service where your treats arrive on a carousel! All of the above are lovely, but add excellent service to the mix & you will have an outstanding stay at The Kensington! We had a couple of small maintenance issues in our room & they were addressed immediately. The employees are courteous, friendly & attentive. The hotel is tucked in a cute neighborhood within walking distance to museums, restaurants, parks, the Tube, and much more. If you are looking for a boutique hotel, with personal service & a cozy, yet vibrant atmosphere this hotel is perfect.",5,2022,10,08
113,Highly recommend Afternoon Tea - 80 Days Around the World taste sensation!,"This afternoon tea experience was a pre-80th early birthday treat for my Mum. It was such fun, the themed approach was an international, delicious extravaganza and the staff went above and beyond in serving us. We had no room for the scones, clotted cream and jam and were given lovely Kensington Hotel ‚Äòfood boxes‚Äô to take them home. I mistakenly left my iPhone charger behind and after calling the hotel afterwards the very helpful Emiliano offered to post it for free to my home in Scotland! I was so grateful and my family and I LOVED the whole afternoon tea experience with champagne because you only live once and life is too short to forgo such treats!  Thank you to everyone at The Kensington Hotel for making our short time with you such fun ü§ó",5,2022,10,05

113,"Wonderful, personable, accommodating  staff","I want to thank the wonderfully accommodating staff at the Kensington Hotel. My stay was superlatively comfortable. Yes, the beds, sheets, and every eating, drinking and lounging space were exquisitely and comfortably furnished; but it was the Wonderful staff, who made me feel very well cared for. I spent two months here, and this great, friendly, international, community took care of me in several, small, personal ways. I especially want to thank Barbara, Genesis, Ronalde, Levente, Sebastian, Petronella, Tatiana, Daniel, Fatmir and barista Alba, the daily breakfast team, who not only greeted me cheerfully by name, but also knew my coffee order, favorite breakfast items, favorite table and newspaper! Thanks also to Arman, Emiliano, Anita, Ronny, Gurchan, Mario, Muhammed and Pavel in the Lobby and front door, for helping me find my way to places, putting an umbrella in my hand if it looked like it would rain, helping me figure out how to put my e-tickets on my phone, suggesting entertainment, doing all the customary things like carrying bags and opening doors, simply being friendly when I needed someone to talk to. Thanks also to evening staff friends: Abdul, Chandan and Krish, who wished I would eat dinner at the hotel more often. I am also very grateful to Marianne, who I met many times, and others who I didn‚Äôt get to know, who did a great job tidying my room and remembering to make my bed with the extra sheet that I requested. Thanks also to Yasin, who did turn down service and remembered to bring me plenty of still water. It was great to meet chef Alex Repov on my last day here. I was eating his food daily but he remained hidden until Arman brought him out to meet me. I will remember London and my stay here with a smile. Thank you, thank you!",5,2022,09,30

I stayed there in 2016 and had a great experience - this was another fantastic stay!  The hotel is extremely well appointed and comfortable.  The design is beautiful and the property is extremely well maintained.  The staff couldn't be nicer and more helpful - all around this is an excellent hotel and I highly recommend it.

113,Life Changing Hotel Experience,"By the time we left, the Kensington truly felt like our home away from home. Our room was impeccable, stocked with lush products, cozy robes and complete with nightly turn down service. The Kensington is in the perfect location, walking distance to the Victoria and Albert Museum as well as Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, and a block away from the Tube, which couldn't have been easier to navigate. 
However what really sets the Kensington apart is the people. Arman, the concierge made our stay so easy and pleasant, and was always ten steps ahead of us, printing out symphony tickets or suggesting the best restaurants before we even had to ask. He had the best, most pleasant attitude- so much so that my mom said he can stay at her house if he ever visits the States lol. Marco and Luciano were absolutely incredible... we truly didn't want to leave but we will definitely be returning!!!",5,2022,09,19
113,"Gorgeous Instagramable Hotel with The Nicest, Most Accommodating Staff Ever",My daughter and I loved this hotel - every single thing about it. It was so picturesque and perfectly British.

A bit farther from the hustle and bustle of central London but that is part of the appeal. #Worth-it!,5,2022,09,17
113,"Amazing food, service, and management!","My wife and I visited The Kensington to meet her friend for afternoon tea towards the end of our stay in London. Right from the beginning, we knew we would be in for a treat. We were welcomed by the friendly doormen as well as the Head of Guest Relations, Yannick Godfrind. We were treated like VIPs; even if it was only for afternoon tea! As we waited for our table, Yannick and his staff would frequently check in to make sure we were comfortable.

Once our table was ready, we were seamlessly handed off to the servers at the restaurant. I believe the name of our server was Clarisse. It was a nice balance of checking in for refills and allowing us to take our time through our courses. I should also add that we had a 7-month old baby with us. All the staff around us were so friendly and interacted with our little one. We never felt awkward having a chatty and, sometimes, fussy baby.

It‚Äôs too bad we only came for afternoon tea. We will surely have The Kensington at the top of our list on our next London visit!",5,2022,09,15

113,Excellent hotel!,"My husband and I stayed at The Kensington at the recommendation from friends. What a wonderful experience! From the moment we walked in the door, we felt at home. Everyone was so accommodating and welcoming. The room was fantastic as was the breakfast and bar. The location is perfect as well. Arman and the others in guest services  took such good care of us even before we arrived. We had so many questions,  as we had never been there before. They answered each and every question promptly and with such enthusiasm. We highly recommend The Kensington and hope to return very very soon.",5,2022,09,11
113,Favorite!,"Just yesterday we left the Kensington hotel in London. It has become our favourite hotel in the world. Post Covid has been a roller coaster of emotions, yet the Kensington provides quality, stability and outstanding customer service. 
When so many have left the service industry, the Kensington has achieved the perfect balance of professionalism, attention to detail and customer service.  We left mid stay for a few days in Spain, returned with an elevated view of Kensington quality.
I can‚Äôt imagine staying anywhere else. I felt so at home and as my feelings were important.
To Thomas, Anita and Barbara and so many others a warm and affectionate till next time.
Looking forward to returning to our London Home.
Thank you 
Patricia and Kyla",5,2022,09,11
113,Lovely hotel with great service,"This was our second stay at The Kensington, and the service was even better than I remembered -- really extraordinary, perhaps especially for a ""big city"" hotel.  Whatever assistance we needed, we received -- including a late-night meal after returning from the theater when the hotel restaurant technically was closed.  Originally a row of stately residences, the hotel retains -- particularly on the ground floor -- some of the feel of a home, albeit a grand one.  A little needed refreshing was underway in the hall where our room was located, and I will say that I don't think the room we were given this stay was as attractive as the one we previously had (in 2019).  Nevertheless, we were very happy.",5,2022,09,10
113,The very best staff!,"Had my first stay @ The Kensington and it exceeded expectations on all my needs. Location is perfect for business traveller with easy access to central London. Room was amazing and gave me space for my extended stay. 

The staff are exceptional!  From the concierge right through to house keeping. Just the best. Remember your name, helpful, courteous, interested in you but not over the top. 

That‚Äôs why I will be coming back. 

Super duper recommended",5,2022,09,06
113,Simply the Best experience,"I had stayed here in March and returned again in May, and I couldn't ask for a more welcoming stay at the Kensington.  The room was perfect, food was excellent but the best of all were the staff.  Incredible service and thank you to Arman and Emiliano for making this stay again  so wonderful.  Looking forward to being back in the Fall.",5,2022,09,05
113,I want to live here,"Once again, I am met with such care and kindest from the beautiful Natalliah, Lucian and Emilliano.  I couldn't ask for a better welcoming or stay here. Incredible service, always above and beyond and of course, I find it increasingly difficult to leave too. 

Whomever stays here, you must try the ""Strawberries dipped in chocolate from the pastry chef, Mary"". Well Mary, you're the queen of sweetness, thank you. 

Thank you all so very much.",5,2022,09,01
113,Wonderful stay,Had a wonderful night at the Kensington last week. Excellent service in the K bar from  all of the staff and big thank you to Anita from reception for being so accommodating and helpful. Would definitely stay again!,5,2022,08,31
113,Outstanding celebration at The Kensington,"After the busyness and hustle of sightseeing in London, my family and I were so happy we had a comfortable and luxurious place to call home.  We had two adjoining rooms for a family of 5, which the reservations team were so kind to bundle together for a family-room. The rooms are outstanding with comfortable beds, fashionable interiors, excellent soaps and shampoos, and most importantly for summer time travel, air conditioning. The breakfasts are superb and the coffee top notch.  All 5 of my family will say that The Kensington was our favorite stay during our 2 weeks traveling through Europe. 

My daughter celebrated a very special birthday during our stay in London, and the outstanding guest relations team, Almire Alim and Thomas Keating, made sure she felt celebrated and loved. They planned a dance party with her favorite music, a disco ball, cake, and even two days of gifts, not just for the birthday girl, but for my other children as well. This is a birthday my daughter will remember forever, and a trip to London that will be etched in my family's memories as one of the best.",5,2022,08,26
113,The Kensington exceeds expectations!,"My daughter had stayed her 3 years ago and wanted to return.  I'm so glad that I was able to experience how special The Kensington is on this recent trip!  The location is great.  The entire staff goes out of their way to provide an outstanding stay.  They were friendly and so helpful in many ways, starting with the concierge service, the front desk/reception, the wait staff at the restaurant/bar and housekeeping.",5,2022,08,25
113,Stand out staff attentiveness,"In a world where hotel stays are very similar, the Kensington staff were more attentive and more friendly than most.  The hotel itself was fine but I would go back because the staff seemed like they were really interested in us - even if it is a cunning ploy to get customers to come back, it works!",4,2022,08,24
113,Best Neighborhood Hotel!,"Staying at The Kensington is always a great experience. Be it for business of with the family, the hotel is A+.  The staff is uber friendly, great with our kids. Shout out to Emiliano, from the concierge team, always going the extra mile.  TKH is our place in London!",5,2022,08,18
113,Amazing place,"Dear Manager,

I am writing to express my gratitude for the service when I visited the hotel with my family many times. It was one of the best place in London, and your staff made it even more special. : (Genesis/Chandan/Layla/ Bryan/Abdul). 
Once again, many thanks to you and your staff for making our vacation more distinctive.
Best regards,",5,2022,08,17
113,"Fantastic Staff, Great Location, Comfy Space","The moment we arrived--jet lagged and exhausted from an overnight flight--the staff immediately took care of us. It made our first day in London so much easier. We enjoyed delicious, top notch breakfasts in the restaurant, as well as relaxing cocktails in the bar or on the front porch after a long day about town. The location is ideal--close to many sites and shopping but away from more tourist-crowded areas. All of the staff was so helpful and kind. We loved our stay and would absolutely return!",5,2022,08,16
113,Dream Vacation,"My family and I recently stayed at The Kensington Hotel. I can't stay enough great things about this hotel. The staff is over the top helpful and friendly! While on vacation our daughter's stroller broke; the staff quickly found us a store that sold strollers, called and make sure they were in stock and arranged a taxi for us to go pick it up. The room was also amazing, so pretty and clean. This neighborhood was also great for families. The neighborhood was quiet yet had several restaurants and cafes. The underground station was also just a short walk away.",5,2022,08,15
113,Excellent stay at a wonderful hotel,"Great hotel for the area, close to key attractions in central London! Gurcan was super friendly and extremely professional and very attentive! Altogether the staff made my stay that little better! Highly recommended",5,2022,08,14
113,What a great hotel.,"A friend recommended this hotel and it sure didn‚Äôt disappoint.   The staff were amazing; attentive,  friendly, personable, accommodating.   You don‚Äôt get service like this anymore.  The property was quaint, well-appointed and well looked after.  We loved the small touches like crystal glasses in the room, well-stocked mini-bar, nightly turn down service which most hotels abandoned a long time ago.    While we only had 1 meal at the restaurant, it was the best Caesar salad I‚Äôve ever had.   We loved the location.  We will most definitely be back to this hotel.",5,2022,08,13
113,Fantastic Stay & Amazing Concierge Team,We recently stayed at the Kensington Hotel in London for two nights. We did a lot of research on where to stay and really picked this hotel because of the reviews and central location. What really separates this hotel form others is the service and Concierge Team. Emiliano in particular was nothing short of amazing and so accommodating. He and his team really went out of their way to make our trip memorable and always treated our kids with so much kindness. We felt very welcome and really enjoyed our time at the Kensington!,5,2022,08,10
113,Amazing Afternoon Tea,"I want to say what a wonderful afternoon tea my friend and I had today. Not only was every mouthful delicious, it was also beautifully presented and displayed in novel ways. I do not want to give too much away as it‚Äôs great to experience it yourself, but the staff made it very special for my friend whose birthday it was. I think I need to focus also on service which made it such an amazing experience. Dan, who greeted us and guided us throughout was kind, thoughtful, funny and professional. We really welcomed all he did for us and hope he will get
to hear this feedback. Thanks again for such a great time.",5,2022,08,07
113,Wonderful experience,"We had a wonderful stay at the Kensington- it‚Äôs at a prime location, the rooms are clean and have all the amenities one may need. Most of all, the staff is incredibly friendly and took great care of us through the entire week we were there. We will definitely be coming back!",5,2022,08,05
113,Great stay,"The room was amazing. The cleanliness 10 out of 10. Cannot miss the staff - Anita from Reception and Petronella from Breakfast team, girls are so friendly and helpful, my credit to them. Thank you so much for best stay ever.",5,2022,07,31
113,Ladies in London,"From the moment I booked our reservation,  to checking in and staying there, the entire staff at The Kensington goes above and beyond in giving the finest service to their guests. The lobby decor is comfortable elegance. The rooms are well appointed and the bathroom is huge, with a fantastic shower head. Highly recommend having tea there. It was a  wonderful quintessential tea service, with a very clever presentation of the food. My daughter and I were treated with genuine concern and kindness after our flight was cancelled and we had to stay an extra day. Again the entire concierge and front desk staff took care of everything seamlessly. This gem of a hotel will be my ""go to"" hotel whenever I travel to London.",5,2022,07,30
113,Don‚Äôt look any further for a hotel in Kensington!,"My spouse and I spent 4 nights here while attending the tennis at Wimbledon. Close to the underground trains with excellent restaurants and shops nearby. We were pleased to be upgraded to a king bedroom but more importantly the staff and service we received during our stay was excellent. The front desk, concierge, doorman, restaurant, bar and housekeeping staff were very friendly, helpful and attentive to all our needs. The lounge and dining ares are nicely appointed and comfortable. We hope to return soon.",5,2022,07,28
113,Loved hotel.,"Great hotel.  Beautiful lobby and dining area.   Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Kensington.   I always stay there when I go to London.  The rooms are small but comfortable     I keep going back as I love the hotel and location.  
",5,2022,07,25
113,The best of the British!,"We loved staying at the Kensington! The staff was so friendly and helpful. Especially, Emiliano, at concierge. The decor is perfectly upscale British. The restaurant and bar were wonderful. It‚Äôs located in a darling neighborhood that offers the energy of the city, while also a break from central London. I can‚Äôt wait to stay again!",5,2022,07,25
113,Afternoon tea,"Visited the Kensington for Afternoon Tea. The staff was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. The hotel's aesthetics were lovely and detailed. There were multiple teas to choose from and a set menu of savory and sweet. Considering the ambiance, location, and menu, the Afternoon Tea is extremely affordable.",5,2022,07,20
113,Amazing Concierge Assistance!!!!!!,"An amazing setting walking distance to so many attractions and sights. Emiliano is the best concierge I‚Äôve ever been associated  with during my travels! He set up drivers, Wimbledon tickets  and dinners. Off the charts Service, 5 Star!!!!!!",5,2022,07,19
113,Phenominal place to stay,"From the look of the hotel to the quality of rooms and service provided, the Kensington was exceptional.  The staff provided for all needs.  The only ranking of the room as Very Good was due to the size of the room with twin beds, wish it was bigger.",5,2022,07,18
113,Very nice hotel,"I experienced the service as very good.  The staff were very helpful especially the reception staff and the general manager.  The rooms were very nice, comfortable and clean.  It was a nice size of hotel.",5,2022,07,17
113,Looks Can Be Deceiving,"The hotel has a very nice lobby area and restaurant- the trouble starts when you go
upstairs to your room. Booked a jr. suite and was given basically a double at best-when I challenged the front desk, they said ""sorry"" no other rooms available-no comp, no complimentary anything to somehow make up for the misrepresentation of what a jr. suite is- And, the room and bathroom were not as clean as they should have been-I called housekeeping to come up and go over certain areas that were not up to par. And, the decor of the rooms was TERRIBLE- bland, flat, no art on the walls, no finesse whatsoever, BUT expensive pricing. Service was average at best. No one is paying attention to the details at this hotel- will not stay at the Kensington again.",2,2022,07,16
113,Gorgeous Hotel and Amazing Service!!!,"My family's stay at the Kensington Hotel in London was truly amazing. Not only is the hotel beautiful inside and out, but the location is fantastic as well. What truly stood out from this hotel was the excellent service. Emiliano is hands down the most professional, well-trained, well-connected, and passionate concierge member I have every met. His resourcefulness is limitless; he went above and beyond and tailored every aspect of our requests down to the last detail. He booked a last minute haircut for my sister and dinner reservations to spectacular restaurants on same day bookings. Thank you Emiliano and the rest of the Kensington Hotel staff for our amazing stay!",5,2022,07,14
113,Amazing service and fantastic location,"My family of 8 traveled to London for a family vacation. We stayed at The Kensington during our time in London, and had nothing but amazing service. Arman and Emiliano were both extremely helpful when helping us plan and book our activities for the trip. They offered great suggestions of restaurants to eat at, plays to see, and activities to do. They were patient with our large group, and very detailed to make sure we knew exactly what we were doing. It was so nice to have advice on what we should see and how to prioritize our day. Not only was the service great, but the location is fantastic. It is walking distance to the South Kensington Tube station, and is very easy to navigate how to get around. We absolutely loved our time at the Kensington!",5,2022,07,13
113,Classic Room-Very disappointing,"Booked a Classic Room based on the gallery from the website but what we got was completely different.  It was small (could live with this as it is London) BUT there were only unusable windows and this made the room very very dark.  The window only opened about 4 inches and looked onto a dirty smelly noisy service area.  There were shutters AND frosted glass which also meant no natural daylight and lights had to stay on during our whole stay-Not very environmental friendly. 

We were offered an upgrade of ¬£150 per night prior to stay and had we known the room would look nothing like the pictures on the website we would have considered it but having spent ¬£1,000 for 2 nights we expected a little better to be fair to us.  Didn't complain as the receptionist must have told us about six times that the hotel was fully booked for the weekend(wonder knowing the room we got was she expecting a complaint).

 ",3,2022,07,11
113,Beautiful Hotel with outstanding service!,"The Kensington is a boutique hotel located in a beautiful area of London. It's very near several museums, Kensington Palace and Hyde Park. The biggest plus of this hotel is there amazing service. The concierge team found and retrieved my lost backpack--while I was on a tour. It was there when I got back. Additionally, the public spaces are just beautiful and comfortable. Certain packages include the very good breakfast and tea for two. I would go back in a minute; it was amazing. ",5,2022,07,10
113,Wonderful service in a lovely setting,"The hotel is beautiful. The breakfast and cocktails are delightful. Rooms are charming. The location is close to museums and the South Kensington tube. But it is the customer service that makes The Kensington stand out. We felt pampered from the moment we walked in. Everyone we interacted with was amazing. Boyan and Arman went out of their way to help, answer questions, and make suggestions. This is our new go-to London hotel.",5,2022,07,08
113,Classic Room Too Small,"I have a daughter who lives in London so I stayed at The Kensington because it was near her flat. First of all, the hotel is beautiful and the staff is as good as any great hotel in the world.

However, since I was alone, I booked a ‚Äúclassic‚Äù room. How bad could it be at a 5 star hotel? Might have been the smallest room I have ever seen. And the walls were paper thin. I heard everything in the hall, next door, above and below me. 

To be fair, I received an email a few days before I arrived offering upgrades, for a fee. I ignored it. I am not a small man. I would have appreciated if when I checked in they could have mentioned that the room was very small and I might consider the upgrade. I would have taken them up on the offer. 

Again, the hotel and staff are lovely. But beware that there entry level room is significantly below par.",4,2022,07,04
113,LOVELY 5 STAR STAY,"Excellent.  The staff here is 5 star.  Our plant landed late and we arrived at the hotel at 2:30am.  The front desk was waiting.  They met us with smiles, offered us food and drink (we were too tired) and escorted us to our room.  The next morning without a reservation they had a table waiting for us at breakfast and the staff knew we arrived at 230am.  So thoughtful. We were at the hotel for 3 days and everyone was so friendly, and professional.  The food DELICIOUS.  Thank you Chandon, DIANA, front desk staff, and all bar and restaurant staff.  Each night we had a Late night cocktail at bar - perfection. The hotel smells of lovely fragrance, lovely English decor, classy, clean, perfect.  We cannot wait to return.",5,2022,06,30
113,Exceptional Staff & Hotel,"Our big family trip to London had been months in the making, with Emiliano, the Head Concierge at the Kensington, being an integral part of the planning process.  His recommendations were  spot on and helped all 7 of us have special experiences. In fact, the entire staff was friendly and attentive!  The hotel is quaint, with many beautiful common spaces.  Our breakfasts were delicious, as were our cocktails in the  evenings.   The hotel is also in a great location and only a quick walk away from the Tube.  I would highly recommend The Kensington!",5,2022,06,28
113,Amazing Time!,"My boyfriend and I went to London and stayed at the Kensington hotel. This hotel was recommended by a friend and I cannot highly recommend it enough. It was such a quaint, cute hotel. The doorman Gurcan was so extremely sweet he went to a local market to get my favorite Turkish treat for me. They were so helpful and awesome to be around. The only complaint I have is that on Night 1 of our stay the hotel room was extremely hot and the A/C was not working. It was also London‚Äôs hottest week of the year. Once that was fixed, everything else was wonderful. Highly recommend!!",5,2022,06,26
113,An excellent stay at the Kensington,"This hotel is a gem. The staff are exceptionally friendly and made an effort to address our needs.  While we did not have any meals at the hotel, we did enjoy well crafted cocktails in the K Bar.  The hotel is a quick walk to the Tube and there are many eateries and coffee shops near by. ",5,2022,06,16
113,Home away from Home,"We happened upon The Kensington after some rather bad luck with another hotel in the area. Upon arrival to The Kensington my family was very stressed and worn out after a rotten first day in London. That all changed as soon as we told reception of our incredible bad luck. From that moment on every staff member went above and beyond to make us feel not only comfortable but very well cared for. What I came to learn after a couple of days is that this is the standard of care here. The overall vibe of the hotel is cozy and welcoming. The decor is nothing short of amazing and the history of the building is quite interesting. The rooms are very clean and roomy. The head of concierge, Emiliano Del Pizzo and his staff went above and beyond to secure some stressful loose ends for us, with Emiliano taking it upon himself to follow up after we had checked out. I cannot say enough about our stay other than I will be back next summer!",5,2022,06,15
113,First Class,"Normally I wait to write a review, but this hotels leadership is a step above, so a good idea others booking can read this. The hotels manager  has an amazing team! The feeling of this place being what I call a ‚Äústep above‚Äù starts when you first walk on the property.  The hotel is beautiful, clean and just has a great vibe. The hotel is perfectly located near two tube stops and museums, so easy to get to just about anywhere from here.  We arrived very early into Heathrow from JFK, so in no way did we think any of the two rooms we booked  would be ready, certainly not before noon!  I will say that after being up for 20 hours it was great to have a hotel manger who went out of his way  way to get us into one of our rooms for a little rest. The second room was adjoining and private, so even better. Team work and caring staff, what can I say! They all know what they are doing and do it with a smile! Best In London!! We will be back again and haven‚Äôt even left yet!!",5,2022,06,10
113,World Class Hotel and Experience,"This is my third time that we stayed at The Kensington and our experiences at this exquisite boutique hotel are always world class! The entire staff are very accommodating and demonstrate the list art of true customer service.  Their goal is to ensure a wonderful experience during your entire stay. By doing so, we return again and again. The management leads by example. They and their teams‚Äô commitment to excellence are truly best in class.   Emiliano Del Pizzo, Head Concierge, and his entire team of professionals are so knowledgeable, helpful and resourceful. They went the extra mile to help our daughter during her recent stay. They provided wonderful suggestions, secured hard to obtain event tickets and made excellent arrangements resulting in wonderful memories. The Kensington‚Äôs accommodations are also lovely. This rooms are well appointed and make for a very enjoyable stay. And the location is perfect. The Kensington boutique hotel is indeed a gem.  We look forward to our next visit.",5,2022,06,09
113,Lovely staff and location!,"You are guaranteed to feel right at home! With incredible service, access to a plethora of recommendations and great hospitality, you won‚Äôt be disappointed! Every staff member goes above and beyond for you.",5,2022,06,08
113,Sadly disappointed,"We had such high hopes for this hotel as our travel agent and the website both showed gorgeous images of the common spaces and rooms. We arrived very early after a long flight and just wanted to refresh. The hotel staff checked us in, gave us a key and off we went with no explanation of the room or where things are in the hotel. Our room was on the third floor, dark, dated and the finishes were worn down and not maintained. It was very disappointing as we spent a lot for the rooms. They offered a new room but it had a very loud machine noise. We chose to remain in our room for the night and ultimately booked a new hotel for the remaining two nights of our trip, sadly losing our money. This is of course our personal experience and does not reflect on the other rooms as we can‚Äôt speak for them. The common spaces are well kept of course. The staff, friendly, but didn‚Äôt go out of their way to remember seeing us before. I wish I could give a better review. Hopefully they see this feedback and are able to make some changes.

113,Wonderful Stay,"Wonderful few days stay at The Kensington Hotel, March 17-20, 2022. The hospitality is non pareil. All the staff are super friendly and helpful. The room is sparkling clean and the bed - and all the bedding - were most comfortable. This is the hotel I will go to on any forthcoming trips to London. Walking distance to the park, shopping, and a nearby tube station that makes the location so very convenient. Love this place!",5,2022,05,31
113,Excellent stay in a perfect location,"My husband and I visited London for the first time and had a perfect visit to The Kensington. The staff was attentive, helpful, and anticipated our needs. We were greeted with a warm towel and ""welcome shot"" of juice and that started off our stay wonderfully. The room, while small (aren't most in Europe small?), was nicely appointed and the bed very comfortable.  The food in the restaurant was incredible and the bar is one of those places where you want to stay forever. Breakfast was substantial and filling. The common areas are gorgeous and just what you would expect in a hotel of this caliber and location. The level of service was unmatched - the concierges had excellent recommendations and the porters even asked about how our evenings were the day before and remembered what our plans were. Absolutely perfect. A note - my friend stayed in a hotel nearby with the same star rating and didn't have nearly the level of service we got here. So yourself a favor and pay them a visit! ",5,2022,05,25
113,Amazing stay!!,"We stayed at The Kensington a few weeks ago for a weekend. And I cannot express how amazing the stay truly was in words!! Special thanks to Gurcan, the receptionist, and Soliman the waiter. Really made us feel welcomed and special! Amazing afternoon tea and dinner and would definitely come back to visit soon!!",5,2022,05,25

113,"Top service, great room, interesting bar and breakfast/book room","Lots of walkable shops, ultra helpful and friendly staff, particularly Lucian.  We stayed three nights in a suite.  We loved instant services, knowledgeable concierge, experienced bar tender Manuel, amazing library/breakfasts, and beautiful touches everywhere, such as fresh flowers.  We cannot recommend the hotel highly enough:  we will definitely return.",5,2022,05,21
113,Amazing Afternoon Tea!,I researched a lot of different hotels looking for an afternoon tea for my partner's birthday. I am so pleased I chose The Kensington. The food was superb. The surroundings lovely and the staff made the day. I couldn't recommend it highly enough. My partner simply asked if she could be 50 again next year so we could visit again!,5,2022,05,21
113,"Stylish hotel, welcoming staff","A luxurious oasis in the middle of London - the hotel is perfectly positioned, with good connections, close to the highly-sought South Kensington neighborhood and to everything you need. The public areas are beautifully decorated and the hotel has a contemporary chic vibe. 
Our room was spacious and bright, the bed was large and very comfortable, the huge bathroom it was cleaned every day with new towels provided and all products were re-stocked each time
Breakfast selection was vast, rich and well cooked, with the option to order a variety of hot egg-based dishes too.The teas, in particular, were delicious.
However, the greatest assests is represented by the wonderful staff that went the extra mile and made us feel at home every moment of our stay. Special mentions to Petronela, Gurcan, Levente and Lucian for being so welcoming and attentive.  ",5,2022,05,15

113,Wonderful stay in gorgeous boutique hotel!,"We loved The Kensington Hotel from the moment we walked in!  We were warmly greeted at the front desk and given a room right away, even though we arrived before noon.  The hotel was created from the renovation of four separate 19th century, Regency styled townhouses and so the public spaces felt like cozy lounges in a private home.  The designers fused period and modern furnishing with beautiful art and fixtures.  Our room was very spacious, especially by European standards and included a gorgeous marble bath with huge shower.  We decided to have the afternoon Tea and it was fantastic!  The food included delicious amuse-bouches, tasty sandwiches and because it was Easter, holiday themed desserts.  The service was outstanding ‚Äì they were always immediately at hand but never hovering.  The breakfast (which was included in the stay) provided both cold and hot items, including a traditional full English breakfast.  Overall, it was a fantastic experience at a beautiful property in a wonderful neighborhood!",5,2022,05,08
113,Stay at The Kensington Hotel,"I had a fabulous stay at The Kensington Hotel. The common areas are beautiful, but the service is what set this hotel apart from others that I have visited in London. The welcome was warm, and the concierge was immensely helpful. Highly recommend!",5,2022,05,03

Great location too for the west end.",5,2022,04,10
113,Family Wedding Weekend,"Recently spent 3 nights at the fabulous Doyle Kensington Hotel whilst in London to celebrate a family wedding. From the moment we arrived at the hotel where we were met by the fabulous Emiliano and his team until we departed our stay was excellent. First impression last and from the first greetings on the steps of the hotel with Emiliano, Arman and Lucian we were treated like royalty. Our room with its large four poster bed was bright and  comfortable. A nice touch was the Butlers chocolate left on the pillow as part of the turn down service. The room and bathroom were exceptionally clean with lots of fresh towels everyday. The hotel was extremely comfortable with a relaxed atmosphere. Sitting on the plush chairs at the front of the hotel drinking coffee and watching the world go by was a fabulous way to start the day. The hotel is well situated with lots of good restaurants and traditional English pubs within walking distance. Highley recommend",5,2022,04,05
113,The Kensington Hotel - A Jewel Box Box,"We recently departed The Kensington Hotel after a lovely three days in London to celebrate a wedding.  Friends from around the USA stayed at the hotel, which was so warm, gracious and accommodating of our every need, whether to secure transportation, to make reservations, to provide directions or to rearrange a lounge of furniture for our  evening cocktail gathering.  From the moment we began our day at breakfast to our ""final, final"" closing the bar, our group experience with the hotel staff was first class, friendly and always professional.  While our room was rather small, it was clean, comfortable and well appointed.  I look forward to my return, hopefully sooner rather than later!  Thank you, Emiliano and all the wonderful staff at The Kensington --- until next time ....  üôè",4,2022,04,03
113,Family Wedding Weekend,Spent a fabulous weekend with my family in the Kensington Hotel.  The staff were so pleasant and helpful.  The hotel ambience and decor are gorgeous with fresh flowers in the lounge area every day. There are lovely little snugs outside where you can enjoy a coffee and watch the world go by. My bedroom was bright & airy with the most comfortable bed. There were also lovely little touches of chocolates in the room. The breakfasts were delicious with a good choice on the menu. Such a great location with lots of cafes and restaurants around the hotel and it is also within walking distance to many cultural attractions. Thank you to all the staff for making our weekend so special.  Highly recommend.,5,2022,04,01
113,Lovely high end hotel with impeccable and friendly service.,Personal service and wonderful cozy area to sit and eat or drink.  The concierge and front desk are spot on with whatever you need.  The food is fabulous.  Chicken Caesar is my favorite lunch.  Breakfast is also great with attentive service.  I always stay here in London.  Quiet area of town as well.,5,2022,04,01
113,Where the staff know your name,"Just back from a wonderful four nights at the Kensington. Great location with outdoor seating for drinks or lunch which is hard to find in London.  Lovely decor and fabulous flowers in the lobby. The best thing about the hotel is the staff.  They were warm and welcoming, most helpful and greeted us by name. We felt very special. Lovely relaxing hotel. Highly recommend. Very good value for what you get.
",5,2022,03,30
113,Wonderful stay as a family.,"We had a wonderful stay at the Kensington which worked perfectly for all three generations of our family. The location was a welcome respite from the crowds in other London locations, but with the advantage of world class museums and restaurants within walking distance. The lobby, tea room, bar, and breakfast rooms are beautiful, with amazing fresh flower arrangements. Breakfast is delicious and served by an attentive and friendly staff. The best part of the hotel is the helpful staff everywhere, most especially the concierges. Emiliano and Arman saved the day several times by arranging last minute dinner reservations for a large group at a bustling restaurant, ordering car service for multiple complicated trips, and facilitating fit to fly COVID tests.  They, and the rest of the wonderful staff helped make this a memorable family reunion for all of us and we truly enjoyed our time at The Kensington.",5,2022,03,29
113,Weekend in London,"Had an extremely comfortable room at the Kensington‚Ä¶ lots of natural light, large bathroom and plenty of water and chocolates! Staff was professional, friendly and solicitous. Would highly recommend!!",5,2022,03,28
113,"Brilliant, great staff and great afternoon tea",We had afternoon tea here.  I would highly recommend.  They catered for us and we were a large party.  They went above and beyond.  We were celebrating two 60th birthdays and they really made it lovely for us all.,5,2022,03,28
113,I wanted to live here and never go home.,"I have never received such beautiful, respectful and charming customer service, upon arrival and when leaving. Both my husband and I were beyond buoyed with this hotel and I sincerely mean this with my whole heart. 

I felt as if I were in another heavenly realm, within the midst of the chaos of London. A true sanctuary, where all that worked there, went above and beyond. Shamefully, I didn't catch all the names of the gems that worked there, yet I do remember ""Emiliano and Arman"". True gentle, gentlemen.

Even down to the tiny, yet magnificent intricacies, such as the glorious flowers, the genuine, beaming smiles, the little pieces of fudge with a coffee, the ""Shall I call you a cab madame/sir?"" to those soothing words of ""Let me take that for you madame/sir...can I help in any way?"". Truly wonderful. 

I agree with the comment below ""Where angels work"" and my title of course. Ah...Sigh. 

If I were to ever come back to South West London, ""This must be the place"".",5,2022,03,26
113,Where angels work!,"I was in London with a friend, celebrating fifty years of friendship.
We chose the Kensington because my friend has already been there, and has fond memories.
Initially, we were a bit miffed because the room reserved for us had the requested terrace but was also a bit cramped, had three steps down to reach it and three steps up to the bathroom! (Reservations should surely have mentioned this when we booked the room - both of us at this point have back/foot/balance problems). It also proved quirky in that the safe didn't work properly, nor did the door window to the terrace open; the flush button eccentric. These things were speedily fixed and they did inquire if we wanted to change room. We declined, as this would have ruined our plans for the day; they did give us compensation by adding complimentary breakfast (they serve very good breakfast; I tasted several different items on the menu and enjoyed all of them.) and then later, as the room persisted in its eccentricities) even added two free drinks at the bar. Which was nice of them.
The Kensington hotel is as described by all, with all the good details: traditional facade and interior set up, excellent food (with delightfully old fashioned items such as prawn cocktail - divine - I had it twice! and one of the best dover soles in London), excellent bar, excellent cellar (with a fascinating Greek sommelier who divined the wine I wanted and then pleasantly conversed of ancient philosophy while I tasted it), excellent service: an international and polyglot staff of rare good manners and discreet professional service: the old kind, that tries to foresee the client's needs, before they are even aware of it!
They will chat a solo client at breakfast until the food arrives and then disappear so one can enjoy it in peace. They will suggest, if they think one wants a suggestion, or will quietly wait for one to make a decision. We were impressed with the Concierges (both Emiliano and Arman) from the beginning (Yes real ones! Gold keys and all. I almost cried when I noticed.) We were directed to restaurants that responded precisely to our ideas: twice. They gave us information that was always correct, enquired after us at all times. The bar and restaurant staff were just as pleasant and courteous every time we had something to eat or drink there). My Italian origin made us beloved of the numerous Italian staff who show the best of their country's abilities for hospitality (too many of you to name one by one: Ancora Grazie! ) The others being just as kind and professional. It was a pleasure to meet every one of You. Thank you!
We were supposed to proceed to the United States, instead, I ended up at an emergency room with an acute case of sciatica (meaning excruciating pain, can't walk, can't even stand properly). It gets worse. I'm treated for it, but unfortunately the drugs disagree with me. Second round at the emergency room under drug shock. My friend has to leave, and I'm stuck in London.
This is where the cookie crumbles: either the hotel is able to cope or it isn't.
At the Kensington I found a treasure! The international staff are not only solicitous they are zealous! I was cuddled, comforted, aided in every way possible. My friend was so moved as to bring them flowers to thank them for their kindness and support. After she left, and I was alone, I was adopted! They took me to the pharmacy, to the supermarket, volunteered to accompany me everywhere. I was served meals in my room, or helped down to the restaurant and bar. They sent messages to see how I was doing, called to hear if I needed anything. 
They extended my stay, managed to keep the room I was in available until I needed it. The terrace turned out to be priceless as I could at least sit outside, and get some fresh air and sun while I was laid over. Arman and Emiliano helped with the difficulties of changing air-bookings, getting to the airport, getting assistance to get on the flight. They extensively discussed things with me in concern that I could then actually handle the logistics we planned. 
I had thought the Gold Keys gone forever, instead I not only saw them again on the uniforms, but found that the old glorious magic is still at work! Both are priceless.

PS: I grew up in the travel business. My parents were both TA's and those days were the hay-day of it. I have travelled extensively at the highest possible levels. I have given it up, because today it is usually a disheartening affaire. I can only say that if I were sure to find the staff I found at The Kensington wherever I stay, I might take it up again.",5,2022,03,25
113,Amazing Visit,"From the time I hopped out of the taxi, my friend and I were greeted with such kindness and respect. The check in process couldn‚Äôt have been easier. 

We were escorted to our room and what a lovely surprise. The decor is gorgeous yet understated. I was very comfortable at one. From room service to the bar to dining room, everything was lovely, delicious and welcoming. 

I can‚Äôt say enough of the staff. Lucien, George, Artiv (I hope I spelled these names correctly) and on and on‚Ä¶ so professional, pleasant and welcoming.  Thank you all!  I can‚Äôt wait to come back!",5,2022,03,25
113,Lovely family Afternoon Tea,"We celebrated with 15 members of our family for our joint 60th Birthday Tea, it was a great decision and well organised by my cousin and the Hotel. Food was very nice, scones warm and fresh, savouries and cakes were all amazing.Staff were very attentive, polite and informative, the cakes where made in London landmarks , like the Big Ben, The Shard etc, the waiter very kindly gave a mini London tour talk to go with each cake. 
As we were celebrating 2 x 60th Birthdays we may have been a little loud for some of the other guests‚Ä¶.sorry. I have to mention the lovely Thomas Keating, once he knew we were celebrating important Birthdays he swiftly arranged a Happy Birthday song from the lovely staff with a cake for each of us , candle and a fresh rose, very thoughtful, very kind, thank you",5,2022,03,25
113,Fabulous service at The Kensington,Stayed for 1 night this weekend. Lovely new room with very comfortable bed. Food was great but what made the most difference was the staff. We have been lucky enough to stay in some of the best hotels in the world and The Kensington is right up there.,5,2022,03,23
113,Mother-Daughter trip,"I‚Äôve traveled to London several times, and staying here was a delight. The room was comfortable, the public spaces were elegant and cozy, the food was good, and the staff was lovely. Everyone was extremely helpful. We had a great time! ",5,2022,03,22
113,The London Landmarks Afternoon Tea - a great experience!,We were at The Kensington for their London Landmarks Afternoon Tea. What a great experience! Our host (Ronald) was wonderful. The scones and sandwiches were delicious and the cakes (also excellent) are real works of art. It was an afternoon to remember.,5,2022,03,20
113,Amazing family stay,"Amazing experience. Staff was so friendly and helpful (especially the concierge with their reservations and George with his suggestions). Great location and beautiful lobby. Tea was amazing, drinks before dinner were great as well. Would stay again!",5,2022,03,20
113,Afternoon Tea with friends,"Lovely experience. Warm and welcoming from the beginning thanks to George at the entrance.
Food was fulfilling and well presented. Staff attentive and premises very clean. The table were we sat was a bit low but I am sure we would have been accommodated elsewhere if required. Elephants seems to be a theme as elements of decoration. I loved it and wonder if there is any explanation for it?",5,2022,03,19
113,"Perfect home from home, excellent service and beautiful hotel.","We loved every minute of our stay at this hotel. We travel a lot and this hotel really stands out in regards to its staff. The front desk, concierge, door men and all restaurant staff were just incredibly welcoming and helpful. We were helped by Arman at concierge to get tickets for the theater which we would not have been able to do without him. It made our trip so special, especially as on our return they had left a beautiful momento for us in our room To remember our evening by. That gesture was truly an outstanding memory for us and one that bought a lot of joy to us all. We loved the layout of the hotel. The restaurant and sitting rooms and bar are all gorgeous and The room was very comfortable and nicely decorated.
I will stay at the Kensington for all of our future trips to London. The location is great and everything about the hotel was wonderful. Thank you The Kensington team for all your efforts and work into making our stay so enjoyable.",5,2022,03,17
113,Relaxing and Luxurious stay,"The location is excellent - very accessible via public transport. Breakfast is fantastic. In the evening, the bar is a lovely place to unwind and those Whiskey Sours ...
All the staff without exception are first class and a special mention for Emiliano at the concierge desk. He was so helpful, nothing was too much trouble and he enhanced our stay so much.",5,2022,03,16
113,"Laid back luxury where the staff don't just deliver, they enhance your stay","The first impression is excellent, a beautiful hotel throughout in a really nice part of the city and the rest of our stay did not disappoint. 

It's clear from every interaction with staff that delivering excellent customer experience is a huge priority for this hotel- they really focus on ensuring guests feel at ease and valued. 

We loved that the team engaged with us (in a professional but genuine and friendly manor), we actually spent more time dining and drinking at the hotel than we ever normally would on a city break.

The rooms were beautifully decorated and our request for interconnecting rooms was actioned (we were even given a complementary upgrade which was a really pleasant surprise). The hotel is centrally located for the museums and there are lots of cafes/bars and restaurants close by.

We've stayed at a lot of similar standard hotels in London and other cities, some more iconic and some much more expensive but I've never felt as comfortable as I did at the Kensington.

I would describe this hotel as 'comfortably luxurious' - they blend high end and beautiful d√©cor with exceptional service which enhances your stay. Sitting in the bar after a busy day sight seeing,  it almost felt like we were having a glass of wine in a friends lounge (albeit a very fancy lounge, in a very fancy house). 

I can't wait to try more hotels within the group and of course, visit the team at The Kensington again soon.",5,2022,03,14
113,Its like a London Landmark itself,"I booked the London Landmark Afternoon Tea for a friends trip to London and was not disappointed. Even before we had stepped through the front door we were greeted by attentive staff, the staff serving and running the afternoon tea were on another level. Nothing was too much to ask, they were friendly and familiar without being too familiar and they were attentive without hovering or constantly checking on us, it was just the right amount. The staff were absolutely brilliant and the food... well that was another level. Everything was an delight to eat, a treat for the taste buds and for the eyes - the sweets were incredible to look at and to eat. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. I would highly recommend and will be returning with family.",5,2022,03,07
113,First class,"The kensington hotel is beautiful but what makes it so exceptional is the customer service. My husband and I have stayed at many hotels but what made this one stand out for us was the way the staff engaged with us. Nothing was too much trouble and the staff were able to provide 5 star service to us in a very professional yet friendly, relaxed manner.
We loved our stay and will never stay in a different hotel in London again. A special mention has to go to the concierge team and Arman Bernardino. Thanks to his  help and excellent advice we were able to enjoy a day that we had written off as being impossible due to the storm. He was so pleasant and helpful. 
The staff at this hotel understand that it is the little things that can make a big difference and impact to the guests. My husband and I cannot recommend it enough.",5,2022,03,06
113,Making our tenth anniversary magical,"We held our wedding reception at The Kensington in 2012 and decided to book the same hotel room to celebrate our 10-year wedding anniversary. 

From the moment we stepped through the doors, we felt special. The staff had been briefed of our special occasion and congratulated us at every opportunity as we moved through the property during our entire stay. 

When we entered our room we were greeted with flowers, Prosecco, a helium balloon and a specially made anniversary cake. As we moved into the bathroom, the beautiful freestanding bath was filled with anniversary balloons. I was so moved at the kindest. 

Thomas, the fantastically thoughtful guest relations  manager, came to introduce himself and handed us a card from the team. He had also been accommodating in helping my best friend arrange another gift in our room. 

We went down for dinner where the impeccable service continued. After our delicious meal (and amazing cocktails) we returned to our room where we had received a special turn down with roses placed on the bed. 

We finished our stay with a delicious breakfast in bed. 

We could not have asked for more from The Kensington. Thomas and the team went above and beyond to make us feel special, and we are so grateful and can‚Äôt thank them enough. 

The Kensington has the luxurious feel and atmosphere of any of the big 5-star London hotels BUT, it comes coupled with a personal and friendly service that leaves you feeling special. 

We already can‚Äôt wait to bring our two daughters back for afternoon tea.",5,2022,03,06

113,Family trip to London,"Fantastic hotel in great London neighborhood. Perfect for our family of 7 visiting. The hotel was very nicely appointed, both in the rooms and common areas / amenities. The food was very nice, we highly recommend doing the afternoon tea (which features the sights of London). We went for my in-law's 50th anniversary and the hotel staff treated us all amazing. They offered a complimentary champagne toast and treated our three daughters like princesses. 
The concierge staff at this hotel was amazing. We've stayed at some of the top hotels in the world and this staff matched (if not exceeded) the service provided by others. We were particularly impressed by Emeliano, who consistently went above and beyond to meet our needs and make excellent suggestions. 

Amazing family stay. We reserved a suite for my in-laws and a family room for us.",5,2022,02,25
113,Definitely can‚Äôt wait visit!,"I travel to London quite a few times for business every year and I was looking forward to visiting here for afternoon tea.

I really am looking forward to visiting. She is an wonderful example of customer service! Thank you Mary!",5,2022,02,19
113,Rest assured,"I stayed at The Kensington while visiting London to take a medical licensing exam. I knew my time in London would be busy and stressful so I choose The Kensington because based on the reviews it seemed like someplace that I would be able to feel relaxed and comfortable during my down time. And a safe bet for a good nights sleep before the exam. My stay here exceeded all expectations. The staff was amazing, it was clear that they had read what I had said as any preferences during my stay when I booked in online. The room was luxurious, I never knew what I was missing until I stepped foot on the heated flooring in the bathroom. On arrival the room had fresh fruit, a jar of sweets, and chocolates. One of the guest relations checked in a few hours after I arrived to see if I needed anything and had a very kind card wishing my luck on the exam. The breakfast was delicious and the staff attentive at offering more coffee and checking in on what was needed. Nicole, who was on breakfast service my first day, was sunny start to a wintery London day. It really started the day off on a good foot interacting with her. Emiliano was the concierge during the daytime throughout my stay and was exceptional. Without prompting he ensured each day that I knew how to get to where I was going, shared about an expected delays on the underground, and wished me luck on the exam. The stay here was above and beyond what I had hoped, anything I needed was met and even anticipated by the staff. During what was a busy and stressful weekend, it made a world of difference to be staying here. It is clear that The Kensington staff value the guests as an individual and makes efforts to have every person have an exceptional stay. I left The Kensington already trying to figure out when I could have a fun weekend away to London and stay there again.",5,2022,02,19
113,Beautiful Visit,"While in London, I had a chance to visit The Kensington Hotel. Had a delicious lunch on the main floor in stunning Drawing Room by the open fireplace.

113,Trip to the theatre,"I booked a hotel stay because we were going to see the Cirque du Soleil at The Royal Albert Hall. I called to check something with the hotel and lost faith in them following that phone call. I cancelled and booked at The Kensington. WOW... world's apart. From the initial booking nothing was too much trouble, the staff are exceptional, the food to die for and the room luxurious. The staff replenished the room when they called to turn down the bed. The show was unfortunately cancelled due to covid. The hotel manager sorted out moving our evening meal times, sorted out a late brunch and generally took care of everything including a room upgrade.
From the doorman on the hotel steps, the staff who took the luggage to the room, the restaurant staff and manager.. everyone was lovely, cheerful, helpful, kind,  and despite being busy interested and caring..nothing was too much trouble. Boyan the hotel manager on the day we arrived was delightful and very helpful. Abdul our evening waiter in the Town House restaurant was attentive happy cheerful knowledgeable and a pleasure to meet.
If you want to have a stay where you are treated with respect and attention by wonderful staff this is the place to be. A really wonderful weekend!!

113,Miss,"Kensington Hotel is my go to place. Its perfect for every occasion.  If you want to blend in a have some tea by the fire, breakfast, lunch or  dinner. This venue is equally perfect for client entertainment,  celebratory or business events.  The venue attracts the business set, HNW/UHNWI who want a discreet yet luxurious and homey venue to conduct business relax. It also has an international vibe and hence attracts an international group who come to London for business and leisure. 

I enjoyed my birthday celebrations at The Kensington with a delicious array of edibles sweets created by a talented chef served by very professional, well trained and welcoming staff with a pletera of language skills to cater for any decerning guest.

I would personally like to thank the chef, the waiters namely Ronald, Abdul and Zouhour.  I also want to thank Nicole and Anne for their effort in making my birthday celebrations and any other visit a special experience and memory.

Special thanks to Nicole and Our waiter Ronald both of whom catered for our every needs. Nicole was so friendly and professional today. Thank you for a lovely day we will be back soon üòÄ,5,2022,01,08
113,Birthday weekend in London,"We travelled as a family of 2 adults and 2 children aged 8 and 11. We arrived early to drop our bags, and from start to finish the Concierge team here were amazing remembering our itinerary and names! Whilst checking in the Reception team welcomed us with mince pies and drinks, a lovely touch and the Manager and Receptionist asked the boys their names making them feel welcomed. 

After returning later during the day from a day in London, the boys had been left personalised gifts plus a lovely welcome note and cake for my birthday! 

The Family Suite was beautifully decorated, a wonderful size for a London Hotel and the kids even had their own toiletries. The beds were super comfy and although we had a little late night noise from people returning to their rooms we soon fell back to sleep.

The Hotel had been decorated to a very high standard for Christmas and had a wonderful roaring fire where you could sit and enjoy drinks. A great location with 2 Tube stations close by, only 5 minute walk to either. 

Thank you, The Kensington for making us feel so welcome as a family and all the extra special touches helping us make memories!",5,2022,01,07
113,A true ‚Äúhome away from home‚Äù,"This has been our 2nd stay at The Kensington and we could not be happier! The warmth of the hotel‚Äôs staff is second to none. We were treated to a nice upgrade and enjoyed newly refurbished and quiet rooms. Breakfast is excellent.

Location in Kensington is delightful, not far from Hyde Park, a block away from many nice restaurants, a 10 minute walk to Kings Road‚Ä¶

If we return to London, we will be definitely staying at The Kensington.",5,2022,01,06
113,We have fallen in love with this hotel - a fond favourite for many trips to come!,"Having visited this hotel very recently, we were so impressed by our stay that we decided to book another trip for early September 2021.

This hotel is, truly, nothing short of amazing. Whether this be in relation to the elegant decor throughout, the amazing and friendly staff, or the delicious food and drink offerings, this hotel has it all.

Upon arrival we were personally greeted by the very kind doormen and very swiftly taken through the check-in procedure, all with a friendly and helpful touch. We were very kindly upgraded to a suite at check-in, which was massively appreciated!

Inside our room, small gifts were waiting for us, and a handwritten note - which I think is such a brilliant and lovely touch. Our room featured a four-poster-bed and monochrome decor, which I found very classy and chic. The bathroom was absolutely ginormous and featured marble interiors throughout, as well as double French doors! Our room truly was a beautiful suite, which is exemplary of all of the rooms at The Kensington.

When staying at The Kensington, I absolutely urge you to wake up early and sample their breakfast offerings. It is by far one of the best hotel breakfasts that I have had the pleasure of experiencing, and one that should not be missed. Not only is their selection extensive and varied, but everything we sampled was tasty and delicious. The staff at breakfast are also brilliant and deserve credit!

The K Bar is another hidden gem for a quiet glass of champagne after a long day - something which I definitely recommend!

I extend my gratitude and thanks to Karan, Duty Manager, for his continued service which has - on multiple occasions - gone above and beyond the ordinary expectations. Thank you Karan for your impeccable customer service: you truly are a star find!",5,2022,01,05
113,Fantastic hotel with brilliant staff and in a great location,"From the moment we arrived to the moment we checked out the staff at The Kensington were excellent. They were all very polite, eager to ask about your day and couldn't do enough. The doorman was particularly attentive and friendly. 

It was my wife's birthday (I advised the hotel in advance) and we were greeted in our room with balloons and a piece of cake just to add to the occasion. She loved the surprise. 

The hotel itself was very clean and well kept in both front-of-house and our room. We especially loved the front porch area complete with xmas decoration and blankets. 

The bathroom in our room could possibly have done with a little updating given the high level of the rest of the hotel but this is my only negative comment and I am picky with my accommodation!

In all I would not hesitate to stay again and recommend the Kensington to friends and family.",5,2022,01,04
113,Fantastic stay in a charming boutique hotel,"My family of four stayed at The Kensington Hotel for three nights over the New Year's Eve holiday. The property is charming and full of history, and has a beautiful and intimate interior design. The staff was all extremely friendly and helpful, and we felt more like family than just a guest. We booked a Family Room which had two king beds (and rarity in Europe) but they could be split into twins if necessary. The size of the room was on par with a typical US hotel room (meaning much larger than a typical European hotel room). The hotel was extremely clean, well appointed, and quiet. It is located on a corner and within walking distance to the South Kensington underground station, delicious restaurants, great shops, and amazing museums and historical sites. I highly recommend it for all types of travelers.",5,2022,01,03
113,Our new go to London Hotel,"The Kensington has now become our new go to hotel when visiting London.  It is absolutely outstanding!  Great location, stunning decor, amazing rooms but most importantly the service was out of this world.  A warm welcome from George on the door and then from booking in to making restaurant recommendations and reservations, Antonio was always on hand and is an absolute asset to The Kensington.
We can't wait to come back.",5,2022,01,03
113,"Well located, old school charm","The Kensington is a very well located property in the heart of South Ken, within walking distance to Hyde Park and the Kings Road. Having lived in the area I was a regular customer of their restaurant and breakfast offering as well as their very beautiful speakeasy themed bar, all of which are exceptional and a very cosy place to read the papers on a lazy Sunday afternoon. The gym is extensive , occupying a very large part of the LG floor but using the light wells to allow in natural light in a clever way so you don‚Äôt feel like you are in a dungeon. The rooms are small and Spartan, but they are priced accordingly. It‚Äôs hard to fault it as a hotel.",4,2022,01,02
113,Upscale Elegance with the warmth of a home!,"The warm welcoming elegance of the Kensington is impressionable.  After a long day exploring the cool rainy sites of London the Kensington provided the refresh we needed every night.  The staff was exceptional and worked hard to make everything right.  The hotel was decorated for the holidays providing the bling to an already elegant backdrop of furnishings and artwork- unique nooks and crannies in which to eat, drink and relax.  Spotless rooms and a perfectly warm high pressured rain shower.  The hotel is conveniently located near the underground and an area of shops, restaurants and museums.  What would bring us back again and again is the staff!",5,2022,01,01
113,Holidays,"Excellent! We had the fabulous experience at this hotel. Really it was an exceptional visit. Yannick the manager and Thomas met and greeted is they looked after our every need and kindly upgraded our rooms. The rooms were gorgeous. Beautiful cocktails at the bar, a fire burning in the beautiful lounging area. There are no words to describe the staff here it was truly the best experience in a hotel I've ever had. The ladies looking after the delicious breakfasts were so helpful nothing was too much trouble. Fabulous food. We were thrilled with our choice and will be back again. Couldn't have wished for a more beautiful hotel thank you!!!",5,2022,01,01
113,Perfect,"Service in The Kensington is perfect. Starting in the Checkin with Antonio, restaurant with Nicole e everybody working to make you feel at home. Everything was perfectly clean, the staff works all day long to make you feel comfortable.  ",5,2021,12,31
113,Perfect every time!,"The Kensington is our very favorite place to stay in London. The staff is amazing, from the housekeeping (best EVER) to the waitstaff, to the front desk‚Ä¶truly the best. The breakfasts alone are reason to visit. We went running in Hyde Park, walked to museums, short walk to tube stops‚Ä¶you can literally walk to anywhere from the hotel. The beds and linens are comfortable, our room had a tub big enough to soak in‚Ä¶the turn down service is top notch with everything from coffee, bottles waters, shortbreads, clean towels, etc being re-stocked‚Ä¶and it goes on and on‚Ä¶we stayed for a week and it wasn‚Äôt long enough. The Kensington is the only place we stay in London now. We loved it even before the pandemic and it hasn‚Äôt changed at all, despite all the pandemic related struggles that have effected most everyone else.",5,2021,12,28
113,Fabulous Afternoon Tea,"On a rainy afternoon our afternoon tea was just what was required. The iconic landmark cakes were fabulous but the savoury selection of canap√©s and sandwiches were just as delicious. The staff were so welcoming and helpful, thank you so much would definitely recommend.",5,2021,12,28
113,Best Hotel Amazing Staff,"This is my fourth stay at this Hotel . It is now our only choice of hotel when we travel to London . The Hotel is fabulous and decorated very well with a boutique luxury hotel feel , small enough to feel personal and big enough to have everything you need. The staff at this hotel is what truly make it special , each and every staff member have looked after us each and every time we have stayed here ..... everyone is top service ..... for the moment we arrived from the door man to Antonio at reception looking after our every need ..... to all the restaurant and bar staff a true gem of a hotel I would highly recommend to anyone looking for the perfect romantic stay we can‚Äôt wait to go back",5,2021,12,27
113,Afternoon Tea,"Not one to write reviews but had to after the AMAZING service from Nicole. Came here with a couple of friends and she made us feel extremely welcome and comfortable. She has a lovely attitude - wish everywhere had staff as kind as Nicole. The afternoon tea was a wonderful experience and the London Landmarks looked great. The Kensington has a nice atmosphere and looked beautiful, we especially loved the Christmas tree. I would recommend and will definitely be back.",5,2021,12,27
113,Afternoon yea amazingness,"My husband and I are not tea drinkers, but needed to do this while in England. It was AWESOME! Everything was so good and the tea was wonderful. We both really enjoyed it. I thought it was so special for how they presented the sweets, on the London Eye with all monuments represented. It was adorable. Anna was especially so sweet. I will never forget this experience. Also, what a beautiful hotel!",5,2021,12,23
113,Amazing afternoon tea,"I've been at the Kensington a few times for my afternoon tea, it's a truly amazing place, great atmosphere and excellent service. Anna was there to welcome me with a very warm smile and made the experience even more enjoyable!",5,2021,12,20
113,An amazing experience!,"We had a fabulous stay at The Kensington Hotel; if I could give more than 5 stars I would. Upon arrival we were greeted by Antonio who arranged an early check-in and showed us around our room and the hotel amenities. We were also delighted to have received a room upgrade to a luxury studio suite and stayed in one of the newly renovated suites with impeccable d√©cor, heated bathroom floors and a walk-in closet. The booking also included a bottle of champagne and breakfast included. Well worth the cost for a five star hotel in London especially when factoring in the Doyle Collection promotions. When we return to London we will certainly be staying at the Kensington again.",5,2021,12,20
113,Afternoon tea,"First time for me and my friends at the Kensington hotel !The hotel is so stylish and beautiful. We were warmly welcoming, thank you especially to ANNA , she has such an amazing energy and she is ready to help , so if you need something for the restaurant and reservation please go see her ! Well done , definitely 5 star hotel !",4,2021,12,17
113,Back again!,"We stayed in this lovely hotel last weekend  with our 11 year old granddaughter for her long delayed birthday treat. It had been a while since our last visit and there were many new faces working there. It‚Äôs difficult to mention everyone who looked after us, as the staff don‚Äôt seem to wear name badges any more.  
George welcomed us back, tho‚Äô how he recognised us wearing masks I‚Äôll never know! We checked in early and Barbara sorted lunch for us while we waited for our room. 
The star of the show for us was Tom! He brought birthday treats for the birthday girl, even offering to sing Happy Birthday to her! He‚Äôs such a joy to talk to and just made us feel so welcome. Thank you, Tom!
Antonio, we hope you enjoyed your trip to Glasgow to see your heroes! 
",4,2021,12,10
113,Best service ever,"I have spent numerous hours studying at the Kensington hotel and the services is utterly excellent. Nicole and Abdul have taken such great care of me. It is always a pleasure to see their friendly faces when I come here and study!! Of course the setting of the reading room is lovely but it is the excellent service that makes me come back here most days of the week! 

Karla",5,2021,12,10

113,Excellent stay in a friendly luxury hotel,"Very stylish and cosy hotel with a warm atmosphere! The rooms are comfortable and tastefully decorated. The lobby has a real fireplace and it is very elegant, it is a pleasure to have a drink there or ar the bar which is as nice. Live music on Thursday ans Friday evening is very good, and also the hotel restaurant was above expectations. All the staff is very curteous and highly professional. We will be back for sure!",5,2021,12,07
113,Family trip for my sons 21st birthday,"This is the first time we had stopped at The Kensington, Queens Gate,London, but what a find and a gem. 
From the moment we arrived on the Friday 3rd December until we left  all  the staff were extremely helpful, friendly, plain and simple superb. 
The hotel manager Thomas  was excellent, on our arrival due to this being a special birthday for my son he immediately upgraded one of the rooms. 
The place is a beautiful presented family owned boutique hotel, the rooms were of a very good standard and absolutely spotless. I cannot fault the hotel. 
We have stopped in some top hotels in London and this is an hotel we would definitely visit again. 
Mr and Mrs Edwards.",5,2021,12,05
113,A piece of heaven,"Just finished a 2 day stay in The Kensington after having to postpone a birthday trip to Paris. From the moment we arrived, service was exceptional, the luxury Studio Suite immaculate and the hotel atmosphere vibrant and elegant. Thomas the concierge is a huge asset to the hotel, the cherry on the top of a brilliant 5 star experience. Thanks also to Albina for our lovely welcome.",5,2021,12,04
113,Staying here is always a life highlight!,"This has been my favorite hotel in the world since 2012. Beautifully appointed rooms and an attentive staff make it a unique oasis in the heart of the city. The moment you walk through the doors you feel surrounded by elegance and luxury. My family and I can‚Äôt get enough of their breakfast spread- its delicious and convenient! The most recent time we stayed (fall 2021), Karan ensured that we had our favorite room, and wanted for nothing. So excited to return soon!",5,2021,12,03
113,Fantastic Stay at a Great Hotel!!!,"The hotel was great, the location was wonderful and the staff was beyond exceptional!  I cannot recommend The Kensington strongly enough - the four of us stayed there for the week and each day was made better than the previous by this wonderful collection of people!!

Karan was such a great host for our family - well done!

Can't wait to go again!",5,2021,12,01
113,Amazing stay,"We had such a lovely stay for my birthday at the Kensington.The room was decorated to make it extra special. My husband liaised with Boyan to make this all happen, upon arrival he was so helpful and ensured that we had a memorable stay. Will definitely recommend.",5,2021,11,29
113,Wonderful facility and outstanding service,"It's easy to see why the Kensington has garnered the outstanding reviews that led us there in the first place. The service was outstanding. We had an issue with our original room selection - no fault of the hotel's but one of the rooms we reserved was unoccupable - but Yannick and Anita at the front desk were extremely helpful and agreeable and made sure we were happy. 
 George the doorman quickly got to know us and was particularly helpful.  The rooms were very nice, but not beyond what you would expect in this price range. However, the common areas were incredible. The lobby, the bar and the restaurant, sitting areas etc were very comfortable and tastefully updated, and the service was always attentive.  Overall a great experience.",5,2021,11,28
113,It‚Äôs beginning to look like Christmas,A lovely stay. The staff were so helpful and friendly that I felt at home. Thank you especially to George for sharing some great tips about London!  I look forward to visiting again for their signature afternoon tea.,5,2021,11,28
113,Amazing stay !,"The hotel is beautiful and so amazingly decorated for Christmas ! Highly recommend staying here. The entire staff is so lovely especially the porter George ! He has such a good energy to him, an amazing first site upon entering the hotel.",5,2021,11,28
113,Just great,Great hotel with amazing service! The staff go above and beyond to make the experience as perfect as possible. The service makes all the difference here. Special thanks to Abdul and George (and Alexandra and Anna) whose impeccable service never fails to impress.,5,2021,11,26
113,30th Birthday Stay,"My surprised me and the kids to a hotel stay for 2 nights at The Kensington. He had the staff decorate the room too. It was lovely. They also were really accommodating in regards to the children. It was fantastic, made all the difference and the children thoroughly enjoyed. 
The staff were polite, friendly, accommodating and would always go the extra mile. 

The rooms are FANTASTICALLY clean and are cleaned throughout (if you pop out they straighten your bed and replenish the bathroom etc). 
Overall, I was very happy with the service and accommodation. I would highly recommend!!! 

There was a manager called Boyan whom my husband liased with to make this all happen. I had the pleasure of meeting him & he‚Äôs an absolute gentleman!",5,2021,11,21
113,Our favourite hotel in London and perfect for special occasions,"We stayed at The Kensington for my wife‚Äôs birthday, since it is our favourite hotel in London. 

The hotel has an elegant and relaxing atmosphere and the rooms are very comfortable. Albina and the team made our stay extra special, it was perfect from start to finish and one we will never forget. 

We are very grateful and look forward to our next stay.",5,2021,11,20
113,Fabulous,"Stayed two nights in the Kensington whilst visiting London to attend the Royal Albert Hall for the Festival of Remembrance. It is not cheap, but the service and standard really are 5 stars, so you get what you pay for.

Checked in at reception by Antonio who was brilliant. He explained about the hotel and brought out a fruit drink and hot towels, nice touch. He spent time chatting, explaining some of the local area and making us feel at ease. He saw us the next day too and again happy to chat and pass the time making us feel very welcome.

Had the first night‚Äôs dinner in the hotel restaurant. Again, it is not cheap but great food and service. Had the fish special as main course and it was very nice and cooked to perfection. The restaurant manager Konstantinos also spent time chatting and was happy to tell us about himself and his family.

Breakfast was continental buffet with hot food cooked to order. All very good as expected.

The front door was opened with a greeting each time we went in and out. We sat in the reception on an afternoon and just watched how good the doormen were, particularly Mario who came and chatted like an old friend. We were also spoken to by Thomas who again made us feel welcome and brought us a glass of bubbly and orange juice, again a very nice touch.

When we came back to the room on the last night after the performance at the Albert Hall there was a selection of confectionery with a card from the hotel, Thomas again, another very nice touch.

Our most notable thing about this hotel is the staff, there are many and they are all brilliant and do as much as they can to make your stay perfect, they are like a big family and make you feel you are part of that family. Sorry if we did not mention by name other members of the staff but they are all superb. If you are visiting Kensington and don‚Äôt mind paying for 5-star treatment then you will not be disappointed and be part of this 5-star family.",5,2021,11,16
113,Great hotel,"Fabulous, everything about this hotel is perfect if you are lookin for a boutique hotel in SW London. The restaurant is excellent too. The staff are friendly and exceptionally accommodating. Excellent hotel gym, really new equipment. ",5,2021,11,15
113,Better than ‚Äòexcellent‚Äô,"We often stay at this fantastic hotel, as the level of service is impeccable. However, the standard of care and welcome afforded us in the past 24 hours was beyond compare. 

The hotel manager, Karan, could not have been more hospitable, nothing was too much trouble and he made our visit feel unbelievably special. As a consequence, we will continue to make the Kensington our first choice when in London. 

Thank you to all members of staff - at all levels - for such an amazing experience. Each and every one of you are a credit to The Doyle Collection.",5,2021,11,13
113,The Best ever stay in London,"I would like to say a big thank you to Karan and all the team for my birthday stay at The Kensington. 
The service we received was amazing they went above and beyond any expectations. George was also amazing , as were all the staff we came into contact with. 
I am now on my way home feeling extremely happy.",5,2021,11,12
113,Look forward to returning,"We had a beautiful two days  at The Kensington it should have been longer but due to an unfortunate water pipe bursting all guests had to leave.   
Both my daughter and my rooms were beautiful, stylishly laid out with thoughtful touches. My room the deluxe double was spacious.  The breakfasts were delicious and promptly served.  The concierge team were professional, helpful and friendly. I felt they dealt with their unexpected issue extremely well.",5,2021,11,10
113,Best Possible Start to our Belated Honeymoon,"This is now the 4th time my wife and I have stayed at the Kensington Hotel. For the last 3 yrs, this staff has done everything humanly possible to make our stay a memorable one.

This particular stay of ours (our belated honeymoon 18 months delayed) was enhanced by the incredible attention to detail that Antonio and his staff displayed. 

They started off with a wonderful welcome of a refreshment and hot towel. Then given the special occasion, informed us of a comolentary room upgrade. Thrilled as we were about that, we returned to our room later the next evening with a display of roses and swan towels on the bed, some chocolates, a slice of cake, and a couple of cocktails to congratulate us on our honeymoon.

The following day, Antonio decided to top it off with a round of champagne and breakfast on him. 

There is a reason why my wife and I keep coming back here. It's not just the rooms, or the bar, or the location. It's the people here that take pride in what they do. Whether concierge, bellman, doorman, server, or bartender, their hospitality is second to nine. They take the time to tell a story, to give directions or advice about the neighborhood, to show you around, to share their favorite things to order at the bar. It is as if they are opening the doors to their own home to you. You don't get this anywhere else.

Thank you, Antonio and Staff, for starting our honeymoon on the right foot. You are appreciated 100x over.",5,2021,11,07
113,Excellent afternoon tea,"The afternoon tea in the restaurant in The Kensington was excellent. I specially appreciated the theme London Landmarks. The sweet pastries were in shape of some London Landmarks, I really liked it. The service was excellent. I really recommend.",4,2021,11,06
113,Casual drinks,"Came to The Kensington for birthday drinks and Karan, the manager, was very welcoming. The service was excellent and he ensured we enjoyed the evening 10/10! Was extremely satisfied with every need being catered for. Would definitely recommend coming to The Kensington! Thank you Karan.",5,2021,11,05
113,Horribly noisy rooms,Rooms are suuuper noisy - no insulation whatsoever. You can hear literally everything what s happening in the neighbouring rooms plus all the corridor noise. Floor panels are also noisy and moving when you walk so not very nice experience. Room was also super super tiny. Location excellent. ,2,2021,11,01
113,Excellent stay once again,"Excellent stay in this great hotel. Very nice room with a really comfortable bed and spotlessly clean.Thoroughly enjoyed breakfast. All of the staff are very friendly and helpful. George, the doorman, is a star.",5,2021,10,31
113,Absolutely Fabulous,Stayed here over the weekend and I can‚Äôt recommend enough!! Location is excellent and close to two underground stations. The staff were more than welcoming and very kind in all regards. Will definitely be staying again!,5,2021,10,31
113,Back to its best !,"The hotel has even improved post COVID . Rooms and public areas beautiful but more Imp the team is functioning very well . The relaxed lounge with great service worked very well for small meetings and the Bar was very comfortable. 

",5,2021,10,30
113,Staff could be better trained,"The location is great within easy reach of South Kensington tube station.  Rooms are very nice, if a little small, but it was clean and comfortable.
Paid for breakfast in advance but on the first morning we picked up a menu where everything was separately priced and was a bit confused - it wasn't made clear that we had pre-paid and could have what we wanted from the menu without paying extra.  Obviously we could (and should) have asked, but it felt a bit awkward.  An explanation up front would have been much better.
The first thing our server said was 'do you want to order food for the kid?' - meaning our 10 year old son.  She wasn't being rude intentionally, English clearly wasn't her first language, but still...and so we had to say that we would actually ALL like to order some food please.  And it went on like that.  Nothing terrible, but not as good as you would expect for a rather pricey hotel and the staff did not appear to have been very well trained.  Two breakfast orders were taken out of three, and again we had to ask, can the third person in our party also order. (?)  We were then told there were no potato cakes available that day on the standard breakfast, as per the menu, and there was also no alternative.  Why could the chef not just cook an alternative potato accompaniment?  Any half-decent pub chef would have easily managed that, so why can't The Kensington?  When the orders arrived there were an extra couple of eggs that we hadn't ordered.  Next door's table's order had also gone wrong.  
One day we got a choice of bacon, one day we didn't.  Sometimes they asked each of us what toast we would like, sometimes they didn't.  The staff were apologetic about mistakes and it didn't matter to us, but they just didn't seem very clear on what they were doing. 
The second day we were not informed about the missing breakfast item, yet it was still missing.  Ketchup and mayonnaise (??) were provided on the table but we had to ask for brown sauce, as if they couldn't have pre-empted that by just providing it.
Not the end of the world but just a little strange! The coffee was rather weak and plates were left to be cleared and juices were running out, whilst staff in fancy suits were asking us 'Is everything ok?' and wanting polite little chats - and again we had to point out to them what needed doing.  We would have preferred less of the chat and more just common sense in running the breakfast room.
Small points, but it all added up to not being very professional, a bit like hard work and not feeling like very good value for money at all.",3,2021,10,29
113,October,"This is a very good choice for solo female travellers. It's in a great location, the reception rooms are lovely and the staff are very attentive. The doorman was particularly helpful when I was leaving, ",4,2021,10,27
113,Lovely hotel and even better experience,"Upon arrival at the hotel the front of house staff were really polite and friendly. The room was a good size, very comfortable and well equipped. The location was excellent for a walk to local attractions and easy to get into the city. The food at the hotel was excellent and the service and friendliness shown to us by all the staff throughout our stay was exemplary",5,2021,10,26
113,Another Wonderful Stay,"This was my third stay at The Kensington and, I have to say, it is becoming a firm favourite on visits to London. This time I came with my husband and daughter for a long weekend.

The staff have always been really welcoming and this time was no exception. 

On arrival, we were welcomed by Yannick, the Front of House manager, who had remembered me from my last stay and politely asked how my Mother was. This personal touch makes such a difference to an arrival after a long journey. 

When we got to our room my daughter was delighted to see a little teepee at the head of the extra bed set up for her and which was also delightfully comfortable.

We stayed two nights, but this time refrained from breakfast, as we had planned three incredibly full days of sightseeing and a Musical matin√©e at the West End: and needed to be on the move early each morning.  Having breakfast would have meant we would not have wanted to leave, it is a delight though, and was much missed on this occasion.

The hotel was beautifully warm and bustling with people. The gentlemen who work on the door as ‚Äòmeet and greet‚Äô work tirelessly and deserve a special mention.  

It is so lovely to see the place come back to life post-covid and it was a joy to return to our beautifully furnished and comfortable room each evening.

The recent refurbishment at this hotel has meant that beds have been selected based on their comfiness. They are, without a doubt, one of, if not the most comfortable I have slept in on my travels.

In my opinion, if you choose to stay you absolutely will not be disappointed as you will have the BEST night‚Äôs sleep.

We did not get to enjoy the Turn Down service this time as my daughter fell asleep early each evening but it was offered at about 7.30pm each evening.

Goodbye for now. We look forward to booking once more and intend to stay again in Dec/Jan.",5,2021,10,26
113,The Kensington was a home away from home,"We were warmly welcomed and whisked into the cozy anteroom with a flickering  fireplace.  Our room was charming.  The breakfast experience was delightful with well prepared dishes and a helpful cheerful group of servers. 

Every day when we returned from an excursion in the city, the polite courteous staff members would inquire how our day went and where we had gone, showing genuine interest.

When we announced the birth of our new grandson, a fruit plate and bottle of wine was delivered to our room compliments of the hotel.   A very nice gesture and something we will always remember. 

The Kensington Hotel is situated within walking distance to many wonderful restaurants, shops, bakeries and the ‚Äútube‚Äù.

We highly recommend staying at The Kensington.",5,2021,10,25
113,Family birthday city break,"We stayed at the Kensington for a family break celebrating a special birthday. The rooms were beautiful; very spacious and beds so comfortable, service impeccable, and nothing was too much trouble. The staff were very helpful with a special mention to George and his guidance about places to visit! 
As a family of coeliacs often we struggle with dining out but the breakfasts were delicious with an excellent choice. Thank you and we hope to be back again.",5,2021,10,25
113,Mrs,This was my first stay at the hotel and I was very impressed with all aspects. I was greeted in a very friendly and professional manner by Antonio and that set the tone for the entire stay.  The bar and salon area are lovely and the staff could not do enough for us. Having stayed at many hotels in London I will definitely stay here again.,5,2021,10,24
113,"Beautiful hotel, personalised service, great location",Hotel booked for my wife's 50th birthday. Beautiful hotel and decor with wonderful customer service. Nothing was too much trouble and lovely touches to help us celebrate - a particular thanks to Karan. All other staff were also very welcoming including George who was great at helping us with travel. We also had 3 Coeliac's in our party who required gluten free food and menus were amended so they could still enjoy the wonderful food. Many thanks to you all - we look forward to seeing you again!,5,2021,10,24
113,Our perfect ‚Äòhome‚Äô in London.,"The Kensington Hotel is our ‚Äòhome‚Äô in London. We wouldn‚Äôt consider staying anywhere else‚Ä¶ we cannot pay this hotel & its staff enough compliments. 

What a Welcome!
‚Ä¶Thomas, Guest Relations, greets us in the Reception Area‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs so dapper, efficient & full of smiles. 
The staff are personable & polite‚Ä¶ nothing is too much trouble. 
Their leader, the GM, Mr Francesco Sardelli, then welcomes us back‚Ä¶ respected by his staff, he‚Äôs charming, friendly‚Ä¶ & truly enjoys contact with his guests. 

Further walking into the hotel‚Ä¶ Friday evening‚Ä¶ & we‚Äôre met by the buzz of the attractive & popular K Bar. 

George, our friendly Porter, then guides us to our pretty  suite, spotlessly clean, on the 5th floor‚Ä¶ interestingly overlooking the rooftops. A suite, so well appointed, with a contemporary twist in this elegant townhouse hotel. 

Attention to detail is exceptional here‚Ä¶ always beautiful fabrics, decor‚Ä¶

Next day‚Ä¶ breakfast in one of the relaxing, homely, well appointed Lounges. 
Our host, Daniel, in his smart bold-checked suit‚Ä¶ again so personable.

We wish The Kensington & it‚Äôs staff ‚Äòthe best‚Äô in these challenging times‚Ä¶ so deserved!!!",5,2021,10,23
113,last minute cocktails with the girls,"The wonderful staff found a table available for us with a five minute warning.  They were. nothing but polite, respectful and charming.    The ambience was superb, sumptuous surroundings and excellent service",5,2021,10,21
113,"Super hotel, lovely location, terrific staff","It was my husband's 6oth birthday and we were going to the Albert Hall to see Gregory Porter. I discovered The Kensington Hotel online, and booked a Deluxe room as a treat and I'm so glad I did as it was amazing. The bed was a four poster and totally gorgeous, and the wallpaper was beautiful too. I even admired the huge yellow and blue silk drapes. The whole effect was a bit 'oriental'. The marble bathroom was to die for and had a ‚ÄòTile TV‚Äô facing the bath, which actually worked! My teenage son and his girlfriend came up to see the room and it was described as 'Extra' in awed tones. I believe this is modern day parlance for meaning ‚Äòvery good indeed‚Äô. We all enjoyed the London Landmarks Afternoon Tea which was a lovely birthday treat for my husband. Be warned, you will be plied with more cake than even someone who only eats cake could eat. We really enjoyed the savoury starters to our Afternoon Tea too. The next day we visited the V&A museum. That, and the Albert Hall were within walking distance (as long as you can walk for 10-15 mins) so all amounted to a very relaxing weekend break. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. Thomas was around near the door all weekend and seemed to genuinely enjoy chatting to visitors and doing his job. I was very impressed with the decor throughout the public areas, all beautifully put together and had real character. Artwork on the walls was very nice too. There was nothing I didn‚Äôt like about the whole weekend. Our only problem was I‚Äôd booked the Afternoon Tea by phoning the front desk, and the booking had not made it through to the Restaurant, so when we arrived to be seated we were not expected. However, it was dealt with well, and we were looked after until a table was sorted, the delay was probably only five minutes. Bravo to The Kensington, I would come back in a heartbeat, and have no reservations in recommending anyone to go and stay.",5,2021,10,21
113,Amazing. Will definitely be returning.,"I booked a one night stay as a surprise for my husbands birthday.
On arrival we received a very warm welcome, which was just as attentative throughout our stay.
Karan Barot, I have to say, was a delight and made our stay so lovely.
Thank you The Kensington - Loved every second.
We WILL be returning.
Mrs Toni Purcell",5,2021,10,21
113,Amazing afternoon tea!,The warm and friendly welcome from the staff and the relaxed atmosphere made my birthday afternoon tea with my daughter a truly wonderful experience. The pastry chef is absolutely incredible! The champagne was in a generous glass and surprisingly good value.,5,2021,10,19
113,Afternoon Tea,"Afternoon tea here us very special. The ‚Äòlandmark‚Äô theme is very clever and witty. I was served a vegetarian option, which was good, whilst friends had the conventional omni- option. Abdul, our waiter was polite, professional and brought fresh tea at intervals.
You get 1.5-2 hours at your table, depending upon demand. This might mean a short wait is required, even if you have booked. I would think booking is essential as the place was packed on a Monday. The hotel is delightfully decorated and close to South Ken. Underground.",5,2021,10,19
113,Luxury in Kensington,The hotel and staff did not disappoint on our short break. A taste of pure luxury. Will definitely be a repeat visitor as i couldn‚Äôt imagine anywhere better. Well done everyone at the hotel you are amazing.,5,2021,10,16
113,Great to be back !,"Great experience again, so pleased to be back traveling and the first hotel I could think of when returning to London was the Kensington! First time since Covid and the hygiene was very well implemented, the staff as ever so helpful and professional, there was an incident involving my dry cleaning which was sorted out to my expectations! I was also lucky enough to be in one of the new renovated rooms, I can only recommend. Thank you all, Antonio, George, Barbara, Anita and those who make up the great team!",5,2021,10,16
113,A very good choice. ,"Good choice. Second time here (first since the before times.) Very happy hotel, nice rooms (bit small but hey it's London. ) staff is great. Loved breakfast and the bar is stellar, with great cocktails (highly recommendthe basil smash.). Most of the staff wears masks, a comfort to the New Yorkers in the group. Would definitely return. ",4,2021,10,14
113,"As a neighbour, used to love coming here for drinks with friends by the fireplaces","For over three years, having a townhouse in Kensington, we have loved coming here at various times of year to sit by the blazing fires with friends and our dogs having cocktails, as recently as last Sunday. 

However, tonight, we call before arriving to make sure they could book us a table by the fire (we specify with our two dogs, as always) -  we arrive and for the first time in years, someone tells us, the night deputy manager, Motiur Taj, the dogs are not allowed, only in the rooms and outside.

We tried to explain to him repeatedly that we have been here as recently as just a few days ago with dogs and friends sitting by the fire, and he kept saying he‚Äôs sorry ‚Äúwe received misinformation,‚Äù as though we just called one time were told the dogs are allowed when they aren‚Äôt.

We kept trying to explain to him that we‚Äôve been coming frequently for several years as neighbours, we even asked him does he even know the drink we normally order that they only just recently took off the menu (he didn‚Äôt). 

It would‚Äôve been less infuriating if he had at least been respectful and apologetic, but instead it‚Äôs like he didn‚Äôt understand a word we said the entire time (and we speak multiple foreign languages, so it is not an excuse to have a language barrier, nonetheless if you are in management, at a hotel, in an English speaking country), so we wanted to bash our heads through a wall. 

Such a shame as they were closed for quite a long time to do refurbishments independent of lockdowns, and they are basically empty every time we visit, including tonight when he said they are packed (we took a video of how it completely empty they were, as usual, but tridadvisor won‚Äôt allow videos).",1,2021,10,14
113,Mid week break.,"Following the usual search for a night at the chintzy hotels for a so called described ‚Äòbargain break‚Äô came across The Kensingon on TripAdvisor and decided to take a look, we arrived three hours early and met by Karan  who instantly reassured my wife and I by his warmth and friendliness we had got lucky with our choice of hotel.

Karan made us feel nothing was too much trouble during our stay  and arriving before the scheduled time was not an issue, in fact we were even upgraded to a mini suite on the fifth floor and he even took us to our room , we were highly impressed to say the least .

Super discovery, if your preference is quality service where the staff actually remembered our names this hotel is for you. Incredibly clean, terrific food, the best bar in London for sophistication and top value for money, believe me as a seasoned mature traveller as value for money you cannot get a better hotel in London and we have done most of them at some stage.

Summary
I think it‚Äôs after you have checked out, then paid the bill one is often left thinking was it value for money ? My conclusion was absolutely , can't wait to go again, and ps, super lovely walks in the vicinity ‚Ä¶",5,2021,10,14
113,Our New Favourite Hotel in London,"We booked a room to stay local to our neighbourhood whilst work was being done on our apartment. However we quickly discovered that The Kensington is hands-down the best hotel in London for a gracious experience with a staff who goes above and beyond.
The hotel itself is beautiful, quintessentially British, with gorgeous drawing rooms and an at the same time modern but old school bar. We were upgraded to a suite which was smartly decorated and spacious. The bathroom had marble tile, a large double sink, and a separate bathtub and shower. 

The staff at The Kensington are what truly makes the hotel special. The doormen always greet with smiles, and most every member of the staff is courteous, friendly, and helpful. Karan the manager went out of his way to make sure our stay was seamless. Fabio, the bar manager made sure that no matter how busy it was, my husband and I had a comfortable place to sit to enjoy a cocktail. Sebastian and Abdu were always there to greet us, to deliver us a pot of tea to our room or serve us a cocktail by the fire in one of the beautiful drawing rooms. Sebastian even sent me a plate of chocolate covered strawberries and sweets when he learned that I'd just received some good personal news. 

Also, for those who are into fitness, the gym is very well equipped for a hotel. There are plenty of machines and the weights are more than adequate compared to many hotels. There is even a punching bag, which you never see!

Honestly, the hotel itself is gorgeous enough on its own, but the staff make The Kensington top notch. Not only is The Kensington the only place we will send family and friends when they come to visit, but my husband and I will return again and again to share an aperitif at the bar or in front of the fire....And to say hello to the friends we made during our stay. 

*note: the only reason I gave sleep quality 4 stars is because our room tended to be noisy. It was close to the elevator, which makes a clicking sound when it's in operation. Also, as the hotel is clearly a historic building the hallway floors were loud when people walked by faster than a slow pace.",5,2021,10,14
113,Lovely hotel - good west London location,"We stayed a few months ago and had a few problems with the stay. The issues were tackled by Yannis who encouraged us to return.
We did and checked out last weekend. It was a such a lovely experience. This time around the hotel got so much right and really gave wonderful customer service. We really love the hotel and have stayed 3 times now. It has a lovely relaxed vibe but still high standards. 
This time we had lots of dealing with Tom the front of house man. What a top bloke. So friendly and thoughtful. Really put in a huge amount of effort to make our stay enjoyable. His attention to detail was impressive and really made the stay exciting for all the family, especially our little ones! Really great stay. We will always return
",5,2021,10,13
113,Disappointing,"I was not going to leave a negative review but can see we are not alone. Despite some lovely attention to detail I have to say the room was too small, next to an elevator and air con unit. 

The person who served us in the bar was incredibly dismissive and made us feel awful for asking to serve us a drink. Reading other reviews I have realised our experience was like many others. A very expensive visit which was disappointing.",2,2021,10,11
113,Excellent,"I‚Äôve stayed here many times and always a pleasure. Some new faces since lockdown Yannick and Karan, but no drop in the attention to detail. Perfect location and Connie providing a welcome at the door.",5,2021,10,11
113,Give it a try!,"We were looking for a room in London on short notice; I had never heard of The Kensington, but the location worked and pricing was favourable; this is a proper good quality hotel, we had a great night's sleep in a comfortable bed in a spotless room with 5 star comfort; and breakfast was tip-top.",5,2021,10,11
113,Fabulous stay at a fabulous hotel,"Brilliant stay as a treat with a friend at this lovely hotel.  The staff could not have been more helpful, with Yannick even arranging V&A tickets for us in advance. The service was perfect - attentive and personal but never over-the-top. Room was excellent, with a really luxury finish. Drinks in the bar were exceptional, and the atmosphere was great. Highly recommended, and we‚Äôll be back.",5,2021,10,10
113,Enjoy  the afternoon tea at the Kensington,"Me and a couple of friends we finally visited The Kensington after we have been already in other company‚Äôs venues. We had an amazing time  on a busy Saturday afternoon. The atmosphere is relaxing and the staff is attentive to the client needs. We had a problem with the afternoon tea starter, we order the vegan but we received the normal. Francesco quickly realized the mistake and  promptly send the starters again.The stands are lovely and everything is perfectly made and fresh, we highly suggest to try it. A big thank you also to Sebastian our waiter!",5,2021,10,10
113,Amazing amazing amazing,"Our stay at The Kensington was absolutely amazing. Every staff member was friendly, positive, and helpful during our stay. The food was amazing, and the beds were very comfortable. The bar is especially nice. George was amazing, and so friendly! Highly Highly recommend staying here.",5,2021,10,10
113,The Wright Family,"My Family stayed at the Kensington as part of a wedding party. The team were beyond helpful! We needed a florist, they took care of the whole order. We needed a hairdresser, they found one. We needed a car park, they had one locally and provided us with discount. The doormen helped carry bags and with our children and prams, they chased down taxis to get us to the church on time. Hotel staff made sure no glass was left empty, we were provided with some early check ins to ensure all guests had someone to get changed on time. The morning after the wedding the staff knew everyone‚Äôs names and asked how the wedding went, they called the bride by her new married name at breakfast and showed a genuine interest in our day. We will definitely be returning for a family Christmas in the hotel that feels like a home from home. Thank you to all at The Kensington! ",5,2021,10,10
113,Nice rooms but that doesn‚Äôt mean you can enjoy a bar drink,"Great rooms and could be brilliant but if you are staying, don‚Äôt expect to have a drink at the K Bar because it‚Äôs not for you, it‚Äôs already booked. If you find someone from the hotel staff not attending the K Bar they may seat you in the granny area and bring you a cocktail menu in 30 minutes - or you could just go to bed instead",3,2021,10,08
113,Wedding weekend at the Kensington!,"We stayed at The Kensington for 3 nights the weekend of our wedding in Chelsea. We both absolutely ADORED this hotel. 

The interior and exterior designs are gorgeous and so elegant, while still feeling very warm and inviting.

We stayed in the Deluxe King room and it was very spacious. The bathtub was huge and so beautiful right next to the window in the room. There was plenty of storage space, a desk, a decent sized bathroom and shower, a safe, mini bar, etc. 

The staff was very helpful and prompt! Anything we asked for, they delivered and if they couldn‚Äôt deliver, they helped us figure out a solution. They always remembered to get back to us on any questions and we never had to follow up again and remind. 

Milind was particularly helpful to me during our stay and even beforehand. He helped ensure the best room for me to get ready in, ensuring the lighting was bright enough for makeup to be done for the wedding day. He also sorted out champagne and chocolate covered strawberries to be in our room upon arrival which was a great touch to get our wedding weekend started! Thank you so much for your outstanding service, Milind!! You helped make our stay and our wedding weekend extra special!!! 

The dining area for breakfast is lovely. I will say the service could be a bit slow and sometimes you did have to remind them of something you ordered, but most everyone was friendly and the food was tasty! 

We will definitely be staying here again to relive our perfect wedding weekend at The Kensington!!",5,2021,10,06
113,Outstanding service,"A very warm welcome awaits you with George the doorman, being shown through to the busy but cosy K Bar. Sat at the bar the service was impeccable, water poured, bar snacks provided... Onto the cocktails... WOW best I had during a 3 night stay to London. Expertly made by Jordan the cocktails were sublime, I was treated to an evening with Jordan catering to my preferences and she even made a cocktail I'd never had before because it was her own creation. I couldn't fault any of the drinks, perfection. All the staff were fabulous and polite and friendly. Highly recommend a visit to The K Bar, you won't be disappointed.",5,2021,10,06
113,Unique coctails,Warm welcome by George who showed us to the cosy bar area. Tried a couple of cocktails from the menu then had some unique cocktails made by Jordan based on our likes. Definitely worth a visit if you‚Äôre in the area,5,2021,10,04

113,Fabulous stay at The Kensington.,"My friend and I treated ourselves to a night at The Kensington where we were greeted by very welcoming reception staff. Our room was beautifully clean and very comfortable. We had beautiful drinks at the bar and a very tasty breakfast the next morning. Big shout out to doorman George who was very kind and a great laugh to talk to.

Thank you George and all the staff at The Kensington, glad to see you open again.",5,2021,10,01

113,Fantastic Hotel,"Excellent Hotel‚Ä¶.     I would most certainly recommend it.
The staff are second to none, most attentive, polite and helpful. Antonio at the front desk was so pleasant and knowledgeable, the staff are a great asset to The Kensington‚Ä¶..

Thank you for an wonderful stay‚Ä¶‚Ä¶",5,2021,09,30
113,One person can make the experience!,"We were staying in the neighborhood and I had noticed The Kensington.  On our very last night in London, I suggested to my husband that after our very long day, we should just walk over to The Kensington and check out the bar to have a drink and perhaps some light meal.  As we walked in we were greeted warmly by the doorman, who enquired about our day.  We responded it had been delightful, but we really wanted a drink!  He escorted us to the bar thru a Solon and said we were welcome to either.  He then went even further to make sure we were introduced to the hostess.  We decided to sit by the fire in the salon.  He came back to check on us and even took our drink order himself.  Perhaps we looked like we needed one!  He came back several times and gave us some history of the building.
Thomas Ketting, the doorman, will be the reason that I book The Kensington should I return..hopefully when I return to London.
Our small meal was delish, and the others who served us were friendly and kind as well.
One person can and does make a difference.",5,2021,09,29
113,How on earth our room was classed as a deluxe in five star hotel in the heart of Kensington is beyond me! Shocking,"The room was extremely bland with no pictures and the view was terrible.  There was a rattling noise from our AC unit that also vented over the bed which is extremely unpleasant.  The direction of the door opening was ridiculous. The bathroom was poorly grouted and not refurbished (as we were told when we checked in), the shower door did not seal so water went all over the bathroom floor. The shower needed descaling, there was no handheld shower.  The lighting was really poor - to have the bedside lights and ceiling lights not independently controlled is not what you'd expect from a deluxe room in a 5 star London hotel - it's just cheap.  The plug sockets in the headboard moved. The tap water was horrible and undrinkable. Noisy doors. The wrong breakfast was delivered and the breakfast was a really poor standard.  When we both ordered coffee with our breakfast we did not expect two cold cups of coffee to arrive.  Surely for the class of hotel and location you could stretch to providing a cafetiere! The channels loaded on the tv itself were incorrectly listed.  How on earth you can class our room as a deluxe in a 5 star London hotel is absurd!  ",1,2021,09,28
113,excellent place to stay in London,"the Kensington Hotel is my absolute favorite hotel for a stay in London. perfect trained stuff and extremly friendly and helpful. The area and surrundings are perfect for parks, museums and of course closed to the famous shopping hot spots in London. also for business travellers a great place. easy to reach and closed to 2 underground stations.
",5,2021,09,27
113,Amazing service and lovely place to stay,We had 5 star treatment and the breakfast was amazing - all included in our deal. Staff remembered what we‚Äôd been up to and even left a little birthday cake in the room for my cousin on her birthday! Super comfy beds and very quiet. Couldn‚Äôt recommend more highly.,5,2021,09,24
113,What a gem,"Booked The Kensington due to its location and proximity to Chelsea Flower Show. We were greeted warmly and attended to efficiently. Antonio at the front desk was very reassuring and attentive, upgrading us to a beautifully appointed spacious family room. 

The Property is exquisite and felt personal, the food served was delicious. 

Will definitely be visiting again.",5,2021,09,23
113,Re-UnitedKingdom After 30+ Years,"College study abroad friends reunited 30+ years later to picnic in the Queen‚Äôs backyard! 7 fabulous days in the UK‚Äôs fabulous Central London. Our stay at The Kensington was perfect. A lovely corner room, well appointed with all the luxury‚Äôs we had hoped for was sunny and offered excellent views on two sides. Breakfast was included each morning and was excellent; most notable were the scrambled eggs with salmon and the avocado toast with poached eggs. The hotel bar had a swanky atmosphere and the bartender, more rightfully called a mixologist, not only made us innovative and delicious cocktails but also introduced us the the delightful Fischer‚Äôs gin! What a treat that was. The concierge, Karen‚Äôs, attention to detail was top notch. He secured us reservations at some of London‚Äôs best restaurants and helped us craft an itinerary which perfectly suited our desires to see more than just the usual tourist attractions. (Including a picnic at Buckingham Palace) Thank you Kennsington hotel for a fabulous vacation! Take care of our son who is living around the corner this semester and we will see you again in the future!",5,2021,09,23
113,Perfect place to stay for a London trip!,"Absolutely loved our stay at the Kensington. The staff was so helpful and friendly, a true 5 star hotel experience.

Overall just a wonderful hotel, absolutely recommend! Also loved Antonio at the front desk who was so helpful and made us feel so welcome.",5,2021,09,23
113,Outstanding hotel and concierge service,"Outstanding hotel, service, amenities and overall experience. Great location in the heart of South Kensington. In particular, concierge Karan Barot was fabulous - from his restaurant recommendations/bookings, guidance on activities and personal attention to detail. He made our visit easy to plan and much more enjoyable throughout. Will come back to stay for this reason alone.",5,2021,09,22
113,A wonderful one night stay,"Outstanding personal service throughout our stay, particularly from Antonio on Reception. 
Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff we encountered. 
Beautiful and extremely comfortable room with many lovely touches. Fabulous bathroom and amenities. 
The only negative was having to leave after just one night, but looking forward to our next visit already!",5,2021,09,20
113,A beautiful stay,"This is our second time at The Kensington and despite some initial hiccups regarding our room, the staff went completely above and beyond to remedy the situation which was truly appreciated.  The room we stayed in (323) was incredibly comfortable and it was beautifully peaceful.  Breakfast was delicious and once again we wholeheartedly recommend a stay at this hotel.",5,2021,09,19
113,do not even think of going to this hotel,"when I say do not go to this hotel what I actually mean is do not go to this hotel unless you want to experience  truly unbeleavable service from the time you are greeted at the front door. My wife and myself have just returned from a wonderful weekend celebrating our annerversary that was made extra special from all the staff, in particular Sabestian in the bar who my wife said makes the best french 75 she has ever tasted, Karan,who with his great local knowledge and contacts arranged special places for us to visit. And last, but not least Thomas who greeted us with such passion remembering us from our previous visit three weeks earlier having afternoon tea. we would not hesitate to recomend this hotel to our friends or family. Thank you once again ALL at The Kensington.",5,2021,09,12
113,Excellent Stay!,"We stayed at The Kensington Hotel for two nights in one of the deluxe king rooms. The staff were extremely welcoming and attentive, in particular Ronnie and Karan. This hotel is definitely worth the five star rating with its great location, cleanliness and service. Thank you The Kensington for your wonderful hospitality!",5,2021,09,12
113,A charming little  hotel,"The hotel is cozy, elegant and charming.
The retro ambience of the Bar is great. And you can feel very relax while having a drink.
Breakfasts are delicious. Room 110 - a suite- is nicely decorated. With good taste. 
The staff is kind and always ready to help. 
All of them: front desk, restaurant, bell boys and housekeeper.
If you need something or looking for anything go and see Karan at the front desk he will gladly find it  for you.
My son and I had a long stay. And we did enjoy it.",5,2021,09,12
113,Superb favourite Hotel,"This Hotel is superb, simply because the staff the Manager Thomas and his team are so helpful and really care about the people that stay there superb.
The room was decorated to perfection the cleanliness 10/10, we have stayed in many hotels but this is my favourite",5,2021,09,09
113,Relaxing and memorable stay,"What a beautiful hotel ! From the moment of check in to the final departure, my daughter and I enjoyed a comfortable and enriching 2 days at this lovely hotel. A perfect base for exploring central London. The room was large and spacious with comfortable beds. The breakfast was excellent - great coffee and perfect fruit and yoghurt; perfect porridge and delicious cooked options. All staff went above and beyond to make this a memorable stay. Would definitely return with enthusiasm!",5,2021,09,08
113,A tremendous stay from start to finish,"I arrived with my husband and our one year old daughter for a weeks stay. Immediately it was evident that it would be a very personal service. The staff got to know our names and were always there to help us whether it be helping us up/down steps with our buggy, organising massages, sending up new towels when we asked for extra. You name it, everything was done perfectly with a smile. If only every establishment could be quite this wonderful. 
We particularly enjoyed all our chats with everyone and they were so accommodating especially to our daughter! Thomas put a smile on our faces every day :) Thank you for everything. See you soon. We can't wait to come back.
I recommend this hotel very highly. ",5,2021,09,06
113,Excellent family friendly boutique hotel,"I have stayed at the Kensington a number of times for business and leisure and it never disappoints. The hotel is incredibly well maintained with beautiful elegant decor  throughout and the most comfortable rooms that you never want to leave. What makes this hotel stand out from the crowd  is the staff they make you feel at home as soon as you arrive and nothing is ever too much trouble. That for me is the sign of a well run hotel.  
  
This was the fist time we have taken our two children (5&7) and the team could not have done any more to look after them and made them feel very special. Thomas the Guest Relations Manager went out of his way to make a fuss giving them two lovely teddies and chocolates which they absolutely loved.",5,2021,08,31
113,Lovely clean hotel staff very friendly,"The hotel was really lovely, the public areas within it were beautiful.
The room was very clean, the decor of our room was not to my taste but the bathroom was tasteful. The staff were very friendly and accommodating.  The cost of breakfast was a little high for us country bumpkins but I'm sure standard prices for high end London hotels.",4,2021,08,30
113,Stunning hotel with a luxury charm to it!,"My partner and I stayed at The Kensington for 1 night in August 2021. We had very high expectations for this hotel having read previous reviews and heard a lot about the hotel online and our stay far exceeded such expectations; it was nothing short of brilliant!

The hotel itself is located close to all local attractions. Interiors of the hotel are elegant and exude a subtle sense of luxury. Our room (which was kindly upgraded for free upon arrival) featured plush decor, with an ornate bathtub in the bedroom and a gorgeous marble bathroom suite.

Dining at The Kensington was equally brilliant; we dined in the outdoor area known as The Veranda and while it is off of the main road area, it was nonetheless a very enjoyable and fashionable experience. There is an extensive all-day menu and drinks list. Breakfast was served in The Drawing Room and was amazing - by far one of the best hotel breakfasts that I have experienced!

Staff at The Kensington were constantly eager to assist me and knew me by name upon seeing and greeting me each and every time. Our room was also serviced multiple times throughout the day, with complimentary treats such as a fruit platter and a note left in the room ready for our return.

I extend my warmest thanks to Karan and Ronnie for their absolutely fabulous customer service and kind-natured welcomes that we constantly received throughout the day. They are truly exemplary of what it means to provide luxury, warm, and friendly service to fellow guests.",5,2021,08,26
113,Brilliant stay,"Brilliant stay in a very charming hotel. Very comfortable and clean. Every single member of the staff were welcoming and attentive, without being too much. Good breakfast served to you in a nicely decorated breakfast room. Really enjoyed our three days here!",5,2021,08,26
113,Anniversary Stay with special touches,"We decided to spend our 5th wedding anniversary here. From the moment we arrived at the front of the hotel we was greeted so politely, warmly and welcoming. The receptionist lady was very warm, professional and helpful, even offer to show us to our rooms, as well as being offered help with our overnight bags. The room was lovely, clean, spacious, well presented, the marble bathroom was lovely. After we had settled into our room Thomas the guest experience manager arrived at our door with a anniversary cake a rose and hand written anniversary card. We arrived for dinner an meet by Joanna who was ever so accommodating, helpful and welcoming, Joanna made the start of the evening pleasant and even engaging in little conversation made it feel more welcoming. During dinner this was when we met Ardit our waiter, he was very welcoming, very, professional and helpful. He even took our photos for us and even showed us the amazing staircase an library in the hotel. Ardit made sure our night was going well even engaging in conversation which made the atmosphere more welcoming easy and pleasing. Dinner was lovely. Thomas also got us a seat outside to watch London in the warm night. On arriving back to our room, the bed had been sorted for us to get into with our slippers out by the side. Overall we had an amazing evening and the added little extras provided for our anniversary was so kind thoughtful and considerate. Thomas, Ardit and Joanna are amazing people who went the extra mile and effort and are a key asset to the Hotel.  We look forward to returning some point in the near future. Thanks",5,2021,08,23
113,Ren,"I visited The Kensington with family during August and had an amazing stay, and it was entirely thanks to Karan. He‚Äôs incredibly personable, kind, and made us feel incredibly special for every second of our month-long stay. We could also see that he treated each guest with the same incredible kindness and care, and it‚Äôs clear that he‚Äôs made their stays special as well. He is exceptional at customer service and really exemplifies a ‚Äúcustomer first‚Äù attitude. The Kensington is so fortunate to have him and we were very lucky to have met him!",5,2021,08,23
113,Lovely Family City Break,"Just returned from a lovely city break in London and a wonderful experience in The Kensington. We arrived a little frazzled from a day out in London with the kids and were treated to a warm welcome complete with hot towels, fresh water and teddies for the kids (all of which was whipped up on the spot - they didn't see us coming, just got it all out when we arrived).
Nothing as too much trouble - we wanted to share a high-tea between four of us. Not a problem.
We wanted to sit in a different area so our kids could run around. Not a problem.
At breakfast we ordered slightly off menu for the kids. Not a problem, and no extra charge.

Overall it was an excellent stay - I would highly recommend to all families and anyone else to be fair.

Bravo and well played The Kensington. We'll be back.",5,2021,08,23
113,Delightful hotel with wonderful staff,"We very much enjoyed our stay at the Kensington, our room (four poster suite) was comfortable, a decent size, and all amenities you could need. The bathroom was of good size, and clean, the toiletries available are also lovely, so much so we have purchased them to use at home. What really makes this hotel though is the staff, they are courteous, polite and so so helpful nothing is too much trouble. 
The only thing we didn‚Äôt enjoy was eating here, not because of the good that is very good but eating a meal at from a sofa or lounge chair with a low table was not particularly comfy especially when you are tall. Was great for sandwiches and light bites but not for a meal requiring cutlery. 
The hotel location is great for exploring, walking distance to history and science museum, the v & a, short taxi ride to oxford street, Piccadilly, and Covent garden  (approx ¬£20) We walked to Harrods and Harvey Nichols and stopped at some of the Lovely cafes and cake shop along route (without stopping would take approx 25-30 minutes at a leisurely pace). 
Hotel also offered us umbrellas to use while out for the day as rain was predicted. 
We used the car park recommend by hotel, some spaces are quite tight but it really does depend on what‚Äôs left when you arrive as how you‚Äôd find it, close proximity though meaning we could drop our shopping off easily at our car rather than having to checkout with our regular luggage and shopping all at once. 
Before booking I called reception with a few questions, about room selections, dietary requirements, the receptionist was fab answered all my questions, helped me choose a room, and then worked out which was best deal to use for our length of stay to maximise value for money. I definitely recommend booking directly via telephone. ",5,2021,08,23
113,Best 5 Star Service and Stay in London,"After visiting this Hotel on several occasions for a lunch or cocktail in the Hotels Lounge and K Bar we decided to try it out for our next overnight  stay in London , as we enjoy trying out different hotels on each occasion.We booked this Hotel for my Birthday for a 4 night stay in August and hoped it would live up to my expectations after the lovely Bar and Lounge service we previously received. Well I must say this hotel went above and beyond my expectations and from the moment we arrived to the time we left it was truly wonderful. The Staff here are extremely professional ,polite and very friendly and helpful in every way. Everyone from the door men , reception , waiters , waitresses and Managers where all wonderful and made my stay here very enjoyable and an unforgetable experience. We had a lovely Deluxe Room  (newly renovated) and as it was my Birthday on arrival I had a surprise birthday cake waiting for me in my room.We had a turn down service every evening and the room was lovely and comfortable with everything you need . I enjoyed my stay at this hotel so much it was sad to leave and I will now be using this Hotel as my regular London stay for sure....I have stayed in many 5 star hotels in London and the customer service here was above and beyond any of them , I believe it was the fact it felt so personable that made it special ,nothing was ever too much for anyone ....we also experienced a Jazz evening the Hotel hosts on sunny Friday evenings on the Hotel Veranda restaurant with oyster Bar snd champagne .....truly lovely hotel , lovely staff and wonderful experience ...Thank you to all the staff at this hotel I will definitely be recommending this Hotel to everyone and coming back ...Thank You to everyone at the Hotel sorry if I cannot remember everyones names - Yannick Reception Manager , Karan at Reception , all the lovely hotel door staff , waiters and waitresses and Restaurant Managers Brilliant service Thank You",5,2021,08,22
113,Excellent stay with incredible personal attention to detail,"This is old school London charm at its very best - the hotel had accommodated a mention of it being my birthday by my partner - so personally sent the outstanding guest relations manager up to our room with glasses of champagne and cake! I was totally spoiled and it felt very personal and genuine the whole time. The room was beautiful and newly renovated - and I know the team kindly accommodate upgrades wherever possible - a rare delight these days. I then received a personal note of thanks afterwards saying  thanks to us both on choosing to stay with us at The Kensington.
It was certainly our pleasure!",5,2021,08,21
113,A truly memorable experience,"We stayed here for a couple of nights to celebrate our special wedding anniversary and I have to say that the whole experience exceeded our highest expectations. From the start of our stay to the end, we felt special; the welcome we received upon arrival was warm and friendly, the room was just fabulous, on the fifth floor overlooking Queen‚Äôs Gate. The Drawing Rooms are a comfortable and opulent area for having a drink or a meal, including the excellent breakfast. We dined here for our celebration and the food and service were first class. Unfortunately, the restaurant was closed for refurbishment, so dining service was restricted to the Drawing Rooms. We love this area - South Kensington and the hotel is in the heart of it. A perfect location for visiting the famous museums or the shops in Knightsbridge or the West End.
But what made our stay truly special was the attentive and professional service by all the staff. Special mention goes to Anita Costache in reception who was incredibly friendly and hospitable throughout our stay. Also Thomas Keating, who made a few ‚Äòtouches‚Äô to makes us feel particularly welcome. Thank you to all the staff for making our stay at the Kensington specially memorable - we will most definitely be back.",5,2021,08,17
113,Ronaldo - what a 'Ray of Sunshine 'and charming young man!!,"I tend not to do too many reviews, however, the experience I had when dining and visiting The Kensington in London was so outstanding I just have to comment, especially when I had the pleasure in being served by one of your waiter staff there Ronaldo. He was so polite, attentive, charming and warm. Every need and more was catered for and his service was outstanding. He is a credit to your organisation and I wanted to congratulate Ronaldo on his hard working nature and great Charisma! You made my visit so very memorable for all the right reasons.!",5,2021,08,14
113,Fabulous Hotel,"Fabulous Hotel, beautiful and tasteful decor throughout,  very comfortable and spacious bedroom. 
Very attentive staff and service, couldn‚Äôt do enough for us.
Excellent food
Couldn‚Äôt recommend this Hotel enough  
The Hotel easily deserves it‚Äôs 5 star status",5,2021,08,13
113,Beautiful luxury hotel in the heart of South Kensington,"We just had a 2 night weekend break at The Kensington. Beautiful luxury hotel located perfectly for the museum quarter, with Knighstbridge easily accessible. The lobby and public rooms are very tastefully furnished. We had a deluxe king room which was gorgeous and very spacious. Really comfortable bed and bedding. Large TV. Lots of storage space. Beautiful bathroom with separate shower.
The staff at the hotel were incredibly welcoming and simply charming. They couldn't do enough. Breakfast was wonderful with a very large selection of cooked dishes and continental choices. My only gripe would be that the coffee and the hot food was served just warm and not hot. Lovely bar for drinks in the evening. There is a really pretty outdoor seating area as well. Well equipped gym which was totally empty so we had it all to ourselves. All  in all a fantastic experience.
My one significant complaint would be that the hotel could improve its environmental awareness and carbon footprint. They had all the fireplaces on in the public rooms. Although this looks pretty and creates a comfy ambience, it can hardly be said to be necessary in July, even in London. But to make things worse they had the air conditioning on at the same time!! That is just crazy. Hope they look into this and rectify it.",4,2021,08,09
113,Amazing afternoon tea,A friend and I decided to try the London Landmarks afternoon tea as a treat and we were not disappointed. The tea was three courses and the food was exquisite. The attention to detail with all the unique ideas for landmarks was really impressive but it also tasted good too! We received extremely attentive service from Petronella and she could not have been any more helpful. We will definitely be visiting again and most likely book a stay too so we can experience more of what the hotel has to offer.,5,2021,08,09
113,An absolutely incredible hotel experience from start to finish,"This hotel is absolutely incredible, the service from every staff member was totally perfect. We have been lucky enough to travel to lots of lovely places in the UK and abroad but the service we received here over our weekend was just unbelievable . 
The perfect level of kindness , professionalism and thoughtfulness without being too overwhelming. 
I would recommend this hotel for the fabulous family room  where the interiors were so tasteful , the food and atmosphere in the bar , drawing room and lounge were perfect, the staff were impeccable. 
It hands down is the best hotel experience I have ever had and this is not an exaggeration ‚Ä¶. And I am known to be a fuss pot ! Congratulations to the Kensington hotel and special shout out to Thomas in guest relations for his incredible afternoon tea treat when he heard our 8 year niece say we couldn‚Äôt go on holiday on an aeroplane because of covid ! You guys made us love our London girls trip even more. Thank you so so much.",5,2021,08,08
113,"Lovely hotel, excellent service!",We stayed for 2 nights and from the start the staff made us feel so welcomed. We got upgraded to a deluxe twin room which was very comfortable.

113,Excellent hotel,"We were well looked after by the team especially by Yannick from reception.  Thank you for being kind and helpful.
Petronela who was attentive and always happy to assist us.
George and Ronnie with very friendly smiles and Fergal who helped us carry our luggage to our taxi that turned up on the wrong spot.  
What makes this hotel special is the service we received and it makes the big  difference.
The amenities are good.  Very accessible to public transport and all the tourist spots like the museums, parks and shopping centres.
We were very happy with our stay and we will definitely come back.
Thank you again.

113,Nights on Us Stay,"We had a complimentary stay from ‚Äònights on us‚Äô and The Kensington Hotel welcomed us. The best thing to say about this hotel is the
excellent staff. They are friendly, attentive and warm.  Something that lacks on some of the 5 star hotels in the city. Special thanks to Yannick, George, Ronnie and Petronela. These people made it an experience to write a review about.
The room was lovely with lots of natural light.  The breakfast was delicious.
It is a 5 minute walk from the underground station and The Natural history museum. Plenty to see around the area.
Will definitely come back. 
Thank you again.

Cindy ",5,2021,08,04
113,Fab hotel in great location,"A really nice hotel in Kensington. Our room seemed to be newly decorated room, not a huge room but we didn‚Äôt spend a lot of time in it. Great air conditioning and a spacious bathroom with a tub! Bed was super comfy with great quality linen. Breakfast was super; great selection and quality ingredients. Only down side was that service was a tad slow. They didn‚Äôt seem to have enough staff on duty for breakfast. Staff that were there were very pleasant and certainly were doing their best. I would thoroughly recommend. Lots of restaurants nearby and two underground stations within 10 min walk.",5,2021,08,03
113,Impressive Hotel and delightful staff,"We booked the Marylebone  Hotel for my Niece's birthday but due to unforeseen circumstances  we were relocated to their sister hotel the Kensington.
On arrival we were greeted by the concierge and Thomas the guess relations manager who gave us a very warm welcome. The hotel had arranged some birthday treats for my Niece which was absolutely fantastic and Thomas was more than happy to video these special moments.
The quality of the hotel and the room was exceptional and the bed was the most comfortable bed we have ever slept on. The quality of the food was outstanding and the service too. we would not hesitate in recommending this hotel to our friends and family as we can honestly say this is the best hotel we have ever stayed in. Finally we would like to thank Thomas Keating and his team for their exemplary professionalism and we look forward to seeing you all in the near future.",5,2021,07,31

113,Marriage ceremony - fantastic experience!!!,"We booked our marriage ceremony at the White Room in The Kensington. Me, my husband and our guests are all regular London 5-star hotel & Michelin restaurants visitors...and we can say with confidence that The Kensington is definitely of top top quality! 
Amazing food, super friendly & helpful staff Ôºàso well dressed and so humble ;)) , the building is so beautiful & everything just refurbished. It's a mix of the pre-war charm and modern south-ken chill. We absolutely loved it! Everyone is super impressed. I didn't catch the name of the gent from reception, the our chief waiter, the bartender lady, and more...big thank you to the whole team for making our night fab!

Cristina, our event manager, did a wonderful job to help us organise everything last minute. She is very responsive and truly put our interests first. I would definitely come back if I have other events to organize. :)

113,A wonderful afternoon tea experience!,"We had a fabulous time at the Kensington for afternoon tea celebrating an anniversary. The food, the staff and whole experience was fantastic. Thomas in particular was a pure delight and really ensured that the day was made even more personal and special. A simple endorsement is not enough. You really need to experience the ambiance of the Kensington for yourself! We are sure to not hesitate to visit again in the coming weeks and months.

The Phillips family and fellow Irish friend Rachael ‚òòÔ∏è",5,2021,07,16
113,"Fabulous service, lovely afternoon tea","We visited the Kensington for afternoon tea as part of a Covid delayed birthday day out for my wife. The tea was excellent, with a different twist to the usual afternoon tea for some of the dishes to reflect the London theme. There were a lot of sandwiches, scones and cakes and we were stuffed by the end. The only criticism was that the carrot cake inside the Shard was a little underbaked.

The service was also excellent. When we were asked if we were there for a special occasion and said it was a belated birthday, another piece of cake appeared (which we took away as we could manage another mouthful) and several members of staff came over to wish my wife a happy birthday which was a lovely and unexpected touch. A special mention to Clarisse who went the extra mile to help make the day extra special.",5,2021,07,13
113,"Lovely staff, great location, beautiful rooms","We had a lovely two night stay here recently. Very quaint hotel. The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating at every encounter. Rooms were lovely. Only slight downside (in my opinion) was the food. There wasn‚Äôt much of a menu to eat an evening meal there and the breakfast was ok, although probably substandard for the level of hotel (over cooked eggs/ undercooked bacon) etc. We would come back for the rooms and the staff! It‚Äôs also in a handy location for many things",4,2021,07,11
113,Amazing staff and afternoon tea!,"My friends and I went for the afternoon tea as I had heard great things. It did not disappoint! The staff were incredible, especially Thomas, he went out is his way for us and his customer service is incredible! We went for my friends bachelorette and he made it extra special by giving her a congratulatory cake and an English white rose! He explained the history behind the afternoon tea and did so with such enthusiasm. I would highly recommend and look forward to coming again!!",5,2021,07,11
113,A wonderful stay made all the more magical by people who really care,"I can't rate this hotel highly enough.

The Kensington is in a great location & is a great base for sightseeing.
The quality of d√©cor, rooms & service is impeccable, but what made this such a magical place for us was the staff.

Everyone went over & beyond our expectations. I was expecting a relaxing break (as relaxing as it could be with a 7 year old in tow) but the staff went out of their way to ensure everything was catered for - nothing was too much trouble.

Our little boy was super excited with all the little surprises and gestures that had been prepared for him; such as a fossil hunt in our room and a Minecraft themed London tourist map. My wife too loved all the special birthday details that had been arranged for her.

From the moment we entered the door at The Kensington we were made to feel so welcome, right through to when we left; and our son was especially upset to leave because it had been made so special for him.

The food at the restaurant was amazing too. The restaurant accommodated us even when we asked if we could watch the football (they situated us in anther room with a large TV)

The whole experience was outstanding, and we were made to feel very special.
We definitely intend to return there later in the year.",5,2021,07,10
113,Anniversary Stay,"We were booked for 1 night for our 10th wedding anniversary and all the staff we encountered helped to make this the most special anniversary ever.

Pricilla was amazing at check in, so welcoming and nice. The water and bag with antibacterial wipes and hand sanitiser is a nice touch. We were lucky enough for the room to be upgraded to a 4 poster, the room was so beautiful and a joy to stay in. The bed was the most comfortable I have stayed in while in a hotel. 

Thomas brought us champagne to the room was a highlight. We really enjoyed talking to him and learning a bit more about the decor of the room. He also spotted us at dinner and came to check on us which was a lovely touch.

The 2 gentleman and lady who were serving in the restuarant that night were so attentive and friendly and helped make the dinner even more amazing than it already was. The food was quite honestly the best I've ever tasted and I can't wait to try the afternoon tea next time! I can really recommend the cornish sole and lemon cheesecake. They also brought us a lovely chocolate cake slice to celebrate our anniversary.

The turndown service was also lovely to come back to after dinner. The camomile tea is a lovely extra.

We had a gorgeous cooked breakfast in the room the following morning which was perfect.

The gentleman who checked us out was also beyond lovely offering us an umbrella or to call us a taxi as it was raining when we left.

I have stayed in a few hotels in London over the years but have never felt so special or that I would love to come back until we stayed here. I cannot wait to be able to return to The Kensington as the service was outstanding and I can't recommend enough that this is the place to stay if you want a truly special experience.
Thank you again and we look forward to coming back again soon.",5,2021,07,06
113,An excellent birthday hotel experience,"My family and I stayed for my belated 30th birthday celebrations. Our stay was out of this world and all staff made me as well as my family super special. On arrival, we received attentive service by all staff and we instantly received bottles of sparkling water, a hot towel and hand sanitizer. 

We stayed in the family room which was incredibly spacious, the decor was spectacular and so well put together. We received a lovely card from the hotel team, welcoming us and wishing me a very happy birthday and a nice stay. Once settled, we had a knock at the door and was welcomed with a birthday surprise. A slice of birthday, chocolates and a yellow rose. I also received a happy birthday song too. 

Our dining experience was great as well. Our waitress was attentive and very knowledgeable on the menu. The quality of the food was amazing and we celebrated my birthday accordingly.

When we arrived back to our room, we were welcomed with a flask of hot water and cups of chamomile tea which was a lovely and unexpected touch. 

The beds were comfy and we slept exceedingly well. We also had breakfast at The Kensington which was amazing too. The selection of food, continental and the full English breakfast, was immense and everything we ordered was at a high quality standard and we thoroughly enjoyed it. 

All staff we spoke to were incredibly friendly, informative and knowledgeable on the hotel.

Our whole experience was memorable and something we shall be reminiscing about. We thoroughly loved our stay at the hotel and we are looking forward to staying here again soon. We couldn't recommend this hotel experience more!",5,2021,07,05

113,Best service I have ever received,"I had the most delightful time staying in the Kensington Hotel for 3 days and 2 nights with my husband. It was the best staycation ever. It is located in a beautiful neighborhood in South Kensington and is a few minutes walk from the tube station which makes it accessible. The entrance, to the lobby, to the restaurant and bar was beautifully decorated. The rooms were clean and the bed was cozy and it was difficult to even leave because of how homey it felt. The best part of my stay was definitely the 5 star service from all the staff. It was the best I have ever experienced and they definitely made things so personalised for me and my husband during our stay, they even made us a dessert for our anniversary. Definitely a place we would go back to once we visit London again.",5,2021,06,28

113,Amazing Afternoon Tea,"We booked a last minute Afternoon Tea as we were on the train to London. 

Located approx 15 mins walk from the nearest Tube station, The Kensington is pretty easy to find. 

We were greeted by a very friendly doorman who introduced us to other staff members and seated us at our table.

Our waiter explained that the menu was now digital by scanning a QR code but a paper option was available. He then left us to browse. 

Once we had decided on the London Landmarks Afternoon Tea and ordered we did have to wait quite a while (there were only 3 other small groups in) however the staff apologised several times and checked in for more drinks etc regularly. 

We were brought a starter (still not sure if it was part of the AT or complimentary). 3 mini dishes which were piping hot and delicious. 

After this we had a bit more of a wait but it was definitely worth it. 
The AT was brought out and presented on a London Eye stand. Sandwiches at the top, sweet, Landmark shaped desserts in the middle and fresh scones on the bottom. 

Every part of the AT was explained to us and the back story/journey of the AT was told in detail. 

All of the food was delicious and so flavoursome! 

Our waiter couldn't do more if he tried and was extremely friendly and chatty. 
Even though booking are now time restricted due to COVID we didn't once feel rushed and felt at ease the whole time. 

Would happily recommend the Kensington

113,Excellent hotel and great location,"I found this hotel on booking.com and was drawn in straight away from its 5* reviews from guests. The photos looked amazing, very modern and recently refurbished. Upon arrival we were greeted by a lovely door man who took our luggage. When we checked in the lovely general manager gave us a room upgrade. The room was beautifully decorated and extremely clean. The staff were all amazing with my young daughter and made her feel like a princess. She was gifted a teddy bear and got treats at bedtime. The hotel is in a great location, close to all the Museums and Hyde park. We walked every time we went out.  The Kensington hotel is truly a beautiful hotel and the staff are the real stars there!! Can‚Äôt wait to come back soon!!! ",5,2021,05,26
113,Five Star Service Guaranteed!,"Clean facilities, Approachable staff, we particularly enjoyed the comfortable bed and the Chromecast TV. We ordered breakfast in Bed and couldn‚Äôt fault all the choices we had. The hot chocolate is a must try!

113,Short Weekend,"I arrived with my family on Friday late night. Due to COVID19 moving around was not possible and we stayed most of our time in the Hotel and we enjoyed the breakfast, dinner and the Bar. Hygiene protocols were high and kept by all.",5,2020,12,14
113,A fantastic hotel with wonderful staff,"Fantastic hotel! I have stayed at many excellent hotels but The Kensington is definitely one of the best. Excellent setting and decor, attentive staff, nice and clean rooms, very nice gym and delicious food/breakfast. I was there the days before the second UK lockdown began and the staff made sure all safety precautions were taken in terms of hygiene etc. 
I have stayed at this hotel twice, most recently with my 17 year old daughter, who loved it as well. Again, the staff is wonderful - I have rarely gotten such good service. 
Cannot wait to return - will always stay at The Kensington when in London!",5,2020,11,12
113,A fabulous afternoon tea with plenty of wow factor!,"My husband and I visited The Kensington for Afternoon Tea just before lockdown 2.0 and had a lovely and memorable time. The staff are all friendly and welcoming, the setting is impeccable, and the spread is delicious. Extra safety precautions are also in place and all staff wear face masks with plenty of hand sanitiser in every room.

I especially loved the show-stopping sweets and pastries that are in the shape of iconic London landmarks. 

As it was our anniversary they also brought out a lovely cake for us to mark the occasion.

I highly recommend Afternoon Tea, at The Kensington once lockdown has ended.",5,2020,11,04
113,Nothing too much trouble,"I had a wonderful one night stay with my family this weekend, including my 2 children. The hotel and room were immaculate, and we were extremely impressed by the excellent service from the minute we arrived. At breakfast the staff were very attentive yet at the same time discreet and unintrusive. I would recommend this hotel without hesitation..",5,2020,11,01
113,Wonderful...,"The Kensington is a lovely hotel. My parents stay regularly when visiting my brother so I visited with my mum on her recommendation.

The staff are good, particularly the concierge who are extremely helpful and friendly. Drinks in the stunning bar were lovely. Breakfast was delicious.

The room was nice. The bed was insanely comfortable and the bathroom was clean and spacious. I haven‚Äôt stayed at The Kensington before but did feel the room was quite small and dark...mum was a little disappointed as after several stays she felt this room perhaps wasn‚Äôt quite as luxurious as others she has experienced. However it didn‚Äôt spoil anything. The room still had a useful dressing area and the service was excellent.

We will be back!",4,2020,08,16
113,Beautiful room,I had a fantastic stay at Kensington hotel!! Although I didn‚Äôt have breakfast at the hotel the room I stayed in was gorgeous.Beds were comfortable and had a great nights sleep. Bathroom was clean and spacious. I would of liked a window to look out but I didn‚Äôt spend to long there anyway!!  Really nice and not to expensive for London and close underground üöä,5,2020,08,12
113,A thoroughly pleasing stay in every way,"Our experience was the property was well-maintained, very attractive and comfortable. The staff was competent and welcoming, in particular we found Carlos Baragaro particularly helpful and warm.  The breakfasts were superb.

We will hope to return upon our next visit to London.",5,2020,04,01
113,Great stay at the Kensington,"My wife and I stayed at the Kensington one night as the Corona virus was spreading world wide.  The staff was so professional and brave in this scary and uncertain time.  Sunny Basra, the Concierge, was the Man!  He was so soothing to talk with, we immediately felt so comfortable with him, it was like we already new him.  I can not wait to stay at the Kensington again.
The room was five star as were all the other areas of the hotel.
Howard Wortley",5,2020,03,28
113,Love this place,We stayed for 3 nights snd I have got my favourite hotel in London. The staff is so helpful and friendly and there are so many nice rooms where you can enjoy afternoon tea or a drink in the evening. The atmosphere is cosy and relaxed. I will definately choose this hotel when I go back. It‚Äôs English and I love it. The room we had was clean and nice.,5,2020,03,05
113,Excellent afternoon tea,"The London Landmarks afternoon tea is absolutely delicious!! My partner and I really enjoyed the lovely food and brilliant service. 
I am vegetarian and I was offered vegetarian sandwiches and plant based milk. 
Highly recommended ",5,2020,03,05
113,An ideal place to locate in London,"For decades we have been visiting London and have over the past few years based ourselves in this hotel.
Apart from being in an ideal location in the city it is within walking distance of some of the greatest places to visit in London viz National History Museum, V and A, Brompton Oratory, Harrods, and many more.

If staying in the hotel on a Friday do take the complimentary hotel provided one hour tour of the area.

The rooms are modern and depending on price generally to a high standard.

The staff are without doubt the most helpful and friendly that you can expect. They are the real gem of the very good services, food and beverages available in the hotel.

The concierge Vincent and duty manager Loretta Hendriks are the best we have ever encountered on many trips to a multitude of other cities in the World.

TIP - get a price before committing to buy accommodation- you may be surprised at the value you can negotiate!",5,2020,02,26
113,Mr vin Patel,Hotel is great staff are amazing. Bar a great place to spend a cold winters day. I only have one small suggestion is they need a little bit more vegi options on there menu. Otherwise it a perfect place to get away with your partner. I've been to the hotel many time with my partner but it was my first stay over. ,5,2020,02,24
113,"Distinctive, welcoming hotel","We have stayed here numerous times over the years. It the only hotel in London my wife will consider. Great property with an incredible staff. From The bellman, Gvido, ensuring you are welcome to the concierges, Michael and Vincent, willing to help with anything. The front desk staff is very pleasant, helpful and always professional. Excellent hotel made even better by the staff.",5,2020,02,14
113,Warm and professional welcome,"Our 5 days stay was exceptional! The hotel team was full of kindness and took care of the whole
Family: personalised welcome presents for our three children, help for any kind of demands. We felt like home and will definitely come back.",5,2020,02,14
113,Beautiful coffee shop,"I didn‚Äôt stay at this hotel but tried their cafe.

Lovely setup with many rooms, comfortable seats, nice carpets on wood and fireplaces.

They offer various drinks and their chocolate fondue with ice cream plate is mouthwatering.

Reasonable prices given the posh setup and hotel it is found in.

In the quiet side too, so ideal for a conversation with a friend.

Recommended!",5,2020,02,13
113,Service with style and substance,"We stayed for one night and absolutely loved the decor, atmosphere and friendliness of the staff. It's got a bona fide rock 'n' roll history as this was the venue that The Rolling Stones used to launch their Beggars Banquet album in 1968 and there are some great portraits of this event hanging in the bar. With some great Stones songs playing and some tasty beers on offer I felt very much at home! The staff were approachable, warm and happy to talk about this part of the hotel's history. I was all ears! Our room was stunning and very comfortable to say the least. At breakfast we went for the continental style and it was delicious. The staff at breakfast were also really friendly and helpful; the perfect start to the day!",5,2020,02,12
113,Would definitely recommend,"Great hotel with fabulous service. Front of house team were exceptional, sumptuous traditional bedroom with high quality fittings ....lovely bathroom with roll top bath and tv above. The hotel staff were attentive and helpful, the doorman was lovely and whereas other hotels in London can be clinical and frosty, this was a fab experience. ",5,2020,02,07
113,Manager at The Resident Kensington,"I‚Äôve been planning a trip to London in June and have spoken with Victoria at the Resident Kensington location murmurous times she has been so helpful helping me book our tours and choosing the best room for our stay she‚Äôs always friendly and calls me back if I miss her and have additional questions.

113,Top points,"Have stayed at the Kensington Hotel on various occasions but I have to say this last time was the best.
Great staff in all areas. Reception rooms were excellent to hold meetings and the dinning experience was also very good. ",5,2020,01,29
113,Stayed at the Kensington Hotel,My wife and I stayed for the weekend at the Kensington Hotel on the occasion of her Birthday. It was a great experience and When we arrived we were upgraded to a suite which was delightful and newly refurbished. There was fruit and Prosecco to greet us in the suite. Very comfortable bed and the suite was quiet because of the new windows that cut off traffic noise.Thanks to the staff who were very attentive and in particular to Lorena Hendricks who was the Manager. Will certainly be back and can recommend to anyone. ,5,2020,01,28
113,Quality and price gift wrapped together - what more could one ask for?!,"Another pleasurable stay at the Kensington. I have been very fortunate to have been able to stay at this location for business and pleasure and I will keep returning. The Kensington offers a unique atmosphere of welcomnes, quality and class! Well location, 4 mins walk from the tube station and on one of the major tube lines. A few good restaurants within stones trow and Kensington Gardens for those seeking a walk or jog during the day!",5,2020,01,28
113,Spectacular style and comfort,"The Kensington can simply be described as ‚Äòperfect‚Äô.  This is how I would sum up our welcome and stay throughout.  My Mum and I stayed for two nights as we wanted to be in the vicinity of the Royal Albert Hall, where we were booked to see Luzia. On arrival we were kindly upgraded to a family room and on being shown our room, I was delighted to discover Prosecco and macaroons which my Mum had ordered as a celebratory surprise for my birthday.  The room was generous in size and has clearly just been refurbished. Everything felt new and fresh.  The beds and pillows were divine and we enjoyed two restful nights sleep.  Staff were attentive, courteous and helpful at all times, making us feel very welcome. The hotel has a beautiful scent too. Turns out you can buy the fragranced candles they burn too. On checking out the staff kindly stored our bags until we needed them later that afternoon.
This is a hotel that prides itself in getting things right at all levels and I am confident that it will not disappoint.  It is one of the ‚Äòvery best hotels‚Äô that I have had the good fortune to stay at around the world.  Book it! You will not be disappointed!",5,2020,01,27
113,Nice Hotel,"Although a bit pricey, this hotel is lovely. Great location and good food. The place is clean and quiet, with friendly staff and a good breakfast selection. I would stay here again when returning to London.",5,2020,01,26
113,"Great hotel, location and service","Just completed our stay and was thrilled with all aspects of our stay. The staff is incredibly accommodating and gave outstanding recommendations and service‚Äîespecially the Concierge,Curtis McCalla). The hotel is really clean and the maid service is so welcoming at the end of the day. The town of South Kensington is a perfect location outside of the hustle and bustle of the center of London but easily accessible by the tube a few blocks away. Also, great stores and restaurants a few steps away to meet every need!",5,2020,01,26
113,Boutique hotel with exceptional service and Great location.,"We stayed 5 days at this boutique hotel with exceptional service and lovely rooms.  As such, a bit higher price point but worth it and reflects the area. Great location in South Kensington within walking distance to the V&A, museums, and shops.  ",5,2020,01,21
113,Delicious Afternoon Tea,"Enjoyed a delicious and interesting afternoon tea, London landmark cakes are a very novel idea, tasty and very appropriate.  The only down size for us was the weight of the silver tea pot which was so heavy to lift that we had to ask the waiter to pour the tea every time which they did willingly.
Delightful ending to the tea was a red rose for each customer along with a postcard of the cake stand which is a very nice idea.",5,2020,01,19
113,Elegant boutique hotel in a great location,"We had a wonderful experience at The Kensington. We were in London for a short stay and wanted a hotel with charm, attentive staff and great location close to public transportation -- and the Kensington offered all of that and more. We celebrated a birthday during our stay. The staff really went overboard -- sending flowers and a dessert to the room. Everyone was really helpful, but particularly Curtis, who gave us great restaurant recommendations and other useful advice. ",5,2020,01,16
113,Magical stay,"We stayed in the Kensington for a couple of days to celebrate my 6 year old daughter birthday. We had planned a Harry Potter surprise , and I shared the plan with the Hotel s staff, who had been in contact and offering whatever we needed since we made the reservation. And then the most ""magical "" thing happened as soon as we stepped in the hotel. All of the Hotel Staff was onboard the surprise and when totally and insanely above and beyond of what we expected. From acting, to preparing special presents, always a new one. Every time we stepped in the hotel there was something new from the staff. They were fantastic. it made all the difference staying here. I don t usually leave reviews, but in this case I have to say, that the fantastic service, total personalization, attention to details and warmth of the hotel staff, was something else!!!!
Highly recommend it, specially if you want to surprise your little one.",5,2020,01,16
113,Perfect location and service,"The hotel is in great shape, loved the afternoon tea and the service.

Perfect restaurant and very spacey rooms, price a bit expensive but the location is great as it is next to the tube and the museums.",4,2020,01,09
113,I JUST LOVE THIS PLACE,"Its amazing to be back to my favourite hotel in London.

I love the neighbourhood, the hotel decor and the service. Even when I travel for work it does make me feel like Im on holidays.

Breakfast is simply outstading.",5,2020,01,08
113,Comfortably Elegance at The Kensington,"I travel to London very often and know many hotels in the city, but very few like The Kensington. Not only it has exceeded all my expectations, but it has become one of my favorite places in the city.  The friendly treatment and professionalism of all staff, as well as the elegance and comfort of its common areas and rooms, make the stay unforgettable.  It also offers an excellent breakfast that can be taken in one of the most beautiful areas of the hotel.  The Kensington makes you feel at home.  Do not miss it.",5,2020,01,07
113,Exceptional Hospitality!!! Exceeding expectation!!,"My parents celebrated their retirement with a trip to London from the states. Novice travelers and exhausted from 50+ years of work they came to the Kensington seeking comfort and a taste of luxury. Leandro and the staff of the Kensington took the time to personalize many details of their stay, including striking out to find their favorite drinks and treats, and ensured that my parents were treated as if the city of London was built to celebrate their retirement. Hyperbole, maybe. But the comfort and joy of knowing my parents were receiving the care and attention they so freely give to their friends, family and strangers alike, made my brothers and me very happy while providing a truly once in a lifetime experience for my parents. Thank you to the entire staff!",5,2020,01,07
113,Stayed at Kensington over Winter Break,"Family of four stayed at hotel between Dec. 27, 2019 and January 3, 2020. Hotel staff was very courteous and helpful.  Location was great due to being close to Underground station at South Kensington and lots of local restaurants.  Hotel and rooms very nicely decorated, although doors to hallways don't keep out sound, but in quiet neighborhood overall.",5,2020,01,04
113,Great place to stay in South Kensingron,"I chose this hotel based on its rating in Conde Nast and the recommendation of a friend who lives nearby.  The downstairs facilities (bars, seating areas and restaurant) are beautifully decorated.  The staff are all very welcoming and they went out of their way to be helpful.  The rooms are fine, with good bed linens.  The only issue is noise from the corridor in the morning when other guests were going in and out.  But this was a relatively minor issue giving the value for money that I found at this hotel.",5,2020,01,04
113,Another excellent stay A+++,"Travelling from Ireland, my husband, two kids and I enjoyed a two night stay here over Christmas. We had enjoyed an excellent stay here a year ago and vowed we would return. Check-in was quick. They gave us warm hand towels and healthy drinks while check-in was taking place. All the staff made such a fuss of our kids throughout our stay which is not always the case in other hotels. We had connecting rooms which was great. The food and service were consistently excellent. Thomas and Oana in the restaurant were brilliant and we were delighted to see them again. The hotel is 400m from South Kensington tube station and you can travel in the tube from Heathrow airport. We look forward to returning again.",5,2020,01,03
113,Cousins Xmas reunion ,"We had the most fabulous afternoon tea, cared for by the friendly and very professional Thomas and the team. Everything about the hotel was beautiful and dressed for its Christmas splendour. The afternoon tea not only looked spectacular, it tasted fantastic. We all agreed we would return again. Thanks guys...",5,2020,01,03
113,Magical London at Christmas ,"The Kensington in London is a classic, elegant and welcoming hotel with a superb staff. The lobby has seating and fireplaces for a cup of tea or a light meal. The bar and restaurant are excellent. 

Set in a quiet area of London, you can walk to shops and local restaurants. You need to take a taxi, the underground or Uber to get to the theater and central London. There is a Tube station nearby. ",5,2019,12,29
113,Wonderful 50th wedding anniversary celebration,"We wanted to express our heart-felt thanks for making my parents Golden wedding anniversary so special and memorable. 

From our initial conversations to the room offered my parents with all the beautiful touches, we couldn‚Äôt have wished for a more special celebration. The food was divine and your very personal approach was much appreciated. 

The decor and ambience of the hotel was understated yet supremely stylish. The Landmarks afternoon tea was great fun and the breakfast the following day (I believe) was fantastic. The hotel is also brilliantly located for the V&A/ Natural History/ Science museum area around the corner and there are lots of independent shops and cafes a stones throw away. 

We would definitely recommend the hotel for a special occasion or visit to London.",5,2019,12,23
113,Great trip,"I typically do not write reviews.  However, after such a fantastic stay at this hotel I felt compelled to post and comment on how fantastic the hotel experience was.  The staff really made this day and all-around wonderful experience. Two people in particular, Lorena in reception and Thomas in the dining room.  The rooms were gorgeous, The food was divine!  Absolutely everyone went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. Sunny and Clariece deserve our thanks too!!!9",5,2019,12,23
113,"Lovely, great service and location","TripAdvisor helped us choose this hotel, and we certainly were not disappointed.  The level of service was top notch.  The room was cozy, the common areas on main floor are great with a bar and seating outside the bar in a lounge area.  All was decked out for Christmas so we were very happy and cozy the whole time.  Breakfast buffet was great, and eggs cooked if you order them from a wait staff person.  Nothing to complain about EXCEPT someone/someones running up and down the corridor all night our first night there.  It felt like they were going to barge into our room, that's how noisy and close they sounded.  I don't know if it was a Black Friday party night?  we stayed there the Friday right after American Thanksgiving, but apparently that Friday is also Black Friday in the UK and shoppers and partying was everywhere.",5,2019,12,22
113,South Kensington Hotel,"I recently stayed at the Kensington Hotel in South Kensington while on university interviews/visits with my son.  The hotel is conveniently located to university, cultural activities and museums, outstanding shopping experiences, lovely restaurants and beautiful neighborhood feel.  Highly recommend staying if you are in town.",4,2019,12,18
113,Brilliant!,"We stayed in December and had a fantastic time at the hotel. It is beautiful, the room was nicely decorated, clean and comfortable. There is a tube station a short distance away that gets to all of the major sites and to other lines as well. We had drinks almost each night when we got back at the hotel bar prepared just right by the bartenders on staff. We had dinner prior to the theater one night in the restaurant which was delicious and also served timely enough for us to make the show. We had their London Landmarks tea one day which was quite good and the presentation was a blast. My husband even had a full English breakfast one morning which he raved about. The staff was always helpful and gracious. I'm glad we chose this hotel and will definitely recommend it to others. ",5,2019,12,17
113,Fantasic service - but not worth the money,"We were met by a fantastic service in the reception area. We had bough a standard room for two. Our expectation for this luxurious hotel was high, but unfortunately the room was a hugh disappointment. Is was VERY small, not room for sitting (only one chair), no closet space (only 4 coat hangers), no room for outerwear, very small bathroom and  low showerhead. Our windows were thin and leaky for the cool wind (so the shutters needed to be closed all the time) and just outside there was 8 big aircondition motors making noice all day/night. The service in the hotel was fantastic - no complaint here, cleaning and location perfect, but the room didn't meet the standard/expectations in our opinion of a luxurious hotel.",3,2019,12,16
113,Elegant hotel and amazing staff!!,"The Kensington Hotel is located in south kensington district;  the structure is very beautiful, clean and luxurious. I was greeted with professionalism especially by Leandro and Barbara! Leandro has been able to manage my needs impeccably, supporting my requests step by step with seriousness, kindness and extreme availability. Really amazing staff, I'll definitely come back again!",5,2019,12,14
113,A home away from home in South. Kensington,"Love this hotel. It feels like you'd own a place in London. You feel welcome the moment you walk in, the staff greets you with a smile and goes the extra mile to make you happy. I've very much enjoyed my stay and will be back in the future. And btw, it's only a five minutes walk from South Kensington tube, which makes it a perfect place for any business or leisure trip. Love it!",5,2019,12,13
113,Best stay,"Location 10/10 (if you‚Äôre looking to stay in a calmer area and at the same time be close to the busy areas of London)
Cleanliness 10/10
Staff 10/10 (very helpful and friendly) 
Service 10/10 (they managed to steam my formal dress in less than a half hour)
Room 10/10 (noting that basic rooms in the uk are tiny, the rooms in the kensington were good) 

I loved the hotel and I am definitely using it every-time I travel to London.",5,2019,12,09
113,A wonderful place to stay in the city!,"The Kensington hotel was a great choice for our family to stay during a holiday trip to London! The hotel manager, concierge and wait staff were all very accommodating and polite throughout our entire stay. The hotel is beautiful and very clean. It is in a great area with lots of restaurants nearby and the tube is just down the road as well. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone wanting a fabulous stay in London!",5,2019,12,01
113,Fantastic Hotel ,"I give this hotel five stars!!  It felt like home.  The Kensington is a fabulous boutique hotel situated in South Kensington.  It is close to transportation, food, museums and Hyde Park.  

From the moment I walked into the hotel I was given a really warm welcome.  Prior to my arrival, I corresponded with Michael (the concierge) several times regarding questions I had.  Not only did he patiently respond to all my queries, he left me complimentary tickets to see the Mary Quant exhibit at the V&A museum which I found to be very thoughtful.  When I met him in person he remembered our email exchanges and asked whether I enjoyed the exhibit.

Sunny (another concierge) was very helpful in answering all my queries and giving me directions to the many places I planned on seeing.  

I was initially given a room where I was having trouble sleeping.  Tzolts was so kind as to not only switch my room but also upgraded me so that I would really enjoy my last night in London.  

Lorena gave me her card and said to contact her directly next time I plan on a trip to London and she will personally take care of my reservation.  

All of the staff members were attentive, kind and exceeded all expectations.  I felt well taken care of and they seemed to genuinely care that I should have the best possible stay.

I highly recommend a stay here!",5,2019,11,30
113,"The Kensington Hotel London - Five Stars with Three 'C's - Cosy, Convenient and Comfortable","The comfort of the accommodation and the quality of the service at The Kensington Hotel London cannot be faulted. From the moment you arrive until you leave you are treated as a special guest by always attentive and friendly staff throughout the Hotel. Our needs were looked after promptly and happily at all times. The various lounges in the Hotel offered a friendly cosy welcoming return from a day out in London and were also a great alternative to your room. The convenience of the Hotel to South Kensington station meant that all areas of London were readily accessible. In summary - The Kensington Hotel London offers a thoroughly satisfying, value-for-money, five-star accommodation experience in the heart of London.",5,2019,11,28
113,A jewel in the crown of course! ,"I‚Äôve been a regular guest here since 2015. It‚Äôs always been consistently luxurious and at the same time quirky, in that British way. All the rooms seem to have different personalities. I always pick what I call ‚Äúthe purple room‚Äù, for its purple velvet sitting chairs and a bathroom with a separate shower and tub. I had the privilege of staying there for quite some time after a big operation and was well looked after. The staff - at least the ones you see almost daily - become like family. Value-wise it sure beats Air Bnb. 
But even if you are not staying at there you should go for a drink at the hotel bar, one of the most understated but sophisticated and beautifully-decorated bars in London, in my humble opinion.
The tea lounge next door is equally attractive - cosy, elegant, decorated in pastels and flooded in sunlight. Great place to have a tea or coffee and people watch. All kinds of people go in and out of there - midwestern American tourists, middle-eastern sheikhs, and myriad beautiful people. And yet it‚Äôs not at all pretentious. You may miss the celebrity hiding in plain sight.",5,2019,11,26
113,This is how you do it,"We stayed at The Kensington to celebrate our four year anniversary and instead of being a simple one night stay, it turned into a memorable occasion that we will talk about for a long time to come.  It's not enough to say that all the staff were good.  The reception team, the concierge, the porters, the bar staff and the restaurant staff all contributed to a thoroughly enjoyable and relaxing experience.  They are a credit to the manager.  Not to mention the housekeeping team as our room was impeccable.
We were lucky to be upgraded and we were told that we were 'couple of the day' (or something similar).  This upgrade provided us with a superior room and many thoughtful extras (some of which were actually quite substantial and I would have been happy to pay for).  However, I believe that had we not received these upgrades I would be writing a very similar review due to the service levels and the overall quality of the hotel.  It's a hard balance delivering this level of service without it being stuffy and overly formal.  For me, they have it right at The Kensingon.  The service is friendly and good humoured whilst being attentive and professional.",5,2019,11,26
113,Business trip to London,"Excellent Hotel in a nice quiet part of Kensington with very friendly staff.
This was my third stay at this Hotel and I will certainly return as the room was recently refurbished and the bed was very comfortable.",5,2019,11,25
113,Dinner at the Town House restaurant,I had dinner with family at this beautiful restaurant. The setting is elegant and relaxing. The food was superb and a very fine wine was recommended by Clarisse. The staff were very attentive and the whole experience was wonderful. Hope to be back soon.,5,2019,11,21
113,Another incredible stay with one tiny flaw,"Myself, my mother and my godmother all traveled to London for a one-night stay at The Kensington. Myself and my mother had been previously with my grandmother and loved it so we decided to stay there again. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were greeted with a warm welcome from the concierge and reception staff. Upon checking in the woman at reception informed us that we had been upgraded to a family room which we were extremely grateful for as the double rooms with an extra bed can be a little bit tight. Instead we were given a spacious room with two double beds which was incredible. The woman at reception asked what had brought us to London for the weekend and when I told her that we were shopping for my wedding dress she couldn't have been nicer. She congratulated me and was very excited for me which I thought was really nice. In actual fact, when we returned from wedding dress shopping we walked into the room and found a small cut-out of a bride in a wedding dress along with a card from the hotel and some sweet treats. I thought that was such a lovely touch and it is the kind of thing that would make me want to return to the hotel. If anyone from management is reading this, the name on the card (who I believe was the woman who checked us in) was Ambre Sakiato and she definitely deserves some recognition for being a fantastic employee. The only criticism I have of the hotel at all, and I hate even saying this because it is suvh a fantastic hotel, the bar/lounge staff can be extremely abrupt, rude and unhelpful. When we initially arrived we went straight downstairs for a quick bite to eat, this was around 1pm on the Saturday. There were many spare seats and we weren't fussy as to where we would sit, we were also in a hurry. We explained to the waitress that we were staying in the hotel and had 45 minutes to have a quick lunch before our appointment. She told us that no tables were available and did not give in until we asked a few times. Further, when we returned from dinner we wanted a quick nightcap before going to bed. Again we were abruptly told that there was no room and were not offered any alternative or told to wait a few minutes while a table became available. On our way out, a waiter walked by and I explained that we were staying at the hotel and that we just wanted a quick drink before bed, he straight away showed us to a table. Because I love this hotel so much I won't let these encounters deter me from visiting again but it is a pity that they let the rest of the amazingly friendly staff down by their attitude.",5,2019,11,21
113,The Perfect Hotel,"The location is perfect, the museums, the  tube, and stores even churches are just a walk away, everybody is very friendly and professional and the food was delicious, definitely I will go back, and I recommend it especially to couples  for special celebrations. ",5,2019,11,18
113,Excellent hotel in a very quiet and trendy location,"It's our third visit to this hotel and we stay very satisfied of our choice.
We still appreciate its location and its qualities: Quietness, cleanliness, modernism and atmosphere.
The staff is very friendly and efficient. We will come back. ",5,2019,11,17
113,Fabulous hotel,"This was the second time that we have stayed at The Kensington and on both occasions we cannot fault it. This time we had a classic double room which was immaculate and very comfortable. The room was quiet and warm. Our booking included a full English breakfast. The breakfast menu and buffet offer a wide range, all fresh and beautifully cooked. As we wanted to use the tube station, the location of the hotel is excellent for South Kensington tube. We felt safe at all times including arriving back from an evening out at a late time. The bar is comfortable, friendly and the service is very good. We shall certainly return again when we need to stay in London.",5,2019,11,16
113,Great place for parents with kids,"We had an amazing experience with the Kensington. We visited with our almost 2-year old son and the hotel truly did everything to give us a great experience. The hotel has all the facilities you would need with a small child. The kids menu is reasonably priced and has good healthy choices. The rooms are fantastic. There are multiple areas where you can relax or have a drink or a small bite.There is a large bath in the room and the hotel provides you with a mini-bathrobe and all kinds of extra's for the little one. The hotel is in close proximity of the Natural history museum which is great, also with a 2-year old. There is a very nice bar and a good restaurant which means that the grown-ups can also relax. The breakfast buffet is also wonderful. As a family we are definitely coming back. Everyone from the staff really gave us the feeling that we were welcome and at home. The guests are mixed, families, business travellers and couples which makes for a very nice atmosphere in the hotel.",5,2019,11,11
113,Amazing Hotel,"This is my first review and the Kensington Hotel is worth it! Exceeded my expectations, the whole experience in London during our stay was better due to our stay in the Kensigton hotel, staff was very friendly and helpfull with all our needs. 
",5,2019,11,06
113,Perfect mother daughter stay,"My daughter (11) and I just returned from a week‚Äôs stay at this magnificent hotel! This was our first trip to London and we wanted a truly authentic experience filled with British charm and elegance and The Kensington delivered. Our accommodations (junior suite) were incredibly well appointed and ‚Äúfancy‚Äù according to my daughter. It was also quite spacious which is rare for a London hotel room I‚Äôm told. 

We were absolutely doted on by the entire staff which not only gave us great comfort being so far from home in the States, but truly helped make our vacation run smoothly. The concierge was amazing with tips and information but the doormen and front desk staff were just as helpful when we wanted to find a local restaurant for a quick bite or figure out which transport option was best. Additional treats included little surprises for my daughter like a custom made Trick or Treating bag filled with candy (we were there for Halloween), special surprise desserts and snacks in our room, and my favorite US newspaper and complimentary still and sparkling waters replenished every day. We enjoyed sitting by the fireplace in the hotel bar/restaurant every evening playing board games provided by the hotel while we shared dessert and a glass of wine for me every evening. While this hotel is certainly accommodating for a family, I would also absolutely stay here with just my husband for a grown up getaway. There were some children at the property but most of the guests were adults enjoying a sophisticated escape. 

Of course there are other lovely hotels throughout London but none of them can compete with The Kensington in terms of location. I wouldn‚Äôt stay in any other neighborhood in London. This hotel is perfectly situated in a quiet nook of an upscale neighborhood with all of the amenities within a 2 block radius. It‚Äôs a 3 minute walk to the Tube which will take you anywhere but it‚Äôs also an easy, beautiful, leisurely walk to everything else you should see and do. I didn‚Äôt know how massive London was and was so grateful to be so close to everything I wanted to do without being in the middle of chaotic and crowded more touristy hotspots. 

This hotel was a five star experience for sure and worth every pound we paid. Highly recommend and cannot wait to come back someday.",5,2019,11,05
113,Fantastic Hotel!!!,"We keep coming back!!! We discovered this hotel about a year ago and have been back three times.  What we love about the place is the kind and efficient staff service, cozy ambiance, clean and comfortable rooms and  convenient location.  We look forward to stopping by for another weekend stay early in the new year.  ",5,2019,11,04
113,Excellent service,"This was our second stay at The Kensington, so we knew what to expect: convenient location close to the tube station, easy walking distances, wonderful breakfast and afternoon tea, clean and quiet guest rooms, and beautiful ambience! The service had been impeccable during our first visit, and it was equally as good this time. 

The staff goes out of their way to make you feel at home and well-attended. One such example of going above and beyond involved Gvido.The day we were leaving, our flight was delayed. We called the car company to reschedule our drive to the airport and set off to take a walk before the rescheduled time. Unfortunately, the driver didn‚Äôt receive the message and showed up early. Thankfully, Gvido knew we were taking a walk before we left and went out of his way to convince the driver to stay, assuring him that we‚Äôd return shortly. This allowed us to return from our walk and catch our ride without a hitch. Thank you, Gvido!

It goes without saying that our next stay in London will once again be spent at the lovely Kensington!",5,2019,11,01
113,Tasty and delicious meal and excellent service.,"I attended a Board Meeting at the Kensington last evening with other members of the Board and after the meeting we had drinks and then dinner. The service was excellent, the meal was delicious and the wine was exquisite. Every member of the staff was exceptional. A joyful evening.",5,2019,10,31
113,Stunning hotel and exceptional service,"I stayed for one night with a friend who was visiting from Australia. From the moment we entered the foyer we were suitably impressed. The whole hotel is beautiful, tasteful, cosy and spotless, plus it smelt nice too!! The various reception rooms are so welcoming and the bar is very classy. Our twin room was small but clean and modern with a nice view over the main street. What stood out the most though and made our stay so exceptional, was the outstanding service. From Thomas, who served us the most superb breakfast, to Vincent on concierge, who organised afternoon tea for us at Claridges. The reception staff and doormen were helpful and courteous too at all times and we felt so valued and special. I cannot recommend this hotel enough!",5,2019,10,31
113,Excellent hotel,Never dissapointed. the breakfeast is exceptionnal and you 'll find no better place for a stay in London.The qualituty of the extra bed could be improve. It's the best Tea Time in London if you ll like this kind of experience.,5,2019,10,29
113,As good and luxurious as it gets - Top marks,"The most magnificent room and importantly I haven't slept in a bed this great in a long time with as comfy pillows. Everything from the bar, lounge, restaurant and hallways opzes of quality and authenticity. A really great experience and the posched eggs and avocados were yummy.",5,2019,10,28

I have never seen such helpful people always ready to solve   any problem I could have.

113,Exceeded expectations!,"Everything about our experience at The Kensington was amazing. The staff, especially Thomas and Melinda, went out of their way to ensure that we felt special and were well taken care of. They always called us by name and asked if we needed anything. The interior was stunning. The furnishings were beautiful yet comfortable and the attention to detail was impressive. The restaurant and bar were excellent as well. We had coffee and juice from the juicery every morning and cocktails in the evening. Dinner from the restaurant was delicious. Book book book, this place is amazing!",5,2019,10,21
113,Jenny M,"The Kensington is so very well-situated!  Walking distance to many shops/restaurants and the South Kensington Underground station.  Beautiful hotel - but truly what makes it outstanding is the staff!  Ronnie, Sunny, and Thomas to name a few.  They couldn't be more helpful and welcoming.  ",5,2019,10,17
113,80th birthday celebration,"It was my dads 80th birthday last weekend and we spent it at the Kensington. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff & their care of us. We both enjoyed our stay so much and we are not particularly hotel people. Thank you so much to all the staff for their kindness towards my dad and for making his birthday so memorable. Ilaria Arcese, the breakfast manager treated my Dad like royalty.",5,2019,10,14
113,Delightful ,"First a shout out to Thomas. He was entertaining, attentive and absolutely charming. We couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better host. Thank you again for the two lovely red roses. 
Now for the food! It was, in a word, delicious! We had the roobios tea ( herbal) and it was amazing. Full bodied and rich with hints of cherry and vanilla. A little lemon and just a bit of honey made it come alive.
Now for the. Savories, sandwiches, scones and sweets.
The beef and ale pie was absolutely the best of the savories, but the crab cake and quiche were also excellent. I‚Äôve never really cared for quiche, but the was so light and tender i would be a fan if all quiche was so good. The sandwiches were tasty and moist. Our favorite was the coronation chicken. The sweets were of course adorable to look at and just as delicious to eat. The carrot cake under the layers of chocolate shard was not as flavorful as I would expect, but the chocolate made up for it. My husband‚Äôs favorite was the lemon ‚ÄúBig Ben‚Äù and mine was definitely the white chocolate with dark chocolate inside mini Gherkin. It has a hint of sea salt and gets better with every bite.
Now for the absolute highlight of the tea - the Scones! Oh my what heavenly bits of goodness when clotted cream and jam are added. Flavorful and not the least bit dry and perfectly tender. I cannot say enough good about them. 
Though this was our first London Tea, it won‚Äôt be our last. The bar has been set pretty high by our experience here and expectations were definitely exceeded.",5,2019,10,14
113,Lovely hotel in great location,"Stayed here as going to Royal Albert Hall and hotel is in perfect location. Very warm welcome from Greta who kindly upgraded us. This was especially welcome after a long day as we decided to have room service (food delicious - seasonal Risotto recommended). Bar is very cute. Would recommend  Chelsea Nights - very refreshing.
Had breakfast in the lounge which was lovely and light/airy. Nice selection of special juices to wake you up.",5,2019,10,14
113,Great value,We booked this hotel based on reviews and were not disappointed. Exceptional helpful service from the moment we arrived when they helped with our bags. We were able to check right into our room after an overnight flight arriving in the morning. There was lots of staff working that morning to assist us in how to see the sights in London. The complimentary breakfast was an excellent buffet with many choices as well as ordering off the menu. If I ever go back to London I would stay there again.,5,2019,10,13

Everyone on staff was superb. Felt like we were treated like royalty. We were in classic room and although small was very comfortable. Would recommend highly",5,2019,10,11
113,Always a joy,"For our annual meet up with Irish cousins The Kensington is our ‚Äògo to‚Äô destination. 
My husband and I have stayed here 4 times now and it remains consistently good. 
If I were asked what was it‚Äôs best feature, I‚Äôd have no hesitation in saying it‚Äôs the superb level of service. All of the staff are warm and welcoming, extremely courteous but in such a way that it feels genuine and that they have our best interests at heart. 
It‚Äôs second best feature is the beautiful interior design and style. Having studied Interior Design myself I have referenced it on numerous occasions as a great example of town meets country, function with luxury, wonderful conversation seating arranged near beautiful and cosy log fires. The Irish artwork was noted by our cousin, herself an artist. 

This excellent level interior design was a tiny bit lacking in our room sadly. A small room with no artwork on the plain walls, no armchair in an armchair-sized space, and it was hard to see how it earned the title of a ‚ÄòQueen Deluxe‚Äô as it was perfectly serviceable, but not ‚Äòdeluxe‚Äô . 

Breakfast was delicious ( though an added extra) and the somewhat plain Bedroom did not spoil yet another wonderful visit as for us, service is worth much more than an armchair.",4,2019,10,09
113,Polished service of a fine hotel,"
The polished service of a fine hotel in addition to the comfortable and immaculate accommodations is why The Kensington is a must stay.  All of the staff are professional and have been trained well. Valeriie we met at the front desk who asked if there was anything else she could do to make our stay more comfortable.  Matter of fact I asked for a suggestion for an outing and the concierge slipped a list of suggestions under my door.  The restaurant manager fit us in for high tea(which we enjoyed) and because we were short on time, got us in and out.  The room service was quick and delicious,  the house keeping spotless.  Oh and George the doorman always helpful.",5,2019,10,08
113,perfect place,"i loved everything about this hotel.  i had stopped in for a drink the last time i was in London and was stricken by the smart, posh design.  when i knew i was returning i booked it right away.  it happens to be located brilliantly as well. just close and yet just far enough from the S. Ken station.  incredibly comfy bed, great Malin and Goetz products, deliciious food, wonderful people.  i'll be staying there again in November and every time i stay in London from this point on.  :]",5,2019,10,07
113,"Best Bed & Sleep I had in Decades! Stellar Service, Genuinely Kind and Personable Staff","There was a lot I liked about this quaint luxurious and genuinely friendly staffed hotel. 
When I first arrived to my room there was a birthday cake and wine with a sweet card from the manager as it was my birthday the following day ‚Äì nice gesture!

Of notable strong mention are the beds ‚Äì where I was able to fall asleep in minutes - something I had not done in decades. Every night there I slept there was divine. Sleeping well is something I have struggled with since a child.

Upon my return home and unable to sleep well again, I contacted the Concierge Sunny to see if I could find out exactly what bed make and model was in my room ‚Äì as I am going to buy one just like it as a result of my experience.  Sunny was amazing. He responded immediately with a picture of the mattress label and inquired into which model it is while supplying me with links to company. He also supplied the exact type of linens I used. I am very grateful for his assistance.  

The Concierge Vincent was superb as well with stellar professional service. Vincent also went above and beyond by finding a creative way for me to get through the many obstacles I had receiving packages through customs. I am extremely grateful for his resourcefulness, genuine kindness and professionality. 

Both Vincent and Sunny were vigilant to assure that all my needs were met with the utmost diligence, and I greatly appreciate Valeriia the head manager for enabling me to have all my request addressed beyond my satisfaction. She is kind, efficient, and on top of all matters in a hotel well run.

The bellman Gvido was always steps ahead of me to ensure I had no impediments getting in and out of the hotel, and made sure I found my cab or driver when called. 

Bathroom amenities were of mentionable quality and as requested I was given a bathtub that was deep and perfect! The gym was astutely stocked with all the key equipment for a well rounded cardio and weight building workout.  I also love the location of this hotel, and that it is so close to Wholefoods.

I hope to be back soon, and hope to have that bed sooner!",5,2019,10,06

Great to have a Nespresso machine in the room. Lovely toiletries provided. No iron/ironing board ... but these were brought to my room just a few minutes after I called down to reception. Really poor service at breakfast. No-one seemed to really know what they were doing and there was no evidence of any manager. Took at least 20 minutes to order a coffee and probably another 10 minutes before it arrived! When I was leaving, I asked the doorman to help me get a taxi. He didn't seem willing or able to do this ... so I ended up going out on the street and hailing one myself. ",3,2019,10,03
113,Very pleasant stay at The Kensington,"We travel to London at least once every year.  This time we preferred to spend more time in museums and had chosen Kensington hotel for a 10 day stay. 

We were in different parts of Europe for two weeks and arrived at the Kensington Hotel with three big pieces of luggage. Lionelle Chan gave us a warm welcome and impressed us by being very caring and thoughtful. He had considered the length of our stay and gave us room options and advice to accommodate our needs. The stay had been a very pleasant one. We would like to express his great attitude and exceptional service.

We welcome the afternoon tea treat too.  The waitress who served us the afternoon tea was the same person who served us breakfast every morning.  She had been very attentive too. The doorman was also friendly and helpful. All these added up to very positive experience.",5,2019,10,01
113,A very comfortable hotel in a beautiful neighborhood,"A very warm, friendly and helpful staff makes this a 5 star hotel. The service was exceptional in every regard. Our room was small by US standards but very comfortable and fully equipped. Perfect for a weekend stay. We loved the heated bathroom floors!  The hotel is located very near South Kensington tube (with access to three different lines) museums, shopping and dining. Several great pubs nearby. South Kensington is a beautiful neighborhood easy to wander with history and wonderful architecture all around. 

I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London.

113,Lovely hotel and excellent service.,I very much enjoyed Hotel Kensington and recommended it to my colleague for future stays and visits. The staff are very detail and service-oriented. The attention to detail was evident. Breakfast in the morning was superb and I hope to return for a future stay.,4,2019,09,30
113,Kensington Hotel wonderful experience stayed a week,"We staya week in London each year. Last year we tried to switch up the area (took a break from Kensington) and stayed on the Strand at the Stand hotel. What a bust!! wouldn't go back to that hotel. The batteries died on the tv remote, as well as the door which resulted in me being locked out and the bed was two singles put together!! Who does that?

So back to South Kensington we went for our week at the Kensington hotel. I cant wait to come back to this hotel.  This hotel was a great value.

The room was very clean and comfortable and the staff was beyond exceptional - Eva and Lorena make a great team. Leandro Vittozzi also!! The bed was very comfortable. The room is not spacious but rooms are not in London.
The bar was exceptional and the cocktails were delightful.
The food at the restaurant was devine. Best Dover Sole ever. Even the soup and salad was world class.

I feel the staff went above and beyond to make the stay great for us. I have stayed in many hotels over the years including the Ritz Carlton and this hotel was well above their standards even.

Will definitely come back - even if you don't want to eat at the restaurant lots of other restaurants near by (Cacciaris is a great choice)
Had great sleeps on the bed (this was not two singles but together!!!).

For location you are five minutes to the tube!!!

Will definitely be back!!!

I must say that I have been more than pleased.  My niece reports that the  hotel is fabulous, the neighborhood is fab and very convenient, but what makes the hotel is the amazing and very personalized service.  They treat you like family!  I have been so pleased and would urge other travelers considering this hotel to do it.  You won't regret it.  ",5,2019,09,30
113,Landmark Tea - Landmark Service,"Just had the amazing ""Landmark Afternoon Tea"". It was only matched by the wonderful service, the staff are there when you need them but not rushing you or interrupting you every 5 minutes.  The surroundings are relaxing but the real star of experience is the food, wow, wow, wow. I love afternoon tea but this experience is head, shoulders and chest above most offered in London at a great price!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",5,2019,09,28
113,Afternoon tea,"We had the most wonderful afternoon tea at The Kensington Hotel. Thomas, our waiter quickly worked out the reason for our visit, my daughter booked the experience as a birthday treat for me. He gave me both a birthday card  and a gorgeous rose courtesy of the Hotel. Our food was both exceptional in presentation and taste. The theme is the London skyline and the stand on the shape of the London Eye is fantastic. We loved all the food but have to say the first course of crab cake, Stilton & broccoli quiche and steak and ale pie were amazing. Thomas also gave me my very own piece of ‚Äúbirthday cake‚Äù and a birthday badge to wear. The service was very friendly and professional throughout and I would highly recommend this venue to anyone looking for a special treat.",5,2019,09,27
113,The Best Part of Our Trip,"My husband and I traveled to Europe on a combined business/pleasure trip. The Kensington was our last stop of three countries/hotels. I could not be more pleased with the service and attentiveness of the staff. Check in was a breeze and we were given some great tips for restaurants in the area. The room was a bit small but with so much to do in the immediate area, we were barely there! Harrods was a 15 minute walk and the Natural History Museum is just around the corner. The Big Bus runs right through the area and there are 2 stops very close to the hotel. Sunny was so helpful when we needed directions and suggestions. He knew the best way to get around and gave me his number in case we got stuck somewhere and needed help. Upon check out, Verushka was training Margeaux and she was patient and kind. I can't say enough about how welcoming and attentive the staff is at The Kensington.",5,2019,09,26
113,A touch of luxury in a pair of converted townhouses.,"This hotel epitomises luxury. The staff are welcoming and highly efficient. The concierge (Member of the Golden Keys) is knowledgeable of the area and lives up to the reputation of his calling. Rooks are spacious and very comfortable, Views are typical London - roof tops. All amenities are provided in the rooms and if not present will be supplied on request (replacing decaf coffee pods with full strength took about 10 minutes. The lounge area has a comfortable feel and there are some lovely paintings on the walls. The library is charming. Meals are served in the lounge or main dining room and there is a well supplied cocktail bar. What makes the hotel is the staff who are ever present and unobtrusive. The staff are like a mini-United Nations with many languages represented. (Fortunate with French, Bulgarian and Oman embassies around the corner). Neighbourhood boasts some good restaurants and pubs. Easy walk to 2 tube stations and many bus routes. Albert Hall and South Kensington museums very close.",5,2019,09,24
113,Top notch customer service from Arrival until departure.  Every detail anticipated.  This is what service used to be!,"Awesome experience.  After the first day they remember who you are when you walk into and out of the hotel.

113,Every aspect of this property is perfect! My top choice in London!,"I am writing this review after a month-long European ""vacation"".  The Kensington was our last stop and one of many hotels. I am telling you this so you can appreciate the weight of my endorsement. The Kensington was over-the top-the best of the best!  Every aspect of our stay was perfect from a smiling bellman ready to help before the cab was even at a full stop, a front desk (Leonel) who welcomed us, an insightful and well-suited concierge (sonny) who was so easy to talk to and full of great suggestions.   We loved the quiet location in Kensington that is a few minutes walk from the South Kensington Tube stations, tons of amazing restaurants and museums. The hotel is in a classic Georgian building with a lovely bar and sitting room.  I highly recommend tea, breakfast and of course, you must take dinner in the restaurant Town House. Our dinner and wine experience in the Town House was very memorable (Thank you sommelier and manager Ben). Our suite had been recently remodeled and was clean, elegant, comfortable. I can not say enough good things about this property.  It is for sure my favorite in London and one of my favorites in the whole of Europe.",5,2019,09,20

A must visit destination if you want to have a night cap. ",5,2019,09,16
113,Fantastic stay at the Kensington Hotel,"Our three stay at the Kensington Hotel was perfect.  The service was excellent, the food was superior, and the value exceeded expectations.

113,Is this customer service or what?,"I've already reviewed this hotel, having been a very satisfied, guest there several times.  However, after another lovely 4-night stay last week, I had to give a special shout out to the staff, particularly ""Leandro"" at the front desk.  On my way out of the hotel one afternoon, I mentioned that my TV had frozen and that I was unable to watch the cricket (there was a big test match going on).  I mentioned that it was not a big deal because I had to go out anyway, but that I hoped someone could fix the TV before I got back later in the day.  When I came back, not only was the TV fixed, but waiting for me in my room was a platter of chocolate covered strawberries with a cricket themed photo backdrop (I've uploaded photo, though don't know if it will attach to this review) that Leandro had apparently cut and pasted just for me, knowing what a big cricket fan I was.  Is this customer service or what?",5,2019,09,13
113,Outstanding,"We have stayed here three times now and I am sold.   The combination of the service, the location, and the relatively reasonable prices are unbeatable. I especially recommend the buffet breakfast, which can power you through many hours of meetings or shopping or walking around London.  As always with centrally located London hotels, the rooms are quite small by US standards and a few of the lowest priced rooms may feel cramped if there are two people and a lot of luggage. But the storage and bathrooms are beautifully laid out.",5,2019,09,12
113,The Kensington,"Amazing hotel! Great location, fantastic experience. Wonderful service. Food very good. We have been to this hotel twice and will for sure return on our next visit to London. The staff helped us in every way--made taxi reservations for our trip to Cornwall. We highly recommend the Kensington. ",5,2019,09,10
113,Wonderful London Hotel,"We stayed at The Kensington in London for 6 nights in August for a 45th Anniversary celebration.This was a wonderful hotel!  The service was top notch, the very British decor was inviting, and the food was excellent at their hotel. Taxi service was quick and easy from the hotel, also.  The room was small by US standards, but they was well appointed with a very comfortable bed.  Perfect location! ",5,2019,09,08
113,A charming and wonderful hotel,"This is the first review I have written, motivated by the hotel's excellent service and hospitality.  The staff is amazing, especially the breakfast team, hosted by Thomas and Jan, The entire team, consisting of Ilaria, Rabah, Barbara, Petronella, Ronald, Melinda, Oana, and Elena, was thoroughly professional, Although its location and food are wonderful, what really makes The Kensington a stand-out is its staff and service.",5,2019,09,08
113,Wonderful stay at the kensington hotel,"We had a memorable  14 nights experience at this hotel, it was a family holiday me and my sister arrived from different destinations we were both very content with the welcoming and friendliness of the hotel staff. Rooms needs a makeover though I should mention that bed was fantastic  . Location of the hotel is central  with all cafes and restaurants around underground is 10min walk . I would surly recommend the hotel for my friends ",5,2019,09,05
113,"Excellent Value,o","Excellent value, extremely efficient staff and fantastic location. I arrived close to midnight and the check in staff could not me more welcoming or accommodating.  The room was lovely and had all amenities one could ask for.",5,2019,09,04
113,Best Hotel I've Ever Stayed In,"From the minute we arrived to the moment we left, the Kensington Hotel was an absolute dream. From the impeccable service to the fabulous food to the elegant ambiance, they nailed it. Rooms are small but that's the only potential downside. Worth 3x the price. Couldn't recommend highly enough. ",5,2019,09,04
113,Fabulous Hotel in Kensington,"Ideally located near South Kensington Underground, The Kensington was just wonderful. I was concerned about traffic noise but you couldn't hear the road at all from the room, staff were lovely, helpful and ready to communicate about anything. Rooms were very nicely decorated. Would definitely return here when in London again.",5,2019,09,04
113,Good Hotel,"Nice hotel, although the rooms are a bit on the small side.  Location is awesome, couldn't ask for anything more in this regard.  Close to the main tube that takes you pretty much almost anywhere without having to transfer.  The bed was comfortable and good amenities.  The walls are a bit thin and you can hear the pipes which made it slightly unpleasant.  Overall staff was nice and friendly.",4,2019,09,03
113,Wonderful family friendly hotel in the heart of London,"We absolutely loved the service, attention to detail, well appointed rooms and their location is incredible.  Walking distance to the park and museums, we will never stay in Mayfair after staying at the Kensington which makes you feel like a local.
The bathroom and living room were a wee bit smaller than expected but the rooms are impeccably clean, and well-kept.  The restaurant Chucs cafe kensington is around the corner alongside many other very good restaurants.  There's a waitrose, hair and nail salons and tons of boutiques around the corner. We will be going back soon.",5,2019,09,03
113,Unforgettable experience!,"Since the moment we arrived the staff made sure we felt like home. A welcome present was left in our room for us and for our 2 year old son as well. Our room was lovely and quite spacious. The day after we arrived the front desk gave us a couple additional presents for our baby boy so he could stay entertained. To be honest I've never been to a hotel were the staff is so focused in making you feel so comfortable! If all these isn't enough, the food in the hotel is really good and the location is unbeatable. The only thing that wasn't great was our mattress; for some strange reason it didn't feel as comfortable as the pillows or the sheets. Anyway, without a doubt we would stay here every time we come back to London.",5,2019,09,01
113,Our Adopted London Home,"The Kensington gives us a reason to keep coming back every time.

The care and personal touch that the concierge, bell men, servers, and bartenders display is not only consistent, but also unmatched, even by their sister hotels. 

One of the concierge workers even sat down and discussed football with me for half an hour while we waiting for our friend to arrive. He told me stories of his support for his club and always welcomed me with open arms when i walked through the doors even though he didn't approve of my support for my club.

Bedrooms are small, but the bed makes up for it alone in spades. Afternoon tea, midnight drinks, and assistance from the employees is always top notch. This bunch take their jobs very seriously.

We have dubbed this hotel our home in London for any future visits to the city. No exceptions. 

You want a sure thing? Stay here. Disregard room size. The quality and care and dedication is what sets this hotel apart from any hotel i've stayed at in Europe.",5,2019,09,01
113,London Themed Afternoon Tea,"I loved loved loved the london themed afternoon tea at The Kensington. Not only was the food really good, but the staff were also very friendly. I would bring other people to this afternoon tea in the future. ",5,2019,08,31
113,"Beautiful Hotel, Comfortable Rooms, Helpful Staff","The hotel, reflecting the South Kensington neighborhood where it resides, is gorgeous. We had a twin room with the beds pushed together, and while the room was small, it was arranged well and never felt cramped. The beds, linens and pillows were are all luxurious, and the bathtub was deep (a point to be appreciated). Perhaps most importantly (for a babymoon), the air conditioning worked marvelously (unique in our stay throughout the UK). Finally, the front desk and concierge were beyond kind and helpful, from our arrival to our departure. They greeted us with fresh pressed juice and warm towels to was our hands. They arranged for most of our meals and a last-minute hair appointment for my wife at a nearby salon. They helped with taxis and tube directions. I can‚Äôt say enough about them. All-in-all we loved our stay and would highly recommend The Kensington if you‚Äôre staying in London.",5,2019,08,26
113,First time with The Kensington London,"Since we first wallked into hotel lobby , such a good greeting from Bell Boy with good communicaton skill on receptionist at front desk. Food at Townhouse room was mavellous, we really like it. We stayed at this hotel for 7 nights and really enjoyed time spending here. It is not a big hotel but it make me feel like I stay in my own house. The time we leave and the time we come back, we feel like they want to take good care of us and want us well. Apprefiated service of all staffs and clealiness of our room which is the most important for me and my wife. Thank you very much. ",5,2019,08,26
113,We loved staying at The Kensington Hotel!,The Kensington Hotel was so wonderful!  We loved the location because it is a quiet area and yet there are great places to dine and the museums and underground is very nearby.  The staff was wonderful.  The concierge went above and beyond and the overall experience was comfortable and very pleasing.,5,2019,08,23
113,London Trip in August 2019,"Majority of the provisions in the hotel are excellent. The staffs are very friendly and kind. The lobby is very beautiful and comfort. Air-conditioning, lighting & TV works perfectly, which you would probably expected for a 5-star hotel and the price you pay especially during peak season. However, there are a few problems we encountered during my stay: 1) View in the Family Room was poor; 2) Bathroom sink blockage even after it was fixed on my first arrival day; 3) Bath Room layout was very strange as it has only 3 sided-barrier.",4,2019,08,21
113,Lovely London stay,"Welcoming venue, with lots of extras. Enjoyed the experience immensely! This is a class hotel in the heart of Kensington, near to all you want to do in London. Staff were very gracious and food, drinks were of the highest quality!",5,2019,08,19
113,An introverted Bride-To-Be‚Äôs heaven!,"This was just perfect. Filling. But perfect. I have to give The Kensington full marks. It‚Äôs staff, it‚Äôs venue, it‚Äôs food, it‚Äôs service, it‚Äôs value for money and experience and it‚Äôs ambiance. 
I was welcomed with a rose and a hand written greeting card congratulating my upcoming marriage. What a way to set the tone for the event. Such a lovely touch.
Every staff member was so friendly, so hospitable and actually, incredibly genuine. So well done and thank you to Alexa and the team. 
I‚Äôm not a wild one with partying. I‚Äôm an introvert so having this stylish and delicious afternoon tea as part of my hen party suited my perfectly. 
So not only did we get the BEAUTIFUL starter and the showstopper afternoon tea, I was also given an AMAZING cheesecake with congratulations very beautifully written on it.
They were very mindful of my allergies and the health, safety and enjoyment of the customers.  They were also very flexible with what you order- you don‚Äôt stick to a strict - ‚Äòif you order tea, you stick with that exact drink ‚Äò. They let us chop and change between drinks depending on what we felt like.
The cappuccino was absolutely delicious as was the champagne.
The hotel is beautifully kept. Clean, warm and welcoming. 
I have absolutely nothing bad to say about it. 
I thoroughly loved it and so did the rest of the ladies who were lunching.",5,2019,08,18
113,Wonderful hotel,"We absolutely loved this hotel.  The staff was friendly and helpful,  the decor in the public areas was beautiful, our room, although small, was well appointed and comfortable, and the continental breakfast had a large variety of baked goods, fruits, meats, cheeses, cereal, eggs and yogurt, all beautifully displayed.  Its location in South Kensington was is a four minute walk to the nearest subway, and close to several cafes and restaurants as well as walking distance to the Victoria and Albert Museum.  We would absolutely stay here again.  ",5,2019,08,18
113,"Absolutely gorgeous ! Stunning decor, charming atmosphere ,and a big warm welcome","I have just had the pleasure of staying at The Kensington ! First in June (accompanied by my daughter and two grandchildren) and then again by myself in July. On both occasions it was a total joy! I simply LOVE this hotel ! The staff, from the Managers down, are delightful  ! They ALL go out of their way to make you feel special special, and entirely cared for ! Breakfast in the lovely dining room is a delicious experience, as was the dinner.(I ate  in the lounge ).The canap√©s and generous nibbles they serve with drinks in the lounges are also a treat. I relished the cosiness, charm ,and sense of luxury throughout this fabulous  hotel ! I so appreciated the quality and colours of the furnishings, the fresh flowers ,and the relaxed ,friendly atmosphere. My  enormous thanks and sincere gratitude to ALL of you kind, caring people at The Kensington !",5,2019,08,17
113,Loved The Kensington!,"We stayed at The Kensington in July of 2019. We loved it so much, we stayed an extra night! The rooms are gorgeous!  The hotel is perfectly located near the underground, food and shops. But what makes this hotel so perfect is the outstanding staff. Absolutely everyone goes over and above to make sure you are treated perfectly. We will stay there again and highly reccommend it!",5,2019,08,14
113,Excellent Hotel Highly Recomended,"This was our 2nd stay at the hotel. We decided to stay a 2nd time as our experience on the first visit was superb. The hotel is clean and tidy, the staff are friendly and welcoming. The bar and restaurant quality are excellent. The breakfast was delicious with lots of choice and not too expensive. Our room was spotlessly clean. We would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in the area.",5,2019,08,13
113,Perfect position in South Kensington,"This is my 3rd stay at The Kensington. Having family in this area we usually stay here when visiting London. With museums, parks, shopping and underground nearby The Kensington is in an excellent position. Staff are always friendly and attentive. Rooms although compact are clean and housekeeping excellent. 
The lounge, bar and breakfast make you feel you are definitely in a London Townhouse.    ",5,2019,08,12
113,We loved the Kensington,"This hotel is full of unique charms. The townhouse resturuant is delicious and beautiful, I loved dining in the little nooks surrounded by bookshelves and trinkets. It felt like being at home. The rooms were a good size and beautifully decorated. The location was perfect, just a short walk to the Science Museum, Natural History Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and just a little ways from the South Kensington station for the tube. My only complaint was that the bed was too firm for me, but that's more a preference thing (my husband loved it).",5,2019,08,12
113,Fantastic service and lovely space,"My wife and I came to The Kensington in order to attend a conference in Westminster. We felt every person with whom we dealt was more than courteous, but rather went out of their way to be helpful and attentive. Lovely place that we would return to in the future.",5,2019,08,12
113,Best staff ever,"We spent eight nights at The Kensington with my husband and our 12 years old daughter. Every room here is different and that tells already something about this place. The ambient is a superb  example of mixed British elegance and contemporary international high class pieces. But what really put The Kensington in another league is its staff. At arrival we entered the suite and we found little individualized gift for our daughter.  The day after we met Thomas, who welcomes guests for breakfast. Thomas has a special touch. He‚Äôs classy and friendly at the same time, makes you feel as a member of the Royal family and has always a fun word for you. Ilaria works in the restaurant and is always sweet and lovely. Greta and Leandro at the front desk pampered us with infinite attention. This place is built around its people, they make it so special. This will be our home in London. As Thomas say ‚Äúit‚Äôs always a see you again when you leave The Kensington.‚Äù. ",5,2019,08,12
113,Beautiful hotel near London museums,"I've stayed at The Kensington a number of times over the last 5 years. The hotel is beautiful and the beds are really comfortable. Many of the rooms are smaller than what most Americans are used to, but the quality more than makes up for it.

The location is great if you're planning to spend a lot of time on the west side of London. The Victoria & Albert (my favorite museum) and the Natural History Museum is walking distance, as is the park. It's a fairly quiet neighborhood and more residentual. But you're also a few minutes from a tube station which puts you in central London fairly quickly.",5,2019,08,11
113,Fabulous!,"We stayed at the hotel to celebrate our 45th wedding anniversary. It was perfect in every aspect. The room was beyond our expectations and we were spoilt with complimentary prosecco and cake!. The attentiveness of the staff was amazing and genuine. The room was quiet, very comfortable and spotlessly clean. ",5,2019,08,11
113,Afternoon Tea,"I brought my mother and grandmother who was visiting London to the London Landmarks Afternoon Tea and was blown away. We were greeted by lovely Thomas who made sure that we were comfortable. Although my grandmother felt unwell, the visual display of the London Eye and the deliciousness of the sweets was to die for.  Ilaria and Ronald served us with such care and warm enthusiasm. The service was top notch. I would definitely recommend this afternoon tea for everyone, and say that it is a MUST for anyone visiting this city. Thank you so much guys for the experience.",5,2019,08,09
113,Amazing stay. Beautiful hotel. Kind and helpful staff.,"My husband and I had a beautiful stay. It was quick but the hotel was so nice that we were able to make the most of our 2 nights in London. Beautifully decorated. The concierge was kind ans super helpful, as well as all the staff. Lots of nice little restaurants in the area. Will definitely come back for a longer stay! ",5,2019,08,08
113,Well looked after,Beautiful Hotel in busy area but peaceful atmosphere within. Staff are attentive but not over bearing. Lovely quiet room. Superb freshly cooked breakfast. Only 15min walk from Royal Albert Hall so would make an ideal base for The Proms.,5,2019,08,06
113,Afternoon Tea,I booked this for my mums birthday. We have done over 20 afternoon teas together in London and Surrey and this one was one of our faves! The food quality was amazing. The price of ¬£42 each was definitely worth it. The staff were very helpful and explained the food well. The representation and the detail on the food was amazing. We were very impressed. We were also able to take home the scones we couldn‚Äôt finish! This is a must!!,5,2019,08,05
113,Lovely Hotel,"I recently stayed at The Kensington for 4 nights with my Daughter and what a lovely Hotel it is, although the area seemed to be a long walk from where we wanted to be and possibly not the best of walks, I am comparing it to staying at another Hotel on a Break to London, which was very near the Thames and so always had a lovely walk to and from wherever we went.  The Hotel seemed clean and the people that worked on behalf of The Kensington seemed lovely and we also enjoyed the food on several evenings.",4,2019,08,05
113,Fantastic,"Customer service was great! ‚ÄúCan do attitude!‚Äù
Room was great with a/c working with the heat at all time high.
Room amenities very good!
Bedding great!
Location is good.
Fish and chips the greatest, bar none!!!!",5,2019,08,04
113,London - Third hotel stay from the Doyle Collection hotel chain,"My 3rd stay at a Doyle Collection Hotel chain, and really liked The Kensington for a London hotel.  Had to change the 1st room I found online, it was really small had to pay more to change to a ""Studio"" room facing front with a good size bathroom. Staff was warm, helpful and friendly throughout my stay. What I love most was the location, with restaurants, shops and the V&A museum in walking distance. Highly recommend, previously stayed at The Westbury Dublin and The Bloomsbury, Ldn in previous visits.",5,2019,08,04
113,Just lovely!,"My husband, 4 yr old son and I stayed here to make use of some Mr&Mrs Smith vouchers and to have two days out in London. We chose it primarily due to proximity to Natural History Museum and the centre in general - and our stay was fantastic!
I was worried beforehand that the hotel was perhaps too ‚Äòboutique‚Äô for our family (esp. for a 4yr old child) but my fears were alleviated immediately by a very warm welcome, free refreshments and incredibly friendly staff who made small talk with our son. The room was lovely, bathroom huge and all very clean - extra bed fitted easily. 
The staff, in particular, are a credit to the hotel. Always smiling, friendly and on hand. They even offered me a pregnancy pillow (!) as I am visibly heavily pregnant which made sleep even better.
Breakfast was lovely, healthy and varied buffet spread with some delicious cooked a la carte options too.
Location is superb, central, great transport links and lots of places to eat out within 5 min walk. Would highly recommend! Thank you for a wonderful stay.",5,2019,08,04
113,The most amazing hotel!,"The Kensington is quite simply the most amazing hotel.  My husband and I stayed there for our 20 th Anniversary trip to London and we were blown away by the elegance, comfort, and incredible customer service by the staff.  We stayed in room 329 which was a large room with a 4 poster king size bed.  The bathroom had a separate tub and shower.  The room had a great view of the street below.  The staff was so attentive and friendly.  George was a standout for all his great advice and recommendations.  He even sent us a little note the day we left.  We had a delicious breakfast every morning in the beautiful and quaint restaurant and at the end of each evening we sat in the lounge and had drinks. We stayed at the Kensington for the first three nights of our 2 week stay in England, upon returning to London for our last two nights I couldn‚Äôt bear to stay at a different hotel that we originally booked so my husband called the Kensington last minute and booked a stay for our last night.  They even managed to offer us our same room that we loved!  Curtis went above and beyond by coming to the hotel we were at a few blocks away and helped move our luggage to the Kensington.  They already had our room all set up with a ‚ÄòWelcome Back‚Äô card and chocolates ready to go.  I am simply blown away by their attention to detail!  Martin at the door was another staff stand out for his welcoming demeanor and pleasant help.  I know exactly where I will book every time I go to London!",5,2019,08,03
113,"Above and beyond, wonderful hotel, such lovely staff made our stay wonderful","Amazing people and place.  Can't wait to stay here on our next visit!  Everyone at the Kensington went above and beyond to make our stay welcoming and fun.  The hotel is absolutely stunning, pictures don't do it justice.  Absolutely gorgeous yet cozy at the same time.",5,2019,08,01
113,Great A/C in Hotel during Record breaking heat wave.,"This hotel is located close to the Natural History and the Victoria & Albert Museums.  It is pretty, friendly and their air conditioning is awesome.  The staff was very attentive.  Room service for breakfast was delicious and so easy.  ",5,2019,07,30
113,Amazing experience,"This hotel exceeded our expectations by far. The staff was so welcoming and friendly, offered us some extras when we lost our luggage at the airport.  The rooms and lobby areas were very clean and it has a great gym in the basement. The location was also great- 4 minute walk to the Tube! Breakfast was great in the morning as well. We will definitely be staying here next time we come!",5,2019,07,30
113,Fantastic vacation,Excellent discovery thank to a friend who recommended The Kensington. Everything is perfect. We will come back. A perfect hotel in a very pleasant area.The size of the roooms is not very big but the common area is so beautiful!,5,2019,07,25
113,"Beautiful, high-class, and perfectly located!","I was fortunate to stay here for a quick 24-hours between flights and could not have been more impressed. The hotel is perfectly located a stone's throw from Hyde Park and all of the museums that surround it- Kensington Palace, the V&A, the Natural History Museum, etc. In addition, the South Kensington tube stop is only about a 5-minute walk from the hotel. The staff was incredibly accommodating and kind, offering me free drinks tickets to the bar and some chocolates in my room! Special thanks to Valeria G. for taking such good care of me! My only complaint was that I found the portions at the a la carte breakfast to be small- better to opt for the buffet. However, I would be lucky to stay at the Kensington again upon my next return to London.",5,2019,07,23
113,The English Charm!,"My mom, aunt and myself stayed at The Kensington from July 09 to July 18th. The rooms were quaint, CLEAN and had beautiful balcony views! The staff was always friendly and attentive to our needs! A special mention goes to the lovely George ‚ÄúClooney‚Äù. George, it was a privilege to have been acquainted with you! You were always helpful (even became our personal travel guide), cheerful and just all round amazing! Seeing you at the door every morning with a smile on your face made our stay so memorable! The Kensington is the ONLY place to stay at when in London! It‚Äôs central location, amazing staff members and beautiful English atmosphere will leave you wanting to postpone leaving!",5,2019,07,23
113,Belated Spring Break Review,"My husband and I took our two boys (9 and 11) to London for Spring Break this year and chose to stay at The Kensington.  We arrived at the hotel around 10am and were given our room immediately, despite check-in typically being much later.  The lobby and restaurant are impeccably styled.  The room was spacious and modern.  The location is also fantastic with a Tube station right around the corner and many attractions within walking distance.  The staff, however, is what made The Kensington feel like home for the 5 days we were there.  Our visit fell just after my younger son's birthday and just before my older son's birthday.  We were surprised and the boys were overjoyed to receive two nights of birthday treats, along with personalized notes from the staff mentioning topics the boys had discussed with them earlier in the trip.  I was very impressed by their attention to what the boys found exciting.  The front desk staff also provided numerous restaurant recommendations that were hits with the whole family.  The bell staff regularly called taxis for us and went out of their way to call a particular driver for our longer trip back to the airport.  We will absolutely stay at The Kensington again the next time we are in London.",5,2019,07,20
113,Memorial trip,"This stay came as a memorial trip.
Because I like Kensington Palace
I chose a hotel close to it.
Providing warm towels and cold drinks at check-in is like a Japanese hospitality.
The rooms are cozy and the rooms are also Japanese style.
The correspondence of the hotel staff was very nice. The food at the hotel restaurant is also very delicious. I was very relaxed.
It is a hotel I want to visit by all means next time.
Thank you.",5,2019,07,20
113,The Kensington is the Best,"This was my second stay at The Kensington, and I enjoyed it even more this year. The hotel is in a fantastic location for food and travel, close to restaurants, markets, and the tube. But it's the staff at The Kensington that makes this hotel really special and top rate. They are always willing to assist. Every staff member is pleasant, friendly, professional, and willing to help. The desk staff is first rate. Leandro was kind and helpful when I arrived after my long trip, and my luggage was misplaced by the airline. He personally made sure that I got a room right away and didn't have to wait the four hours. The desk staff provided me with a toothbrush and a few other essentials as well. I can't tell you how much I appreciated that kindness. (Leandro also helped me later with a small room issue.) Vincent at the concierge desk was great and helped me call the airline to locate my luggage. He also helped me later book some tickets. George, Ronnie, and Guido were always polite, helpful, courteous, and welcoming, too. The staff in the restaurant were always very pleasant and efficient, and the food there is very good. My standard room was clean and tidy with a very comfortable bed and linens. Although it was a bit small, it was just fine for one person. My room did need new carpeting, and the floor boards were squeaky, but other than that, I enjoyed every minute of my two week stay here. The staff makes you feel welcome, not like a foreign tourist, and there are many five star extras like free wifi, free water, very comfortable bed, air conditioning, early check in, doorman, large tv, room safe, hot pot, refrigerator, fast elevators, concierge services, turn down service, welcome drink, restaurant on site; all in addition to a fantastic location in South Kensington. Thank you for making my trip so enjoyable. I hope to stay at The Kensington again next year. The staff understands that when you treat people well, they return.",5,2019,07,20
113,Kensington in London,"we recently stayed at the Kensington while vacationing in London.  The hotel is in a wonderful part of town.  The staff from top to bottom provided exceptional service.  The food and beverage was top notch.  This was our first trip to London, but certainly not our last stay at the Kensington.",5,2019,07,16
113,Can't say anything but this is surely a wonderful hotel,"1st class service, excellent location, great stay, 5-star cleanliness, great food and an overall wonderful experience. 
You can find cheaper hotels in the area but this hotel is surely a wonderful stay and if you're willing to pay that much it is the place to stay!",5,2019,07,14
113,Poorly trained staff and limited response from management during birthday trip in May 2019,"I booked 3 nights at this hotel for my husbands 35th birthday in May 2019. I was incredibly excited to stay here - a bit of luxury in Kensington. However, my experience at the hotel was horrible due to the staff. Essentially, rather than get to know the guests of the hotel, I was instead questioned as to whether I was staying at the hotel, several times, and asked my room number. I was also asked to show ID. If the staff were trained to know the guests (or not make assumptions about who may or may not be guests of the hotel) we wouldn't have had these issues. In one specfic incident, I was sitting in the lobby eating a banana after a workout and was approached by an employee of the hotel several times and first told that I was not allowed to eat in the lobby (despite the fact that two other women had eaten their entire breakfast in the lobby, without interruption from staff). I was then asked if I was staying at the hotel, to which I replied yes, and then was asked my room number. I raised this with the hotel and received notification from the front desk that I am actually allowed to eat in the lobby and shouldn't have been harassed in that way. The front desk said there would be an investigation, but I was never addressed about the issue, nor were actions taken to ensure that other guests do not feel this way. Ultimately, I was hoping this hotel could be a home away from home, but now I would never want to return, as I was made to feel as a trespasser in a hotel where I was paying 300+ per night to stay. What an insult and embarrassment. The hotel, staff and management should be ashamed of their inability to do the sole job they have in the business, which is to make their guests feel at home.",1,2019,07,12
113,Beautiful Hotel - Perfect Location and amazing staff,"My husband and I stayed at The Kensington for 3 nights/4 days and absolutely loved it.  The staff were very welcoming and helpful.  The rooms were very clean and well decorated. The hotel itself was beautiful and sophisticated and the Town House was such cute restaurant. The location was one of the main reasons we stayed here with it's proximity to the metro, museums, restaurants and Hyde Park and was perfect for our visit.  We will definitely be staying here next time we are in London!",5,2019,07,11
113,Wedding night,"Without exception, the hotel staff were excellent. Friendly, professional and accommodating for all of our requests. Lovely family room finished to a very high standard. The hotel feels private, discrete and stylish. Will stay again .  ",5,2019,07,11
113,Perfect base in London with staff who go above and beyond,"Perfect place to stay recently with 2 American friends on their first visit to London. 

The atmosphere in the hotel is gorgeous, and feels more like a private club where you can sit in a quiet corner reading the paper and feel totally at home. 

The basement gym is peaceful and impressively equipped for a city hotel location - mini fridges being stocked with coconut water was a nice touch following a workout. 

Breakfast was fantastic - we could have sat chatting and sampling drinks from the Juicery for hours!

Simple things like the receptionist offering me a bottle of water as I headed out on a run early in the morning and getting me a refreshing juice when I got back didn't go unnoticed. The staff going above and beyond to ensure we enjoyed our stay made all the difference and will guarantee our return to the Kensington.

The only place I will be staying on future visits to London!",5,2019,07,10
113,Great Hotel with Outstanding Staff,"We've just spent a fantastic weekend in London, made simply sublime by our choice of the Kensington Hotel. From the moment we were greeted By Valeriia, the wonderful Front Office Manager, we knew we were in for special stay. What made this so enjoyable was the entire staff effort in 'hosting' their guests. This is an elegant and friendly hotel, in a great loaction, but the service marks it out above all else. We'll be back very soon. Best wishes from Ian and Mary Barry - Ireland. ",5,2019,07,08
113,Wonderful hotel in an excellent location,"The Kensington is a jewel of a hotel in an excellent location.  Historic hotel that feels like ""home"".  The staff is exceptional and very friendly.  We were staying here for a trip to Wimbledon and the hotel was very convenient.  I'd definitely stay here again.",5,2019,07,08
113,Almost perfect! ,"Third stay, highly recommend treating yourself! Carlos at front desk is the type of employee all hotels should station at the front desk as he is welcoming and highly competent. Great concierge Michael. 

Room was absolutely to die for. Only missing element was service at breakfast has slipped. Food good, but we waited a long time for table service. Maybe because it was Wimbledon? That said, we will still go back. ",5,2019,07,08
113,one of the best,"My husband and I booked a studio suite. The classic rooms I assume are smaller and may be fine if you do not plan to be in the room.  We had requested a quiet room
The hotel lobby, bar and restaurant are very pleasant and comfortably sophisticated.  The reservation welcome staff was more than kind to weary travelers and greeted us with an amazing fresh juice upon arrival..   Everyone was smiles and attentive.  
The studio suite we were first assigned was next to  construction updating the other rooms on the floor but when we called to report some drilling noise we were immediately taken to another floor to view an alternate studio.  This studio was tucked away from other rooms and we completed our stay in that studio.   The entire staff was amazing.   The room was slightly more worn than the original studio suite we were given with the noise issue but slightly less updated decor did not bother us and I do know they were updating other rooms I assume this room will soon be as well. Anyone else would probably not even notice. Only very minor details like furniture scratches and not gleaming new tile grout. Very clean though and very quiet. The private studio made for an excellent stay.   The customer service which we engaged several times needing help with transportation and computer tech issues was more than helpful!! 
We travel a good bit staying everywhere from the Ritz to comfortable less expensive hotels.  The Kensington London exceeded our exceptions for the price range and we will certainly recommend.",5,2019,07,07
113,Nice hotel in South Kensington,"We stay 1 night in this hotel on our way back to Chile. I chose it because of this excellent location, close to various London landmarks and 2 blocks from a Tube station. It was a very good experience overall. I requested a late check out and had no problem with it. The room they gave us was on the 5th floor, in the attic, so it was kind of small.",5,2019,07,06
113,Great stay,"Stayed for a night, excellent! Very friendly and helpful staff (George, Dominique and everyone else). Stayed only 1 night, but really relaxed and enjoyed it, would definitely recommend to everyone. Great value for money. ",5,2019,07,06
113,Fantastic hotel,"Loved the location of this hotel.  Had a standard classic room at the front but still very quiet at night. Felt very relaxed the moment we checked it and was offered a refreshing pick me up juice! Room could do with updating, however bathroom was ok and spacious.  Fantastic breakfast, excellent choice.  Enjoyed a drink in the K bar.  All public areas of the hotel were well decorated and furnished.  Love the hotel and would return again. Thank you to the staff who made the effort to check if we were celebrating an occasion and left an 'anniversary dessert' on a plate in our room.",5,2019,07,03
113,My Mum and dads 50th Wedding Anniversary!!!,"I organised a 2 day mini break for my Mum and dad to stay at the Kensington.I
I contacted and arranged a meal, an afternoon tea and flowers for the room.
I was a little worried as this was such an occasion to celebrate.
I needn't have been! The staff were amazing and looked after my Mum and Dad very well!
The room was gorgeous, the dinner was fabulous, the afternoon tea was out of this world!!! They loved the landmark cakes of London!
Little touches and kind thoughts were created throughout their stay and they have told me they will never forget their time there.
Many thanks to Ramona and all the staff at The Kensington!",5,2019,07,03
113,Tiny - but cute,"The hotel itself is stunning. The lobby, restaurant and bar are gorgeous. Service is 11/10. The rooms are clean, beautiful view, but you couldn‚Äôt swing a cat in it. We stayed at Blake‚Äôs last time we were in town and were spoilt for space, so to have that experience as a comparison and then end up with enough room for a 5 year old it was a struggle to adjust... in saying that, I wasn‚Äôt in charge of booking accommodation this time around so I‚Äôm not even sure what the other options were (the saying ‚Äúif you want something done right, then do it yourself‚Äù definitely applies). We barely fit in the bed, it was quite a struggle. All that aside, I‚Äôd stay here again (If I was alone and had no one to share the room with). It‚Äôs footsteps from the Museum of Natural History and Victoria & Albert, and a handful of amazing restaurants. ",4,2019,07,03
113,A bit of luxury in central London.,"This was a post GCSE trip to London for my daughter to see the Dior exhibition at the V and A.
The hotel was lovely, opulent decor and very good staff. Comfortable rooms, great food and excellent location. Loved it!",5,2019,07,03
113,Love it,"Best Turkish in town.
Large portions that you can take away too if you don't finish. Never had a bad meal, always thoroughly enjoyed. Good atmosphere too. Been to loads of different Turkish restaurants all over and this is by far the best",5,2019,07,02
113,Loved The Kensington!,What sets The Kensington apart from other hotels is the wonderful staff. We felt welcomed from the minute we arrived. The concierge helped with all of our questions and Curtis helped us to our room and showed us around the beautiful hotel. The neighborhood was close to the tube and there were great restaurants within walking distance. We can't wait to go again!,5,2019,07,02
113,Great location but not luxury,"We stayed here in May 2019. We selected the hotel because it was 5 star. We thought the location was great. It was near attractions including museums and lots of local restaurants and such. The service at the hotel was also great. Staff was very nice. 

Here‚Äôs the negative and why we wouldn‚Äôt stay again: the entrance, lobby and restaurants were very high end. When you got upstairs to the guest rooms the hallways were so narrow you had to hug the wall to let others by. There was absolutely no space in the room it was so claustrophobic and the bathroom was way small. Also the outlet in the bathroom said it couldn‚Äôt be used for the hairdryer so you couldn‚Äôt dry your hair in the bathroom. You also had to step over a high bathtub wall to get into and out of the shower. I had Achilles surgery and it was very difficult that there was no walk in shower. If you were elderly or had medical issues like me it would be hard and dangerous. 

I asked at the desk about upgrading from the standard room even though we paid a lot but was told it would be an additional $200 American a night to upgrade. 

I did not consider the hotel to be 5 star especially in light of what we paid and other 5 star boutique hotels we have stayed in.",3,2019,07,01
113,"Chick boutique hotel with amazingly friendly, accommodating and welcoming staff","I have been staying at the Kensington each year I travel to London with my family.  The hotel is extremely charming and English, very accommodating and in the greatest location of London (South Kensington).  You will feel the warmth of the staff upon arrival.  They will do anything they can to accommodate you and your family.  This hotel is very hard to leave!",5,2019,06,29
113,Lovely hotel,"This is a beautiful spot near, but not in, the heavy congestion of London.  We loved our room after we ""upgraded"", spacious with nice windows and clean, ample bathroom.  My only recommendation is to NOT get the basic room - it was tiny and required turning sideways to get between the back of the bed and the armoire.  The larger rooms are what you want.  The lobby, bar and dining areas are tastefully decorated and the breakfast (continental or English) is well worth adding to your reservation.  We loved this hotel.",5,2019,06,29
113,Amazing place for afternoon tea! ,We came to the Kensington to have the ‚ÄúLondon landmarks‚Äù afternoon tea and had the best time! We were greeted by George who was so welcoming and gave us a mini tour of the beautiful hotel. The food was incredible and the service was great as well! Definitely recommend for a classic high tea in London! ,5,2019,06,28
113,35th Wedding Anniversary Trip,"After a visit to Amersterdam and a river cruise on the Rhine River, we arrived in London for a 4 night stay at The Kensington. The Kensington is a beautiful hotel with a superb staff and conveniently located in the South Kensington neighborhood within walking distance to Kensington Gardens & Hyde Park, and many museums such as the Victoria & Albert and Natural History. Our package included a full breakfast and one Afternoon Tea. The breakfast menu or the buffet continental breakfast offered everything one would want and then some, and The Afternoon Tea was a thoroughly enjoyable and memorable dining experience. We had a wonderful visit to London and The Kensington is a great place to stay!",5,2019,06,28
113,Amazing Visit!,"I came for afternoon tea at the townhouse and was welcomed by George who was wonderful and showed us around. You could tell he really cared about his job and made the most of it. He was super friendly. The afternoon tea was also fabulous. We were immediately seated and had everything explained to us. The tea was amazing and the best tea I have ever had! The food was amazing in texture and flavor. Service helpful and nice! I wish I lived in London because I would 100% visit again! After tea we ran into George again and he showed us a bit more of the hotel. I wish I knew about this hotel because I would‚Äôve stayed here. Loved George, the rest of the staff, the atmosphere, and of course the food and tea. ",5,2019,06,25
113,Great Location and Great Service,From the time we set foot inside the Kensington Hotel to the time we left for home the people working at the hotel were so nice and attentive.  The location of the hotel near the Hyde Park area was so appealing.,5,2019,06,24
113,Fantastic hotel,"We had never heard of the Kensington before and have stayed in several other hotels in london, this has definitely been one of our best experiences.
On arrival the valets welcome you, very friendly and professional.
The front desk staff are excellently the same.
Our room was very clean and spacious, everything you would want, bed very confortable.
We had breakfast in bed every morning and the food was very good.
The bar (as seen in the pic) very nice, the staff again Proffesional and friendly, if you need advice on a beverage they will happily assist you.
We had dinner in the resturant one night, the food very good. Unfortunately I really can't say much for the service, the young lady who served us was extremely friendly but and it is a but, she kept forgetting our orders, we had to remind her and another server a couple of time to get us additional drinks and bottles of wine, she also collected plates whilst our guests were still eating, plus forgetting a few food orders.
The negatives definitely have not put us off the hotel, it is excellent, we have infact booked again when back in London next month.
I highly recommend this hotel and you won't be disappointed. ",5,2019,06,22
113,"Great location, service and. Amenities ","Booked a 4 night stay - small room but perfect for our stay - quiet, loved the heated floor in the bathroom, cozy bed, immaculate and all the amenities.  Storage space was limited which made it challenging to unpack.  Staff was very helpful and attentive.  Breakfast buffet was excellent, we had dinner two evenings and the food and service was excellent.  We especially appreciated the wine recommendation.  Location is great- close to the V&A and Natural History Museum and walking distance to Knightsbridge.",5,2019,06,21
113,Cocktails and note to eat,After a wonderful few hours at the V&A we were looking for somewhere nearby for a bite to eat and celebratory drink.  The townhouse @ The Kensington was perfect.  The ambience is relaxed chic.  Easy to have a conversation whilst enjoying a cocktail and/or üòä gin.  Table service was excellent and our food was delicious.  ,5,2019,06,21
113,Great experience in London,"Marvelous greeting on arrival, superb staff, excellent room.  Location desirable for visits to A and V museum and Museum of Natural History, both highly worthwhile.  Easy access to Westminster, and available taxi service",5,2019,06,20
113,"Great staff, great location",Walking distance to Nat History and Victoria and Albert Museums.  Many restaurants nearby.  Short walk to underground.  Staff was exceptionally helpful and attentive.  Recognized us as returning guests after visiting other towns in England.,5,2019,06,19
113,Classic British Elegance,I would return to this hotel in a heartbeat. The room was small but we weren't in London to see a hotel room. The staff was always accommodating. I do recommend buying the breakfast inclusive package. There is a cold buffet that feels very Scandinavian plus you could order traditional English breakfasts off the hot menu for no extra costs.  ,5,2019,06,17
113,Anniversary Trip,Had a great stay at the Kensington!  Room was clean and nicely decorated.  Staff were all top notch.  Room size was quiet small in comparison to hotel in Canada.  Concierge was Very helpful front desk staff were attentive.  Restaurant food & service was amazing!,5,2019,06,17
113,Wonderful Afternoon Tea,This is a wonderful spot for afternoon tea if you are looking for something a bit different. Our party had several people with dietary restrictions and our waiter was happy to explain the different menus and how they can be accommodated. The chef did a lovely job preparing both gluten free and dairy free options. I will certainly be visiting the Kensington Hotel next time I am in London and highly suggest it to anyone who is looking for a unique afternoon tea spot and to those with special dietary needs.,5,2019,06,17
113,Terrific Experience,"We recently had our first stay at The Kensington and we could not have been more impressed.
Bedroom and common areas were beautifully decorated, clean and comfortable.
The quality of the food and services provided at breakfast and lunch were first class. Every staff member with whom we interacted was friendly, helpful and made us feel very much at home.
The excellent support and informed recommendations provided by Vincent and Michael at the Concierge Desk help make our stay all that more memorable. 
We very much look forward to our next visit.",5,2019,06,16
113,Excellent stay,Had a very nice stay here for several days.  The staff is outstanding from the front desk to the concierge to the wait staff and house keeping. The rooms are comfortable and location is near everything from the museums to the tube. ,5,2019,06,16
113,Outstanding stay in Kensington,"Literally a perfect hotel. Top flight staff, wonderful room, perfect location. Highly recommend this establishment. Breakfast in front of the fireplace before going roaming through Kensington. Easy walk to the tube. Museums are around the corner. ",5,2019,06,15
113,Lovely two day stay,"I stayed here with my boyfriend for two days.  The hotel was excellent!

We requested early check in and the hotel was able to accommodate us.  Bed was very comfortable and room was quiet even though it overlooked the street.  Everyone at the front desk was very kind.  

There‚Äôs an excellent bar in the hotel and the gym is serviceable.  The neighborhood is not ‚Äúhappening‚Äù but is very convenient and has excellent tube proximity.  

Highly recommend. ",5,2019,06,13
113,Fantastic Hotel!!!,"Everything was excellent across the board...
Staff, Amenities, Service, Fitness Center, you name it....Could not recommend it any higher.......Incredibly Respectful and courteous staff.....Can‚Äôt day enough about it.........",5,2019,06,12
113,"Hotel has very nice common spaces, though rooms need some updating and enlarging","Our stay was the fourth time we have stayed at The Kensington over the last 10 years. We have always enjoyed our stays, but this time things were less than expected. Ground floor renovation looks great and seems to work well. The rooms need to be renovated soon and we noted that renovations seemed to be happening on the 5th floor above our room. This was annoying due to the very NOISY work going on at times when we were on the phone or trying to have a conversation!
The rooms are small and the furniture too big for the rooms! When renovating, thought must be taken to make the rooms more practical for their size or combine some rooms so they are more of a size that works for couples that need more space!",3,2019,06,12
113,Second Time at The Kensington,"This was my second time at the Kensington and I felt so at home! Love the atmosphere any time of day, the living room areas with fireplaces, so appealing... And all the team coming out to offer assistance. 

The breakfast is outstanding, the cooked breakfast is very well executed, i loved the avocado on toast! And i remembered the mackerel from my last visit, together with the sweet cherry tomatoes it was so delicious.

Ilaria at the breakfast room and all her colleagues are so pleasant and accommodating.

The bed was fantastic and so were the views from room 317. At this hotel people
can be on holiday, business and all makes a great vibe. It is so well located and so close to The underground. I also love that it is perfectly accessible from Heathrow on the Piccadilly Line with no connections needed just straight! 

Get an Oyster and enjoy wonderful London from this lovely base. Will always return to The Kensington! thank you all for taking such good care of me, loved my stay",5,2019,06,12
113,Wonderfull Hotel,"Extremely comfortable hotel. I love the decoration, the attention to detail, the friendly staff.
The high tea is amazing, normally you have to book but even though we hadn't  the waiter managed to serve us a very complete tea.
The location is perfect.
I will come back",5,2019,06,12
113,"Fabulous Hotel, Great Location","The Kensington Hotel is fabulous. Value for money, great facilities and sensational staff.  And for a change a hotel has created dedicated space for smokers thereby avoiding the random smokers at the hotel entrance - very civilised!",5,2019,06,12
113,Height of Elegance in central London,"Recently completed a one night stay at the Kensington Hotel ‚Äì‚Äì I wish I could‚Äôve stayed there longer....  From the warmest of welcomes upon my arrival to my departure less than 24 hours later, the hotel and its staff surpassed my (high) expectations at every turn. The Kensington is located in a very desirable neighborhood, centrally located in London and within a five minute walk of a tube station.  The bar inside the hotel was phenomenal ‚Äî high-quality drinks in a very elegant atmosphere ‚Äî and the room service was delicious.  My room was nicely laid out and of a good size. I would not hesitate to stay there again on my next trip to the big smoke!",5,2019,06,10
113,I Adore This Hotel,"This my 4th or 5th time here. And I'll be back next year. Such a charming hotel in a wonderful neighborhood. Away from the mobbed tourist areas but still in the heart of London. Love the ambience of the hotel and the beautiful lounges, and the staff is terrific. Vincent is an amazing concierge. Such a fabulous find for me. And to me the price is very reasonable. ",5,2019,06,10
113,Enjoyed the overall experience,"Having visited and stayed in the Kensington and Paddington areas during past visits, I've always found that the hotels and rooms fit the buildings they are in. Not like a new hotel, with newer styled normal rooms all being identical or similar.  Our room at The Kensington, was quirky, but we enjoyed it. Our room was quiet, the bedding was comfortable and there was plenty of space within the room for our luggage.  Behind panelled doors we located a coffee machine, electric jug, fully stocked bar fridges hidden away in our modern well appointed room.  A larger than expected bathroom, included a bath and shower, was a pleasant surprise.  Wifi worked well throughout the hotel. Every single staff member we encountered, from the minute we walked in the door, were helpful and looking to assist in any way possible. The hotel was within easy walking distance of South Kensington Tube Station and we are looking forward to a return visit, when next in London.",5,2019,06,10
113,Way above my expectations,"I knew this was going to be a great hotel, but my experience as a guest was above all expectations. Aside from the unique interior design, I was welcomed by the most professional, efficient and welcoming front desk staff. I think his name was Leandro. He was able to satisfy all of my needs and gave me great recommendations for a Chinese restaurant. Later that day he even gave me a quick tour of the hotel which no one has ever done in my previous travels. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,06,08
113,pure excellence,"The hotel is just perfect for both business and leisure. Starting with an incredible staff to welcome you, perfect rooms with all you need, a fully equipped gym that is always empty, breakfast that is incredible with a wide variety of foods (from healthy acai bowls to pancakes) and not to forget the bar. Will definitely come again, there is no other hotel I would go to in London.",5,2019,06,07
113,Superb in every way,"Everything the package promises is delivered. The location is fantastic and the service was faultless. I had parked in a spot outside which was only short stay. As I checked in the doorman took my keys, drove the vehicle around the block to avoid parking inspector, parked it in a spot across the road and put enough in the meter to get through until parking lot as free for the weekend. (I reimbursed him). The service throughout the entire stay was like this.",5,2019,06,04
113,Splendid Afternoon Tea,"Very fortunate to be invited for afternoon tea to celebrate niece‚Äôs birthday. It was wonderful! 
The warm starters were delicious and the tiny saucepan to serve the mushroom (for veggies) & steak pie was adorable! The main tea was served on the London Eye stand - see photos. 
We sampled a number of teas, nothing was too much trouble - the staff were very attentive and polite. The China, teapots and cutlery were beautiful, as was the setting. Very comfortable and cosy with fire lit all around. The scones were warm and tasted divine & the sandwiches were varied and tasty. The showcase landmark cakes were an unusual mix - see photo. 
I thought this was a wonderful afternoon tea. ",5,2019,06,04
113,Perfect Stay at the Kensington,"My six night stay at the Kensington was fabulous and exceeded my expectations in every way. This boutique hotel is charming, well-designed and intimate. It had a beautiful, sophisticated aesthetic. The staff was friendly, helpful and made us feel welcome every step of the way. In particular, the staff during breakfast was exceptional. Breakfast at the Town House was superb. I am a frequent visitor to London, and this is by far the best hotel I have stayed in for a variety of reasons. In addition, the location simply cannot be beat. Many great restaurants and attractions are in walking distance and the hotel is well served by the tube at South Kensington which include three tube lines. For my next trip, I am definitely staying at the Kensington!",5,2019,06,04
113,Enjoy London the right way,"One of the hardest things for travellers is finding a really enjoyable hotel in London. Because there are so many tourists, even so-called four stars hotels fail to deliver comfort and cleanliness. Therefore, if one wants to have a really enjoyable experience, one needs a top-quality hotel with a good price/benefit ratio. The Kensington certainly provides this. Location is excellent, staff are friendly, rooms are comfortable and clean, and the lounge is welcoming. The price is reasonable given the benefits",5,2019,06,03
113,Fabulous High Tea,"My Daughter Inlaw booked a high tea here to celebrate me visiting London from Australia. WOW, WOW & WOW!!! Feom the moment we walked up to the front door I just knew this afternoon was going to be special. The decor takes you into English high society, the friendly, attentive service was brilliant. Thankyou to staff who provided little personal treats throughout our stay to make me feel more special!! The High Tea was impeccable, tasty, well presented, deginitely high quality. The champagne is French, the teas are the very best. All food produce sourced locally. I could not fault our afternoon. Thankyou to everyone involved, especially my daughter inlaw Johanna‚ù§Ô∏è",5,2019,05,31
113,Fantastic Stay,"Excellent service the moment you arrive outside the Hotel, the staff cannot do enough for you without being overbearing, great value for money with exceptional quality in all the detail.  Great location for transport 5 min walk to South Kensington Tube station and 10mins from Cromwell road and the national museums. ",5,2019,05,31
113,Fabulous!,"We stayed in a deluxe queen room. It was large enough for us and very comfortable. The lounge areas in the hotel are beautiful and we enjoyed having breakfast there in the morning or finishing the day with a cocktail at night. The hotel was in a brilliant location for our weekend away, within easy walking distance of the Royal Albert Hall and the South Kensington underground station. However, what makes this hotel stand out are the staff. They are polite, friendly, and helpful - not much else to say! You can‚Äôt beat good service!",5,2019,05,30
113,Fabulous stay ,"We are a family of 3 traveling to London for the first time.  After searching and reading about different hotels we decided on the Kensington for its location and good reviews as well as being able to provide a room with 2 king beds.  Our stay was fabulous.  The staff could not do enough for us to make our stay memorable.  Vincent the concierge was so attentive and informative. I arrived in London under the weather and when I asked Vincent if I could get tea every night , he made sure delicious teas were delivered not once but every night !   We stayed for 9 nights and the time went by so fast !
The beds were super comfortable as well as the pillows and sheets. 
The family rooms are located by the elevator however it was never noisy.   While the view was not the best , I am not in my room to look out the window.  
There was a minor issue with a paint smell one afternoon as the room below was undergoing renovations.  The staff however was attentive to this and made sure our issues were taken care of.
The attention to detail to second to none. They sent edible goodies to our room to remember our special events such as Stamford bridge for my son and memorable cute arrangements after seeing Hamilton West End.  
I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to London.   Fabulous location.   Fabulous staff.  It felt like coming home every night when we walked through the doors. Thank you for being part of our memorable vacation 

Cindy Mazzola ",5,2019,05,28
113,A lovely stay! ,"We stayed only one night, for a quick visit to the Chelsea Flower show. What a wonderful hotel! Superb service and there is NOTHING to complain about. Loved it all and I really hope I can stay here again when visiting London! ",5,2019,05,28
113,London weekend stay...,"Very disappointing stay. Our room was so small we had to climb over the bed to reach the other side of the room (not helpful with a bad back). Very claustrophobic. A large industrial air conditioning unit on the other side of the window was noisy, interfering with sleep. I am guessing we had the worst room in the hotel. When we asked to move for our second night, reception offered us a ""discounted upgrade"" for only ¬£200 extra!!! Rest of the hotel was nice and location was great, but a five star experience? No chance, two stars at best, thanks to the awful room and disappointing / outrageous response from management. I should also add it is the first time I've asked to move rooms in 20 years, and I travel frequently with work and family.",2,2019,05,27
113,Simply lovely,"Stayed here with my daughter as we had tickets for the Dior exhibition at the V&A. Within walking distance so perfect.
Beautiful entrance and door staff helpful but not pushy and were happy to help with bags and or taxis if required. 
Reception staff welcoming and efficient and you are offered complimentary juices (which the hotel prepare on site) and hot hand towels, lovely touch after a long journey. 
Very well maintained and managed establishment. Whether you have a title or are staying one night or ten you receive the same impeccable service. 
Spotless room, we stayed in a superior Queen room, very comfortable.
Breakfast was superb and if you are looking for the perfect poached egg then look no further.
Highly recommend a stay here, we usually stay at the Landmark, which is lovely but if you want to be a little more central then this is a definite. ",5,2019,05,24
113,Great experience,We had a great experience staying at The Kensington and the staff was extremely helpful and nice. Gvino was especially accommodating and friendly and we would highly recommend this hotel after celebrating our 5 year wedding anniversary in London although the rooms were a bit small but comparable to NYC size rooms since we are New Yorkers.,5,2019,05,21
113,Charming and Wonderful,The charm of the Kensington is apparent as soon as one steps into the lobby.  The surroundings are spacious and elegant without being ostentatious.  The entire staff went out of their way to provide one with excellent service in a positive and cheerful manner.  We would not hesitate to stay at the Kensington again.  All the meals provided excellent and we highly recommend having the breakfast included in the price of the room.  The Kensington and staff will be remembered fondly. ,5,2019,05,20
113,A perfect hotel!,"That might sound like a hyperbole, but frankly there is no other way to describe the Kensington. it is a beautiful building - elegant London townhouses that have been sensitively converted, with comfortable lounges and dining area, and an atmospheric bar. The bedrooms and bathrooms are superbly equipped. But what makes the Kensington so outstanding are the staff. From the moment that we arrived, we were made to feel welcome and almost like part of a family. Nothing is too much trouble, and when I mentioned that we were in London for my birthday, cakes, cards and prosecco were produced seemingly at the drop of a hat! We had an excellent lunch and breakfast -both beautifully served. It's truly a world class hotel situated perfectly for the Albert Hall, the V and A, the Natural History Museum, the Chelsea Flower Show, Imperial College and 3 minutes walk to South Ken tube station. As I said...perfect!",5,2019,05,19
113,wanted to see more,the stories that they tell of Albert and Victoria were interesting and kind of sad.  the film is worth watching as it tells the story of Victoria's days after Albert dies and what she accomplished after his death.  ,5,2019,05,19
113,So glad I did,"I stayed at The Kensington for 2 nights and what a wonderful experience it was. My first foray into a London hotel of this style where the property is a combination of adjoining terrace houses, the style of stay is quite different to your typical hotel. Matching the residential nature of its surrounds, The Kensington is personal, intimate and homey. 

The lounge and bar area had a great vibe and the staff are excellent. When you get a following from locals, you know you‚Äôre doing things well and that was definitely the case for these venues in the hotel. You could see locals having meetings over coffee during the day, and after work drinks in the evening.

Breakfast had everything you need, and the staff even remembered my room number, newspaper and beverage order from the day before. No iPad cheating involved.

An excellent stay and I‚Äôm so glad I took the opportunity to step outside the area I normally stay and got to discover this gem of a property.",5,2019,05,19
113,Great location to base yourself & really good porters,"The hotel is wonderfully located. Close to the Natural History Museum & V&A, it‚Äôs also a few Tube stops into the theatre & museum district & 20 min bus ride to Westfield London. It‚Äôs nice to be out of the major tourist areas & in a more residential setting.

The porters are fabulous. Friendly, warm & helpful - they deserve their own shoutout.",5,2019,05,17
113,Beyond 5 Star,"This is Royal Class. I‚Äôve traveled all over the world, and stayed in some amazing hotels; this exceeds them all. Absolutely outstanding in service, friendliness, quality, and manners. Impressive.  We will be back, we‚Äôve found a home away from home.",5,2019,05,17
113,Best Hotel I have Stayed In,"I have traveled to many countries but the Kensington has been the best hotel I have ever stayed in. The staff was so devoted to make you feel happy and comfortable. Everything at this hotel was geared towards making the customer comfortable. The hotel is beautiful , clean and has everything you would need. . I highly recommend this lovely hotel.",5,2019,05,17
113,Great service and excellent afternoon tea,"We stayed in for 5 nights. Our first time in London with a 4 year old. From the moment we stepped in the hotel, we were welcomed with open arms and smiles. Our room was not ready but the staff was really nice to bring us some refreshing drinks and chocolates. Breakfast was top notch. Clean rooms. Cleaning staff did excellent job every day. We will come back and find a clean, welcoming room. Tea in the evening for us was refreshing. I can't stress enough how excellent the staff was. Shout out to my man, George! He was so kind and generous to our kid. Always smiling and helping us out. Hotel staff was very accommodating to our requests. 
Last but not least, we enjoyed Afternoon tea. We have done few in past but the presentation, food, service was beyond excellent. 
Can't wait to go back for our next trip. Already missing hospitality of The Kensington.",5,2019,05,16
113,London Landmark Afternoon Tea,"Well what a fabulous experience, thank you so much for having us.
This was birthday presents for my sister and mum and both received lovely little gifts for the celebration. The staff were fantastic, so friendly and their attention to detail was second to none.

The afternoon tea itself was superb, the hot starters were AMAZING we all LOVED them, the sandwiches were yummy and you could keep ordering more. The landmark cakes were spectacular and delicious and the buttermilk scones were to die for.

I can‚Äôt fault the experience or the food, thank you so much we will be back soon.",5,2019,05,14
113,Landmarks Afternoon Tea,"First of all we had cocktails in the bar which complimented the afternoon tea, when seated the waiting staff went through and explained the menu relating to the London landmarks we also had a map on our table showing where the landmarks were. Our afternoon tea was served on the London Eye it was spectacular, we enjoyed our experience here from the food to the staff who were very helpful and polite. 

I would throughly recommend this hotel and the afternoon tea as we had a lovely time.",5,2019,05,14
113,A beautiful hotel with mediocre accommodations,"My wife and I were so excited to stay in this beautiful hotel in the vibrant neighborhood of South Kensington, and halfway into our 8 day stay, we are really enjoying ourselves. 

The lobby, bar, and restaurant, are all gorgeously decorated in a mix of classic furnishings, polished wood bookcases filled with books, and whimsical art. 

The food and drink in the hotel bar and restaurant are perfectly executed and the service is commendable. 

So, why only four stars? 

The accommodations. 

The room we were offered for our week long stay is cramped, poorly designed, and barely decorated. It's so tiny and cluttered, one must turn sideways to get past the bed in order to go up to the bathroom.

Up you say? To the bathroom?

Yes, that's correct. The bathroom is on a different level than the bedroom. The steps leading up to the bathroom take up a significant portion of the tiny space offered. Try climbing those in the dark in the middle of the night. I already tweaked by back a little slipping on the way down. 

The bathroom is reasonably appointed and does offer the luxury of radiant heated flooring. The water pressure in the shower is ideal and the water always warm. The shower stall is a shower-tub combo with a very high side to climb over. Between that barrier and the stairs leading up to the bath, this room is not for anyone with physical ailments or injuries.

We had thought we would order room service while we were here, but the room is too small for dining and only one chair is provided to sit at the small round table offered. 

There is a small closet, half of which may be used for hanging clothing, the other which offers a minibar fridge, safe, and coffee maker. 

It's not all negative reviews for the room. The bed is quite comfortable, which is essential for a hotel room. The A/C works pretty well and is quiet. Also, the cleaning staff keep the room immaculately clean. 

In fact, the entire staff at the Kensington Hotel is courteous, professional, and responsive. They exemplify five star service. 

Overall, there really is much to commend at the Kensington: the service, the food, the atmosphere in the common areas, and the location are all fantastic. 

In our experience, however, the rooms still need a bit of work",4,2019,05,13
113,Brilliant for Breakfast!,"I work in the area and often do breakfast meetings.  The Kensington is my go to for these breakfast meetings.... tranquil, comfy, luxurious, fantastic service and gorgeous food.  You can go for a traditional English or mix it up a bit ....or be super healthy....  they have a fantastic juice menu which is amazing. It‚Äôs also pretty good for lunch and dinner which one of the coolest bars in London....).",5,2019,05,13
113,The Best of Everything,The Kensington Hotel is a true London treasure. The rooms and the hotel are traditionally chic and spotlessly clean. The quiet beauty of the neighborhood and the architectural structure is also not to be discounted. The staff is truly excellent and always looking for ways to anticipate and accommodate every need. I could not give a higher recommendation to this hotel and to the entire staff.,5,2019,05,11
113,Beyond Exceptional,We loved our stay at The Kensington. Lovely neighborhood with great Pubs. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Guido went above and beyond to answer questions and point us in the right direction. We will be back and highly recommend.,5,2019,05,10
113,"Excellent service and great location,",Excellent service. And  great location. Staff very responsive and courteous. Great restaurants in neighborhood.. stayed there twice .will return for sure .. walking distance to transportation buses and trains ,5,2019,05,09
113,Delightful afternoon tea,"We had afternoon tea at the hotel and the entire experience was wonderful.  The tea was ""themed"" as Landmarks of London so some of the food items were made to look like icons of London; for example, there was a wonderful mousse that was shaped like a typical London phone booth.  The service was excellent and all of the staff were attentive and knowledge.  A first rate experience!",5,2019,05,07
113,Great Location in London,"Everything at the hotel is top notch.  Location in Kensington is convenient to the Victoria & Albert museum, natural history museum, Hyde Park, etc.  Underground is only a few blocks away to get to other locations in London.  ",5,2019,05,04
113,Perfect luxury hotel with exceptional service,"My wife and I had a 2 night short stay at The Kensington to celebrate my birthday and couldn‚Äôt have wished for a better experience. 
The hotel has timeless elegance with beautifully decorated public areas combined with its relaxing cool bar where many a pleasant hour was spent during our stay. 
The rooms are spacious, very comfortable with pleasant touches such as a turndown service. 
What sets this hotel apart from other stays would be the friendly professional service we experienced. From the minute we arrived and for the duration of our stay the level of service the staff at The Kensington provided was exceptional. 
I look forward to the day we return.",5,2019,05,01
113,"Great location, excellent staff","Because of a problem at home our four night stay for two had to be turned into a one night stay for one at very short notice. I'd booked a special cheap rate which was non-refundable, but the hotel offered to keep the amount I had in effect overpaid as a deposit against a future stay. This was a smart move on their part - they could have just kept the money and said ""tough luck"", but doing this was a great goodwill gesture. When I got to the hotel the welcome was friendly and efficient, the room was very comfortable and overall the standards displayed by all the staff were very high. Only one thing I'd change: I had a room with an internal view back over some rather scruffy roofscape, the next time I go I'll ask for a room overlooking the street.",5,2019,05,01
113,Afternoon tea for my sisters birthday ,"What a lovely experience the afternoon tea was.  Thoroughly enjoyed the food which there was plenty of, the staff were super so efficient and friendly.  Would highly recommend this to everyone. Thank you for a lovely afternoon. ",5,2019,04,30
113,Luxury hotel at great value,"I stayed here in February for a birthday weekend. The hotel was extremely comfortable and well looked after. Lots of nice touches and good customer service. We were lucky enough to get a room upgrade. We even got into our room early which was very convenient.

The bar is relaxed with a great range of drinks and nibbles. We went to see a show and the hotel was well located to catch a tube train. There is lots to do in the area with shops and parks all within walking distance. We also found it easy to get to Portobello Road market. One of my best stays in London.",5,2019,04,29
113,Highly recommend ,"Outstanding location. Leaving South Kensington tube station the sign says ‚ÄúMuseums‚Äù and they‚Äôre nearly all here and within metres. Can easily walk to hotel from the tube station. Hotel has beautiful facade and unusually a couple of outdoor seated areas. Indoors opulent Art Deco design features and original art. Staff from doormen, reception, waiters and room service all very friendly and approachable for a 5star. Breakfast , dinner and wine list all recommended. Cocktail bar is lovely- adults only in the evening.",5,2019,04,28
113,Surprise Afternoon Tea,"My daughter booked for four of us for afternoon tea.It was a real treat.It was real luxury. The attention to detail and service is excellent. David served us and was very atentive. I don't drink tea,I could have coffee instead and as many cups and varieties as I wished.
It is a little expensive but you get what you pay for.For what we got I wouldn't have expected to pay much less.",5,2019,04,28
113,London Theme Cream Tea,"Excellent cream tea.  More expensive than some of the others I have had but the attention to details of the London landmark cakes and desserts was fabulous.  
Staff were on hand but not in the way and anything we needed was dealt with quickly and pleasantly by them.  
Something special in a less formal setting than some other cream teas around.  ",5,2019,04,27
113,LOVED EVERYTHING,"we choose the hotel because of its location, situated on a quiet street but close to everything. a few blocks away form the station, from muesums and from the park. The staff was very welcoming and made us feel very special. I especially liked that they made my children feel welcome. ",5,2019,04,25
113,Romantic getaway,"This was myself and my husband's first trip to London and we couldn't have chosen a better hotel.
Upon arrival we we're greeted with a warm welcome, hot towels and reshreshing fruit drink. The service was acceptional ,friendly and helpful.
The rooms are beautifully decorated with all amenities to make our stay comfortable and luxurious. 
The location was perfect with cafes , restaurants , museums all at our doorstep.
We would highly recommend The Kensington and look forward to returning.",5,2019,04,24
113,A cozy stay at a posh hotel,"My husband and I stayed at The Kensington for 6 nights in early April. We took the Piccadilly line from Heathrow to the Kensington Underground Station and the hotel was less than a 3 minute walk away! We were warmly welcomed with fresh Juice and warm towels. The girls at the front desk were very kind and accommodated our request of a higher floor. Once we were checked in, Curtis gave us a tour and history of the hotel, he was also very welcoming and always ready to help throughout our stay! 

Location- could not have been better, the Kensington underground station connected to all the major sights and neighborhoods. Tons of great pubs, restaurants, coffee, etc all within walking distance. 

Hotel/rooms - The first floor is beautifully decorated. We enjoyed relaxing by the fires with some tea after a long day of sight seeing in the cold. We stayed in a Queen room which was quaint, but in a major European city in a posh area, that is to be expected. We had a small issue with the bathroom tub and ended up switching to a king room which was much larger but equally as nice. One of my favorite parts of our stay was the chamomile tea which we received during turn down service.

Since returning home, I've already recommended this hotel to many friends for their next trip to London!",5,2019,04,23
113,The perfect hotel,I have stayed at the Kensington multiple times over the years.  Hotel remains consistent at each stay.  Staff is very friendly and rooms are clean and comfortable.  Would not hesitate to stay there again.,5,2019,04,22

113,Wonderful,"We stayed at the Kensington prior to the London Book Fair.  We arrived at Heathrow from the US early in the morning and arrived at the Kensington quite far ahead of their normal check-in time.  We were warmly welcomed and the front desk said they would arrange an early check in.  We had an excellent breakfast in their restaurant and when we returned to the front desk our room was ready.  The remainder of our stay at the Kensington was similarly exemplary.  We were always treated well and the staff went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and that we felt at home.  It reminds me of the England that I experienced as a younger man.  The sitting rooms and dining rooms are so warm and cozy with their blazing fireplaces, something that is so welcome in March!  Martin the concierge went above and beyond the call of duty and the doormen warmly welcomed us when we came in and wished us well as they handed us umbrellas when we went out.  The food is excellent and the service impeccable.  The Guinness black bread is scrumptious and the recipe well guarded.  I am looking forward to returning to the Kensington next year when we return to London. Very special.",5,2019,04,21
113,"Great hotel for its location, service, rooms","Superb service, absolutely clean and well designed rooms, soft linens, etc. Location near some of the greatest museums of London, therefore of the world (walking distance of 5 or so). I would love to return there many times!",5,2019,04,21
113,Fantastic place to stay!,"We loved everything about this hotel. From the unrivaled service to the quiet rooms in the middle of London, we couldn't say enough. The food is great, too, as is the room service, and the bar and lounge make you right at home. This five-star hotel gets ten stars from us!",5,2019,04,18
113,A,From the moment you walk through the doors of the Kensington Hotel you are made feel special. The staff are extremely attentive and professional. My favourite part of my stay is sitting in front of the beautiful open fire in a relaxed and beautiful setting. It is my go to hotel when in London.,5,2019,04,17
113,A lovely luxury boutique hotel,"An oasis of charm and graciousness, this beautiful gem of a hotel welcomes you with fires in the fireplace and staff, especially Verushka, to welcome you with the epitome of English hospitality. From the beautifully appointed downstairs to spacious guest rooms, it is full of period charm.",5,2019,04,16
113,The Kensington is my home in London,"I stay here when I'm in London for business or to visit family a few times a year. The doormen welcome me back when I arrive, its so nice to be greeted when you're jet-lagged from the flight. Last December my husband was particularly impressed when Ronnie and Guido greeted him and asked why he didn't come with me on my last trip! 
The staff here are accommodating, and the lounge area is great for meetings, business or otherwise.
I also like that the location is very convenient, an easy walk to the park and to the underground.
The rooms are well appointed and quiet, I sleep very well here.",5,2019,04,16
113,Lovely staff with exceptionally helpful staff,"We stayed at the Kensington Hotel towards the end of March, 2019. The rooms was a very good standard, and the facilities very good too. The staff however were excellent ... I arrived a little before check-in time, because of a work meeting finishing early, and they were able to check in and give us our room. I was also very pleased to have a bottle of water thrust into my hand after a lovely run round Hyde Park on Sunday morning. Welcoming and helpful - would recommend",5,2019,04,16
113,30th Birthday Trip Away,"Thank you, The Kensington Hotel!
I had the best time staying with you. 
A 5 minute walk to South Kensington tube station and around 10 minute walk to The National History Museum, Science museum and The V&A - a fab location. 
Staff treat you very well and nothing is too much bother- we returned each evening to our curtains being drawn and a Butlers chocolate on the pillow. 
The shower was nice and powerful.
Overall one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. ",5,2019,04,16
113,excellent,"it was definitley a value for money experience, the hotel is cosy yet luxury. the staff is excellent, ready to help and solition maket, friendly yet respectfull, the location is wonderful.  the outside sitting areas are making the difference. ",5,2019,04,16
113,The London Landmarks Afternoon Tea,"I had spent two months staying in London with my daughter and this was our last outing together before I flew out the next day. FABULOUS is an apt word for our experience. The service by Anthony and Barbara (?) was very personable and nothing was too much trouble. The food was not only delicious but beautifully presented and plenty of it. I emailed earlier in the week to say my daughter was gluten intolerant and she received everything the same as me but gluten free, so a big thanks to the chef. The club chairs and beautiful fresh flowers everywhere made for an absolutely relaxing and memorable afternoon. We made some lasting wonderful memories, so thank you The Kensington x",5,2019,04,15

The hotel is situated in  a beautiful area of the city, and though I‚Äôm still exploring it, they‚Äôve already helped us feel a warm welcome, as they received our son with a personalized note, a teddy bear, a coloring book and a small pack with shampoo and bath ordeals. Great hotel and great team you have!",5,2019,04,07
113,The Kensington Hotel,"The hotel is situated in an amazing location by major attractions, we visited the V&A museum , Royal Albert Hall and the Natural History Museum. There are many eateries, shops and supermarkets locally. The hotel itself was elegant and our room was magnificent. We enjoyed amazing breakfasts in chilled back, comfortable luxury and also our evening meal was second to none, try the fish risotto, it was delicious! I have saved the best to last, the staff! We would like to sincerely thank all the staff who made our visit to this hotel splendid. Every request we made was done efficiently with genuine helpfulness and kindness.

It's also convenient on foot to the South Kensington Underground station and connections thereby to anywhere in London or by Brit Rail to the countryside and beyond for wonderful day-trips to more charming places, from which you'll return to your guest room and the home-like comfort of a turned down counterpane and a chocolate bon-bon on your pillow.

Excellent facilities and services and great food and drinks. We could have happily stayed in the lobby by the fireplace for our entire trip.",5,2019,04,01
113,London Landmarks Afternoon Tea,"We took our mum to afternoon tea for a Mother‚Äôs Day treat as she‚Äôd never been before but it was the 2nd time for my sister & I at the Kensington. The previous time was for a special birthday fir my sister, with the As Old As Time theme.  Love the theme ideas that the Kensington do & they didn‚Äôt disappoint this time either.  As before, my favourite course was the savoury starter.

The hotel is really near the tube station - if you find the right exit - and the staff (Barbara, Roland & Thomas) were very friendly & willing to help you commemorate whatever occasion brings you to their afternoon tea.  They have lovely commonerative postcards & a takeaway London map.  

We weren‚Äôt able to finish all the lovely food despite the amount of time spent lingering over it. We weren‚Äôt rushed at all & took away the lovely themed desserts in a classy Kensington ‚Äòdoggie bag.‚Äô

They even got the right coats, jackets & scarves from the cloakroom without any description from us.

Many thanks for making this a special Mother‚Äôs Day for our mum.",5,2019,03,31
113,"Wonderful, especially the staff!","We stayed at The Kensington for 3 nights in March 2019 after a very positive one-night ‚Äòtrial‚Äô (by chance) c. 3 months earlier. Our recent visit confirmed all that we‚Äôd appreciated on our first stay: the hotel is clean, well-located and has really-cosy lounge and dining facilities, but the ‚ÄòClassic Queen' room can be a little on the small side. No issue at all, though, with the staff ‚Äì all were super-friendly (yet still highly respectful & professional), positive, cheerful and extremely helpful - perhaps inappropriate to single-out any one but the really high standards of customer service were epitomised by Margaux in guest services and Ilaria, the restaurant Breakfast Manager. We really enjoyed our stay, feeling ‚Äòat home‚Äô in the very comfortable, club-like surroundings and convivial atmosphere. We‚Äôll definitely be looking to stay there on our next London trip.",5,2019,03,31
113,Townhouse hotel in a good location,"We stayed at the Kensington for an extended weekend to celebrate my birthday. It‚Äôs a good hotel, with reasonable rates for London, plus it‚Äôs close to several museums and Hyde Park, which I love to visit. The room was good, although on the small side, and the floor was severely slanted. Ameneties were great. We also loved the fitness space, which was spacious, with lots of modern equipment. Lots and lots of visible staff around, and they were quite professional and friendly. I‚Äôm always looking to feel at home at any hotel, and I didn‚Äôt quite get that feeling at the Kensington, but really it‚Äôs a lovely place. They didn‚Äôt pay any attention to my birthday, though, but I got over that pretty quickly. ",4,2019,03,31
113,Lovely Boutique Hotel,"Location great, welcoming entrance and doorman, that was always ready and waiting to hail a taxi. Staff at reception were friendly and knowledgeable. The bar and sitting areas were comfy and beautifully decorated. We really love the style of this hotel. Our room was the classic twin bed as we were 2 friends staying together which was a tad bigger than another couple that booked the Classic king room. The bathrooms are well appointed with amazing water pressure in the shower but tight as were the bedrooms but you're in central London so you shouldn't want to spend time in your room, enjoy the city or the communal space down stairs. Breakfasts was included in our rate and was perfect",5,2019,03,30
113,Very central,"We had two stays at the Kensington totalling 7 days.
The hotel is very well located for the parks, buses and the underground system. Enabling easy access to London‚Äôs attractions including the Museum of Natural History just around the corner.
The staff and service are fantastic, friendly and helpful. They made us feel like royalty.
Our first room was large and roomy and very comfortable. On our return our room was on another floor and much smaller, perhaps too small with 3 months worth of luggage but still comfortable.
Would recommend this hotel.",5,2019,03,30
113,Delightful neighborhood boutique hotel!,"When traveling to London, a traveler is overwhelmed by the sheer enormity of options for accommodation! Over the years, we had been to the ‚Äútop sights;‚Äù we were looking for something that was warm, welcoming, and felt more like home. We found just that at The Kensington. It was delightful! In the lovely South Kensington-Brompton neighborhood, it was a short walk from the South Kensington Underground Station, with connections to everywhere we wanted to go.

Arriving from Boston in the morning, it was questionable if we would have a room before mid-afternoon. The lovely reception staff were very helpful and hospitable ‚Äì taking charge of our luggage, placing a priority on our room request, offering many suggestions for our stay, and welcoming us into the lovely, light-filled drawing room to relax with coffee or tea. Before we realized it, we were ushered into a warm, lovely-appointed room.

We enjoyed fresh and lovely breakfasts and relaxing evenings in the bar, always accompanied by gracious and attentive staff. Walking in the neighborhood was akin to stepping back in time ‚Äì Queen‚Äôs Gate is a beautiful tree-lined boulevard lined with 19th-century buildings, lovingly cared for. A nice walk NW takes you to the Kensington area of Hyde Park; NE to the Natural History and Science Museums and the Victoria & Albert. It was lovely to get lost in all the mews in the area.

Our stay was a precursor to a my ‚Äúbirthday‚Äù cruise. Quite unexpectedly, a knock on our door came from two delightful staff members bearing a bottle of sparkling wine and lovely little birthday cake on a tray lined with a sea-faring map and accompanied by a little compass and ‚Äúsword!‚Äù A card wished me a lovely birthday and a safe voyage! Such a special touch that we certainly didn‚Äôt expect in the big expanse of London!

I must extend my sincere gratitude to one of the concierges, Mr. Vincent Peach ‚Ä¶ he was indeed a ‚Äúpeach.‚Äù He tirelessly and graciously answered all my e-mail queries and arranged our transport from Heathrow to the hotel and from the hotel to Tilbury Docks to board our ship. My only regret was that we weren‚Äôt able to meet, and thank, him personally as he was not on duty during our stay. His colleagues were always at the ready should assistance be needed.

The Kensington oozes Old World charm and service ‚Ä¶ the staff makes a stay extraordinary ‚Äì warm greetings coming and going. They know how to make you feel ‚ÄúAt Home!‚Äù If our travels take us back to London, we‚Äôll be here!",5,2019,03,29

113,London Landmarks Afternoom Tea,Went to the London Landmarks Afternoon Tea for our first wedding anniversary with our friends. Wonderful afternoon with amazing food and tea!  Great price and good quality and more than enough to eat! We couldn‚Äôt eat it all so had it boxed up! We stayed and chatted for ages and when they needed our table they offered to move us to the lounge so we could continue our afternoon! Went and had a drink in the bar afterwards too!Barbara and Ilaria made it very special! We got an extra cake with anniversary wishes! Thank you for a fabulous afternoon! Well worth the price!,5,2019,03,24
113,Relaxing and Cozy,"I arrived from a long and tiring flight from Los Angeles.  While my room was not ready, they offered me a delicious beetroot drink on arrival, and walked me over to a comfortable lounge where I worked for a few hours while they prepare my room.  I even ordered a nice fish and chips lunch before checking in.  The fish was huge, but so soft and delicious.  I will definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2019,03,23
113,Great boutique hotel,"I was in London from New York for 36 hours and really looking forward to a good nights sleep. Was upgraded to a beautiful suite with a four poster bed. Very spacious and charming. Had trouble with the shower but maintenance came and fixed it right away. Everyone is super helpful and friendly. Love the lounge and lobby area for late night drink and snacks, and morning breakfast. Location is great. Overall it‚Äôs a great hotel and I will be staying there when next in London for a personal trip.",5,2019,03,21
113,Amazing Stay!,"We loved everything about our stay here! The hotel, staff and dining were incredible. Make sure to take part in the afternoon tea. Veronica at the front desk and Curtis in the lobby were the friendliest faces to send us on our way each morning and welcome us back each afternoon. We would go back to London just to visit The Kensington again.",5,2019,03,21
113,Remarkably Smooth and Wondefully Elegant,"My partner and I spent our anniversary here as a little staycation away from home. Well worth it as well. Veronica (excuse the spelling if it‚Äôs wrong) at reception was amazing. Very genuine and a great smile. All of the staff were, but for a first impression she was great. 

We had Breakfast included and so happy we did. Was fabulous food with fresh juices, etc. The eggs royale were wonderful and the hollandaise sauce was knockout good. Thomas, who greeted us, was great. Very personable and a great sense of humour. 

I think it‚Äôs important to note that some hotels in London seem to whitewash their service levels. From our experience, it seems like the staff here have great empowerment and are also able to be themselves. Great leadership if I had to guess. 

Many thanks for making our staycation amazing. ",5,2019,03,19
113,Remarkable hotel with extremely helpful staff,"I have stayed at The Kensington, London several times. It is an extraordinary historic property that is superbly furnished. The lounge area is charming and warm. It is perfect for meetings with business associates and meals with friends. The rooms are a very nice size and provide all possible amenities. But, the best part of The Kensington is the staff! Everyone including reception greeters, porters, concierges, and wait staff in the excellent restaurant, are extremely professional and amazingly helpful. I was so grateful to all of them on my last trip, which started and ended with Curtis McCalla welcoming me and shepherding me on my departure from London. It‚Äôs a special hotel with remarkable staff.",5,2019,03,18
113,Wonderful Hotel,We stayed at The Kensington as we were going to The Albert Hall.  From the moment we arrived the welcome and service was incredible.  It is a beautiful hotel but felt cosy & relaxed.  I had requested a quiet room & that was exactly what we received.  We will definitely stay again as the staff really make this Hotel shine! ,5,2019,03,18
113,60th birthday celebration,"Stayed one night at The Kensington but should have stayed
We loved the elegant rooms and the K Bar is a must at night
The staff could not have made us more welcome and the fruit and chocolate plate with Happy Birthday was  such  a surprise 

Curtiss McCalla directed us to a superb dining experience of Japanese Sushi and we ended the evening drinking cocktails in the K Bar

113,Visitor Kensington ,"Awesome experience , would love to do it again. Lovely staff looked after us so well. We walked in and still got a good deal for three nights. I would do it again if I have to, can‚Äôt think of staying at any other place then Kensington now.",5,2019,03,12
113,Afternoon Tea,"Beautiful hotel, with elegant furnishings. 3 fires burning for relaxing cozy feeling. 
Amazing bar but I‚Äôd had too many champagnes to enjoy it! 
The London Landmarks Afternoon Tea was excellent.  Starters including , mini fishcake, mini beef Wellington and tart. 
Then sandwiches, 2 scones, and 4 desserts. 
One of the best afternoon teas in London and I‚Äôve had a few! ",5,2019,03,11
113,Our new home when in London,"We wanted to get a new experience and change from the traditional 5-star corporate hotel we usually stay in when in London. The Kensington ticked all the boxes. Neighborhood is great, hotel has a nice boutique vibe, it is not too big but not too small either so has all the service and amenities you need while on business. Above all, service is great with very nice staff throughout. A special mention for Margaux who greeted us at our arrival and made sure our stay was perfect throughout our stay. This personal touch clearly made all the difference.",5,2019,03,11
113,Amazing hotel who made my night when my boyfriend proposed in the most amazing way thanks to the hotel !!,Just returned from a two night stay at the Kensington hotel. And all I can say is this hotel is amazing rooms are beautiful with everything you could want in there. The staff are so lovely and nothing is too much trouble for them. On the Saturday evening they helped my boyfriend now fianc√© set up my proposal in our room and all I can say is wow they totally made all my dreams come true it was the most perfect proposal and something I will never forget. Me and my fianc√© will always be returning here üòçüòçüòç,5,2019,03,10
113,Extremely pleasurably stay,"Returning this time to The Kensington for two days for pleasure, and pleasure it was. The Kensington is the kind of hotel which is not too big to lose out on warmth and personality yet it is not to small to seem empty. There is always a few people chatting, a fire burning, a real gem! The rooms are very well lit and very conscious with regard to the decoration! I when I return to London I hope to return to The Kensington.",5,2019,03,09
113,Short stay,"This was my second time at The Kensington. Couldn't ask for more. Great location makes this hotel a perfect place for pleasure and business. The staff was extremely kind, polite and friendly. They always welcome you with the best smile.
Breakfast was healthy and fresh. The only downside bedrooms are a bit small but very clean and comfort.
I was extremely satisfied the first time and can't say anything negative my second time. 
Thank you for making me feel so welcome.",5,2019,03,09
113,Too short of a stay in a wonderful hotel in South Kensington,"Two quick overnight stays as bookends to a trip to Cambridge, and this hotel locating at the South Kensington station was perfect (on the Circle and Piccadilli lines). Late check-in was no problem; but had to wait until around 4pm for the second day. The staff was very efficient, cordial and nice. The rooms (singles) are a bit small, as are the bathrooms. But for a central London hotel, this is probably expected. The extra windshield does reduce the street noise, but it is so quiet, I could hear people walking in the hallways and upstairs; it is a popular hotel. Breakfast was not included in my reservation, so I didn't try the restaurant, but there are a lot of options within walking distance. Overall, I would not hesitate one second to stay with them again, especially if I had a few days to explore around.  ",5,2019,03,08
113,Fantastic Experience,"My husband and I stayed at The Kensington about 10 days ago.  We cannot say enough about it.  The staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and comfortable!  Thomas, Curtis are just a few of the names that I remember, and they were fabulous.  Frankly, everyone we came in contact with at your hotel engaged us in conversation, asked about our day, and were genuinely so warm and caring to us.  It's never happened before, but we found ourselves thinking about them all after we arrived back in the US.  In addition to the service, the location was fabulous.  We walked to Harrods, Kensington Palace, Buckingham Palace.  We felt very safe in this location and it was close to the underground station.  We had dinner several times in the Townhouse restaurant and had the London Landmarks afternoon tea which was amazing!  We had drinks in the bar and the bartender, whose name I unfortunately cannot remember, was very friendly and very talented in making drinks.  Our room was spacious and had everything we needed.  We wouldn't hesitate to stay at The Kensington again and are looking forward to visiting again some day!",5,2019,03,05
113,Great location when staying in London,"Comfortable hotel, very friendly and helpful staff, good selection for breakfast and in-room dining. I enjoy staying here, meet up with friends and family in the cosy corners or lounge area. The location in South Kensington is exceptional - the surrounding bars and restaurants, also close by the museums.
However, the rooms require some refurbishment.",4,2019,03,04
113,Nine nights of kind and high end service,"For such a nice hotel ( I am a rather average middle of the road man ) I felt quite welcome and content. Big shout out to Gvido at the door and Thomas in the lounge. These two gentlemen bring the best of service. Meeting your needs and yet offering the most down to earth commentary and advice on where to go and what to see when you get there.
Rooms are comfortable and reasonably quite. This is a hotel after all and the guests make all the noise.",5,2019,03,03
113,Service with a smile ,"A four day visit turned into a spectacular experience. Every member of the staff was superb. Martyn, Curtis and Gvido were on their A game . Smiling, working hard to make our stay special. A special Thank you to Valeriia. ",5,2019,03,03
113,Afternoon Tea,"This was the best Afternoon Tea I have ever done and I have done quite a few in well know London Hotels and landmark.  My sister had been before for the Beauty and The Beast Tea, and recommended it,  so I knew it would be good, but the Landmarks Afternoon Tea surpassed our expectations.  The food was delicious, the staff were so welcoming and attentive and the surroundings were second to none.  I can't wait to go back and do it again.",5,2019,03,03
113,Excellent stay in South Kensington,The staff were very attentive and polite.  The room and bed  were very comfortable and the lounge/bar areas were lovely.  Great location for visits to The Royal Albert Hall and Museums. There are plenty of local restaurants and cafes nearby too. ,5,2019,03,02
113,Excellent.  Comfortable lodging with a great location,"My wife and I stayes there for several nighta as part of an anniversary trip.  The room had everything, including some space with a small table and comfortable charis. The room also overlooked a local thoroughfare, but we got little (if any) noise.  Hotel also had comfortable nooks to sit and chat or have something to eat and drink.  Location provide access to the Tube, tour busses, and an array of various types and prices of restaurants.  Staff was very friendly and helpful to boot.  We also got a bottle of wine to help celebrate our anniversary.  ",5,2019,02,28
113,Birthday Treat,"We had afternoon tea and were treating a vegan friend for her birthday. The staff were lovely, the food was delicious and the surroundings were beautiful - what is there not to like. We did have an issue but when we spoke to Ilaria Arcese, it was promptly deal with appropriately. A lovely afternoon had by all.",5,2019,02,27
113,Excellent five stars hotel,The Hotel is very near the subway. Nothing to say about the quality of the room. We have a studio suite. The only thing is maybe the noise because we can hear every step near our room. I recommand this hotel and i will return.,5,2019,02,26
113,"Breakfast could have been better, but amazing hotel regardless.","Mrs Beef and I spent the night in this fine hotel in December, on the evening where we attended Guy Barker's Christmas Jaaazz bash (nnnnniice).

We found the passage to the room fairly arduous, but once in the room, the mezzanine toilet floor with built-in staircase was an amazing quirk! I ensured Mrs Beef experienced the ""works"", fireman-carrying her down the flight to check for structural integrity, and ""depositing"" her gently on the ample double queen...

The bar area was very cozy, very oldschool, dimly-lit. The clientele were varied, and one shouldn't pass judgement, as The Beefs were rather green around the gills, it having been a night of some small decadence, quaffing overpriced bubbly from plastic glasses. The Jamesons was nice, but threatened me something fierce the next day on a bus replacement service, driven by Bandit himself, and no Buford T. Justice in sight. Very friendly service staff.

The breakfast was rather hit and miss. The bar area was converted into the breakfast buffet, and we found the hot English classics were woefully underrepresented. Not everyone gorges themselves on carbs for breakfast, after all. The fresh juices were nice, however.

We would recommend this hotel, but for the price, we really expected a more comprehensive breakfast buffet.",4,2019,02,26
113,Couples escape in central location in London. Highly recommended ,"We spent a wonderful evening at the Kensington in early January. The staff were very  friendly and professional. Our room was magnificent. The bar, restaurant and lounge were all very comfortable.   Service was excellent. ",5,2019,02,24
113,Another Incredible visit to the best hotel in London,"This review is long overdue. I‚Äôve stayed at the Kensington now 4 times and it is by far my favorite hotel on the planet - and I don‚Äôt say that lightly. 

The hotel is exquisite. The rooms are so comfortable and immaculate. The amenities are over the top. The gym is updated and spotless. The restaurant and bar are both incredible and the attention to detail is clearly a top priority. The service throughout the hotel is top notch. From the second I walked in I was greeted with a genuine ‚Äúwelcome back‚Äù. Throughout my stay the staff all made it a point to say ‚Äúgreat to see you again‚Äù. 

The Kensington has the best that there is to offer, but the best part is their people who clearly love what they do and it shows in the way they treat their customers. I cannot wait to go back. ",5,2019,02,24
113,5 Star Lunch epxerience,"We had a lovely 3 course lunch at the Kensington Hotel. The plates are simple and tasty. Beautiful dinning room and delicious cakes. Excellent service. Special note to  Thomas our waiter for his kindness.
",5,2019,02,24
113,Excellent hotel,"From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special with the warm welcome from the doorman and reception including a complimentary fruit drink while we checked in.  This hotel oozes charm and sophistication.  Beautiful d√©cor.  Staff were friendly and attentive and nothing was too much trouble for them.  They knew it was my birthday and left a surprise cake in the room and special birthday breakfast.  Dinner was excellent.  Fantastic location with the tube around the corner and the V&A just a short walk away. Deliciously comfortable bed and well-equipped room, even including an umbrella!  Thank you to the staff at The Kensington for making my birthday so memorable.  Would highly recommend this hotel to others and will definitely be returning.",5,2019,02,23
113,Fabulous Hotel,"This hotel had it all. Wonderful staff, great location (easy access to the subway), good restaurants in the area as well as at the hotel, and very nice area. You couldn‚Äôt stay at a better hotel in London. ",5,2019,02,23
113,An experience to remember in a beautiful Boutique hotel in London. ,"We had an early lunch here and it was a dining experience to remember. Ben Buckley the food and beverages manager personally greeted us and treated us like royalty. Thomas from Waterford was similarly friendly and helpful. The smooth Jazz background music, ambience and furnishings were welcoming and comfortable. The food( which is why we came!) was amazing. I‚Äôd recommend the tomato and mozzarella salad and the seared Scallops. 
Can‚Äôt praise this place highly enough.  Even the bathrooms are breath taking. ",5,2019,02,22
113,Amazing,"I don't usually write reviews but the experience we had at the Kensington was so above and beyond that, I had to share. Just wanted to say that the staff was deeply thoughtful, the hotel was beautiful and tasteful, the location is fantastic and all in all our stay at the Kensington led to us having a fantastic trip to London.",5,2019,02,20
113,South Ken Charm!,"A boutique gem in London‚Äôs wonderful South Kensington neighborhood. I was meeting cousins and friends and going to the Philadelphia Eagles game. I chose to stay in the neighborhood I spent a semester oh so many years ago and appreciate the city from there. And, as I love the tube, it‚Äôs ease in getting around, I wanted South Ken be my ‚Äúhome‚Äù tube stop. ‚Ä®‚Ä®I arrived very early morning and was pleased they had a room ready for me. After a miscommunication and disappointing first room (it was dark, overlooked a roof, and had chipped paint in middle of main wall under the tv, and stained carpet), I was moved to a much brighter, better room - albeit it equally rather small, it was lovely. As there was no bureau, I had to be creative to put my clothes away. So, I used the baskets in the closet and night table and unpacked. 

The front desk staff were all pleasant and wanted to be accommodating. Curtis, a Concierge was so warm+helpful. When cousins, friends and I wanted good pub food after the Eagles game, he sent us to a sentimental place I knew from my college days. It had wonderful food, great service, and we all loved his recommendation. Gvido, the front doorman is such a nice, charming chap. I immediately felt welcomed and at home each time I left or returned. 

The hotel decor is comfy and welcoming. From the front porch to the cozy lobby, the common space is warm and inviting. 

Breakfast is served in The Town House (also accessible from outside), where all day dining is also available. Breakfast included full continental choices ‚Ä®of cereals, fruits, meats, cheeses, juices coffee or tea, toast & preserves, etc. And there are quite a few al a carte choices. The smoked salmon was divine and served with scrambled eggs among my favorites. They didn‚Äôt seem to understand the concept of crisp bacon. And, service at breakfast could use some improvement. 
I love a great English breakfast and this is a great spot to sit back, relax and enjoy just that. 

Late night drinks in the lounge were quite pleasant and one night even had a crowd of Philadelphians also there for the Eagles game. 

It was a wonderful property to spend this special week in my old neighborhood. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to anyone who wants to be in lovely South Kensington!",4,2019,02,20
113,Disappointing,"We stayed for a weekend in a classic room. For the price point we were left disappointed at the experience. 
Negatives: Our classic room was tiny with the smallest shower room I have ever seen. Too small to open the door fully, it is blocked by the looks and too small to even dry yourself in comfortably. A tired and stained dull green carpet. A view over the hotel air conditioning trunking which made continuous noise and evoked food smells at meal times. The K bar has an attached smoking space which has a door directly into the seating area. The many people egressing let a flow of smoke into the bar which was very noticeable to non-smokers. Requested complimentary paper didn't arrive without having to give an additional reminder. Even the guest directory has silly typos.
Positives: Good location. Great staff especially Curtis. Good gym.
We are unlikely to repeat the visit.",3,2019,02,19
113,Wonderful birthday visit to London,"We had the privilege of spending a wonderful few days at this beautiful hotel on the occasion of my husband's birthday. We have been here often in the past when visiting London and  have found it to be an oasis in the busy city. The lounge/lobby area is beautifully decorated and a pleasure to spend time either for afternoon tea or a pre/post theatre drink. The location in South Kensington is ideal, with a large variety of shops and restaurants in the neighbourhood, a short walk to the Natural History Museum or the Victorian and Albert Museum, a 10 minute walk to shops on the King's Road in Chelsea  and also very close to the tube station (Picadilly or District/Circle line). If you are not pressed for time, it is very pleasant and scenic to take one of the many buses towards Picadilly.
We were upgraded on this visit to a beautiful suite with a four-poster bed and a marble bathroom and received a lot of personal attention from Margaux, with a welcome drink, a slice of birthday cake and a complimentary breakfast. The breakfast was very tasty with a buffet and a variety of hot items (omelettes and eggs benedict). For a smaller breakfast, there are a number of cafes around the corner, in particular a french patisserie. 
We had a wonderful visit and hope to return soon..",5,2019,02,17
113,2nd Visit Just as Wonderful,"This was my second trip to The Kensington and it was just as wonderful as the first.  My husband and I traveled to London over Thanksgiving break and stayed for four nights.  His favorite thing from the first trip was the rain shower, something he talked about constantly over the past two years.  Upon arriving in our room, there was not a rain shower in our bathroom, however the staff quickly remedied the situation and moved us to another room the next night.  They were happy to address any concerns we had and were very pleasant to talk with.  Room service was efficient and delicious.  This is our go to hotel in London and very convenient to the subway stop and many shops and restaurants.  You're guaranteed to have a great time!",5,2019,02,14
113,Top class with the lightest of touches,"Just back from three fantastic nights at The Kensington Hotel, London. A truly wonderful experience. I can‚Äôt fault it. We were there to celebrate my dad‚Äôs 80th birthday and the staff could not have been kinder nor tried harder to make our whole party feel welcome and cared-for. A special mention to the impeccable Thomas and Barbara who were so attentive and ever on the ball. I‚Äôd like to thank Ramona too for helping me arrange it all before we arrived. Mum needed a gluten-free diet and this was never a problem. The chef even made us a stunning gluten-free 80th birthday cake which was delicious. There were unexpected flowers, special patisseries made‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll stop gushing but seriously, if you are thinking about booking this hotel, do so. I had been apprehensive about booking somewhere that I hadn‚Äôt stayed in before for such an important occasion but I needn‚Äôt have worried. The Kensington excelled itself. A top class hotel delivered with lightest of touches. ",5,2019,02,13
113,The BEST hotel in London,My Mom and I have stayed at The Kensington Hotel for the past six years on our annual Mother/Daughter trip to London! It‚Äôs such a gorgeous hotel with an amazing staff! It‚Äôs truly our home away from home! We highly recommend staying here on your London trip!,5,2019,02,11
113,Made my birthday very special,"Booked two nights at The Kensington to celebrate my birthday. Everything was wonderful. Being a platinum member of the Discovery Loyalty schene we got a room upgrade. Guest relations sent me up a cake with Happy Birthday greetings which was very thoughtful. Turn fown service every night and a vresh pot of different tea first night it was camomile and second peppermint. Large tv screen in room, lighting with dimmer and very nice bathroom with shower and bath. Nespresso machine and also tea facilities. Great location just 5 minutes from South Kensington Tube Station that takes you direct to Heathrow. Fantastic staff and service.",5,2019,02,10
113,"Once bitten, twice shy. Not 5 star hotel/service.","It took me 2 months to finally post this up as my stay was back in December. After doing much research everywhere, I booked The Kensington Hotel for 3 nights - 2 separate bookings as I've decided to add 2 more nights because the reviews were amazing. Unfortunately, I felt like hell in this hotel. Here's why.

1) Classic Room is unacceptably small. They did not mention that there is absolutely no space to open up our bags?! It's okay if you have a cabin bag or a bagpack. It's okay if you are on staycation where you do not bag suitcases but if you do - open them up and you'll be left with no space to go around. It is so friggin small I can't believe this is an actual room!? If you're planning to book this room please make sure you don't bring suitcases as they don't provide proper space.

2) I booked Classic King Room and specifically reminded that it's a King Bed and I do not want my room to be next to the elevator. I specifically got one opposite of what I have requested for. A double bed and next to the elevator. I am an extreme light sleeper and this is not good at all. It was not the bed as per my booking. Long story short, we were moved to their suite on the 2nd night (and third) which I will elaborate later.

3) On our first night, we were already too tired to move (It was about 4-5pm, we have just landed from Amsterdam so we need a short nap before dinner at 8pm) and just decided not to do anything about it since our bags are already there. Will decide tomorrow but.. It was unacceptable when the room I've booked for 2 has only 1 bath towel and 2 face towels; the face towels have brown-ish stains. Not a big patch but good enough to be put off by it. That was also partially why we were moved to the suite. 

4) I called for new towels, it never came. I had to walk down to the front desk to register this issue.

5) I also requested for full amenities which were not provided at all. I called housekeeping again, to specifically ask for a shaver and toothbrush, they gave me vanity set. My partner can't shave with vanity set.

6) USB port is not working in the Classic Room.

7) Breakfast - I have to mention this lady by the name Alexandria which is a racist and rude staff. We were down for breakfast 2 days in a row and I have observed her for the longest time. She ignored us (maybe because we are Asians, and basically the only Asians present), does what she have to do (no issue with that), but when it comes to other white people she would start the longest conversation asing about their entire schedule for their trip in London, like every single table. I have no issue if you do not want to start a conversation with us because of the said reasons but at least do not be rude to me. She threw everything we ordered on the table and before we could even speak to her she just walked off when we wanted to ask for coffee. ""Is there anything else I could get for you"" is not very difficult isn't it? She does ask this question to everyone else, but us. She would try to avoid serving us, I was about to ask hey if you have Asian phobia or? Is there a reason to avoid us and make others serve us? What racist card are you playing? On a brighter note, Barbara was a complete opposite of her. She was very nice and she certainly did her job very well and deserve to be mentioned that she was very helpful. Thank goodness for Barbara's presence otherwise life would have been hell with Alexandria. I chose to dine in the room on our 3rd morning because I do not want to spoil my morning by Alexandria's terrible behaviour.

8) K Bar also has an issue. I invited a friend over for drinks after dinner and they took forever to even order our drinks. We were literally left there alone and nobody wants to take care of us. When our drinks finally arrived, I wanted to ask for water so I signalled for someone and also took forever. The first question was ""You want the bill?"". Dude, my glass is full and it had just arrived. Have the courtesy to ask ""How can I help"". This is so basic and omg it was clear that we were not wanted in the place, just get the bill and get lost was the reaction he gave. I could not remember his name.

9) I should not complain about the suite but the room does have odd issues. The design of the bed and the location of the TV is weird. It's placed on a position where the bed is covering the TV and only one side of the bed is able to watch it. See pictures attached. It's not a major issue but it is very weird.

10) The corridor does not have even floors and it's very narrow. Not a quick fix or anything they can do about it.

11) The rooms have very bad noise issues as it's an old building. Not so much for the suite but yes for Classic Room.

12) The nicest part of the hotel, is their entrance which captivated my heart on first glance but everything went downhill after that. 

13) Breakfast choices were not good at all; be it pancakes, bacon or french toast where their food just isn't great so we relied on some toast and that's all, unlike the breakfast I've had at Westbury London which is definitely 5 stars. 

14) Each and every single front desk staff remembers me ""oh you are the one we have upgraded"". There is absolutely no need to do this every single time I am at the front desk. Every single different person who had attended to me did this. What are they trying to achieve?

15) I went to the toilet during breakfast and the cleaning lady was just very angry when I went in. I did not want to disturb her so I used the first toilet nearest to the entrance and did not disrupt her by going inside. I have no idea why but she is just angry at me for no apparent reason. Again this hit my racist button. Perhaps it's not but I felt it. Any other hotels would have just give a smile and good morning, but this lady was just angry at the world?!

However, I do have good things to say too -

1) The lady who did my check in served in a very professional manner. I wish I could remember her name now but she is very friendly and made us feel welcomed. Though this was the only moment we felt welcomed in the hotel.

2) Shower water pressure was strong and shower was great.

3) Bellboy were the nicest people in the hotel and coming back with their greetings made a difference. They were the only ones by far I have not felt any racism. And Barbara from breakfast too.

4) Location is amazing, just about 3 minutes walk to South Kensington tube station.

5) Few good eateries around the area too which I visited regularly when I used to live in London.

Summary-

I have reported some issues above and not all. But it's good to know I felt extremely unwelcomed in this hotel and so many staffs are being racist to Asians. That was precisely how I felt. I left for Westbury London where I am a Marriott Platinum member and treated well with no racist cards played. I almost broke down when I arrived at Westbury because everyone was so kind and nice which was a complete opposite from The Kensington Hotel. I almost forgotten how it's like to be serviced by people who realise their guests are very important; I go back to Kensington Hotel every night thinking what the hell has just happened? Everything and everyone were not just cold, simply reminding you that they did you a favour by upgrading because you complained and just throwing faces because we were Asians. I was very very upset staying in The Kensington Hotel. I am not new to London, I have stayed in W London, Marriott Park Lane, Westbury London, and many other 5 star hotels and I have never been treated this way. I paid a more expensive price in this hotel than Westbury just to try out to see if I like it, and if I do, I might continue with their loyalty program because anyhow I am already a Platinum with Marriott group. I signed up for Doyle Collection loyalty upon check in but I emailed to request for it to be removed as I felt so terribly disturbed by the experience. Thanks for the experience Doyle group, you will never see me again. Once bitten, twice shy.

Would have been a star but 2 because it wasn‚Äôt a place that I completely could not stay but I can‚Äôt give any more than 2.",2,2019,02,10
113,Lovely Unique Afternoon Tea,"We visited the townhouse at the Kensington for Landmark ""Tiny Building"" Afternoon tea. The service was very friendly, charming and extremely knowledgeable.
The afternoon tea consisted of a starter with 3 warm savories and the main event of sandwiches, scones and the sweets all designed in specific London Landmark shapes which was fantastically presented on a very strudy London eye metal frame. The whole experience was great. The food was intensely satisfying with well crafted flavours and a good tea selection to match.",5,2019,02,09
113,"Inconsistent service, unenjoyable stay","UPDATE: The Front Office of the hotel did reach out to offer their apologies and partially rectify the situation with a gesture of good will. I appreciate their follow-up and commitment to customer service. 

Original Review: We were looking forward to our stay at the Kensington due to all of the positive reviews, but unfortunately our stay was less than ideal. Before arrival, we had corresponded with the hotel requesting a street-facing room. Check-in informed us that our room was street-facing, but upon arrival at the room found a room facing the back of the hotel with all of the equipment. We requested to move rooms but they said they had no availability for that night and we would have to wait until the next night to move. This was very inconvenient given that we could not fully unpack our things for a 5-night stay. Disappointing that our initial request was ignored. 

The most egregious incident was when we brought back cupcakes from the artisanal bakery down the street and wanted to enjoy them with the drinks we just ordered from the lounge bar. A waitress immediately approached us and to inform us that we can't eat outside food/drinks in the lounge. This is quite offensive given that we were guests of the hotel and paying patrons in the lounge. The reason we wanted to enjoy it in the lounge is because the room is extremely small with only one sitting chair. One of us would have had to sit on the bed. I brought up this fact with the front desk who apologized and said that we could enjoy it in the lounge, but later called up to our room to tell us that it's in fact a management policy not to allow outside food/drink in the common areas. Given the size of the rooms, paying lounge guests should be allowed to enjoy a snack on the first floor. 

The rooms are very small with minimal area around the bed to put luggage or maneuver around the room. The bed and pillows were uncomfortable and we did not really sleep well during our stay. 

We booked the Beauty and the Beast afternoon tea. I thought the experience was just fine but overpriced. Inconsistent service from the wait staff. We were ignored for the first 20 minutes when tables around us were getting serviced. For instance, we never received the Belle cookie that is suppose to come before the food until I specifically asked about it. At breakfast one morning, the waitress did not write down any part of our order. When our food arrived, the omelet orders were both wrong. We had waited a bit for it so didn't bother sending it back. I had also ordered a juice (which I later found out was not included in the breakfast rate) that I think she forgot to put in since it arrived after we had finished our meal. However, of course we still got charged for it. Upon leaving, no one helped us with our luggage down the stairs outside but at that point, we were glad to be leaving. 

Positive notes: Thomas from the breakfast staff was excellent and the location is very close to the South Kensington station.",3,2019,02,06
113,Fantastic Hotel,"We want to keep the Kensington Hotel our best kept secret but it wouldn't be fair to the rest.  We loved our weekend stay at the hotel from scratch to finish.  The hotel staff is 100% spot on.  Leondro at the front desk was just great as was Ronald, the waiter at the hotel restaurant, and Ronald who took very good care of our luggage and taxi needs.  

The hotel is warm and cosy and the interior/exterior decorating beautiful.  Rooms were a bit on the small side but exceptionally clean and beautifully furnished.  Location is perfect and convenient to everything.  What more can we say -- we're definitely going back!!!",5,2019,01,31

113,Great Hotel,"We were given as a gift a two night stay in the Kensington. We had a wonderful time. From the moment we walked in to the day we left, all the staff were polite, helpful and interested in wether we were having a good time. There was a good restaurant, although we didn‚Äôt use because there were so many great restaurants in the area. There was also a fine bar that served wines, spirits and great cocktails. 

We were upgraded when we arrived, which was a bonus! Our room was spacious, bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was just the right size. Lots of extras in the room, Nespresso machine, tea making facilities, dressing gown, slippers and a lovely gift of two miniature bottles of aromatherapy oil. Our package was through a company called Mr and Mrs Smith, well worth a look on their website. 

Also we were very close to the underground, bars, restaurants and museums. We had a great time...... ",5,2019,01,23
113,Friendliest place you can think of,We spent last weekend at this gem of a small hotel in Kensington. Our stay really made our weekend in London.

113,Amazing Afternoon Tea,"Me and my girlfriend had a great time at the Kensington Hotel. We have had the best afternoon tea and tried the new London Landmark Theme, which we loved.  Special thanks to Thomas and Illiari for looking after us. They have been really great.",5,2019,01,20
113,Fantastic hotel and location,We visited London for the NBA game and I stayed with my two teenagers in the Doyle Kensington in a beautiful family room.  The room had a double bed and two single beds. Really comfortable beds and bedding. Plenty of space in the hallway area for dressing and getting ready for me - and a gorgeous bathroom with walk in shower. The bar has a vast drinks menu and a relaxed atmosphere. Buffet style continental breakfast was lovely. The staff were amazing and went over and above to make our stay fantastic-and it was! The location is second to none - a two minute walk from south Kensington station.  Thank you all so much. We will definitely be back!,5,2019,01,19
113,Lovely,"I recently stayed at The Kensington. It's a pretty hotel and very relaxed. My room was so comfortable and had all the amenities I like. Nice towels and sheets and pillows.  I had a few meals in the cozy lounge by the fire. The food is great and the service is just right. And the location is perfect, a short walk to museums and great shopping. I'll definitely stay there again next time I visit London!",5,2019,01,17
113,Study Abroad,"I was returning to London to pick up my daughter from a study abroad program and The Kensington was not only in the neighborhood, but was just down the street.The staff were welcoming and knowledgeable and the restaurant was not only good, but was relaxing. The location to the tube was another big PLUS and the hotel itself was lovely and charming and I would return and definitely stay here again!",5,2019,01,15

113,Excellent stay,Stayed for 2 nights. Rooms small but very well appointed. Beds very comfortable. Bar excellent as was the breakfast quality and selection. Service through out was first class. Think of it as a mini Dorchester where the rooms are half the size but for 1/3rd the cost. I will certainly becoming back again.,5,2019,01,11
113,Fantastic and authentic London hotel,"We stayed in a junior suite with my son on a business trip of mine. The room was roomy, clean and elegant. The overall experience in the hotel was top quality. The service was friendly, effective and warm throuhg out the whole staff. The interiors are designed in a very tasteful way with beautiful art. Eventhough we are routined travellers, it felt like we were staying in a local mansion in the middle of London. The restaurant is of very high quality- dinner, roomservice and breakfast -all was of top quality. The location of the building itself is also great - quiet but central. Warm recommendation for anyone.",5,2019,01,10
113,The most wonderful customer service i've seen,"The hotel itself is beautiful but what wow-ed my husband and i during our stay was the incredible customer care. I fell quite ill during the stay and needed to visit hospital and the staff were so incredibly helpful, caring and considerate. They helped out above and beyond and we were so grateful. Can't recommend this hotel enough for all aspects.",5,2019,01,09

113,Highly recommended hotel! Excellent stay.,"My husband and young kids wanted a mini-break in London and travelled from Ireland to stay for a few days between Christmas and New Years. I initially picked the hotel based on its location and the website information was very helpful. I booked directly with the hotel by phone and thankfully was dealing with an excellent receptionist - I cant‚Äôt remember her name unfortunately but it may have been Maria. Anyway, the receptionist was extremely helpful and even took the names of my kids so that the hotel could leave them a little gift upon arrival. I booked a suite for me and my husband and an adjoining room for the kids. Check-in was efficient and the hot hand towels and glasses of fresh juices were welcomed! The general decor of the hotel is extremely elegant and tasteful. The rooms were excellent and as one would expect for a 5-star hotel. The windows also had soundproof glass. The housekeeping staff were very kind and replenished the bottled water daily and even gave us a few extra. Thomas saw to us each morning for breakfast and was an excellent host so special thanks to him for helping to make our stay so special. We were within waking distance of The Natural History Museum, Harrods, Hyde Park and a tube station. A really lovely part of London. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel. It‚Äôs an excellent hotel with excellent staff in an excellent location. In my opinion, the staff are reall what make this hotel which is why we plan to return during the summer. Thank you to everyone who made our stay so special.",5,2019,01,04
113,A Gem of a Hotel,"Myself and my 11yr old son had a wonderful few days at The Kensington just before Christmas. The Hotel is in a fabulous location, close to the V&A, Natural History and Science Museums and just a couple of mins walk from South Ken underground station or bus stops. Our room was spacious, well appointed and spotlessly clean. All staff were fantastic but special mention must go to the Breakfast staff for their friendly approach and to the Reception staff for their resourcefulness and kind gifts for Lucas - he was thrilled to receive them. Thank you for making us feel so welcome and I‚Äôm looking forward to staying with you again in the Spring.  ",5,2019,01,03
113,Beautiful hotel in great location ,"This was my third stay at The Kensington and it is a ‚Äúmust‚Äù for me when I am in London. From the greeting, hand towel and welcome juice at reception, the service was faultless throughout my stay. The lobby, bar and restaurant are beautifully decorated and the food and drink service is excellent. My room was spotless and the bed very comfortable. The rain shower was a highlight. The hotel is located very close to South Kensington tube and bus stops. There are lovely shops and eating places nearby. It is walking distance to the Victoria and Albert museum. Highly recommended. ",5,2019,01,03
113,Usual wonderful stay,"My wife and I stayed for three nights over New Year and to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary, we had our reception at the Kensington two years ago and it was fantastic in every regard, we have stayed at the Kensington several times since and every time the service and attention to detail is outstanding, the staff are professional, knowledgeable and always so helpful and polite, it is always a pleasure to stay here and we always feel welcome and part of the family, we cannot recommend this hotel and the staff highly enough",5,2019,01,03
113,My second stay as good as the first!!,"My second stay here did not disappoint! My room was spacious anand kept beautifully clean. I especially love the HEATED bathroom floor! The staff was extremely helpful, polite and friendly. The breakfast was excellent. The location...in South Kensington..is excellent and a very short walk to two tube stations. I‚Äôm usually in London around the Christmas holiday and the hotel is beautifully decorated‚Äîinside and out‚Äîwith a cozy fireplace and comfortable seating for relaxing and having a cocktail and snacks. There‚Äôs no question that the Kensington is now my go-to hotel in London!!",5,2018,12,30
113,Beautiful festive stay !,"Myself and my husband stayed at The Kensington the weekend before Christmas as we had tickets for the Royal Albert Hall which is a short walk away. The concierge prior to our stay were incredibly helpful arranging parking and afternoon tea for us - which was highly appreciated. The hotel was decorated very tastefully and the front of house staff / doorman were inviting and warm. The room was lovely and no complaints at all, however we did book the standard room as it was just a 1 night stay and we will upgrade to a larger room next time just so it is more comfortable space wise. Lastly, Beauty and the Beast afternoon tea was fantastic - special thanks to Andy and Dan who were so enthusiastic and lovely to us making it such a nice experience. I will say the two women who interacted with us ( I believe they may have been management ) appeared frosty and compelled disinterested but luckily the men saved the day with their charm! All in all, I think it is a fab hotel in a wonderful location and we will be re booking to come back in March !",5,2018,12,28
113,Style and substance beyond compare,"The Kensington Hotel is one of those rare gems you find yourself worth reviewing with pleasure as well as planning your next visit to London with hopes of booking another stay there. 

Upon arrival (an unusually early 7am), staff and management greeted us with warm smiles and kind words. Expecting to just leave our bags with the front desk while we wandered the streets for a few hours, we were instead given a room straight away as well as warm towels and cold water to help refresh us from the long time spent travelling. 

We found The Kensington provides you with beautiful and clean rooms, attentive staff and a menu with a variety of choices for 24 hour room service. 

The location of the hotel is fantastic. A five minute walk from the South Kensington underground station, you can take the Tube and explore what London has to offer. Alternatively,  you can stroll down the peaceful streets of West London to visit The Natural History Museum, Hyde Park and Buckingham Palace. 

Surrounding the hotel are numerous restaurants and pubs which provide you with a wide selection of dining options when deciding where to eat next. 

Overall, The Kensington is an amazing place to stay and will be highly recommended to family and friends who travel to London. A warm thank you to the team at The Kensington who made our stay with them enjoyable. We plan and hope to revisit Soon on our next trip to London.  ",5,2018,12,28
113,London stay 2018,"After a week in Sweden, half of which was inside the arctic circle, and 3 days in Copenhagen, we arrived in London. I had stayed in Kensington for business on previous trips but this was our 35th Anniversary vacation and I wanted to take my wife somewhere special. The Kensington was perfect for our few days in London. The staff was delightful and upon our arrival showed us all the services they provide. 
Location was excellent and our room was very comfortable and clean. This is not your typical chain hotel. It has an Old World charm that few hotels still have. Location is great with lots of restaurants an easy walk as well as pubs. The Underground is convenient and close as well. 
The lobby and sitting rooms and bar were all decorated for the Holidays and that just added to the warmth and charm of the Hotel. We only ate out once as the food at the Hotel was excellent! I will most certainly go back the The Kensington on my next trip to London. ",5,2018,12,24
113,Noisy room couldn't sleep,"Horrible noisy rooms. When I  opened  the window I saw loads of  noisy equipments.  Not nice hotel management either. Very Disappointed. 
The bar and restaurant  staff are good though. The food are  delicious.",2,2018,12,22
113,The Journey,"The hotel is very central to south Kensington and close to the Royal Marsden Hospital  We had excellent breakfast ,comfortable beds. nice bath room with walking shower, Very pleased to have chosen  this hotel and we would stay again if we needed .",5,2018,12,22
113,Wonderful Experience. Loved it!,"We stayed here 14-16th December '18, and we absolutely loved everything about it. Anytime we go back to London we will only stay here now, if its available. The ambience and decor is simply outstanding.",5,2018,12,21
113,Love this place,"Our third stay here, and never a disappointment. Staff took such good care of us, it was such a pleasure staying here for the wind down portion of a two week Christmas market tour. A suite upgrade was available for our Discovery tier and what a treat! Great hotel in a great location. We were able to spend some time in the K bar for the first time, and it was fabulous (any wine by the glass so you can splurge on something high end without getting a bottle). Will stay here whenever in London. ",5,2018,12,16
113,Beauty & The Beast Afternoon Tea,Me and my partner have had the most wonderful experience as part of the afternoon tea.I am a big Disney fan so this was just perfect. The food selection was lovely loved the starter and the choice of cakes and sandwiches was great.The little touches made it that bit more special. One of the staff Thomas was great he made our experience that more special with the little extras he did. The location was just perfect. We would highly recommend.,5,2018,12,12
113,Dinner Service in the lounge,"We stay for business reasons very often in The Kensington but today was the first time I ate dinner in the lounge and I wanted to recommend Florin, your waiter there. From the start I felt very welcomed and looked after. He has an eye for all the details that go on in the lounge incl. fixing all the small things like lights but never forgetting his guests. Great service all around and highly recommendable.",5,2018,12,11
113,second time at hotel this year,The Kensington is in a great location and service is excellent.  from the moment we checked in to our checkout the staff ensured everything was great.  the rooms are quite nice and beds very comfortable.  without a doubt this is the hotel to stay in when in south Kensington.,5,2018,12,11
113,Outstanding,"Outstanding hotel, very well located. Staff very friendly, make you feel at home! Great rooms and facilities. You can reach subway, Hyde Park and a lot of museums at walking distance. A lot of bars and great restaurants in the neighborhood.",5,2018,12,10
113,Lovely cosy hotel in an ideal location,"We stayed here for 2 nights. The service was very good and we were well looked after. The room was comfortable although the bathroom was quite small, however this is understandable as space is at a premium in central London.The food at breakfast was excellent and the bar food and cocktail menu were both very good also. The reception rooms are beautifully decorated for Christmas.",5,2018,12,10
113,Amazing afternoon tea ,"This review is just about the Tale as Old as Time afternoon tea. We didn‚Äôt stay in a room at the hotel. 

From start to finish, we were very impressed with The Kensington. The building and downstairs rooms are stunning. The staff were very friendly. I was a bit worried that this afternoon tea experience might be a bit tacky and overcrowded, but it wasn‚Äôt at all. We were seated at a table with plenty of room. We weren‚Äôt too close to others to hear their conversations. 

The food was exquisite. Every mouthful was wonderful. A lot of thought and care has gone into this afternoon tea service and overall we were really impressed. 

Worth the money. Highly recommended. ",5,2018,12,08
113,Lovely hotel!,"I really enjoyed staying here. 
The front desk staff were so kind and friendly. Thanks for the hospitality :) 
The room was a bit small but it was okay to stay. Bed was great and helped me to have good sleep. The hotel is located near tube station, and it took me around 7-10 mins by walk. 
The hotel atmosphere was so pretty. I really loved the christmas tree and fireplace area. 
I tried bar and restaurant, and both of the are great. 
I would love to visit the hotel again :)",5,2018,12,08
113,Cosy base in London,Nice boutique hotel with good value rooms but pricey once you got to junior suite and above. Best is Brompton suite with a nice Crawfoot tub near a louvered window and a four poster bed with chinois bed posts. The junior suite i stayed in have identical items except its bedroom is much smaller and the doors to bathroom made the room look even smaller. Breakfast spread is great and they have wine by the glass program which is useful. ,4,2018,12,08
113,Warm and inviting with a fabulous team,"The Kensington was warm and inviting with beautiful decor and relaxed atmosphere. 

The whole team were fabulous from the moment we arrived. The door men, concierge, reception, bar and restaurant staff were all friendly, welcoming and efficient. 

The room was pristine and chic but also cosy and comfortable. 

My second time staying here and will not be my last.",5,2018,12,06
113,Boutique hotel with a view,"Lovely design hotel. Attention to details is everywhere, staff is extremely caring! It was my fianc√©e's birthday, so when we got to the room we had a desert with a Happy Birthday note. 
I would definitely recommend this excellent hotel. Thank you again Katerina!",5,2018,12,06
113,An Elegant Hotel With Attentive and Gracious Staff,"I stayed in The Kensington for seven nights in November 2018.
The Kensington is an elegant well-maintained hotel in a great location.  The staff are attentive, helpful, and gracious; they made me feel like a VIP even though I stayed in one of their Classic Rooms.
I was traveling alone, and found the Classic Room very comfortable. The Kensington lists the maximum number of guests for each room, and based on my experience their assessments are correct; I would not try to have a child or a third adult in the Classic Room.  The bathroom was a bit small, but the stand-up shower itself was spacious.  If a smallish bathroom is the trade-off for an elegant hotel with great staff at a fair price in a great location, I'll happily take that deal.  
There are many restaurants in the immediate vicinity, and Knightsbridge (Harrods!) is about a twelve minute walk. In addition, this hotel is close to South Kensington Station, which is PERFECT if you plan on getting around London on the tube; three different lines pass through South Kensington Station, so wherever I went I rarely had to change trains.
Next time I visit London, I will absolutely stay at The Kensington again.",5,2018,12,03
113,Perfect place to stay for the Royal Albert Hall,This is a stunning hotel with excellent service and facilities.  Decor is subtle but stunning.  The Town House restaurant was also excellent.  All within walking distance of South Kensington Tube Station and the Royal Albert Hall.  The bed was one of the comfiest I have experienced in a hotel.  The whole evening and stay was a delightful experience.,5,2018,12,03
113,Honeymoon at the Kensingtons,"My wife and I visited London for our honeymoon from 17/11/18-23/11/18. We stayed at the kensington hotel for the trip. It was in a very lovely and posh neighbourhood. Far from the touristy crowds in the city but yet convenient to travel around. We either  walked orused public transport to get from place to place. The nearest metro was South Kensington station a short 3 minute walk from the hotel.  The Kensington is sort of a 5 star boutique hotel. I found the room assigned to us slightly on the smaller side. We didnt have enough space to open the luggage on the floor flat out. Not too sure maybe due to us taking a normal double room. Amenities wise there was nespresso machine with complimentary capsules. It was very convenient located as there are a few bus stops around the corner. Food wise one does not worry. There are a couple.of restaurants nearby from pastries, italian pizzas, steakhouse. Pity i didnt manage to try all as my travels took me further inwards to the city. We had a wonderful time during my stay in London and yes i look forward to be back in future ",4,2018,12,01
113,Excellent hotel at a good price,"Excellent welcome, good room and bed, cosy lobby area and very good location. The hotel was very cheap compared to other similar hotels in London. I was there for business but I think the hotel would be very good for couples on a week-end trip",5,2018,11,29
113,Loved this hotel!,"Loved everything about this place!! First glance - the hotel is beautiful and charming. We arrived on our first day after a 9 hour flight. Our room became available almost immediately upon arrival. We were also given a free upgrade because we were visiting London for my birthday. Perfect way to start! I also received beautiful flowers, a card, and a dessert from the hotel staff on my birthday! So sweet and thoughtful. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Their hospitality was excellent. They were always willing to go the extra mile with assistance, questions, etc. Special thanks to Curtis for all of his help during our stay! We ate a few meals at the hotel restaurant and were not disappointed. We ate breakfast, dinner, and even decided to try afternoon tea. The Beauty and the Beast theme for afternoon tea was enjoyable. We loved it! Our room was large and clean. We had a king-sized bed, so I am not sure if that made a difference in terms of room size. The hotel itself was in a convenient location. We were just down the street from the tube entrance, which we used on a daily basis. The hotel also has a computer/printer for guests and we used it on a couple days to print out our tickets to some of the attractions. I booked this hotel because of the reviews on Trip Advisor and I am so glad that I did! We will definitely return on our next trip to London. ",5,2018,11,28
113,Tale as old as time Afternoon tea,"Well what can I say, from the second we arrived to the minute we left we were made to feel very special. We were going to take our young daughter bit decided to just go alone as we didn't fancy tackling the underground and all the walking with a 3 year old. Thomas was absolutely wonderful his customer service is truly spectacular. He put together some goodies to take home as a nice touch. 
He was so professional and kind. thank you! 
Barbara came to take our order and was polite and friendly. The whole experience was unforgettable and we shall certainly be coming back.",5,2018,11,28
113,Delightful Hotel,Great hotel. Staff is terrific and the hotel is fantastic. I Travel so much and I truly enjoyed my stay at the Kensington. The service was spot on and the staff made some terrific restaurant suggestions.  The bar was very cozy and the drinks were phenomenal. The hotel itself is charming and sophisticated which is a hard blend to find sometimes. I am looking forward to my next visit.,5,2018,11,27
113,Wonderful,"This is one of the few places where the pictures don't lie. The hotel is beautiful, the staff is friendly. Our room (king size deluxe) was spacious and convenient. We sampled some breakfast dishes which were excellent. Location is central and only a few-minute walk from the South kensington tube station.",5,2018,11,27
113,Boutique Hotel in a Great Location with Great Service,"We stayed in The Kensington for one week and enjoyed each night. The location is conveniently located near the museums and the South Kensington underground station. The service in the hotel is wonderful. The staff is attentive and qualified. Ask anyone any question and they can help you or they find someone who can. We upgraded to a larger room and the size was OK by European standards. The room was serviced at least twice a day including turndown service and water bottles. The gym was bigger than we expected and we were pleasantly surprised. Breakfast is really good and a great way to start off the day. At night there is usually an available couple of seats at the bar where it is warm and cosy.

My only issue is that the room had very minimal storage. Not a single drawer or really anywhere to unpack. 

We would stay at The Kensington again. My advice...pay for the larger room.",5,2018,11,26
113,Elegance and Extraordinary Service,"I stay here just about every month for my work travel and the hotel is wonderful. The staff is amazing. Slyvia at the front desk is the ultimate host and professional. Service is excellent from the restaurant to the front desk. The rooms are elegant and very clean. The hotel has a upscale boutique feel without too many people in and out. It is peaceful but offers full service accommodations including dry cleaning and wash and fold. Its located in a great neighborhood and walking distance to Royal Albert Hall, Hyde Park, Regent Park and Harrods. There is also excellent high tea service served next to a fire place.  I always feel 5 star when I stay here and never deviate from this hotel. This hotel has my loyalty and is by far my favorite place to stay in Europe.",5,2018,11,26
113,They go above and beyond,"We had a fantastic stay at this beautiful hotel this weekend. I particularly loved the bar area where we had both pre and post dinner drinks. Lovely atmosphere and made me feel very Christmassy. Both myself and my Fathers rooms were upgraded which was a lovely touch and both rooms (studio suite and luxury studio suite) were spacious, well appointed and stylishly decorated. We had one tiny issue which was dealt with as soon as it was brought to their attention. 5 star service. I‚Äôm really pleased we have found this hotel and we look forward to returning in the near future. ",5,2018,11,26
113,Wonderful,"We spent an amazing week-end in this so charming and lovely place. The staff is very kind, special thanks to Curtis.Perfect dinner and a nice bar with a lot of whiskey choice. We will come back soon for sure.",5,2018,11,25
113,Great hotel with kids!,"Thoroughly enjoyed 2 stays at the Kensington during our recent trip! Beautiful rooms, great staff, extra friendly towards kids! Top notch location. Good breakfast buffet & cocktail hour. We will be back! ",5,2018,11,25
113,Perfect getaway,"Amazing find, a fantastic hotel, perfectly positioned for our visit to the Royal Albert Hall. I asked for quiet room and were on the 3rd floor. Bliss.  Huge comfy bed, robes, water, free wi-fi all made our brief stay all the more enjoyable.  Lunch and full English breakfast served in a relaxed setting, with excellent staff who couldn‚Äôt do enough to make our stay special.  Beautifully decorated with wreaths and tree and blazing fires, perfect.  Christmas shopping on the Saturday whilst leaving cases here.  Can‚Äôt wait to try other luxury hotels in the Doyle Group.",5,2018,11,24
113,Granddaughters first visit to London,"Everything was great about the hotel.Very comfortable and pleasant surroundings.
Staff were all  friendly,efficient and professional.
Room lovely - a special supper and gift was waiting for our granddaughter 
when we returned to our room late evening.
The bar, breakfast and afternoon tea were all lovely.
Would definately recommend - especially for  the proximity to the museums and galleries.
We would definitely stay again.",5,2018,11,23
113,Christmas again,"All dressed up for Christmas. Really brings hotel to life. Staff are great and nothing too much trouble. 
Walking distance to mueseum and Harrods. Great place to base for indulging yourself for Christmas. Just enjoy it.",5,2018,11,22
113,An Afternoon Tea,"We visited here to celebrate a milestone birthday and was not let down, as it was a complete surprise for the receiptient, we were a bit cautious but we had an excellent tea with attentive yet not intrusive service thank you very much ",5,2018,11,22
113,Best hotel in London,"We booked this hotel last minute as we had an issue with an apartment we rented nearby and had to leave the flat immediately... the hotel staff helped us bring my three little kids and all our belongings to the hotel from the apartment, cannot thank them enough for this lovely gesture. We had the best experience, excellent staff! Beautiful hotel, very cosy and welcoming. Food is outstanding..  No doubt its the best hotel in Kensington london. We will come again next month, thank you for everything.",5,2018,11,21
113,Perfect hotel,"It's a perfect hotel for business people and for tourists for a great price. Everything is just right: the rooms are extremely clean and quiet, the bathrooms are squicky clean and the taps are Grohe made. Fabulous shower after a long day of meetings. The staff is so friendly and helpful and breakfast was surprisingly wonderful - with fresh fruit and vegetables you hardly ever get in English hotels. The prices are very good - and you can still use the spacious loby of the nearby Marriot if needs be! For tourists - the Victoria and Albert Museum as well the Natural History Museum are nearby. The nearest tube station is around the corner, bus stations are nearby, with all busses leading everyehere really near, and Hyde Park is just a little bit away. It's a perfect hotel for either business or tourism and the prices are great. Good restaurants and shops really near with everything you would need. What a nice surprise!",5,2018,11,20
113,Fantastic hotel,"Stayed here a few times and never fails 
A very friendly face greets you upon arrival
Service is excellent and nothing is too much of a problem
Breakfast is excellent 
Near to tube station and museums
Shopping is also one tube stop away for Harrods or Kings Road you can also take a short stroll either and enjoy the lovely buildings in the area

Will always return here when visiting London ",5,2018,11,20
113,Good service and beautiful rooms,"Good service and beautiful rooms, The hotel design is gorgeous with attention to details. I was with my husband and daughter and they surprised her with a beautiful book and cake with her name on it, and she loved it!",5,2018,11,19
113,Perfect stay,"The hotel is very agreable, the staff impaccable and the common rooms a real treat, each with an inviting fire place and confortable chairs and sofa, you can always find a nice corner to sit in. Rooms are charming and decoration is quite pleasing. We had an excellent stay I would highly recommend this hotel. Only small mishap, the size of the beds... they seem like quite small queen beds but their confort ( brilliant pillows..) make up for it.",5,2018,11,19
113,First class hotel made for a wonderful trip,"Our room was superbly clean and comfortable, with a large, firm bed and several plump pillows that made sleeping a breeze. Everything was spotless, from the high water pressure pristine showers to the ambient room lighting (with dimmer switch) and we were treated to cute little surprises every time we returned from a trip into the city like chocolates on the pillows, fresh slippers by the bed side or a tiny plush British Bulldog named Budd welcoming us ""home."" A large HDTV with a good selection of cable channels made our hours recuperating after a long day out a delight. The air conditioning in the room was responsive, quiet and as cold or hot as your taste prefers.  

As an avid runner, the fitness center was a triumph, with a full selection of high quality cardio equipment as well as a complete set of weight and resistance training equipment. A constantly refilled refrigerator of bottled waters, piles of clean towels and a reliable bowl of fresh fruit only added to the work out experience. 

The Kensington is in a charming and safe neighborhood, literally around the corner from a collection of high quality restaurants, local markets, pharmacies, coffee spots and no more that a few minutes walk from the South Kensington Underground Station which leaves you no more than 20 minutes from all major attractions like Big Ben, the Zoo, or the National Gallery.     

I can't recommend the hotel more highly and will certainly re-book the next time my better half and I have the pleasure of visiting London.",5,2018,11,18
113,Couldn‚Äôt recommend more,"Amazing staff, great food, beautiful rooms and attention to detail was flawless. Felt so comfortable during 5+ day stay and location was within a five min walk of underground. Nothing was too far and great little eateries in area. Beautiful stress free neighborhood especially for first time visitors. Absolutely fantastic experience!",5,2018,11,18
113,Lovely Stay at The Kensington,"We booked 2 rooms at The Kensington for our family of 5 (2adults, 3kids). I chose that hotel for the location, and after reading the reviews at Tripadvisor. We were extremely pleased with the hotel and all the staff throughout our 6-day stay there. The rooms were not only huge by London's standard, but also clean with comfortable beds. The children were greeted with little surprises of gifts from the hotel when we checked in. We were also very grateful that the staff tried their best to accommodate our requests before we arrived.We are very grateful to the extremely helpful concierge guys on our departure day. One of the guys noticed that we were waiting for quite a while for our transport to the airport. He offered to help us call the transport company. After we realized that our transport was stuck in the traffic and unable to pick us up, his colleague proactively called for a London cab for us, which arrived in 2 minutes. It's been a really wonderful experience for us. We will certainly be back one day!!",5,2018,11,18
113,Good stay...,"Nice accommodations, nice facilities and nice hotel decoration. However, the staff lacks a bit of professionalism. Indeed, the relations of the staff members with the clients did not always reflect the expectations of a 5-star Hotel. ",4,2018,11,18
113,Excellent location - Classy hotel,"It was our second stay in this hotel. We appreciated its class, cleanliness, modernity without ostentation and location steps from Museums, shops and restaurants that we appreciate.Rooms are comfortable with all needed amenities",4,2018,11,18
113,Well located with exceptional staff,"I stayed at The Kensington this summer and had a wonderful time.  The staff is more than friendly, they are attentive and display an incredible degree of professionalism at all times.  Had several meals onsite, all of which were excellent.  Breakfast in particular is fantastic.  Great location, lots of little cafes, pubs, and restaurants in easy walking distance.  V&A museum and Harrod's are also a short walk away.  A fantastic property and I will definitely stay here again next time I am in London.",5,2018,11,16
113,BEST STAY !,"I surprised my boyfriend for his 30th, and we had an incredible stay. Everything was so perfect! From all the surprises I planned with the staff of the hotel to breakfast in bed. Love this place, I would really recommend it to all my family and friends. At the Kensington you will observe that they they know what they do and they enjoy it, they master the service and it's great to be able to enjoy that where to a lot of places it's not like this anymore.",5,2018,11,16
113,Warm in every way.,"During our week long honeymoon in Paris, my wife and I made a candid decision to head over to London for a night.
It was our first time to London and we wanted a perfect neighbourhood for the occasion and importantly, a perfect hotel.
The Kensington was just that!
Guest relations and hospitality are top notch. The place and staff both exude a warm, unpretentious, homely vibe that leaves you perfectly at ease.
Details are all in place from a comfy bed and (thankfully underutilised) wide screen TV, to excellent breakfasts and superb connectivity and locality.

You cannot go wrong with a stay at the Kensington.
We might return once we've exhausted other parts of England :)",5,2018,11,14
113,Fantastic Posh London Hotel,"We LOVED this hotel. The staff, the restaurant, and the bar were all fantastic. Be warned, the rooms are a bit small, but it's London, what do you expect. This is our new go to in London! Also, if you're going to a Chelsea FC match, it's a super easy walk to the stadium :)",5,2018,11,13
113,Exceptional Hotel,"Service and comfort was at the highest end of all my stays in various hotels... and hotel location provided easy access to the train system, restaurants, bars and very short walks to many other Museums, parks and shopping. Perfect",5,2018,11,13
113,a place to return,"Very kind service and very nice and cosy ""ambiance"" in every part of the hotel. The decoration makes you feel at home and the food is well chosen and prepared.As a proof of our pleasure we took every meal in the hotel and did not look for any other place;We will come back with pleasure",5,2018,11,13
113,Lovely experience!,"My wife and me stayed here for 4 nights. The employees of this hotel were absolutely wonderful. always helping, greeting, smiling. The hotel itself is great! the room was a bit small but clean, organised and well kept. We did the 'Afternoon Tea' in a Beauty and the Beast theme. It was nice but too expensive.",5,2018,11,13
113,The Standard,Our stay at The Kensington absolutely made our visit to London.  The service and attentiveness of the staff are second to none.  The hotel is comfortable and quiet.  The location is the best-set in one of the poshest areas of London.  The Kensington is absolutely worth every penny!  We were pampered and more than comfortable every minute in the hotel.,5,2018,11,12
113,Perfect hotel for a London weekend,Overall a great experience at The Kensington. From check-in with hot towels to comfortable bed. We stayed in the Luxury Studio Suite and it was all you had hoped for. Convenient for all activities you may have planned for in London with 2 subway stations within a couple of blocks. Great area with good restaurants as well!,5,2018,11,12
113,Pretentious and over priced,"Thought this was going to be a treat for a weekend but sadly a bit of a let down. The room was small, but the bathroom required a trigonometry set to calculate your entrance and exit it was so small. Service at breakfast is not brilliant either it took 3 attempts to get a black coffee and with low level chairs and tables it‚Äôs not the most comfortable dining experience.",2,2018,11,10
113,"Excellent location, wonderful service","The Kensington was close to several things we wanted to see in London, so the choice was easy.  We were very pleased with the experience.  A very inviting place, with dated art and a ground floor series of common areas that were always busy, inviting, and comfortable.  Our room was large, although the view wasn't the best.  Soft bed, well-equipped bath, excellent wi-fi, and really good food in the dining room.  I don't think I've ever stayed anywhere with such an excellent bar and lounge in a hotel of this style.  We could have spent much more time in the bar if we had the opportunity.  It is a bit older, and some of the features you might expect in a modern hotel are not going to be there, but it is elegant and more than adequate.  Service was always very good.  Our TV was a bit problematic; big lags in locking on to a channel, and a tendency to wander in volume.  We would certainly contemplate a return.",4,2018,11,09
113,Great service and common areas,"The common areas are lovely and the service is great. Only had the breakfast, which was really nice. I would suggest to order from the meny and not take the continental buffet, more value for the money. ",4,2018,11,09
113,Truly lovely,"The quiet elegance, the location, the service - everything you hope and expect when visiting London.  We enjoyed our stay and appreciate the assistance given.  Our room was spacious, the staff courteous and immediate in their service.  The bar and dining room were outstanding.  See you next time.",5,2018,11,07
113,Wonderful hotel!,"My daughter and I just returned from a five-night stay at The Kensington Hotel and couldn't be more pleased!  The service was impeccable, the rooms beautiful (even though they are a bit small), the bar, lounge and dining areas are cozy and lovely! The staff was welcoming and friendly, and always had good advice when it came to area restaurants and attractions.  We can't wait for a return visit!",5,2018,11,06
113,Great experience!,"I stayed with my 10 year old daughter and our experience in the hotel was the highlight of her trip. Excellent and friendly service, lovely, well appointed room, sophisticated ambiance and overall very welcoming.",5,2018,11,05
113,Lovely hotel with great staff,"The lounges of the hotel are just great: active fireplaces in all of the lounges, very cosy decoration, you feel at home (if ever this could be like this!). Rooms are well decorated, lot's of quality details (slippers, cosmetic products, tea, etc.)",5,2018,11,04
113,"Nice room, small bathroom",The room and staff were very nice. The bed was comfortable. The only 2 things I didn‚Äôt really like. 1 was the tub/shower was awkward to get in and out of. The tub was elevated and a little slippery. The other was no dresser with drawers for clothes.,4,2018,11,01
113,Amazing Stay in The Kensington,"Friendly, helpful and professional staff. We had a wonderful experience in The Kensington during our short stay in London. Interior decoration is exquisite ... gives you a cozy sensation while maintaining a classy appearance. Highly recommended! :)  ",5,2018,10,31
113,First stay in Kensington,"This was our first stay in the quiet and beautiful Victorian South Kensington neighborhood of London.  Walking in this neighborhood is simply dreamy.  The South Kensington Underground stop is a very short walk so every site in London is simple to get to.  We had a first floor Luxury Room that was very nice with a spacious bathroom.  What we loved most about this hotel was it's boutique, homey feel and fabulous lobby area, filled with cozy fireplaces and intimate seating areas.  The morning breakfast was excellent and all you could ever want included with our room rate.  Delightful!!",5,2018,10,29
113,"Reasonably priced in light of the facility, service and location","Reasonably priced in light of the facility, service and locationBuzzing restaurants, seemed to be quite a scene in a positive sense5 minutes walk to South Kensington tube station and on a major bus route to Knightsbridge, Mayfair, Piccadilly. So museums, shopping and WestEnd are within easy reach.",5,2018,10,29
113,I will return!,"The staff at the hotel is amazing, extremely nice and polite. My room was even bigger than I expected it to be. Great location, the train is just a 2-3 minute walk. The afternoon tea was also extremely cute and tasty. The room service food however could be improved. I ordered twice and didn't enjoy the food. Other than that, great hotel.",5,2018,10,25
113,Comfort,"We arrived to find our reservation had been canceled, however; they quickly sorted this problem and got us into a room as quickly as possible. I was grateful for this as I was not feeling well at all. They were very caring, sending tea to our room for me on two occasions along with a note wishing a swift recovery. This person touch was much appreciated. I wasn't able to eat much but what I did was good. They staff was wonderful and the location was great in terms of easy access to the tube and museums within walking distance. I would definitely stay again.",5,2018,10,24
113,Perfect Weekend Stay!,"Stayed last weekend with my wife and daughter.  Absolutely brilliant.  Lovely Room, Great Staff, Beautiful and Grand Communal Spaces, Restaurant & Reception.  And they made our 8 year old daughter feel wonderful on her birthday.  I could not suggest any improvement! Well Done!",5,2018,10,24
113,Wonderful Hotel,"This hotel is beautiful!  The staff are so helpful and friendly, the food service (and juice bar) are excellent!  It is a 5 minute walk to the underground, but on a quiet street.  The location was perfect and within walking distance of the park, shops, restaurants, etc.  The amenities are superb.  ",5,2018,10,23
113,Tranquility in Kensington,"This is a very well run hotel with attentive, polite and helpful staff.  Great location for Royal Albert Hall, museums etc.  As others reviewers have stated, the rooms tend to be small but are totally adequate for a short stay (without too much luggage!).  The public areas are lovely.  A very welcoming and calm place to stay.",5,2018,10,21
113,Continues to tick the boxes ,"Nice return visit, nice room upgrade. Been at home with this location since ‚Äò92.  A lot of restaurant turnover in South Ken, but still a super convenient base.  Staff on top of their game-friendly but professional. ",5,2018,10,20
113,A beautiful hotel with fantastic service,"We stayed at The Kensington last weekend to celebrate a birthday. As soon as we walked in the service was flawless and this continued until we departed. A special thank you to Carlos, duty manager, who met all of our needs and made our stay truly unique with his personal yet professional attitude. 

The communal area and bar were particularly special, with its open fireplace, beautiful decor and great atmosphere. The location is perfect, right in the heart of South Kensington and only a 3 minute walk to the tube station.

We highly recommend staying at his hotel and would like to thank all staff for making our stay truly unforgettable.",5,2018,10,20
113,Stay at the Kensington ,"We had a fantastic stay here from start to finish. Celebrating our wedding anniversary, we were spoilt! The hotel is stunning and the staff very friendly and attentive. We will most certainly be returning!",5,2018,10,20
113,First time in London,"I was looking for different areas or hotels to stay at during my first solo visit to London. I decided to book my 5 day stay at The Kensington, because of the location (it is in a very nice neighhborhood) and being so close to museums and Kensigton Palace. Also it was easy to get to the underground as the South Kensigton station is a few minutes away. I liked the warmth of the hotel. It feels like you are in this grand classic townhouse with a very fancy an homey feel. All of the staff is very friendly and cordial. The rooms are a little small but that is expected in big cities. The room was clean and bed very comfortable. I love that they have turn-down service and fluff your bed before bedtime. Also a plus the room has a nespresso machine.  ",5,2018,10,19
113,Just AMAZING!,"It was a birthday gift for my mother and it was just wonderful! From the check in where Carlos greeted us politely and explained everything about the hotel, to the delicious breakfast where John was always very sociable to the cocktails at the bar. The bellmen were very well mannered too and knew the surrounding well. Everyone was just extremely polite! The location was also perfect - very safe and easy location to reach. Definitely would recommend this hotel!",5,2018,10,19
113,Wonderful hotel,Third visit to this lovely hotel in the heart of Kensington. Service exceptional. Always a welcoming at home experience. Ideal location for Royal Albert Hall. Victoria & Albert Musuem and excellent shopping.,5,2018,10,18
113,A nice place to lay your head,"This was a very nice hotel.   The rooms were quite small and the lighting could be better but the overall experience was quite nice.   I liked the common areas more than the rooms.  Staff was great, beds comfy.   Breakfast was included and was very good.   ",4,2018,10,17
113,Elegant hotel in perfect location,"This was our 5th trip to London, and I wanted a Kensington hotel, specifically one within easy walking distance to the South Kensington Underground station (which serves the District and Circle lines, and the Piccadilly lines, which together get you pretty much everywhere you need to go).  The Kensington Hotel is a 5-minute walk to the station, along a street lined with restaurants.  The Hotel also is about a 10-minute walk from the Natural History Museum, the Victoria & Albert Museum, and the Brompton Oratory (if you want to attend Mass).  The Hotel is an elegant accommodation, with exceptionally friendly and helpful staff.  Our room was small but very comfortable.  The bathroom was somewhat tight, particularly the shower, but, again sufficient.  (The low water pressure and soft water made rinsing clean a challenge, but this is a problem not unique to this London hotel.)  The Hotel restaurant has excellent food.  Any wine on the list can be ordered by the glass (for 25% of the bottle price).  The bar is very nicely appointed, with the best bourbon selection I found on our 12-day trip to England.  Definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2018,10,14
113,"A lovely, tranquil hotel in well-situated S. Kensington","We stayed at the Kensington last week for four nights and were delighted by it all-around.  It is perfected situated with charming and plentiful restaurants and shops abounding.  It is a quick walk to the Metro stop and onward toward Knightsbridge area. The V & A are very nearby, too.  
The hotel staff was consistently kind, gracious and helpful in every way.  It was very busy but this did not deter from the peaceful ambience nor the service.  The common areas are attractively British with many cozy spots to take tea, cocktails or a meal. The rooms were well furnished, very comfortable, quiet and had excellent bedding and lighting.  Likewise,the bathrooms, while small, were very well equipped and had excellent showers. There was a decided generosity to the whole establishment.  I would definitely recommend and return myself.",5,2018,10,14
113,"Class place , well situated","This is  like what Doyle Hotels used to be like. You can see the influence if you look carefully at their attention to detail. The staff are very friendly , helpful and courteous. I have no hesitation in recommending the hotel.",5,2018,10,12
113,Lovely hotel near South Kensington tube station.,"Lovely hotel near South Kensington tube station.  Room was small but well appointed, staff was great and the common sitting and dining areas on the 1st floor were charming, comfortable & very British!  Food was very good too.",4,2018,10,11
113,"Stylish, comfortable ambiance -- inside and out.","The hotel‚Äôs townhouse architecture fits wonderfully into the surrounding residential area.  It‚Äôs a pleasant walk to Kensington Palace, Hyde Park, the ‚ÄúAlbertopolis‚Äù museum district and upscale shopping.  The hotel‚Äôs surrounding South Kensington neighborhood offers hidden charms and amenities in all directions, especially in the Holland Park area.

With two exceptions, the staff was warm, welcoming, helpful and professional from the moment our taxi arrived at the hotel.  Special kudos to the front desk, concierge, and bowler-hatted doorman.  Somewhat the opposite was the ma√Ætre d‚Äô who reigned over the breakfast service.  He seemed overly pretentious at times, sometimes to the point of haughtiness ‚Äì perhaps not the best personality for a high-profile, customer-service position within the hotel.  Also, we faced ongoing issues with housekeeping‚Äôs failure to keep us supplied with basic bath linens.

The food and drink elements of The Kensington were excellent.  Breakfast options were plentiful.  The surroundings were peaceful. Service was attentive.  The sedate, wood-paneled bar has to be one of the coziest in London.   The elegant, sumptuous afternoon tea is an experience not to be missed.

The interior design of the hotel was stylish and beautifully maintained.  We knew in advance that our accommodations, a so-called ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù room with a queen-sized bed, would be smaller than rooms in most American hotels.  Make no mistake, though, this room and bathroom were cramped for two people.  I do not recommend it for a multi-day stay.",4,2018,10,09
113,Great location in South Kensington,"This is a great little hotel in the heart of South Kensington. I highly recommend it. It is close to the South Kensington station, a quick cab ride to Harrod's. Walking distance to four museums including the Victoria and Albert Museum. What a pleasant place to stay while in London.",5,2018,10,09
113,Excellent Hotel,"My stay at the Kensington exceeded my expectations. The hotel itself is beautiful - I spent most of my time sitting by the fire downstairs reading a book and drinking tea. As a frequent traveler, this hotel truly made me feel the comforts of home.  The staff is exceptional - so incredibly nice and helpful. I can't wait to return. ",5,2018,10,09
113,Exceptional!,"This hotel delivers on all levels: 

- Exceptional personalized service;
- Much better than average cleanliness;
- Very comfortable rooms;
- Very comfortable bed and linens;
- Great location - quiet yet convenient location;
- Turn down service includes a thermos of hot water and a tea press - very nice touch;
- Bar and restaurant are also excellent!

The reception, concierge and doormen were all very helpful and conscientious! Exceptional personalized service on all levels!

No complaints - which for me is rare!  Will be staying here on next visit to London.",5,2018,10,08
113,Excellent stay,"I stayed here with my daughter for the weekend & it was certainly the best hotel we have visited in London. Everything was great from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. The staff were wonderful, very friendly & obliging, all going the extra mile to see you are looked after whilst you are there. The public rooms are wonderfully appointed & the bedroom & bathrooms very nice too with comfortable beds, quality bedlinen, tea & coffee making facilities & large modern television. Breakfast was exceptional, the choice was expansive & everything delicious. We couldn‚Äôt fault the hotel in anyway & will return. Thank you The Kensington, you‚Äôre doing a great job! ",5,2018,10,08
113,Wonderful experience!,"Charming, friendly, clean, and quiet - and ideally located in beautiful Kensington! Off the beaten path, and yet within easy walking distance of major museums (Victoria & Albert), shops (Harrods, among many others), Hyde Park and South Kensington tube station.
We started planning a return visit on our way to the airport!",5,2018,10,07
113,"Little, but lovely","Stayed here for a quick fun trip. Front desk staff was fantastic, doormen were responsive once they realized I was a guest. Room was well appointed, but as most city hotels, it was small. Also, I really wish hotels would spring for doors to their showers, I hate when the whole bathroom takes a shower with you. ",5,2018,10,07
113,Tale as Old as Time,"Absolutely super time spent at this afternoon tea! Such good fun! Fantastic theme! Delicious food! The best service too - friendly, funny, excitable, professional, made a good day an absolutely brilliant day! Especially Dan! ",5,2018,10,05
113,"Great location, charming hotel","The Kensington occupies a wonderful location in London, easily accessible by bus and underground. It's also very easy to walk places, like the nearby V&A and Natural History museums.  The staff is warm, and the rooms clean. My only compliant would be that the heating/cooling system is so energy efficient that it shuts off constantly and as I result, I simply gave up and had my windows open the whole time, despite the attempts of housekeeping to help me.  Also, I like that the hotel is attempting to be green, but where was the recycling container in my room then?",4,2018,10,05
113,Heaven on earth,"Just the best hotel you can find in London!!
The staff is friendly and approchable, the food is to die for, my favorite was the seasonal risotto, the suites are spacious and comfortable.
Will definitely come back!!!",5,2018,10,05
113,weekend,"I spend a weekend in London. This place made me feel welcome. The environment is as british as it gets. Well - I am not british, but I believe this is it. I love to visit stately homes in the country. This place feels a bit like it.",4,2018,10,03
113,First visit to london,"This was recommended by a friend. My wife and I enjoy a five star experience without stuffiness or pretention. This fit the bill.It was beautiful, well located, and wonderfully staffed. A short walk to the tube, Kensington Gardens, or Hyde Park. The food was excellent. Overall it was a great experience.",5,2018,10,02
113,great location,"what a great location... spent a long weekend for a girls weekend, great breakfast and super close to tube... plenty of shopping in the area, great local pubs and the energy in Kensington is amazing... so glad we stayed in this party of London",5,2018,10,02
113,Amazing experience with the Events Team,"We had to put together a very special event requiring a lot of attention to detail. Had an amazing experience working with the team, led by the manager Ben. Not only was the venue beautiful (classic with a modern touch) but the team was great at troubleshooting issues and making sure that everything was in order. We received very positive feedback from all the participants and we would be happy to work with the team again for future events. We were especially impressed by Ben who remained calm and was always helpful in finding solutions for us. Thank you for helping us organise the event!",5,2018,10,02
113,Perfect location,"Loved the location of this hotel in South Kensington. Close to the Metro stop and more importantly close to a fabulous Italian restaurant around the corner...Macellaio. May need reservations depending on the night but definitely worth it. Don‚Äôt pass up on the bone marrow with pomegranate seeds. Daniel was an awesome host for us...aged meat made to perfection. There‚Äôs also a wonderful gelato place nearby for after dinner. 

Stick to the great breakfast/brunch on Sunday at the hotel (nice selection and they also have freshly made juices daily = huge plus for me) or go around the corner on Old Brompton road (before Macellaio) to the French cafe for fresh and quite delicious brioches.  In love with them!! 

Room was on the small side but overall happy with hotel and room. You can also catch ‚ÄúTop of the Pops‚Äù on TV late night for some fun flashbacks to the 80‚Äôs. ",4,2018,10,01
113,Home in London,"I love this hotel , it has such a warm friendly atmosphere. The staff throughout the hotel are efficient, professional and welcoming.

A beautiful hotel, very charming 
Recommended",5,2018,09,26
113,Fabulous intro to London's finer things,"The Kensington was the last stop on our honeymoon tour of France and the UK, and it did not disappoint! Greeted with a warm towel at reception to wipe our travel-weary hands, quality service began at the curbside and did not stop until we left four days later. Rooms were a good size for an urban hotel, and we were even greeted with a complementary bottle of Prosecco, courtesy of the thoughtful and responsive staff.",5,2018,09,26
113,Good place to stay outside of central London,"This was our second trip to London so we chose to stay outside of central London. We chose Kensington because it seemed like a nice area. The Kensington just seemed like the natural place to stay. 

It was a good choice. Nice but small room. It is London after all. Convenient location. Friendly staff. I would recommend it to others.",4,2018,09,22
113,A great Hotel with a comfortable room,"Stayed here in the summer with my Husband and my 4 years old daughter.

113,Old world charm and great service,"We were greeted by friendly and knowledgeable staff and escorted to a well appointed junior suite.  I had previously called the concierge to make a restaurant reservation. I had asked for a fun place with great food.  The concierge had made a reservation at Lucio, a lovely Italian restaurant within a five minute walk. We celebrated our 25th anniversary with Champaign, a terrific Amarone and exceptional food. 

We hVe loved everything about the Kensington Hotel",5,2018,09,12
113,One of the best accommodation experience we've had,"I've booked the hotel for my wife birthday. She was pregnant and I wanted to give her some quiet comfort time (as we have 2 years old at home). I've written this in the comments to the website when finishing the reservation. From the moment my wife came into the hotel, the staff did everything they can to assist her, and they responded to any comments or ask I had. They thought she is coming with our 2-year-old son and left a teddy bear present for him which he loves. the bed was very comfortable and the bath with TV was the perfect facility for her to properly relax. It's so much feeling someone cares for you to this level and makes sure you have the best of your time and quality for the money you spend. I can't recommend enough this hotel.",5,2018,09,12
113,Stunning Hotel with Great Service,"We stayed for one night at the end of a long holiday around Europe on our way back to Australia. We loved the hotel interiors and the location is very central. Walking distance to the Tube to meet others for dinner. The hotel itself is styled beautifully, the rooms are tastefully decorated. Carlos, the hotel manager was lovely, he attended to all of our needs and was very caring and understanding. He really made our stay enjoyable. I would stay here again and will recommend to all my friends.",5,2018,09,12
113,I am sure I will be back there,"My first impression was not that good as the room I saw was quite narrow, dark and - with no real daily light (there were two very tiny windows with blurred glass). As I planned to stay 3 nights I asked the reception to change it. They showed me 3 different ones to decide: the one I took was small (literally had to jump over my bed to get to my closet:-) BUT never mind, the room was super cosy, very light, clean and my bed comfy. I have to admit that the customer service was amazing for the entire stay, very, very pleasant. There was also an umbrella in the room for guests to be used. The location is convenient - 5 minutes walking distance from the South Kensington tube station. Lovely restaurants nearby but the one in the hotel is also really good. I do recommend this hotel and definitely will be back there.",4,2018,09,11
113,Celebration of our 50th Wedding Anniversary.,"We were delighted we chose The Kensington Hotel to celebrate our 50th Wedding Anniversary weekend starting 1st September. As on the 2nd September 1968 I left this Hotel then know as the Onslow Court Hotel to get married in St Augustine's Church near by. So a lot of memories. The Kensington is lovely and  the service amazing when we wanted a larger room! it was sorted immediately by Duty Manager Veruska Cimino she helped us settle in and made us so welcome, with a lovely bottle of Champers! and chocolate strawberries to celebrate our anniversary!  All the staff were so helpful and friendly, the food was lovely we had an evening meal in the Lounge as there was a party in the restaurant, which wasn't great as the lighting was very poor! Breakfast was great and plenty of it. Recommend it as it is really a  superb hotel and hope one day to visit it again.",5,2018,09,11
113,Best hotel experience I have ever had,"This was not the most expensive hotel or the most luxurious hotel I have ever stayed in, but it was the BEST hotel experience I have ever had in my life. Period. The staff was AH-MAZING. Hands down amazing. The front desk person who checked us in with hot towels and a shot of beetroot juice was so accommodating and so understanding of the long travel day we had had. The porter, the doormen, the waiters, the bartenders, housekeeping, the person who checked us out -- everyone was amazingly marvelous. No detail was overlooked with the staff. The hotel itself is gorgeous; I loved the bar and the lounges and drawing rooms. We were even able to invite friends over for drinks one night near the fireplace and the service, the wine, and the bar bites were just spectacular.  Every morning, we would leave the hotel and the everyone would greet us with a smile. The rooms were beautiful. We got upgraded to a suite. The beds were comfortable, the sheets were soft, the pillows were substantial. Turndown service was great, too. My only complaint about the room was that the light over the sink in the bathroom was dark, so it was hard to put on makeup under such a dark light, and our view from the room was disappointing. But the hair dryer had a concentrator attachment, and the towels and bathrobes were soft and fluffy. The location was key; we were 5 minutes from the tube and a few steps away from really fun restaurants and pubs and Kensington Gardens. We ate in the townhouse two out of the 5 nights we were there and that was just awesome. Excellent cocktails, excellent wine choices. I cannot say enough about the staff and the service. Top notch, friendly, super accommodating. The only reason I may not be back is because I may want to experience another borough in London on our next trip, but this hotel will be hard to resist for our next time in London. Thank you, Kensington Hotel, for making our 5 nights in London one of the the best vacations we have ever had.",5,2018,09,06
113,Annual stay at the Kensington,"The Kensington is our perfect home away from home, for our annual trip from Hong Kong to visit our daughter's family and we have stayed there on many occasions since 2011. It's location is ideal  with only a short walk to the various museums and South Kensington underground station. The hotel is a classy gem situated just away from the busy section of Old Brompton Road. I find the ambience very relaxed and welcoming, being immediately recognized and greeted by the front door staff upon arrival. It's not at all 'stiff' like many other top hotels as personally I prefer a casual and laid back atmosphere when on holiday. The restaurant serves an excellent breakfast and afternoon tea and staff provided impeccable service even at the busiest of times. Needless to say we had an extremely enjoyable stay - as usual. This is a hotel we would visit again and again. ",5,2018,09,06
113,Warm and welcoming every time you step in the front door,"Great location, tasty cocktails, lots of choice in the breakfast buffet/ menu, delicious dinner, well appointed gym and an amazing location in South Kensington. We have stayed with the Doyle chain in Dublin which was also a great experience. We had a few problems with our shower but the staff went out of their way to accommodate us and ensure we had a great experience. Would highly recommend.",5,2018,09,03
113,Amazing boutique hotel close to South Kensington tube station,"This was my first - and definitely not last - stay at this Doyle Hotels property. It was perfect from check-in to check-out. The staff are amazing, the room was comfortable and the Nespresso machine in the closet was a nice touch, as were the selection of teas. The aromatherapy toiletries provided are lovely. My bed was comfortable, TV channel selection was limited (lots of football and buy real estate in Spain channels if you like that sort of thing), as was space if you used the room for working. I enjoyed the staff, the bar and the neighbourhood. I will definitely book into The Kensington the next time I am in London!",5,2018,09,03
113,Lovely weekend stay,"We stayed here for our 10th wedding anniversary, and it was a lovely stay.  The hotel is in a great location in a nice neighborhood, and the room, though small as all London hotel rooms are, was clean and pretty.  The service is excellent as well (I was wondering if they might do something special for our anniversary, but they didn't, but that's fine).  highly recommend this hotel!",5,2018,09,03
113,Beauty and the beast afternoon tea.,A real must to visit the whole experience from start to finish was excellent Barbra and Thomas were so friendly and made the whole thing enjoyable nothing was to much trouble the food was tasty and well thought about with attention to detail . Beauty and the beast theme ran through the whole tea.,5,2018,09,02
113,Beauty &the beast afternoon tea ,I had a lovely afternoon tea with my daughter it was magical and the food was delicious. The staff were lovely and we even had a song from Thomas the waiter I would definitely recommend this to any Disney fans or to anyone wanting a lovely day out in beautiful surroundings.,5,2018,09,02
113,Very Good Hotel + Excellent Service,"We're a family of 4, and this was our 2nd time staying at the Kensington. From the moment we arrived, the staff did an excellent job of making us feel special. Specifically: they upgraded our family room to be 2 adjoining rooms with a private, connecting hallway. And they left treats and books in the room for our kids. 

The location of the hotel couldn't be better. It's in the middle of one of the most charming neighborhoods in London - and it's just steps from the South Kensington tube station.

The only thing keeping us from giving the highest marks is that the rooms and bathrooms are a bit tired and in need of modernization.",4,2018,09,01
113,Excellent response to problems,"Warm welcome, great location, excellent service, wonderful breakfast and they make a mean Gin & Tonic. Management was incredibly responsive to a few problems we had with our room. We would definitely stay there again.",5,2018,08,29
113,Amazing hotel,"Stayed at The Kensington Hotel for 4 days. It is a wonderful hotel with excellent service and very comfortable room. Beds are great and room is well appointed. Location is wonderful...close to Victoria & Albert Museum and Natural History Museum, Kensington Palace, Harrods and lots of restaurants. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Highly recommend b",5,2018,08,29
113,A tale as old as time afternoon tea.,"My friend Nicky and I went to the Kensington for the popular ‚Äú A tale as Old as time afternoon tea‚Äù. 
What a treat. I have had many afternoon teas , but this was superb. 
We were seated at our table in what appeared to be a library in the most comfortable chairs with cushions. 
Our hosts were forever attentive and gave us full explanation as to what each food item represented. We had luminere and cogsworth join us on the table. 
The starters were beautiful. Lovely and warm straight from the oven. The plate gracefully decorated with 2 rose petals. 
The sandwiches we‚Äôre scrumptious, we were offered more but we were eager to save room for the brioche and the cakes. 
The brioche were served warm with a choice of jam and chocolate. They were lovely. 
I thoroughly enjoyed the jelly ( with an edible rose petal ), try the grey stuff ( gorgeous mousse ) , in fact everything was lovely. The flavours were superb. 
It all looked too good to eat. It was a beautiful afternoon tea. 
It was made more enjoyable by the ever attentive hosts , especially Thomas  , who provided my friend with an umbrella as it was raining and she didn‚Äôt have a coat. 
He also gave me some lovely postcards to give to a sick child I ve been looking after on the ward I work ( she was thrilled with them ). 
The whole experience was just wonderful. I would recommend anyone to visit. It‚Äôs a day I will never forget.",5,2018,08,29
113,Last Minute Booking,"We stayed here as a bit of an accident, thanks to a mishap with another booking and a rather funny story. 

We rang to book with the hotel directly and informed them that we'd be arriving in a matter of 10 minutes, but didn't mind waiting in the bar for the room to be ready. Upon arrival, we were greeted by some lovely staff who giggled at our story and had very kindly upgraded our booking. 

The hotel is beautiful, clean and modern and is on the door step of the Natural History Museum and many restaurants. 

Will definitely be staying here again on a future booking to London.

They even have a smoothie bar, which was a perfect pick me up when leaving with a bit of a fuzzy head for our train.",5,2018,08,28
113,"4 Days and 3 Nights in the London, Kenington Hotel","My wife and I just completed a 5 city tour for our 25th Anniversary. The last leg of our your was London and we stayed at the Kensington Hotel. First, the hotel is situated in fashionable South Kenisngton which has nice shops and many different restaurants. The best part is that the area is not overcrowed as much of London's tourist areas are.Upon arriving, we were greeted on the sidewalk and our bags were brought in the Front Lobby. At check-in, first we were given herbally fragrant steamed wash cloths. This was very welcome after a day of travel. Check-in was easy and complete in about 3-5 minutes.The Main Lobby of the Kensington is absolutely beautiful in an understated mannor. The Lobby serves as a gathering point for guests, as a place to have drinks, a light bite to eat, quiet conversation or just a place to read and research your upcoming day... it is wonderful.The Hotel's Bar and Restaurant both work off of the Main Lobby, however, they are distinctly defined and are complete entities within themselves. You may go to the restaurant and be seated and not be aware of any goings-on in the Main Lobby. The decor in the restaurant is especially beautiful and picturesque in a soft contemporary setting. One of the most captivating pictures taken on our trip was in the restaurant. The Bar is very friendly and serves multiple purposes. In the evening quite frequently people are buying drinks at the Bar and sitting in the Main Lobby. We passed by the Bar after 9:00pm and there were perhaps half a dozen people there at that moment.  In the mornings, the Bar serves as the buffet area for the restaurant. A very elegantly laid out series of breakfast foods. We ordered omelettes and then went to the buffet and helped ourselves to wonderful breads, cured fish, muesli and fresh fruit. There was many other offerings too.Our room was fresh, smelled good upon entering and is very well though out and convenient. The shower is wonderful! The in room coffee was good...surprise. If we have one request of improvement it would be the Wifi, it was a little slow.Overall, this is an amazing hotel with great staff in a good location!",5,2018,08,28
113,Wedding celebration with my daughters.,"As my eldest daughter is getting married in a week's time we decided we would visit The Kensington for their famous ""Tale As Old As Time "" afternoon tea to celebrate. It was a cold ,rainy day but from the moment we arrived in our taxi ,had the door of the taxi opened for us and were very politely greeted and ushered through the door we felt  welcomed and at home. I cannot fault any of the staff who attended us.All were natural,smiling and helpful. We took our seats in a beautiful ,small restaurant that had a blazing fire. The table was laid with a spotless ,white linen tablecloth and was laid out with an attractive tea service and cutlery. My own personal bugbear was the bowl of  sugar cubes,which inevitably disintegrate in the dish if exposed to the air .I know wrapped sugar cubes or even a fresh bowl would be more acceptable but this is a tiny criticism in what was a superb tea. We were attended by staff who were attentive but not intrusive.The theme of Beauty and the Beast was present in the form of sweet character figures and in the food offered. We opted for two vegan options and two vegetarian options. I can only say it was the best vegan and vegetarian tea we have experienced and we so appreciated the effort put in to fulfil our requirements.Thank you everyone for making a family celebration so special and my daughter was delighted with the congratulations offered by the staff,who appeared generally interested in her. We loved our visit so much we determined, in the future, we will make The Kensington our place to visit and stay when we come to London for a longer visit . Well done and thank you to everyone involved. If I had the option of more stars I certainly would have awarded more!",5,2018,08,26
113,Birthday visit:Tale as Old as Time Afternoon Tea.,"Wow wow wow.
This whole experience will
definitely be 1 to remember.
 Myself and friends  attended The Kensington for the beauty and the beast themed afternoon tea with friends for my birthday.
Upon entering the hotel we were highly welcomed by the attentive staff and shown directly to where we needed to go for our afternoon tea.
All staff acknowledged us and were extremely helpful gathering coats etc.
We were shown to a cosy hideaway under the stairs with beautiful leather seats and a roaring fire.
After a few minutes wait we were shown to our table.
A waitress came over and asked if we we were all having the afternoon tea and what tea we would like.
We did also add on alcoholic drinks,champagne and cocktails.
Our teas were offered to come out  afternoon tea which we preferred and shortly after starters appeared aptly fitted with the theme of the tea and confidently explained by the staff the meaning behind each 1.
We were shortly served the main event carefully capturing certain aspects of the film and all were very cleverly done.
On the table upon entering were keepsake postcards and a 'belle dress biscuit'-highly welcoming and wonderful.
All food and service could not be faulted and the etiquette and ambiance of the hotel is truly spectacular.
I do hope to return to such a fabulous beautiful hotel.
Thank you Kensington x",5,2018,08,25
113,Great Hotel in a good location ,"I quit writing reviews because of very busy days in recent years. But I should write this review for this beautiful, perfect hotel. We spent 4 days there with my 11 year old son and we enjoyed every moment. 
Check in was fast and smooth. Room, though a little small wasl clean and nicely decorated with a more than comfortable bed. I‚Äôm a hard sleeper but I enjoyed sleeping on that perfect bed. 
Breakfast was good. I tried everything in egg menu and all were perfect. 
All staff were welcoming, professional and helpful. I‚Äôve never seen this in Europe hotels before. 
Thank you everyone for your efforts and thank you Gdiv (hope remember and spell it right) for helping us leaving hotel smoothly and thanks for great photos. ",5,2018,08,25
113,Afternoon Tea- wonderful ,"The ‚ÄòBeauty and the Beast‚Äô afternoon tea is absolutely brilliant. Themed on the Disney film it is a triumph of cooking and creativity.

Not just that, but the staff are excellent. Their enthusiasm and professionalism may be required by the hotel but it comes across as natural and real.

Make sure you ask for lots of hot water because the tea can get very strong if left in pot. Sandwiches, brioches and cakes all top draw.

To quote from the film ‚Äòtry the grey stuff it‚Äôs delicious.‚Äô",5,2018,08,25
113,Warm and inviting. Great service,From top to bottom I enjoyed my 5 night business stay at the Kensington.  It was so nice and quiet inside. Charming decor. Staff is very pleasant and attentive. Loved the breakfast and unhurried atmosphere and every morning the newspaper of my choice was hanging on my door. The bar is also very nice with comfortable seatings.  They even had some musicians playing softly by the entrance and had charming seats out front on the sort of porch like front entrance. The only negative was small room and no drawers at all. Just closet with hangers. ,5,2018,08,24
113,Visit with a 4 year old,"First off, staff: we were welcomed very professionally (to me) and very friendly (to my son). A perfect balance which we both appreciated.
The team during the whole visit were fantastic. The little extras for my son really made the difference (presents)!
 
The hotel is nice downstairs, our room was ok. I say only ok, because you can hear people walking in the room above. I put on a noise simulator of rain sound to drown it out, so we could both sleep soundly. And also the sink didn‚Äôt drain (hotel team fixed this on the first morning, after I alerted them to the issue). 
 
All that being said regarding the room, I still rate the hotel strongly and staff deserve gold stars.

Location is fantastic for the museums and a good amount of generic places to eat which are good for children.

Cost of room is worth it in my opinion.",5,2018,08,24
113,A very pleasant stay,"We spent 6 nights here. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. The bar, lounge, and restaurant are elegant and understated with responsive service, although things take a while because they are made to order. The basic rooms are small by modern standards and we upgraded to a larger one that was very satisfactory.",4,2018,08,23
113,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed at the Kensington for a family trip to London . A really lovely Hotel. superb location, staff and great with children, would definately stay again Stayed in the family room and it was perfect for four of us ",5,2018,08,22
113,Tale as old as time afternoon tea just perfect and the hotel staff wonderful,"We saw this advertised last year and fully booked, we managed to arrange to go on Friday 17th Aug.
It is ¬£42 a person but well worth the treat, thst staff work  hard to make it a fun time and tell you the stories behind the reasons for the cakes etc really creative!
You can have as many sandwiches as you want. Anything left they kindly give you a beautiful box to take home. Our waiter akmul was just lovely.
We stayed for a drink in the bar and alexander just went the extra mile and made us feel extremely welcome. I would recommend the afternoon tea and the bar and great location for the hotel too, immaculate ! Thank you for making us feel so very welcome",5,2018,08,22
113,Great afternoon tea,"They do a great job with afternoon tea. They go with a theme, the current one is Beauty & the Beast. If you haven't seen the movie, it won't make much sense but they tie in all the food to that theme. They do a great job of explaining what you are eating and the staff is incredibly attentive. The room and hotel is classic and elegant. There is a lot of food so be sure you come hungry. We split 2 orders for 4 people and didn't finish everything as we weren't particularly hungry. It's not cheap, close to ¬£50 per person but you are there as much for the food and tea as the experience. They work hard to deliver an excellent experience along with the excellent food. Book in advance as you likely can't just walk in because it's so popular.",4,2018,08,21
113,Pre dinner drinks!,"My wife arranged a surprise 40th in Kensington for me and as we had our 1st date here we decided to venture in.

The bar is beautiful and the drinks list is very good. the staff excell and i can honestly say we enjoyed another visit to this lovely hotel.",5,2018,08,18

113,Beautiful Hotel & Location !!,The Kensington Hotel was a wonderful choice for our honeymoon stop in London. The hotel is centrally located in trendy South Kensington area of London... We loved the restaurants and boutiques nearby for dinner and shopping also the hotel is around the corner from the subway (Tube) station very easy access to the train station to get out and see this beautiful city. The hotel staff was very accommodating especially the doorman - Martins and Curtis is awesome also !! The breakfast is very good and the staff in the restaurant were so courteous and accommodating !! I also had cocktails in the bar one evening and really enjoyed my cocktail the mixologist  put together for me ... I can't recall his name but I know he was from Italy ... such a courteous and friendly bartender and he could really mix a drink !! Our stay at the Kensington was AWESOME !! Also the Doorman Martins helped us get a cab on our last day as we were heading to the train station to get the Euro Star to Paris ... our pre arranged car was running late and Martins tried calling them for us and then got a cab just in time to get us to the station on time !! KUDOS to your staff especially the Doorman !!,5,2018,08,15

Close to public transport",5,2018,08,15
113,WONDERFUL HOTEL,"Have stayed in London several times and this was first in luxury category. My friend and I LOVED it. Yes, the room was not huge, but was quite sufficient for 2 women with lots of luggage, and nicely appointed.
The people there were SO nice and accommodating. The doormen were so good about directions and recommendations, the front desk staff was the best, housekeeping took good care of our room (even knocking on our door as leaving for the day to make sure all was well with our room), and the breakfast dining room staff was excellent,and especially Thomas, the Maitre d, was really special and took the time to give us a history of the house that became the Kensington. Also, we felt the breakfasts there were our best meal every day.
Will be our first choice for a London hotel. ",5,2018,08,15
113,Welcoming and Comfortable!,"The Kensington Hotel provides a first class hotel experience at a reasonable rate. We were made to feel welcome as soon as we walked in the door, with the staff providing bottles of water and fresh juice for us on a hot day in London.

113,Great place,We Travled all night from Los Angeles appeared to know that we would need some down time.  They got us into our room 3 hours before check in.

We highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to visit London. It is in a really nice area of South Kensington close to shops, restaurants and the Underground. ",5,2018,08,14
113,Great time at the Kensington Hotel,We stayed at the Kensington Hotl from 7/29 through 8/4 and had a great time. The staff in all departments was amazing. Everytime we needed anything the response was quick and friendly. This was in all aspects from the front desk to the breakfast restaurant to room service to house keeping to the lobby crew. Everyone there was truly amazing which helped make our stay so great.,5,2018,08,13
113,Wonderful,"We stayed here for three nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We were in a superior room which was small as most london hotel rooms are, but comfortable and not cramped. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and the bathroom spacious. The staff were professional and pleasant, and assisted us with everything we needed. The location is ideal. It is the most charming part of the city: close to museums and Hyde Park. There is an underground station very close by. We had the breakfast our final morning there and immediately wished we had opted for it every morning. The food was wonderful and the decor and ambiance lovely. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable.  I won't stay anywhere else in London.",5,2018,08,12
113,Truly exceptional 10/10,"I booked to stay at the Kensington as I had a meeting in the private dining area for 12 associates. The food was incredible and the waiter never let my wine glass get near empty (top man)

As it was the school holidays I brought my family along (wife & 2 x kids aged 3 & 8). They were thoroughly spoiled by the amazing staff and kept entertained. They were made to feel like the most important people in the world.

From the porter to the bar and reception staff, I cannot rate the friendliness and service any better.  Thank you for making our stay so nice. 

And Iv never slept so well (might of been the Wine) the family room was lovely.

Would highly recommend this beautiful venue for business and for families.

113,Excellent boutique hotel in South Kensington,"We spent five days in December and the hotel was an excellent option in this area of the city.
The atmosphere was wonderful and the Christmas decoration was very nice.
The only problem was the triple room at the first floor was very noisy with the AC machines working very close and we asked for moving to another triple one in a higher floor.
The breakfast was perfect and the service at the bar too!",4,2018,08,04
113,The Kensington ,"I have had the pleasure of staying at this hotel for the past 2 weeks. Perfectly situated in London‚Äôs South Kensington it makes travel around London very easy.

I highly recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to London.",5,2018,08,03
113,Class and comfort in the heart of Kensington,"We stayed two nights in the height of the English heatwave.  The Kensington was a very relaxing Oasis to return to with very welcoming staff, very comfortable rooms, a sophistication to all the public areas (but not over-bearing) and a fabulous location.  Drinks in the bar and dinner in the restaurant were of a high quality and served with similar aplomb.  Highly recommended and we will be back.",5,2018,08,03

I was traveling solo and had a very comfortable small room that managed to include a comfortable bed, a desk, and an easy chair.  Well-lighted and well-equipped bathroom.  The public areas are extremely attractive and inviting.  Breakfast, which was included in my room rate, was first-rate.

But the highlight for me was the friendly and accommodating staff, one of whom, Martyn Cope, a concierge, was extremely helpful when I left my phone in an Uber on the day I was flying back to the U.S.  He helped me contact Uber and very generously agreed to receive the phone from the Uber driver and send it back to me in the U.S.  He went above and beyond and I am very grateful for his sympathetic and kind help.  I would absolutely stay in this lovely hotel again.",5,2018,07,28
113,Great location,"I had a good stay here. The hotel was right near the tube, the park, and all the museums. Breakfast was really nice. My room was rather small, but quiet and clean. My only complaint is that I was in the room working and out the sign on the door not to disturb, and every single day that I was in there working, the maid just came in anyway. The sign was up for a reason.",4,2018,07,25
113,Beyond expectations,"The Kensington was everything I would have hoped for and more. Staff were very friendly and helpful from check-in to check-out. Location can't be beat between Gloucester and South Kensington picadilly lines. Room was spacious, clean and very comfortable. Bathroom met expectations. All in all, a very pleasant stay. ",5,2018,07,24
113,What a great spot to stay!,"The Kensington is a fabulous hotel. The living room atmosphere of the lobby is super comfortable, the staff is friendly and accommodating and the rooms, while small, are well appointed. The best thing about the Kensington is its' location. It's close to several museums, parks and a manageable walk to Buckingham palace. There are several great cafes and restaurants within a few minutes walk along with lots of interesting shops.",5,2018,07,24
113,"Fabulous retreat close to museums, restaurants, shops and the tube","My sister and I live on different continents and we chose The Kensington as a treat for ourselves while in London. We were looked after in the most solicitous way by every member of staff. The service throughout our stay was impeccable, from the doorman, the receptionists, the concierge, the service staff in the restaurants and those who looked after our rooms. The hotel is an oasis of understated elegance where you can relax in beautiful surroundings. The lovely quirky musical details outside the hotel set the tone for a stay out of the ordinary.

The hotel is within walking distance of significant museums, Harrods and South Kensington tube. We were given a complimentary three-hour walking tour called A Photographic Experience. What a wonderful way to get some exercise while exploring the local area. Our guide, Gail Spencer, is uniquely versed in amusing and interesting details of the area and of London and British life in general and three hours sped past.

My sister and I met up with some childhood friends at afternoon tea in the hotel. I try to have afternoon tea whenever I‚Äôm in London and the popular Tale as Old as Time afternoon tea is an absolute delight with unique features. 

All in all, kudos til everyone at the Kensington for making this a memorable reunion for my sister, our friends and me.",5,2018,07,23
113,"Very nice hotel, but rooms can be cramped","This is a very nice hotel in Kensington about a five minute walk from the South Kensington Tube station.  We took the tube from Heathrow in less than an hour for 5 pounds using our oyster card. 

There are a number of bakeries, cafes and restaurants in the immediate area.  This is a nice safe area and we took every opportunity to walk the neighborhood to go out for meals.

We booked a ""Superior Double Room"" using United Miles through their website.  This actually was a ""Classic Queen Room"" as described on the Kensington Website.  The good news was that the bed was upgraded to a very comfortable queen size.  The bad news was that the bed dominated the room and with two pieces of luggage, there wasn't much room left.  The bathroom is also small, and if you are above average in size, you will find it cramped.  Having said that, the room was in very good condition, and everything was spotlessly clean.  Air conditioning was quiet and efficient.  WIFI was fine and cable tv options were okay.

We arrived about 9:30 am and since I had emailed them our early arrival they were able to have a room available for us.

A couple of nitpicking items.

The TV remote did not turn the tv on and off.  It did work on other functions and we simply reported it as we checked out.

One afternoon we returned to the room after a hard day of sightseeing to find that the room had not been serviced.  A young lady who did not speak much English came by, but apparently not to make up the room.  We had some trouble communicating and just asked her for some fresh towels.  As we were going out for dinner, I stopped by the front desk to let them know that our room was never serviced.  While I was waiting, a young man (a trainee) asked if he could help us.  We told him that the room had not been cleaned and he said he would take care of it.  When we returned from dinner. the room had been cleaned.  Not sure why the room was not serviced to begin with, but both people we talked to were helpful in resolving the problem.

Our room averaged out at just under $400 per night.  This did not include breakfast.

The small size of the room and a couple of minor hiccups keep me from rating this five stars.  But it is a lovely hotel in a nice section of London, so I have no trouble in recommending it.",4,2018,07,19
113,My favorite hotel in London,"I try to stay at the Kensington on most trips to London. The rooms are small but comfortable, the location is excellent allowing me to walk everywhere, the staff is attentive and friendly. 

As a vegan, I highly recommend the juicery and dining at the restaurant. Bar is cosy, nice afternoon tea with vegan options, and the atmosphere around Christmas is magical.

Nice hotel for special occasions",5,2018,07,18
113,Best Location in London,"Classic English charm.  Be sure to book your room in advance as it is often fully booked. Some rooms are small but well equipped.  I especially liked the shower with fast hot water and strong flow,  a rare treat.   Excellent location.  Excellent breakfast.  Excellent staff and service.  The staff goes out of their way to make your stay enjoyable and memorable.",4,2018,07,18
113,Stop over in (best part of) London...,Super friendly staff. Great service. please do something about the Wi-Fi because this kind of slow at the moment otherwise everything is fine!!! Very clean and quite convenient to get around from the hotel. Very much recommended!!,5,2018,07,18
113,Wonderful hotel,"This is a gem. Top notch. From the staff to the amenities it is a pleasure to stay here. The location is excellent as you avoid the madness of main thoroughfares but are right by the museums and Harrods and great local restaurants, as well as a block walk to various tube lines for convenience.",5,2018,07,18
113,Very enjoyable,"The Kensington is a wonderful hotel with attentive, professional, and friendly staff. The location is great - close to the tube and with many fine restaurants within walking distance. Many five star amenities like welcome drink, turn-down service, free water and wifi, treat left on bed, concierge services, doorman, etc. You are treated politely and with respect by every staff member. The room is a bit small though, and at times you can hear neighbors above and next to your room, but I would certainly stay here again. I recommend The Kensington.",5,2018,07,17
113,"Wow, we loved it","I usually never put service first, but in this case I will say:  the service was impeccable from start to finish, from front desk to concierge to restaurant.  Brilliant!  The location is fabulous, just a short walk from the tube and also to the park and Kensington Palace, the V&A museum, Hyde Park, and other attractions.  Great food for breakfast and dinner both.  Lovely room, never heard a peep at night.  Beautiful bathroom.  Old world charm.  Can not say enough about this beautiful hotel.",5,2018,07,16
113,Elegant Old World Hotel with modern attitude,"We have enjoyed visiting the Kensington Hotel for many years. The staff are very friendly and helpful. One concierge, Ronnie, remembered our grandson's visit four years ago, and he and the other greeters made our young teen granddaughters feel very special. Excellent location for walking to South Kensington Underground, museums, shopping, parks, and lovely neighborhoods.
comfortable dining, tea rooms, and cozy parlors for reading.",5,2018,07,16
113,Very good pre theatre dinner,"Having been treated to tickets for the First Night of the Proms we needed somewhere to have dinner before the performance and decided to give The pre theatre dinner menu a try here.  A limited choice made it easy and the selection covered vegetarian dietary needs too.  Very attentive service without being obsequious whilst making sure we weren‚Äôt rushed either.
The set menu is good value, drinks on the expensive side but never the less not ridiculously over priced.
Very well appointed public areas mad for a thoroughly enjoyable start to the evening.",4,2018,07,15
113,Flash SW7 Hotel,"I stayed here as part of a Wimbledon package booked from Australia. Stayed three nights in Room 404. Original room they put me in was slightly bigger but this one had a street view, which was better. Room quite small, fine for me a a solo traveller but too small for more guests. Couldn‚Äôt work out the shower & flooded the bathroom each morning! Service was great, especially in the breakfast room, & also from trainee concierge, Curtis. The breakfast itself was superb. Shame about the overdressed, snooty English guests who sat near me.",4,2018,07,12
113,Beauty and the Beast Afternoon Tea,Took our family here for an excellent afternoon tea. Very good food and service. Catered for vegetarian and gluten free. Good location. Terrific surroundings. Very good and would re-visit. The theme was well carried out in the food. ,5,2018,07,11
113,Every disney girls dream - Worth every penny,"Booked a tale as old as time afternoon tea for a birthday treat. Annoyingly for me i had to change the date twice and the time and they were really sweet about it and didn't mind at all. 
Arrived 20 minutes early just due for once to traffic going our way and we walked through the hotel to the restaurant. 
Well isn't it very well done out in there, the bookcases with choice of reading matter was most interesting - did wonder if they change it though... could go back to find out!
We were shown to a table and offered an alternative if we wanted to sit elsewhere, no very happy thank you. A gent talked us through the procedures of our afternoon tea, so delightfully, he truly loves his job and is an asset to the team, for sure. If only i could remember his name and i thought i wrote it down. 
We were given a menu and chose some teas, and without really noticing they finished dressing our table with accessories of beauty and the beast. 
We ordered cocktails too and throughout the next two hours or so we were treated like royalty with one beautiful slim hostess and the gent. The food was sumptuous exquisitely presented, more sandwiches were offered and postcards for a reminder of the day were given. Huge compliments were given to the chef and his team and i cannot rate this hugly enough.
The only sour note was another waitress took our decorations (lumiere etc) for another table who had arrived even though there were other tables in before us, that was upsetting...teh chap kindly brought them back when i mentioned this.",5,2018,07,10
113,New Year's Eve at the Kensington,"Loved it!  Beautifully appointed, and a terrific bar.  We could walk basically everywhere we wanted to go, and we had great fun during the New Year's celebration - we could see the fireworks from our windows!  The staff were superb - could not have been more helpful or welcoming.  We would definitely return.",5,2018,07,10
113,Amazing family stay,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay as a family (with our 3 and 7 year old daughters).  The pre work put in by Georgiana and the team was second to none, with presents for the girls based on their likes. They absolutely loved the teepee in the room!

The room, along with everything else at the hotel was to a really high spec.  Highlights included the breakfast, amazingly comfortable beds, brilliant location for the v and a museum and a couple of (childless) drinks in the stylish bar. 

As a final treat Georgiana managed to get us a reservation at the fully booked beauty and the beast afternoon tea.  It really was the perfect end to a perfect stay!

Can't wait to come back!",5,2018,07,09
113,"Beautiful, plus it's a great value!","This boutique hotel is a great option, no question about it. 
The location is great, right in the heart of Kensington; a very short walk to the Museum of Natural History and a lovely stroll away from Knightsbridge. 
The service is quite good as well; nothing extraordinary, but all the staff is very friendly and helpful. 
The lobby lounge and restaurant are exquisitely decorated, you will definitely want to spend some time there. Breakfast is super enjoyable, but the other meals I had there were not as memorable.
As for the rooms, that's where it gets a bit tricky. I have only stayed in the Classic Rooms (work trips; again, great value), but they're TINY and sparsely decorated. The bathroom is so small it's actually somewhat uncomfortable. I would never book this room if I had to stay there for more than a couple of nights and/or travel for pleasure. Also, if you're not traveling solo, forget it there's simply not enough room for two people, plus suitcases.
That said, The Kensington certainly gets my vote as it is a lovely, AFFORDABLE, luxury boutique hotel, which is not that easy to find in London.",4,2018,07,08
113,luxury boutique hotel,"The Kensington Hotel was one of my favorite hotels. We've never been to london before, so while searching a hotel to book the neighborhood really drew me to this hotel. 
Filled with some of the best restaurants and little french and italian cafes. It was super close to the tube, so we didn't have to use a taxi or uber.(which is super expensive)

The hotel staff was super friendly, helpful, and so warm. The breakfast was fresh and delicious. The bar was beautiful but a little pricey. If you ask for a cocktail off the menu you'll pay 20 L per cocktail. 

The room was tiny but very clean and everything you needed was in there. My blowdryer didn't work (my fault) and the blowdryer they provided was just awful. 

South kensington is a charming area, and very clean. 

We cannot wait to come back to The Kensington, all in all it made our trip so much better.",5,2018,07,08
113,"Superb service, food and accommodations",Recently stayed in this wonderful hotel with our two kids 12 and 14 years old.  The service was spectacular in the morning breakfasts were delicious. The whole family loves the tea experience.  The location is very close to the metro and lots of great places to eat.  ,5,2018,07,07
113,Lovely place to stay,"From the comments left by others, I chose the Kensington for the location and good reviews. It was true to what I had read. The location is close to the tube and many good restaurants, pubs, coffee shops, bakeries and gelato. It's a good thing I didn't stay longer because I was attempting to try them all. The hotel is in a neighborhood and away from the hustle and bustle but walking distance to Hyde Park, the museums, etc. There is a lovely bar and restaurant inside the hotel. Guests have access to comfortable places to sit and have a coffee or tea or even High Tea. There is also a workout room downstairs. Although our room seemed small at first, it was quite adequate. By the time we left, the size was perfect. There is a closet to hang clothes and drawers under the night stands. Also an in room safe, coffee or tea service and turn down service at night. They provide robes, slippers and nice toiletry items. I found the housekeeping staff to be particularly attentive. Everyone who worked there was helpful. I was very pleased",5,2018,07,07
113,"Excellent location, good service, and typical room size","Stayed for three nights during a recent biz trip in London. The hotel is really good located, with only 15 min walk to Queen's Gate and Hyde Park, a lot of good restaurants nearby and only 3-5mins walk to South Kensington tube station. 
Our breakfast experience was truly a plus. There was a small buffet with cereal, pastries, and fruit. And full breakfast also came with some other a-la-carte options for eggs and toasts. 
Given the upscale neighborhood, the rate was understandable. 
The only things is that the room was not noise proof, and shower space was really limited.",4,2018,07,07
113,Another Excellent Stay,"This hotel never disappoints.   The main reason for this is the staff, every single one of them......friendly, helpful, happy, polite, attentive.......you cannot walk past without them wishing you a good day etc.   The food is excellent, enjoyed dinner and breakfast where you can pick and choose rather than having a full breakfast.   The room was very comfortable, bed and bedding first class.   The bed is so high that my wife at 5'1'' almost needed a ladder to get in!   Only one small gripe, the shower is a fixed head, but you can't have everything!",5,2018,07,06
113,"Friendly staff, disappointing hotel room","We had stayed at the hotel before a few years ago and were looking forward to going back to stay there again. The hotel is in a great location and only a short walk from the local tube station. The staff are very friendly and welcoming, the food is fresh and tasty (although rather a limited bar food menu) and we slept well (good quality of mattress, pillows). However, we felt our room was rather disappointing - very dark and dreary, fusty smell and overall the d√©cor and furniture felt worn and in need of updating. When we spoke to someone at the hotel they did upgrade us to a new room which was appreciated.

In summary, the hotel is in a great location, the staff are very friendly but the hotel seems to lack the finishing touches that one would expect of a 5 star hotel. For the money paid, I would try another hotel in the area for our next visit.",3,2018,07,02
113,friendly and kindness!,"This hotel is nearby Hyde Park. I was able to relax in a quiet environment. Reception is very friendly and kindness. The hotel has a small business center, I could use internet and print out.Thank you so much!

113,Tale as old as time afternoon tea,"An amazing experience from start for finish. Lovely staff, very friendly, nothing was too much trouble. Afternoon tea itself was lovely and the theme was very well executed without being too over the top. Was offered more sandwiches and unlimited tea which was fantastic, including the optional hot chocolate or coffee instead. Also received a handwritten thank you card, thanking us for our visit. Would recommend it entirely. ",5,2018,07,01
113,Kid Friendly!,"We booked The Kensington for the warm welcome that kids are to receive upon arrival.  With 3 young kids, a kid friendly hotel is super important.  Waiting in their room was supposed to be a book and a teddy bear as a welcome.  We checked in late and nothing was on their beds as expected.  When we walked down to head out to a quick dinner I asked the lady at the front desk and she said the'd have it all ready before we got back.  We ended up going to a pizza place the Head Bellman recommended and getting a pizza to-go.  The pizza was good (as well as the other places he recommended) but we were back earlier than the hotel expected.  The hotel sent up cookies, fresh juice, a bundle of books, and teddy bears.  Above and beyond what we expected.

With the kids we had to reserve two rooms, but we wanted interconnecting rooms since the kids are young (10-7-4).  They placed us at the end of the hall in the perfect rooms.  Bear with me as I try to explain the setup.  At the end of the hall there is a fire door that is propped open, but it also has a key carded handle on it.  just beyond the fire door was a little vestibule and just our two rooms.  They programmed our keys to work on the fire door and each room door.  At night we were able to close the fire door and have our room doors open so we could hear the kids.  The vestibule was nice to store our shoes and stroller.

The hotel is just a couple of blocks to the underground and about 10min walk to Kensington Gardens/Palace.  The restaurants near by were good and laid back so easy for kids.",4,2018,06,30
113,Convenient and lovely London Hotel,"The Kensington Hotel is a well staffed, friendly and lovely hotel.  The staff is extraordinary friendly and helpful (dinner reservations, tips regarding riding the tube and ordering taxi's). It is conveniently located near the tube station and the surrounding area has great restaurants and museums.",5,2018,06,29
113,Lovely waiters ,"I was served by somebody called David and another whose name began with AK they were really friendly and nice to chat to. 
Food was nice service was quick I was a bit disappointed they took Lumiere off our table to give to another but we still had a nice time. ",4,2018,06,29
113,Great location,"London.  So many possibilities.  We settled, after about a shortlist of 5 in the knightsbridge, Victoria, Kensington area, on the Kensington.  Was it good yes.  Perfect no.  Am I fussy? Yeah, a little.  Here's my lowdown.  

Arrival.  I requested a room on high floor away from the lift.  We got floor 3 (of 5) at the end of the hall.  So pretty much a tick there.

The common areas are lovely.  The bar, excellent esp the pisco sours.

Location.  Excellent The hotel is in between to tube stations Sth Ken and and Gloucester.  Both are on the Piccadilly line. This line has direct access to Heathrow.  The stations are both in zone 1 which means you can access most of London's attractions for as little as possible on the tube.  So you are close but not too close.  We spoke to a couple who stayed in Mayfair and hated it because every time they stepped outside their hotel it was into a crowd.  They couldn't wait to get out of London.

Room.  We had the least expensive option.  The room was size was good however the bathroom was tight.  No room really to hang your towels to dry let alone any hand washing you might want to do on a long stay.  The shower was tiny and awkward, (it would not have fit me if I was pregnant or still plus size)  You had to get in to turn it on and so endure cold water until it heated up. And I found the knobs for changing water temp and pressure annoying. So probably I should have gotten a more expensive room so i could have a bigger bathroom but its so hard to gauge these things online.

Service  Mostly good.  I inadvertently left my ""good pjs"" there. And they have posted me the wrong ones and charged me for the privilege.  Still trying to get that sorted.",4,2018,06,26
113,Enchanting Afternoon Tea,"As a regular ‚Äú partaker of Afternoon Teas ,‚Äú I went with an open mind after reading the reviews before I went. It‚Äôs very difficult to understand the poor reviews. My daughter and I were delighted with our experience. The setting, service and food were magnificent. Other than the fact that we arrived early for our table and this was not a problem, I cannot add to the other five star reviews. ",5,2018,06,24
113,The Kensington Hotel Rocks!,We stayed five nights at the Kensington Hotels June 2018. From the moment we checked in the staff was extremely welcoming. The hotel is quintessential England with a modern twist. The Concierge service was very helpful with our questions and recommendations. The hotel was located in a great area easy to get around. The breakfast was excellent and the bar staff and drinks were wonderful. You definitely wont be disappointed!!,5,2018,06,20
113,Comfortable Hotel in Good Location,"For our second hotel choice during a recent trip to the UK, we chose The Kinsington because of close proximity to The Victoria & Albert Museum and its closeness to the Underground to Heathrow. What a great choice. The check in was pleasant, Veronica was extremely friendly and helpful. She even walked us to our room! Unheard of...that was good. The room was a little tight and the view was of a nearby building...that was not so good. The bar was very nice and mellow and made a great martini. Did I say what a great location? Great food all around and Hyde Park is very close. I would highly recommend if you want a chilled hotel that‚Äôs close to many sights and good food.",4,2018,06,18
113,Wonderful Hotel,"We spent the first two nights of our holiday stay at the Kensington.   Lovely hotel, very comfortable rooms, great location.   Showers were great, beds and pillows very comfortable, helpful staff.  Would absolutely recommend this hotel for future stays.",5,2018,06,18
113,Best ever. ,"Not often one to leave reviews but my stay at The Kensington this weekend was absolutely flawless. Not only did my girlfriend and I get upgraded due to it being her birthday, we received complementary desserts and a bottle of champagne. Carlos and his team certainly put a huge smile on both of our faces and has without a doubt won my business the next time I am in London. The room was clean, the bathroom was spotless and the staff were very friendly and helpful. By far the best hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed in whilst being in Kensington. ",5,2018,06,18
113,Very good choice and location,"We always stay in the Kensington area but a first for us in this hotel. It was a very good choice. 

The room was an appropriate size with the king bed. The furniture was sufficient and in very good quality. Room decor was a lovely wallpaper.

Bathroom was laid out well but had a shower no tub, if that matters to you. 

The dining area was so English! You knew you were in London. Lots of comfy seating surrounded by bookshelves. And the large windows allowed plenty of light. 

Breakfast was very good. Occasionally had difficulty getting the attention of a server even when they were not busy.

The bar was our cocktail destination every evening before dinner. Again, nice and comfy chairs and sofas to settle into.

Doormen were extremely helpful with directions. Front desk staff did a perfect job with checking us in and out.

We especially enjoy the location as plenty of great restaurants are a short walk from the hotel. And the South Kensington tube station is equally convenient.

We will return!

",4,2018,06,16
113,Some things great....Some things...Not so much!!,"Frequent business traveler to London.  Usually stay at The Marylebone however it was fully booked so decided to try The Kensington.  Looking forward to returning to The Marylebone.  The majority of the service was outstanding at The Kensington but too many gaps.  Too many issues with the room.  And, an unexpected injury.

The service, as I said, for the most part was really outstanding.  There were a few people who probably need to find new jobs outside of the service industry.  Incredibly friending doormen.  Always there to help with directions, getting a cab or just chatting up a bit.

Front desk and restaurant staff also incredibly kind.  The female restaurant manager at breakfast (shame on me for not remembering her name) was tops.  She sets an example for hospitality.  There when you needed her but never hovering.

Attention to detail is also key.  Servicing the room did not excel as did other areas.  Having to request replenishment for laundry bags, coffee/condiments and inconsistent turndown service are just a few examples.  

There are low shelves above the sink in the bathroom (VERY small bathrooms btw).  Leave it to me to lift my head right into the corner of the shelf after washing my face causing a significant wound on my forehead.  Staff responded quickly to provide aid to my deep cut and greatly appreciated it.

There was motor that turned on at all different times of the day and night.  I called about it twice but gave up since no one addressed it nor got back to me.

No clock on the bedside table.  The clock is on the television.  Only problem is the staff needs to ensure the clock is on the proper time.   

Finally, it's beautiful hotel.  Truly is.  The outside seating in front and by the lounge are a a nice touch.  However, since those areas are also the smoking areas they hotel needs to figure out how all the cigarette and cigar smoke doesn't come back into the lobby and lounge area.

Was hoping for more and I'm sure most guests have great experiences.  I just wish I was one of them.",3,2018,06,14
113,Excellent Hotel and fantastic experience,"I choose to stay at The Kensington as a frequent business traveller to London. I cannot fault the hotel, the service, staff, rooms, food (and fresh juices) are simply outstanding. Its an ideal please to host business meetings, breakfast and dinner meetings and I would highly recommend it for comfort, quality and location.",5,2018,06,12
113,Amazing anniversary stay and afternoon tea ,"My husband booked for our wedding anniversary and had advised the hotel in advance of our arrival.  We were greeted on arrival by a couple of lovely reception staff giving us well wishes and a refreshing shot of juice.  Amazing start!!!
The hotel is an easy walk from South Kensington tube and the entrance is everything you would expect, a cute seating area, a instagramable bike and an essence of grand London hotel.  
Our room was just lovely (426), very comfortable, styled beautifully and the best sleep I have ever had in London.  The bed, to die for!  Whilst we were out, our curtains were drawn and chocolates were left on our pillows.  That made our evening.  
The making of our whole stay was a complimentary bottle of bubbles and strawberries, for a first time stay, we were blown away for such a great!  Amazing!! 
The one thing that I really LOVED about the hotel, is the staff!  The lovely ladies on reception remembered our plans the day after we told them and they asked how we had enjoyed ourselves.  For such a busy reception desk, that was a special touch that you can‚Äôt buy!  Complimentary water on our departure was a lovely touch too. 

On a side note, we did have the Beauty and the Beast afternoon tea too.  The staff were incredible and the food was fantastic.  I would go again in a heartbeat if I could!  The only (and it‚Äôs minor) negative, the Disney accessories are a little tired.  Try the grey stuff, it IS delicious!!

We will absolutely be back as soon as we can!!",5,2018,06,12
113,Great stay,We love the Kensington- the staff is delightful and are able to cope with all issues- including the odd plumbing snafu- the concierge staff is knowledgeable and helpful- and always eager to help. If you‚Äôre ready to splurge book a suite- and enjoy the stay!,5,2018,06,11
113,"Beautiful hotel, beautiful service!","We spent 4 nights here on our honeymoon, our first time to the UK.  The Kensington was absolutely beautiful, the staff was welcoming and attentive, and the location was fantastic. We loved our stay and hope to return!",5,2018,06,11
113,Kensington Hotel definitely not a repeat,"I booked the hotel for two weeks as I needed to be in South Kensington and it is part of the Doyle collection. The Marylebone Hotel,  which I love, is in the same collection so I had high hopes. I only stayed 3 days. It looks good but amateur service. First of all, they wrote Mr on my key card and I‚Äôm a woman. I mentioned it and they gave me this rap that their computer auto puts everyone in as Mr. I‚Äôm a platinum discovery member and always get upgraded at The Marylebone with smiling service. I am told they can‚Äôt upgrade me and I get to a room that is so small, you can barely walk between the bed and the wall. Then, I get a hand welcome note to Mr D in my room later.  Really? Hardly, the personal touch. I will say the housekeeper was very nice. The woman who delivered soup to my room was genuinely nice. 
At breakfast I am told roughly, we are shutting down in 10 minutes rather than a nicer way of maybe saying, ‚Äúis there anything you would like as the kitchen is closing in 10 minutes.‚Äù I‚Äôm spoiled because the Marylebone Hotel always makes you feel welcome and service is important to them. You feel like they want you to have a great experience. 
So, I checked out 11 days early and headed to The Marylebone Hotel. They upgraded me to a beautiful room and included breakfast in my rate. The service was impeccable and I once again felt at home. 
The Kensington could learn a lot from their sister Hotel. It felt stuffy at The Kensington. They don‚Äôt quite understand how to make people feel at home. At least, that was my and my son‚Äôs experience. 
I‚Äôve stayed at some great 4 and 5 Star hotels in London. The Kensington Hotel was not one of them.",3,2018,06,11
113,"Great location, lovely bar, poor service...","We checked in to the Kensington with high hopes for a relaxing stay in London after an excursion packed river cruise on Uniworld.  It would be several hours till our room would be ready, (which was expected), so we walked around town for a while.  The Kensington is situated in an excellent location within walking distance to the Queens Gate, Natural History Museum, and Harrods.  
We returned to find our room less than ideal, the view was nonexistent, brick walls, pipes, and air conditioning units. 
It was a lovely large room with two beds as requested, but there was nowhere to put your clothing,  so we undertook living out of our suitcases for the entirety of our stay.  The air conditioning wasn't working, and evidently we were in the ""family"" section of the hotel as witnessed by the herd of small children above us that kept us awake half the night, every night.  We surmised they came from a different time zone...  
Breakfast was served in a delightful room, more cozy library than restaurant, the buffet style offerings were more than adequate, and if you are lucky, you might be treated to a special mug for your cappuccino.  Later that evening we spent an hour in the bar, a delightful refuge with a more than capable bartender.
We were attempting to contact a friend in England to join us for a visit, but we never got the messages he left at the front desk even though we asked several times.  As a result, to our disappointment,  we were unable to make contact with him.
When we requested that the beds be made up ""american style"" with a bottom sheet and a top sheet instead of duvet only (because it was hot in the room with the A/C out), the staff simply left a folded sheet on one of the beds and expected us to remake our own beds, with only one sheet...?  
The manager was very apologetic as we paid our bill and left, but that did nothing to ameliorate our disappointing stay.
And all this for only $700 per night.",4,2018,06,09
113,Outstanding,"This is the fourth time I stay at this hotel. I strongly recommend it! Nice staff and great area to stay! Good restaurants near the hotel, fine attractions at walking distance and easy transportation!",5,2018,06,09
113,‚ÄúTake as old as time‚Äù afternoon tea,"Superb I went with my daughter,niece and sister in law to celebrate the latter of the twos birthdays.  The staff were very attentive and knowledgeable explaining the beauty and the beast theme of the tea.  David our waiter surprised the girls with a plate each saying happy birthday with cakes and sweets we hadn‚Äôt asked for this nor were we charged extra.  The sign of an excellent waiter who by being very attentive but not obtrusive made my young niece and her mums day - I cannot recommend highly emough.  Thank you David",5,2018,06,08
113,Wonderful hotel and Perfect Location,"I stayed here on business and what a gem!  The hotel is a lovely hotel with a very friendly and helpful staff. The rooms are comfortable, well appointed and clean.  The beds are heavenly! It is also located in an are where there are a number of cafes, shops and restaurants.  You can walk around the corner and find what you need. I highly recommend it. ",5,2018,06,08
113,Wonderful Hotel,"Located in the best part of the city for visitors, it is beautiful quiet, elegant and the staff is perfect. It's just a few blocks from two Tube stations and there rea lots of great pubs, restaurants and museums with in a few blocks.

Not cheap but so comfortable.",5,2018,06,07
113,Best stay in London,"We recently had the pleasure of staying at the Kensington for several nights. Without a doubt, this was the best hotel experience of our journey through London, Paris and Valencia. The atmosphere in the hotel is superb-beautiful, welcoming, comfortable.
Very nice location just a few blocks from the so. Kensington Tube stop, and near many shops/ restaurants. The staff at the front desk and in the restaurant and bar area were professional,friend,y and attentive to every detail.  The breakfast is the best we have ever encountered in a hotel! A must to purchase with room. Beds exceptionally comfortable and room was well-appointed, including nice hairdryer. Truly a home away from home.",5,2018,06,07
113,Truly amazing Tale as old as time tea,"5 stars really isn't enough for this wonderful tea, the service was exceptional and Thomas brought the tale to life. We waited ten months for the reservation and it didn't disappoint. Chef Sandor really made the day by creating a special cake for my friends birthday, it really was the icing on a truly wonderful day. We can't thank you enough. A must visit for any afternoon tea fan, you will not be disappointed. Thank you to all.",5,2018,06,05
113,First Class,"We love this hotel. It is beautifully decorated. Our room #312 was good size & nicely appointed. Breakfast was awesome & included in the rate we paid. The bar was fun & very active. It‚Äôs a little a pricey, but, in my opinion well worth it. This area is very nice & has a number of shops & restaurants that are in walking distance. The staff at the Front Desk, Restaurant & Bar go all out to please their guests. ",5,2018,06,01
113,Absolutely Beautiful Hotel,"This hotel deserves a detailed review!

Upon walking into this hotel, it was impressive.  The exterior and interior is beautifully decorated.  Staff are friendly and polite. Although we knew our room would not be ready, we dropped our luggage off and asked reception to contact us when our room was ready, as we had just disembarked off a 24 hr flight.  

After eating lunch, we decided to return in the off chance our room was ready as we were extremely tired.  Yes it was, however reception had not phoned us.  We were very disappointed as our expectations of this hotel were high & this was such a simple request.

Our room was pleasant and we were very happy to be able to open the windows for fresh air.  My son enjoyed his personalised note, milk & cookies that arrived for him.  Our only disappointment was the cushions on our bed were frayed & these cushion covers were beyond mending.  When I tried to straighten the crooked lampshade, I found the shade was broken underneath and had been tied with plastic zip ties.  

We checked out and as we were travelling throughout the UK, I had not had a chance to email management, when I received an email from management inquiring about our stay.  I informed him of our concerns - lack of a phone call regarding our room being ready, frayed cushion covers & a broken lampshade.   He informed me this information had been passed onto the appropriate departments.

Prior to checking out, we decided to rebook with the hotel for our return stay in London before flying home.  Upon arrival, we were pleasantly surprised to have been upgraded to a suite!

Be sure to take the stairs to the above floors.  The staircase is so beautiful with portraits hung along the way, it feels like your in a grand home.

The lounge areas with their fireplaces lure you, to sit in the comfy chairs and relax. I easily spent hours in this area, it‚Äôs so relaxing and pleasant.  Florean, (hopefully correctly spelt), was very accommodating with my coffee requests and always a pleasure to be served by him.

Dinner in the Townhouse was delicious, relaxing and a nice way to spend our last night.  We than moved to chairs by the fire for a coffee and chat.

Concierge were helpful with requests of printing tickets for us. Rafael, was extremely helpful in assisting us with wrapping wedding champagne glasses, that we had been given the task of transporting home. Rafael also took the time to talk to our 7 yr old son, which was very kind. 

This hotel is close to both South Kensington and Glouchester underground stations and an easy walk to Kensington Gardens.  
And although we experienced some negative things, the hotel responded to those concerns.  When we travel to London next, we would definitely stay at this hotel again.  
",5,2018,05,25
113,A Lovely Experience,"The atmosphere at the Kensington Hotel was lovely. The hotel was beautifully presented and the staff - friendly, welcoming and eager to help us wherever they could. 
The hotel is very close to the tube. Kensington Palace, the palace gardens and the Victoria and Albert Museum are all within walking distance of the hotel. 
It was a lovely experience to have stayed at the Kensington Hotel while we were in London.",5,2018,05,22
113,Absolutely wonderful !,"We planned a return trip to this Beautiful  Hotel to celebrate my Husbands 60th Birthday and our 40th Wedding anniversary. We loved this place last time as it's a lovely luxurious Hotel in a great location with such a friendly feel -  so couldn't wait to go back. To our amazement we were upgraded to a beautiful suite on check in and given champagne , chocolates and flowers to mark the occasion. How lovely and kind of the Staff to help us celebrate and our thanks go out to them for making our stay so memorable and special.............Wonderful in every way ....can't think of anywhere else we would want to stay in London. .....So if you're looking for a classic , stylish Hotel in a vibrant location - then the Kensington is must - you will not be dissapointed.",5,2018,05,22
113,Delightful hotel,"What wonderful hotel! The decorations are perfect, the bed incredibly comfortable and very nice small touches. I loved the heated floors in the bathroom and the luxurious robe and slippers. The breakfast was amazing and in a great atmosphere. The location made it super easy to get around on the Tube, would highly recommend to anyone!",5,2018,05,22
113,A Gem!,"Elegant hotel in the heart of South Kensington, a neighborhood rich with interesting restaurants, coffee shops and museums. Beautifully appointed and intimate lobby and common spaces, where we enjoyed drinks every afternoon in front of the fire. Room was small (we could not pass each other between the end of the bed and the wall) but the high-quality linens and in-room Nespresso machine made up for a lot. Staff was very service oriented and friendly. Breakfast wasn‚Äôt included, but prices were competitive with neighborhood restaurants and quality was high. Overall, a keeper. We originally reserved for two nights and stayed five!",5,2018,05,20
113,Great place,This hotel is in a superb location in Kensington. The staff are very friendly and professional and make an effort to use your name. The hotel is really beautiful and well equipped. Our room was very comfortable and quiet. The bathroom was particularly nice and had good shower pressure. Will definitely stay there in the future. ,5,2018,05,18
113,tale as old as time afternoon tea,"firstly, i booked this as a surprise for my partners birthday, and our anniversary, and the staff were so helpful, friendly and nice. the actual decor of the building and layout means you can have quiet conversation while not having to shout over others. 

reagrding the actual tea, it was amazing, it looked amazing, was presented brilliantly, and tasted unreal. absolutely brilliant. thanks to the staff at the kensington!!",5,2018,05,14
113,Tale as old as Time afternoon tea,The hotel is beautiful and clean and the greeting we received was friendly and professional. The afternoon tea experience was something I had booked for my sisters birthday which was in January but although we had to wait for the day to come around it was everything we hoped it would be. The attention to detail as well as the staff being knowledgeable and explaining all about did not go unappreciated. Highly recommend this. Thank you for a lovely experience. ,5,2018,05,13
113,"Wonderful, Beautiful Hotel with an Outstanding Staff","My wife and I stayed at the Kensington for 3 nights to kick off our 6-night stay in London to celebrate my wife's birthday.

Having not been to London before, it was tough to find the right property for us.  We wanted to be in a good, walkable location, convenient to an Underground station, and most of all, after a very long 10-hour flight and 8-hour time change from California, arrive in comfort with good service.  We were very fortunate to have chosen the Kensington Hotel to begin our stay!  (The same cannot be said about the hotel we stayed in for our following and final nights in the Marble Arch/Marylebone area -- which turned out to be more money for a slightly-worn and less-well-managed property...)

The property itself is in a beautiful Georgian Neoclassical building (typical of the South Kensington area), at the corner of Queen's Gate and Old Brompton Road, making it very convenient for the many museums (the V&A, Natural History Museum, etc.), Royal Albert Hall and Hyde Park, which is just under a mile's walk down Queen's Gate Road.  There are a number of good restaurants, cafes and pubs within a couple blocks' walking distance.  The upscale feel of South Kensington is everywhere, with both Ferrari and Lamborghini dealerships on the street and plenty of very expensive real estate.  Despite this, the neighborhood feels friendly and unpretentious, unlike the gaudy show of nearby Knightsbridge, where ridiculous shows of wealth are on public display.

The South Kensington tube station is just a couple of blocks away (5 minute or less walk), which makes getting to the city center easy.  To the south, the even more expensive and upscale Chelsea/Sloane Square areas are walkable, or a one-stop tube ride away.

We were upgraded to a Deluxe Room for my wife's birthday celebration, where the extra space was welcome (both for us and our luggage).  Our room was on the 3rd floor overlooking Old Brompton Road -- perfect!  The windows were well-insulated and street noise was not present when the windows were closed.

The room was *very* comfortable, with a great king-sized bed with nice linens, a spacious and comfortable bathroom, and large windows that let natural light in during the daytime.  The high ceilings added to the spacious feel and ambience of the room.  All of the little things were thought of -- carefully thought-out storage spaces, with all the amenities you would expect of a luxury hotel.  

(Our one suggestion to the hotel: the rooms could use a few more electrical outlets.  It was not possible, for instance, to both plug in a phone and have the bedroom side light on at the same time as only a single outlet was available on either side of the bed).

BUT most importantly -- and aside from the great location and wonderful property -- the STAFF IS AMAZING HERE!!  From the moment of check-in, through check-out, we were very well taken care of.  Nobody missed a beat over our 3-day stay.  The concierge desk was very helpful, the front desk people were amazingly accommodating, the bar and restaurant staff were great.  The wonderful staff are the main reason I give this property a 5-star review.  Thank you for the great service!!

The public areas are beautiful, very English and very appropriate to the area.  A comfortable sitting area is in the room adjacent to the check-in/reception area, and just past that are the restaurant and the bar.  The bar is a special experience at night, with great ambient lighting and outstanding service.

All-in-all, the Kensington is one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed at (and we have stayed at many hotels around the world).  It is big enough to offer the full-service jet-lagged international travelers need, but small enough to feel personable and quaint.  It's just lovely.

We hope the hotel maintains its high-value-for-price status and its amazing service, as we will definitely stay here again when next in London!",5,2018,05,12
113,The Kensington experience ,"I was impressed! The restaurant is very nice, good ambience, amazing food. The staff was friendly and professional.
My waitress was Elena, a very nice presence with a lovely smile. Thomas also made a good impression. 
I will definitely come again",5,2018,05,12
113,Like coming home.,We stayed at the Kensington at the beginning and end of a two week vacation. The service was above and beyond and the staff was warm and friendly. The two rooms we stayed in were both very unique and comfortable. The beds and pillows seemed a bit stiff for my taste but the linens were all crisp and clean and the room was very cozy. Arriving at the Kensington after our travels and enjoying a beverage fireside on a brisk night was like coming home.,5,2018,05,06
113,Service and  Facility Beyond Expectations,"The Kensington is one of the best managed and most elegant hotels I have ever enjoyed. From the impressive, classic facade to the professional and warm welcome from both the doorman and front desk staff, I knew I was in for a world class experience.  It didn't seem to matter that I had booked through a third party site at an extraordinarily good rate. I was treated as a VIP. The lovely woman who checked me in also escorted me to my room. It was a especially lovely and quiet 3rd floor gem...room 311 that I would certainly ask for again. When I had booked online I paid a modest fee to upgrade to a Deluxe room and was so very glad that I did. The spaciousness, sumptuous setting and chic bathroom were worth every extra pence. Also, the location of the hotel was perfect...a short walk to the South Kensington tube stop and right across the street from a well stocked Waitrose market. Finally, I knew I had found something when the British friend's I had invited to meet me for drinks declared the bar and public rooms were among the best they had ever seen in London. Very much !looking forward to a return visit!",5,2018,05,04
113,Fantastic staff and location,"From the moment we walked into reception to check in and were offered water and hot towels--greatly appreciated after a red-eye into London--I knew that I'd have a good experience at the Kensington. 

The room was lovely; I adored the duvet and pillows (it was like sleeping on a cloud). We were on the second (well, third, technically) floor and had no issues with noise. We had a few minor issues that were immediately addressed by staff. Lovely turndown service, including slippers, which I always enjoy. The room includes an American outlet and a USB port, though the USB port only works when the tv is on, which was odd.

The location of the hotel is another of its biggest selling points. It's a quick walk to the South Kensington Tube station, which is on the District, Circle, and Piccadilly lines. Everything was incredibly easy to get to; Victoria was only 2 stops away, and Westminster only 4. Even so, it's in a lovely neighborhood with loads of restaurants, bakeries, and other shops. The Victoria & Albert and Natural History museums are a stone's throw away.

Loved the atmosphere of the hotel and the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful.",5,2018,05,03
113,Fabulous- Tale as Old as Time,"My sister and I attended the Tale as Old as Time afternoon tea in April. We had a fabulous experience, all of the staff were very professional and got us in the beauty and the beast spirit, making it more of an experience and not just an afternoon tea. I don‚Äôt want to go into detail about the food or extras so as not to spoil anything. 

We weren‚Äôt rushed at all and there was a very relaxed atmosphere, the restaurant are not shoving as many people as possible into a room which is nice.

A very enjoyable experience we would highly recommend it!! A special thank you to Carolina who managed to fit us in when we had to cancel because my sister was quite ill. We booked last August and it did not disappoint! Thank you",5,2018,05,02
113,Beauty and the Beast Afternoon Tea,I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at The Kensington. Thomas was lovely and I especially loved his singing of ‚ÄúBe Our Guest‚Äù. It definitely made my birthday special. All of the food was excellent and I could not complain about anything. ,5,2018,04,29
113,Absolutely perfect!,"There isn't much to say, other thsn this hotel has a lot of character, the service is excellent and it's most welcoming. The room was spotless and crisp, everything on point, just the way we like it. Thank you very much for a wonderful experience.",5,2018,04,24
113,What a stay!,"In addition to being a fabulously appointed hotel, in an great location close to museums, shops and the tube, the service here is excellent. We enjoyed a relaxed lunch in their ‚ÄòTown House‚Äô restaurant, and were able to arrange an impromptu themed afternoon tea: as a guest at The Kensington you are certainly made to feel special. And particular thanks to Ilaria Arcese, their breakfast manager, who went out of her way to make our stay so enjoyable. We‚Äôre looking for a reason to visit again soon.",5,2018,04,23
113,An afternoon tea to remember,"I attended the Kensington 'Tale as Old as Time' afternoon tea on Friday 20th April and it was by far the best I have attended in London owing to the attentiveness and politeness of their staff. Our waitress Petronela was outstanding and Thomas was charm personified. The food was excellent and the whole experience was thoroughly enjoyable and most importantly fun for all of the Davies party (aged 18-50) which proves it doesn't matter how old you are to attend this exemplary tea. 
I hope to be seeing the Kensington very soon. 
Miss Lucie King",5,2018,04,21
113,Very nice central London hotel & excellent service,"We made a mistake with our booking date through Agoda but the Kensington were fully booked and the concierge was excellent in finding us another hotel for that night.  Anyway, despite a 'no cancellation' booking the Kensington allowed us to move it to the 17th - brilliant!
Lovely hotel - the only comment I would make is that their 'Superior' rooms are really what I would call 'standard' at this price break.  Very comfortable and well appointed but small er than perhaps one would expect for 'superior'.",4,2018,04,19
113,is a well kept seret,I like this hotel not because it is over the Top but it is pleasantly over the top ... it has fantastic service and looks amazing to show it definitely has class ..  but I feel where it lacks is that it misses a personal touch .. and for what your paying for it is what should be added.,4,2018,04,16
113,Nice Place in London,"Kensington is a nice place to be at during your short London visit. Safe, nearby attractions, decent price, and good service. I recommend for short visits. Solo or business. They also usually offer discounts on a regular basis, which makes a competitive price. Overall, decent and nice.",4,2018,04,13
113,Beautiful Hotel,"This is one of my most favourite hotels in Kensington. It is a true gem! A perfect location, a very comfortable place with great helpful staff. The bar downstairs is classy and offers a unique selection of drinks. The lounge is very cosy and pleasant, with a fireplace, it is perfect for a meal or drink.Thank you to Ashley for looking after us, he was very friendly.",5,2018,04,12
113,Fantastic,"The staff at the Kensington went out of their way to make sure we had a great stay.  The hotel was great as was the location.  The sitting rooms were a wonderful place for tea, or after dinner drinks.  We would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,04,11
113,The Royal Albert Hall & The Kensington,"The Royal Albert Hall & The Kensington; A match made in heaven for our trip to watch Gregory Porter perform.
- A 10 minute walk to the elegant venue, the hotel has a perfect location, easy to find and in a nice area. Walking distance to the parks and tourist attractions.
- The staff are attentive, they go the extra mile and have a ‚Äòcan do‚Äô attitude, 5 star service.
- Classic elegant decor.
- The rump steak at the Town House is the best steak I‚Äôve ever had, perfectly cooked. Nice breakfast too. A dine early option for the Theatre guests available. 
- A cute gift on arrival of chocolate coated strawberries and an Easter egg for my birthday.
- Large bathrooms, a turn down service with chocolates on pillows, toiletries and a mini bar.

Overall a beautiful hotel in a stunning location with 5 star staff. Thank you,
Julianne

113,Perfect boutique hotel,"Me and my husband spent a couple of days as part of our honeymoon. We booked a slightly bigger room and requested to stay high up in the building, which was granted. The room was a great size, clean and had a very comfy bed. Hotel is in a great location, near to many nice restaurants, Tube Station, busses and museums. 

The staff were very friendly and helpful. They even surprised us with a lovely gift to celebrate us getting married, which was lovely. 

If I had to pinpoint one down side it was the room cleaning service. First day the missed to clean our room, second day they forgot to replace cups and last day towels. 

Overall we were very happy with our visit and would warmly recommend The Kensington!",5,2018,04,03
113,Great location for a London stay,"We stayed here just for one night and loved it. It‚Äôs not the biggest or best hotel we‚Äôve stayed at but the customer service is amazing. Every member of staff was on point and couldn‚Äôt do enough for us.

We will definitely return.",4,2018,04,02
113,Lovely Gem in South Ken,"We just spent a week with 3 children at The Kensington. First, it's a great location, tucked away in a beautiful neighborhood with lots of restaurants and coffee shops, quick walk to the underground and also easy walk to Kensington Park, V&A museum, Science Museum and the Natural History Museum. 

We arrived at around 9pm and were promptly taken to our rooms which already was equipped (as asked in advance) with a rollaway bed for our 3rd child. We had two rooms that were connected by a private hallway...perfect set-up for a family of 5. Both rooms were spacious by London standards and very clean. The decor was nice, nothing fabulous, but very tasteful and nice sheets and housekeeping was attentive.

The lobby and sitting areas on the ground floor are truly lovely...especially with fireplaces roaring. Some mornings we ate breakfast in the lobby, other mornings in the actual restaurant. What a nice atmosphere to start your day! The majority of restaurant staff were friendly, although some of the servers were definitely more reserved (i.e., less friendly), than I would expect and it sometimes felt like i was making them go out of their way, when I was simply ordering or asking a question. We had a female waitress from Italy who was wonderful and who always made a point to chat with us, even if we weren't her table.. 

 The doormen were super--very friendly and extremely helpful when you're looking for a taxi not just to go around town, but for even trips outside the city or to the airport. The concierges were also helpful as I reached out before the trip and they were able to make several reservations for us which was great as some were last minute. 

I love boutique hotels and am extremely picky. This place fit the bill for me. Lovely atmosphere, helpful staff and great neighborhood. I will def be back here on my next trip to London!",5,2018,04,01
113,Sophisticated charm,"This is the third hotel review of mine for a Doyle Collection hotel in London and the Kensington doesn‚Äôt disappoint - it‚Äôs nicely located for the tube and a little high street with great restaurants and breakfast spots. The entrance is quintessentially British - if you are arriving here from abroad it couldn‚Äôt sum up Kensington charm more - super smart and stylish with an old world charm with all the modern amenities we need today. The ground level is the bar and the lounge area for relaxing by open fires. It does have a real sense of 19th century drawing room, fresh flowers and staff on hand for afternoon tea. The corridors to the rooms are windy and the floors uneven - the property is very historic. The rooms are the smallest I‚Äôve experienced in the Doyle collection hotels - they are super petite, but perfectly formed - my room only had space for the bed, the wardrobe and a chair and I could just about shuffle around the room. I like the Kensington for a very short stay of two nights max otherwise I would get very claustophobic indeed.
Five star but no cigar!",5,2018,04,01
113,"Excellent service, lovely room, but no hot water for over 24 hours","We really liked the Kensington.  We had adjoining rooms that were very comfortable, and the staff was very attentive, helpful, and kind.  The hotel's restaurant has remarkably good food and excellent service.  The location is convenient and fun, and the rooms were surprisingly quiet given that we were on the second floor.  My one complaint was that due to a pipe breakdown, we had no hot water at all for over 24 hours - a pretty unusual problem to have in a luxury hotel.  That said, I think we would go back, because I assume this was a freak occurrence.",4,2018,03,26
113,Great hotel in London,"We have stayed here twice.  The hotel is so convenient to the museums, Harrods, good restaurants, the tube.  Excellent breakfast.  Lobby area includes 3 rooms to sit and relax with a cup of tea and the daily paper.  Rooms are clean and comfortable. There is also a nightly turn down service!",5,2018,03,26
113,Fantastic for a luxury treat,"Friendly staff who at the request of my 10 year old son, brought a birthday cake up to my room for myself and the other members of our party. When we arrived there were 2 gifts left for my son along with a personalised card, grapes, chocolate milk and biscuits. Great location,very clean and very comfortable rooms.Bathroom had a great shower and the shower gel etc was lovely. The hotel is pricey( i was using a voucher i had received as a gift) however if you were just looking to stay one night to go to a show etc and wanted to get yourself a treat then i would highly recommend it. ",5,2018,03,26
113,Superior Service ,"We recent stayed at the Kensington for a four night stay and appreciated the excellent service of every staff member. Our room was cozy, the food and drinks were delicious. Fantastic location near South Kensington tube station. Highly recommend.",5,2018,03,24
113,First Class! ,"The Kensington hotel is perfection. The staff are attentive and friendly, on arrival they provided us with a refreshment then showed us to our room (a really nice touch). 
Romona on the front desk made our stay extra special for our anniversary, we can't thank her enough. 
Breakfast in the morning was delicious and the waiting staff were all welcoming. The rooms are comfortable and immaculately clean. 
The Kensington staff ensured we had a fabulous stay to celebrate our anniversary. We will definately be staying here again and we would highly recommend staying here. ",5,2018,03,22
113,Beautiful hotel & great service ,"Stunningly decorated hotel, we live locally so dropped by for some tea and dessert, their lounge area is beautiful with an open fireplace and tastefully chosen yet cosy furniture. Great place for a catchup with friends over drinks/coffee and the staff are friendly and relaxed which is nice. I actually left my bank card here by mistake and worriedly called up the hotel the next day when I realised. Luckily they had found it quite soon after I had left and kept it in a safe for me to collect so it was a relief that I didn‚Äôt have to cancel my card with my bank. All in all great service as expected in an establishment such as this. Will return soon for dinner next time. ",4,2018,03,21
113,Great Experience,"We stayed five nights in February. We found the hotel to be very well appointed and a great location for museums, sites and the tube in particular. We stayed in a deluxe room and found the room size to be very comfortable and adequate for our needs. We appreciated being able to check in early after a long, transatlantic flight. We enjoyed the in-room amenities such as the tea kettle and Nespresso machine. We ordered room service a number of times and found the food to be very good and service very prompt. 

The customer service was impeccable. A special shout out to Carlos and Georgiana for their responsiveness and professionalism and for Georgiana‚Äôs diligence in helping to resolve a mini bar charge glitch post check out.  

We would definitely stay again and would highly recommend this place to others.",5,2018,03,20
113,Consistently excellent- yet to disappoint ,"I‚Äôve stayed at this hotel regularly over the past few years and have loved every stay. In my books excellence is often measured in consistency and The Kensington has done that hands down. From the Concierge and his team through to the reception, hospitality and room staff, great training and attitude. Makes every stay a pleasure!!",5,2018,03,17
113,Afternoon Tea,"Myself and a group of friends recently visited for the Tale as Old as Time Afternoon Tea, the hotel was beautiful and the setting for tea was amazing, so relaxed with soft lighting. The staff there really do put so much effort into the experience and really looked after us, even arranging the extra Disney decorations to get a great photo. They explained what to expect and the food was really well presented. The food itself was amazing and the best afternoon tea we have all had (we have had a few!) we all said we would love to come back. ",5,2018,03,15
113,"Location, charm, service","Sure, my room was a bit small but once I had found the best way to put things away and the best way to get in and out of the shower, it was really cozy and comfortable, clean and welcoming. The temperature control worked fine and hot water was delivered with great pressure with reliability, something London hotels in the same price range sometimes struggle with. The location is fantastic, everyone at the hotel is very welcoming and friendly, service is great. I love the atmosphere, furniture, such a welcome break from the anonymous business hotels out there....Cocktails are a bit pricy but they have a proper bar, which is great..... I don‚Äôt want to be too complimentary because I‚Äôd rather keep the good news to myself and make this charming hotel my 
London base!",5,2018,03,14
113,Can be better,"Having stayed at the Kensington for business and picked the place as the location was good as well as the room size seems reasonable for me travelling on business with luggage and parcel from work.  

Having early arrival which the hotel has kindly offered me a room to freshen up. Staff upon arrival has been welcoming and helpful.  Staff at Townhouse was highlight as most of them (90%) has been very nice and welcoming.  Particularly Sylvia (if I had remembered her name correctly) and a gent I forgot his name but I remembered he was from Poland.  Very good asset to the team as very cheerful and good services.  

The heating at the room was very warm, a bit too warm.  Water pressure at the room was good which is really a plus!  

Room was clean well but then housekeeping could have paid more attention to details as found or spot two times during my over a week stay that they haven‚Äôt properly tidied up some amenities.  Sometimes, some little details counted most when you‚Äôre providing deluxe or above services.  

The reaction or recovery when I addressed the issue at housekeeping was considered prompt but just that it still happened twice which was disappointing as being a Doyle Collection.  

If I‚Äôm going London again for business, will consider staying here again as I like the neighbourhood which is quite and considered accessible to restaurants and close to Hyde Park.  Hope to have a chance to run in the park when the weather permits.  

Overall, disappointed when you have expectations on the hotel but they still have very good staff.  If there is a 3.5 rating will be what I prefer.  ",3,2018,03,12
113,Mothers Day,"Just had afternoon tea here for Mother‚Äôs Day a present from my son (ok he won it in a raffleüòÑ) but that didn‚Äôt matter one bit by anyone there even when my son turned up in all his bike leathers üòÄüòÄ .
Amazing food on a beauty and the beast cartoon theme with some weird and wonderful teas which if you want you can try them all and with a really relaxed atmosphere helped along beautifully by Thomas and Barbara it was a blinding afternoon highly recommend for a special occasion but a big shout out for all the staff who also helped to make it a special afternoon ",5,2018,03,11
113,WOW!! First Class!,"We spent two nights here, the first was for my fianc√© (alone) the second was for our wedding night.

We did inform the hotel and were given (not sure if on purpose) a lovely room. We received a beautiful cake on our wedding day inscribed with our names - a beautiful touch.

Service was impeccable, room was lovely... everything was as you‚Äôd expect perfect but also personal!

A real gem of a hotel!!! Highly Recommend!!!!",5,2018,03,11
113,Beautiful hotel in perfect location,"This is such a lovely hotel in the heart of Kensington.  The elegant architecture is complimented by an equally elegant interior beautifully decorated with curated items throughout.  A doorman graciously welcomes you to this beautiful boutique hotel.  Our room wasn't ready when we arrived early from Florida, so we enjoyed coffee fireside as we waited.  We reserved a suite which was perfect for us to relax with plenty of room.  Double doors lead to the bathroom which was stylish in black and white marble. A deep soaker tub was below the window while a roomy shower with rainwater showerhead was on the opposite side of the room.  In-floor heating kept our feet warm in the bathroom.  We visited in November 2017, and it was quite chilly in the room until a steward explained their thermostat system.  Very elegant and comfortable.  The employees were very friendly, helpful and courteous.  The tube is a short 1 1/2 blocks away, and along the way are several small diners for eating breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Great location away from the crowds but very easily walkable (which we did) to many historic landmarks and museums.  If I ever get to return to London, I'm staying here!",5,2018,03,09
113,Stay at the Kensington,"We started and ended our trip from London to Scotland, Wales and back to London at the Kensington Hotel.  The room was small but completely adequate.  The continental breakfast got you going and the location was great.  Museums within walking distance and the Tube is just a couple of blocks down the road which gives access to anywhere you want to go in London.",5,2018,03,07
113,Lovely hotel,"The hotel is lovely with such friendly helpful staff.  The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are clean and lovely too.  I would defiantly recommend this hotel and would stay there again.  We needed a taxi to a venue and they could not do enough to be helpful to ensure we got to the venue.  This hotel has a lovely relaxing atmosphere with lovely helpful staff the receptionist even took us up to our room personally, nothing was to much trouble at the hotel.  Excellent stay and will be returning soon. Thank you to all the staff that work at this hotel you are amazing.",5,2018,03,05
113,FANTASTIC Boutique Hotel in the heart of Kensington,"Perfect boutique hotel in the heart of Kensington that is also big enough to support a nice restaurant and bar.  Rooms are lovely and most are a decent size. Bathrooms are updated with all the amenities.  Front desk staff is professional, welcoming and very lovely.  On site restaurant served a great European buffet breakfast but also allowed menu options.  Afternoon tea and after dinner drinks were spot on as well.  Clientele is fashionable and well mannered... not your ""tour group"" set.  5 min walk to South Ken Tube Stop if needed... 5-10 min walk to nice shopping, restaurants, and museums.  This is a great hotel find!",5,2018,03,04
113,Lovely London Hotel,"I stayed here for a 1 night whilst visiting friends and seeing a show in London. We had a studio room which was lovely and the check in process was quick with complimentary welcome drink.
The bar area is beautiful with a nice open fire. 
I must make a special mention for George from the concierge team who was extremely helpful during our stay and made us feel very welcome at the hotel. We only arrived back home today but already planning on returning with our son in the summer.",5,2018,03,04
113,Beauty and the Beast afternoon tea worth a visit,"Visited the 5* Kensington Hotel for a birthday celebration.
We had a themed Beauty and the Beast afternoon tea, the service was great, Paul and Thomas looked after us very well as well as other members of the team.
It‚Äôs a very different Afternoon Tea with lots of little extras. The characters were on the table to make it more authentic, the savouries, sandwiches, cakes etc. were delicious.
I think the themes change but definitely worth another visit.",5,2018,03,04
113,Luxury city break,"Amazing place with friendly staff, great service and very nice location. 
The hotel is a kind of mix of boutique with design hotel and the rooms are very cosy and comfortable.
The location - Kensington - is simply perfect, at a London upper class neighborhood and quite near of Natural History Museum and the metro station.",5,2018,03,03
113,"Nice hotel, nice location","Visited in the run up to Christmas.  Very festive, great staff.  We are frequent visitors to London and the area feels like a second home to us.  Hotel is decorated in a traditional style, spotless rooms.  Our room 126 was a bit on the dark side regarding natural light and that is only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars.  Will return for sure this August.",4,2018,03,03
113,Charming elegant and sophisticated,I stayed there with my husband over Christmas and we had a fantastic dinner at the restaurant. The hotel room feels comfortable. The bathroom nice and clean. Such a great location close to Hyde Park. The gym is so well equipped you can do a very good training. We had a brilliant time!,5,2018,02,28
113,Super staff,"Stayed for two nights in freezing February. The welcome was lovely and the staff were superb for the duration of our stay. We had a room on floor 5 which was an attic room, so small - but it was quiet and that's what we prefer. Bed comfy, bathroom spotless, what else do you need.
We didn't have a breakfast inclusive offer, and I decided to get breakfast outside the hotel, as I did think the price looked a bit steep (maybe I'm just mean!) and there were loads of fabulous places close by where we did get probably better value. ",4,2018,02,27
113,"Beautiful lobby, restaurant & bar","Had a lovely stay here, we were offered a complimentary upgrade and the room was nice but it wasn't anything special. However the ground floor is stunning and we had a delicious breakfast. Staff were very friendly and helpful. George the bellman was a joy! ",5,2018,02,26
113,Perfect Vacation Getaway,"Loved this hotel. Everybody was so awesome and friendly. I loved the location and after a long day of touring, I felt relaxed and at home. The facility was very clean and classy. I wish I stayed longer!",5,2018,02,26
113,LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS HOTEL with one small but,"the small ""but"" is that our room was very small   True, we selected the least expensive room.,  next time we will ask for a bigger room but there will definitely be another time. The staff is great - the lobby is the most charming . Location couldn't be better . Overall 5 stars.",5,2018,02,26
113,Beautiful hotel property and best nights sleep,"The Kensington enjoys a wonderful location within London and is a very beautiful hotel. Lovely relaxed atmosphere in all public areas.  Breakfast was fabulous and their bed was the comfiest I have experienced in a long while, great nights sleep!  Heated floor in the bathroom :) Staff are extremely efficient and attentive.  Will definitely stay there again!",5,2018,02,26
113,Well worth the wait!! Couldn‚Äôt fault anything!!! ,"Wow what a wonderful experience!!! 

Booked the tale as old as time afternoon tea back in June ‚Äò17 for my best friends birthday. We visited on Friday 23rd February and it was such a wonderful, very well detailed tea. 
I literally couldn‚Äôt fault any of it. 
Tom welcomed us in and what a wonderful, delightful man. He is definitely the hostess with the mostest! 
Erik was our waiter he was so polite, helpful and friendly. 
All the staff were tentative, efficient and knowledgeable.
The food was carefully prepared and presented. 
The hotel was beautiful and we didn‚Äôt want our experience to end so we headed to the bar for cocktails. 
The bar guys (Francis, Franco and Georgie manager - sorry I can‚Äôt remember his name and then Ben the GM) were such great fun, kind and professional! They really made our day (and my friends birthday a remarkable day.) 
The cocktails were amazing! 
I would definitely be returning to the Kensington again very soon!
Thanks guys keep doing what your doing. ",5,2018,02,25
113,Wonderful Service,"Visited for the Tale as Old as Time afternoon tea. The food and clever links to the story were great but the visit was made extra special by the staff. Our host, Thomas, took time to explain everything and our waitress, Lilitha (apologies for spelling) was attentive throughout. Little touches like the happy birthday message on our plate and the time taken by several different staff to wish my daughter well were very much appreciated.
A beautiful setting,  lovely food and excellent staff. What more could you wish for? 
Highly recommended.",5,2018,02,25
113,Execellet across the board !,"The wonderful was  wonderful and very accommodating.  George is truly fabulous.
A wonderful help for an exhausted traveler.
Robert and Nighttime  front desk were great as well.  Would stay there again because of George and team",5,2018,02,24
113,Enjoyable stay,"Beautiful hotel in an excellent location. Would strongly recommend. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Would certainly return. The hotel is beautifully decorated and located in the heart of Kensington not far from the museums. The service at the hotel was excellent, the food was excellent. Very difficult to criticise anything - the staff were friendly. Really felt at home.",5,2018,02,24
113,Beauty and the Beast afternoon tea.,"Was pleasantly surprised as it was such a lovely afternoon.  My daughter had booked this as it was my Grandaughter's 21st Birthday on Valentine's Day, as a Birthday treat. We were greeted by a gentleman who took all our coats and showed us where to go.
The staff were all very helpful and very pleasant.  As the theme was Beauty and the Beast they explained everything to us about the food and what it was meant to represent.
They even put all the little characters on the table.
The food was excellent and very filling with more if we wanted it. there was no rush for us to leave.  it really was a lovely afternoon and more than we had expected.",5,2018,02,21
113,Charming and wonderful hotel,"Was not sure what to expect at this hotel, but was pleasantly surprised. Excellent location in the heart of South Ken. Rooms were well appointed if a bit small, though this is central London and is to be expected. Food was good. Free wifi is always a plus. Wonderful lobby and friendly staff.",5,2018,02,19
113,Impeccable reception staff ,"I just got back from a great stay at The Kensington with my boyfriend. Note: this is a review of a superior room. 

Pros: 
-Exellent location in the heart of South Kensington with museums, restaurants and bars just around the corner. Very close to the metro with direct trains to Heathrow. 

-Impeccable reception staff offering a true five star experience. They did everything  in their power to make our stay pleasant and managed any request with a smile. 

-Beautiful lounge area and a really nice bar with great drinks and decor. A must to visit, even if you're not a guest at the hotel. 

-Great with complimentary water everyday, I also appriciated the robe and slippers, and fresh towels twice a day. Made the stay more comfortable. 

Cons:
-The bed could be bigger and more comfortable. 

-I would prefer more than one european outlet in the room. Also, the bathroom had one outlet (for shavers only) next to the mirror. Would prefer using the hairdryer (and the straightener) in the bathroom instead. 

Overall I rate this hotel 4,5, and I would not hesitate to return. I highly recommend this lovely hotel. ",4,2018,02,19
113,Wonderful experience!,"London is an amazing city filled with wonder!  On our recent trip there in early February, we found another wonder..The Kensington Hotel.  Upon our arrival, we were greeted by the welcoming staff who personally toured us around the hotel.  The lobby is elegant and welcoming.  The rooms are beautiful and comfortable and were a welcome site after a long day traversing the city.  As nice as the Kensington is, the service is unparalleled.  Whether going the extra mile to get you a reservation or help in acquiring a stamp for a post card, the staff warmly tries to accommodate all inquiries and concerns with an immediate response.  We visit London often, and have stayed at several different hotels.  This has changed.  Any time we find ourselves in London, we will be staying at The Kensington.  You should too!",5,2018,02,18
113,"Friendly, attentive staff in elegant and comfortable surroundings.","We stayed two nights in this wonderfully located hotel and enjoyed the excellent service and comfort it had to offer. The stylish. ground floor reception rooms are perfect for relaxing and reading for a bit and the location - two minutes from the V and A, the Natural History Museum and South Kensington station mean that you are in a lovely oasis in the midst of plenty of activity and interest. Staff are courteous , friendly and obliging. Our room was spotless and breakfast was delicious. We hope to return!. ",5,2018,02,18
113,Elegant hotel,"This is a very nice hotel, and the staff is over the top üòä
The surroundings are gorgeous and stylish.
The evening bar is delicious decorated, whit a nice feeling of a hideaway.
We have tryed the afternoontea and the evening menu, and it was very delicious and tasty.
But the supiriorroom is very small for a 5 star hotel. Theres is room for improvement.
We hope to come back some day, and stay in a lager room.
Overall a hotel you want to visit again.",5,2018,02,18
113,Afternoon tea,"My daughter & I went up today for the ‚ÄúTale as old as Time‚Äù afternoon tea. From the moment we arrived at the hotel the service was 1st class. We were a little early and we were shown into the lounge area where we sat & waited sitting next to a lovely open fire. 
We were greeted by Thomas who took us into the restaurant for our tea, he was lovely & very friendly. Our table looked lovely and the waiting staff were great. We were asked if we had any allergies and my daughter can‚Äôt eat chocolate which was noted. Our drink order was taken & these arrived very quickly as did our first course of the 3. These were very tasty one small beef & one small venison pie & a cheese souffl√©. Then the main event our tea with a nice selection of sandwiches & cakes all with a Beauty & the Beast theme. They did a selection of chocolate free cakes for my daughter which was really great and very thoughtful. At no point did we feel rushed & the staff were very attentive. We had a Belle shaped biscuit to take away with us which was a nice touch. It was a really lovely experience and one I would recommend. ",5,2018,02,17
113,Afternoon tea that exceeds high expectations ,"I booked the tale as old as time afternoon in July and we finally got to go on 15th Feb. I was looking forward to it so much I though It may not live up to my expectations, I was so wrong. The afternoon tea exceeded expectations. Every looked magical and tastes even better. I‚Äôve been to a few themed teas where things looked great but not much thought goes into the taste. 

Even though every table was booked I didn‚Äôt feel the room was over crowded, it was still relaxed and comfy.The staff where tentative and friendly explaining all the different items and the story behind them. There was so much food with a plate of starters and the usual tower of food. We where even offered seconds on the sandwiches and a biscuit to take away. 

As you can probably guess I was blown away by this experience and would recommend it to anyway. I can understand why this is sold out with months to wait. ",5,2018,02,17
113,True Masterpiece,"The Kensington Hotel is a true hidden gem, incredible decor fine dining and amazing staff are just a few of the reasons I cannot wait to return. The attention to detail in the rooms is impeccable, as are the first grade amenities. The location is fabulous and everything that Kensington has to offer is just a short stroll away.",5,2018,02,16
113,"Grandma, Wife, Sister-in-Law and Daughter all absolutely loved it. Total quality - both food and service.","Food was amazing.
Staff were lovely and helpful (and very posh according to my 12 yr old daughter).
All of the food was amazing from the sandwiches, french pastries and coffee/tea.
This was booked 6 months ago and was a very special day.

Special thanks to Carolina and Ben who we dealt with regarding the booking as we added 2 people. They was so efficient and friendly too.",5,2018,02,15
113,Lovely hotel - great customer service,"I stayed here with my wife and 12 year old son for one night, as we had tickets for Cirque Du Soleil at the Royal Albert Hall. We had a wonderful stay, the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome, and there was a nice surprise for my son when we got to the room. The hotel has a nice cozy feel to it, the beds were comfy, the room was a good size and very quiet, and the breakfast in the morning was excellent. The Albert Hall is about 15 minutes walk, and it is also convenient for other attractions in Kensington. Will definitely return.",5,2018,02,15
113,Beautiful suite and lobby - staff could be better,"We often have dinner at this hotel, and we've taken guests a few times.  The service in the lobby and restaurant can be less than polished.  Most of the managers are professional, but some of the staff behave like it's their first day - even though we know they've been there for a while.  We keep coming back because the space is really lovely, the food is mostly good, and it's close to where we live.

On Christmas day we decided to have a treat and stay in the Knightsbridge Suite.  It's magnificent, with a separate sitting area that even had a small Christmas tree.  We arrived early and were allowed to check into the room, but clearly the staff weren't completely ready for us.  I was thirsty, so I called the front desk to ask if any of the items in the bar were complimentary -- there was no price list at all, so it wasn't clear.  The woman at the desk answered, 'no, they are not complimentary, you have to pay for anything you take.'  Even in the Knightsbridge suite, at ¬£1,000 a night??  Usually, you at least get bottled water.  I called the front desk again and asked for the manager this time, and she very nicely said to go ahead and have whatever we wanted.  So I had a chocolate bar and water. (Honestly, Kensington - was that so hard?) So, again -- good managers, hopeless staff. 

It got better.  The manager sent up a big bouquet of flowers, fruit, bottled water, and a few other treats.  So it came together in the end, but with a few hiccups.  

Overall, we enjoyed ourselves.  Christmas dinner was very nice, as was breakfast the next morning.  The entire lobby area is magical.  We will probably keep coming back to have drinks and dinner here because we enjoy the space. With just a bit more training of the staff, this place would be perfect.",4,2018,02,14
113,"A gracious, hospitable and memorable experience","My sister and I were recently in London for two nights and I had made a reservation at the Kensington Hotel based on the reviews and photos I had seen online, it was otherwise a new experience.
From the moment we arrived we were made to feel welcome in every way. The reception and all the sitting rooms and dining areas were filled with the most beautiful authentic furnishings and paintings, fires were going. It was welcoming, comfortable and yet elegant.
We had arrived after a 24 hour flight so were tired and jet lagged but managed an early dinner, steak and vegetables, which was completely delicious, before going to bed. Our room was perfect in every way, comfortable beds, lovely bathroom, coffee making facilities and everything you could want in a room away from home.
Breakfast the next morning was impressive, a superb buffet but also a comprehensive menu, excellent and immediate but subtle service, great coffee, open fires, newspapers, excellent choice of books on the shelves, it was like staying with a hospitable and generous family in a beautiful home, filled with antiques and paintings. All staff were amazing, but a special thank you to Thomas for the wonderful and warm conversation and a fascinating history and background to the hotel itself.
The experience was professional yet personal and of an exceptional quality. The Kensington Hotel will now be my hotel of choice for whenever I am staying in London. Thank you to you all.",5,2018,02,13
113,A great hotel and a great staff,"This hotel is very beautiful and luxurious, but the relationship between quality and price is good. You are very near to South Kensington tube station, and you are well connected with every site of the city. Great breakfast. The rooms aren‚Äôt large but are enchanting and comfortable. All the hotel is perfectly clean. I want to underline the professionalism of the staff. They are kind, smiling and available in every time of day and night. We will certainly return when we‚Äôll come back in London.",5,2018,02,12
113,Classic hotel,"Checked in late to the hotel but got very good service from the reception. 
Received a very big room in the basement.. Had some problem with the AC.. 
But clean room, love the bathroom. 
Location is good.. Walking distance to Harrods",4,2018,02,12
113,Wonderful  themed afternoon tea,"My daughter and I enjoyed a wonderful 'Tale as old as time' themed afternoon tea at the Kensington Hotel yesterday. From the moment we arrived the service was friendly and attentive. The table was laid beautifully with a Lumiere candelabra and a Cogsworth clock suggesting the delights to come. The food was delicious - even the grey stuff (a super white chocolate mousse) !!  All the little pies, sweet cakes, jellies and treats were beautifully presented and linked to the story and were SO edible, in fact so delicious we brought some home. The rose petal decorations were a simple, thoughtful touch. It was lovely to see a little girl at a another table so entranced by the whole experience.  Well done to all the staff and thank you, we had a lovely afternoon.",5,2018,02,10
113,MY FAVOURITE IN LONDON,"I stayed there last autumn for a romantig getaway. The reservations team knew it because I mentioned it and they gave us a really nice room.

The whole stay was simply magical. The decor couldnt be nicer, the brakfast was just a delight and the location is simply the best in London if you want to be central but still in a quiet and charming area.

I will always keep very special memories of this hotel. I really can't wait to go back again!",5,2018,02,10
113,Lovely stay at The Kensington,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Kensington. We took the tube from Heathrow, and the short walk from Kensington Station. From the moment George met us at the door we felt right at home. As all of the public rooms were decorated beautifully for the holidays we enjoyed having tea by the Christmas tree with the cozy fire in the fireplace. Our room was lovely, bright and sunny, with a view overlooking Queen‚Äôs Gate. It was extremely small, but I was limited to a Superior Queen when I made the booking. I will make sure a Deluxe room is available for our next stay which we will look forward to!",5,2018,02,08
113,Amazing Amazing Amazing,"Took my fiancee here for her birthday for the weekend, we also had the Beauty and the beast afternoon tea. What can i say....

For anyone that is looking for a weekend away in the Kensington area do not look anywhere else. 5*****",5,2018,02,05
113,Fabulous afternoon tea,"Me, my sister and brother in law came here yesterday for afternoon tea. It was beauty and the beast themed and was wonderful. We booked back in July due to high demand and was worth the wait and almost ¬£45 per head. The food was delicious, especially the bite size venison pie for starters, i would come back just for a larger version of the pie. The last part which was sandwiches, macaroons, biscuits was wonderful and all fit nicely with the theme which the servers explain when they bring them out. We were also accomanied by Mrs Potts, Lumiere and Cogsworth! All the staff were brilliant and overall a wonderful afternoon tea. I look forward to staying at the hotel in the future. Well done to the team! ",5,2018,02,04

113,Don't think twice!,"Beautiful hotel, elegant without being fussy.  Excellent location very close to the tube, and walkable to many sights (Kensington Palace, Notting Hill, Harrod's).  Writing this review because other reviews helped me choose it, and I want to pass that on!  The Kensington is an absolute delight, look forward to staying again.",5,2018,01,24
113,Amazing hotel and service,Can't say enough about this hotel.  Every detail- both design and service- were perfect.  Every employee we came across was friendly and helpful.  The hotel was luxurious but also homey- not an easy thing to do.  We only had breakfast and drinks but was very impressed with food and service.  Continental breakfast was so much better than what you would expect from a continental breakfast.  Everything was very fresh and well presented.  We also had full breakfast included in our room.  Would recommend the Kensington to anyone coming to London for any reason,5,2018,01,24
113,Beautiful Hotel,"I recently visited The Kensington Hotel with my two daughters for the Tale As Old As Time afternoon tea for my birthday treat. It looks a beautiful hotel although we only saw the reception lounge and the room where we ate.  There was a welcome roaring fire after coming in from the cold weather outside and also a very warm welcome from the staff who greeted us.  We were shown to our table and all the waiters were so friendly, helpful and very charming.  The tea itself was very nice with the Beauty and the Beast theme.  We were a very awkward group to cater for comprising of a vegetarian, a nut allergy sufferer and one daughter has wheat intolerance but all our needs were dealt with very efficiently and nothing was too much trouble. My only criticism which has been mentioned by others is that I was given brioche rolls with jam and Nutella and although this fits in with the French theme I would have much preferred the traditional scones, jam and cream but overall a lovely experience.",4,2018,01,24
113,I would live forever in this hotel,"My stay was absolutely perfect! I cannot imagine a better hotel. I think that staff is one of the most important things in a hotel and Kensington staff was very friendly and helpful. George and the people from the front door are very welcome, Front Office Manager (Valeriia), Silvia and Benjamin from the restaurant were extremely helpful during my stay as well as all the staff. The hotel is very well located (near Victoria and Albert, Harrods, Shopping area, Museums, Kensington Gardens) and I love this area of London. Room was stunning as well as the common areas, afternoon tea and restaurant. I would recommend this hotel to all travelers! ",5,2018,01,24
113,Simply The Best,"The Kensington is my preferred choice of Hotel while visiting London for either business or pleasure. The staff are excellent, courteous, friendly and extremely helpful and cannot do enough for you.

I always relax and unwind as soon as I arrive at the Hotel after a hectic day of business.  ",5,2018,01,23

113,Fantastic location for a family week end!,"A nice and friendly classical hotel in the hart of Kensington. The staff was very helpful, and we send our thanks to Martins, Mike, Guido and Ronnie for contributing to a perfect week end!

",5,2018,01,21
113,Fabulous stay,"Stayed in this lovely hotel last night while attending the Royal Albert Hall. Staff were charming on check in and our room was very comfortable with everything you could possibly need. I particularly like the lounge areas which were beautifully laid out cosy and comforting with excellent service excellent all day dining menu, can recommend the club sandwich and scrumptious cocktails. We didn‚Äôt have to check out until 12 which was nice although we did depart earlier. The toiletries are aromatherapy Associates which are yummy and such a treat. I will definitely stay here again and would be more than happy to recommend to friends and family. Well done Kensington.",5,2018,01,21

113,Beauty and the beast afternoon tea,"What a superb experience - 5 star service!! 

The service was incredible, from the moment we arrived to when we left. The team couldn't do enough to make not only ours, but everyone's experience very special.

The environment was relaxed, comfortable, and immaculate. 

The food was tasty, and we all enjoyed the selection of afternoon tea. The attention to detail on the themed food was amazing. It was served in good timing, and we weren't rushed at any point. 

I would highly recommend the beauty & beast afternoon tea, you definitely get value for money. ",5,2018,01,21
113,Three days in London,"Few days in London prior to business meetings conference etc. 

Excellent hotel, super friendly staff at reception, house keeping and in the restaurant. 

Loved the decor in the restaurant. 

Excellent breakfast each day and so too was the afternoon tea. 

All in all a great stay and will definitely book again. ",5,2018,01,21
113,Magical Afternoon Tea experience,"My friend and I greatly enjoyed the Tale As Old As Time Afternoon Tea in the Lounge room. We loved everything about it and were very impressed by the effort the staff and chefs went to to ensure we were catered for properly as my friend has a gluten intolerance and I a caffeine intolerance. It was lovely to receive a phone call the day before to confirm booking details and staff were un-phased by us arriving late due to trains. Although they were very busy turning tables around we never felt rushed.
The food was divine - great if you have a sweet tooth - and elements of the film were beautifully represented and perfectly executed in a very clever manner. It was artwork!
I would personally like to thank our server, Barbara, for her exceptional hospitality and for making us feel so welcome and comfortable.
Absolutely spot on!",5,2018,01,17
113,"Exceptional Hotel, with Old World Charm and Customer Service that will Exceed Your Expectations","Words cannot express enough how Amazing my stay was a The Kensington Hotel.
From the moment I arrived till 2 weeks later on my departure, I consistently received 5 star service from all the Staff.  
Many thanks to Eladia, Barbara, Vincenzo, Lilia, in the restaurant for always remembering my order and expediting it in a timely fashion. 
To George the doorman that always had a smile on his face, was eager to help me find quaint places to go in the neighborhood...which by the way I went to the sweet shop you suggested! Thank you also for taking my picture on the elephant and the cruiser bike too! :) 
To the nice guy  that brought me steamed milk to my room at 4am very morning and Valerie the Manager for making me feel so welcome and accommodating throughout my stay....
Miss You All already.
Thank you to the Chef that was so kind to making adjustments for my ""clean diet"" lol - the food is absolutely wonderful in the Town House Restaurant!...this is coming from someone living in San Francisco and New York where restaurant standards are high
As an Elite Athlete, it is imperative I have a hotel with a good gym when I travel. The gym was not only open 24hrs but also offered a full range of  state of the art equipment by Life Fitness.
The Ambiance of the whole hotel is so warm and inviting with vases of lush freshly cut flowers and  inviting fire places to sit next to for a bite to eat or even afternoon tea, which by the way is booked 6 months out but a must!
The rooms are elegantly decorated each with it's own character but the most inviting at the end of a long day especially when the nightly turn down service leaves chocolates on your pillow :)
I highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to experience the old world charm of London; a place where customer service comes naturally and will by far exceed your expectations.
See you all again soon!",5,2018,01,17
113,This how an hotel should be,"An amazing night spent here. Unfurtunately I was in The Kensington just for one night. However, everything was great. Special thanks to the staff and Veruska for the great welcome and assistance. You must try the breakfast!!!",5,2018,01,15
113,Fantastic weekend in London,"Great little hotel in a perfect Kensington location. We especially enjoyed the elegant bar and delicious breakfasts. The staff were brilliant, they really added to the experience. We will definitely return.",5,2018,01,14
113,Great service,From moment we arrived we we were made to feel welcome.The staff are the main attribute of this comfortable and warm hotel.Peaceful inside but close to many attractions .The only drawback was our room a bit small with a poor view but changing it was not a problem and we were very happy with our new room.Plenty of helpful staff around all the time.Food was good and the hotel was very relaxing,4,2018,01,12
113,Comfort & Convenience ,"The Kensington staff was friendly, attentive & amazing.  The public rooms were beautiful and inviting as was the restaurant and bar service. Our room was small and had little place to store clothing, however, the bed was plush and extremely comfortable, the room was clean and staff very accommodating with towels, pillows etc.  At one point we blew a fuse and the electric went off.  We called down to the desk and within minutes, the desk sent the electrician and we were back on.  The hotel is 2 blocks from South Kensington Station.  There are excellent breakfast restaurants and gourmet bakeries in the two block radius as well as fine dining and Indian food.  ",5,2018,01,11
113,"GORGEOUS Stay, FABULOUS Location","Our stay was welcomed by the helpful front desk staff and accentuated by the suggestions provided by George (meeting him upon your stay is a MUST!) Our room was impeccable with heated bathroom floors, a Nespresso and the most comfortable bed of our entire stay in various countries in Europe.

The bar, breakfast and ambiance is top notch, with multiple fireplaces and nooks throughout the lobby.

Location was close to the ""Tube"" and very easy to get around- VERY close to Kensington and charming spots around the neighborhood.

This hotel MADE OUR STAY in London. My husband and I cannot wait to return.",5,2018,01,10
113,5 Star,"The Kensington was an amazing hotel and experience. From the moment we arrived, they knew our names, had water ready, and started providing tips and help to navigate our visit. George was an asset to the hotel, and made this one of our most memorable hotel experiences. The breakfast was nice, the lounge, and bar; the rooms were attended to. The location was perfect, close to the subway, and quiet at night. The neighborhood was close to parks and restaurants, and coffee shops. We absolutely would go back to Kensington the next time in London.",5,2018,01,10
113,A great stay,"Very well located, the Kensington provides very good service and excellent prestations.
We've spent a lovely week-end. Very quiet and familial hotel. I can recommend this hotel and will certainly choose it for my next stay in London.",5,2018,01,09
113,Lovely stay,"Perfectly located in the quiet though central quarter of South Kensington, the hotel provides a cosy and sophisticated accommodation for anyone wishing to be comfortably close to exhibits and tourist sites. The main hall, furnished with fireplaces and sofas, gives the visitor a warm welcome. The perfectly-trained staff does the rest... 
As for the rooms, the style is researched though sober and somehow reassuring... 
I would definitely recommend, both for families and for couples looking for a cosy retreat.

113,5 star individuality and personable service  ,"What a delight it was to stay here . From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we were greeted warmly . The lady who checked us in took us to our room personally, she couldn‚Äôt have been kinder . The hotel has a wonderful old world charm and class to it . Room was a good size . There wasn‚Äôt one staff member who disappointed us . From housekeeping to front desk to concierge to waitering staff , all well trained and again service with a warm personal touch .

113,A hotel worth your while,"Great hotel with great service. Rooms are spacious -for the London standard, that is- and very clean, confortable and nice. The location is great on South Kensington (residential) and just a few blocks away from the underground. Perfect for a 5 day visit to the city. (Our trip was actually on Jan 2017)",5,2018,01,07
113,Birthday Tea ,"My daughters took me to a  ‚Äòa tale as old as time‚Äô / beauty and the beast themed afternoon tea for my birthday!

We weren‚Äôt rushed so felt like we got personal service, would highly recommend ",5,2018,01,06
113,Short Trip to London,My wife and I stayed at the hotel for one night before flying to Australia. The Reception Staff and Concierge staff were excellent from our arrival. They were attentive and very professional ensuring our needs were met throughout the short visit. Excellent service. ,5,2018,01,04
113,Amazing 5 star hotel!,"We arrived on a cold and rainy day. When we entered the hotel we received an immediate warm response from the staff and all the roaring fireplaces. All the staff was super helpful and friendly, but some that stood out were: George, Barbara, Gvido, Justine, Catalin, Alex, Giovanni. Every meal at the hotel was delicious. It quickly became our favorite London hotel, and we hope to return.",5,2018,01,02
113,Elegant charm in every corner,"My family of 5 spent Christmas at the Kensington this year and were delighted in every way. 

First, the atmosphere. It's beautiful, elegant and charming in a very English way. Perfect for what we were looking for. The first floor has several different areas for sitting by various fireplaces, or eating, or just passing through. And each one was so lovely we found ourselves making time to spend in each one. Usually we are out-and-about types, but these rooms just felt like experiences we wanted to have. They were just so lovely. Especially decorated, but not over-decorated,  for Christmas.

The location was wonderful. 

But the most noteworthy aspect of our stay was all the personal touches. We arrived late at night on Christmas Eve, and were delighted to find that the room was made up specifically for our needs.  A king size bed for my husband and I and twin beds for each of the 3 kids ages 10, 12 and 14. So nice since we usually have to argue about which kids are required to share a bed. Then the first day of our trip was waking up Christmas morning, and the hotel had set out Christmas stockings for them, with a personalized card for each that had victorian illustrations of things that particularly interested each of them. (the hotel had emailed me before hand and asked about their interests). The stockings included oranges and sweets and books on London. It was a very appreciated touch. 

Other nice service touches included automatically handing each of us an umbrella as we walked out into the rainy day, and providing tips on the best ways to get to our destinations. 

They even pleasantly handled an odd request.  My daughter dropped her cell phone in a puddle while we were out. We called the hotel to see if they could help us find some uncooked rice. Not only did they provide the rice, they had filled an ice bucket with it, and had it waiting for us at the front desk so we didn't even have the delay of waiting until we got to our room. They were very sensitive to the ""urgency"" of a teenage girl's phone.

And lastly, the food. It had been our original plan to eat in as many different restaurants as possible just to have different experiences, and we did eat in many other great places. But we found ourselves drawn to eating in the hotel because the food was excellent and they would serve in any of the various sitting rooms.  So we had breakfast in the hotel every day. And we had drinks and late night snacks every night in different sitting rooms, and we even came in and had dinner in one of the lounges one night.  The food was wonderful. And the environments just drew us in.

A wonderful experience in every way.",5,2018,01,02
113,Worth every penny,"I stayed for couple of nights with my family during our short stay in London. Good but peaceful location. Room was small (as they tend to be) but well equipped with nice decor. 

Service and breakfast was impeccable.

Only minus I can think of, is the baby cot we got from the hotel. It was definitely made to last, but maybe something more up-to-date could be considered. Our baby was not provided any sheets so we needed to invent from material available. Towels etc. 

Good service. Will return.",5,2018,01,02
113,Simply Wonderful,"From the welcome at the door to the final farewell everything was simply perfect.

Very comfortable room and extremely luxurious bed, followed by a hearty breakfast this was Irish hospitality at it's best in the heart of London !

Every member of the team we came into contact with were nothing but polite and professional, I would single out the receptionist Diana as the star of the show !",5,2018,01,02
113,A Luscious and Festive Paradise -  Hotel of Dreams,"Phenomenal stay at the Kensington - the room was gorgeous, the Hotel was exquisite, food and beverages delicious, and the staff genuinely lovely and so happy to help and create a beautiful customer experience, particularly George. Staying just after Christmas, I was lucky enough to see the glorious decorations which amplified the cosiness of the hotel.
I will be coming back here time and time again, thoughout all seasons. Thank you, The Kensington.",5,2018,01,01
113,Love this hotel....,"Always stop at this hotel when visiting the Kensington area and never disappointed. The overall ambience is excellent and the staff always make the stay very pleasant... keep up the good work.

Look forward to visiting again, soon.",5,2018,01,01
113,Wonderful British Experience,"I selected this hotel for its location and that it could offer us a very British experience. The Kensington did live up to our expectations in every way. 

The location is excellent within walking or a short taxi ride to most attractions.

The rooms are well appointed with classical furniture. The bathrooms  are modern and stylish.

The reception and foyer areas are beautifully decorated with fresh flowers and stylish furnishings.

Breakfast was excellent with a good size buffet. The bar service was very good.

All round the service was of a very high standard. The door men and porters were very helpful and knew the area well and could guide us how and where to go.

We had a very enjoyable stay and can highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,12,31
113,"Fabulous hotel - great service, close to the tube and very convenient to many restaurants","Our superior room was small but adequate for our needs.  Impeccably kept and serviced. Staff was very solicitous and helpful at all times. Breakfast was complimentary and offered a wide variety of options.  Service was great and food nicely prepared.
A wonderful hotel convenient to the tube and many wonderful restaurants!",5,2017,12,29
113,Lovey hotel,"Pros:  outstanding service and staff. Attentive and thoughtful.  Lobby and lounge are beautiful. 

The food in the restaurant is excellent. We had then Christmas Dinner which was 5 courses. The venison was succulent and memorable. 

Cons: we had a superior room. The bathroom was compete but small and space efficient. The shower stall has a swinging glass half door that most Americans will find awkward. 

The bedroom was small but quaint. One downside was that the floor was uneven and bowed toward the center of the room making the luggage situation interesting

Bottom line: reasonable rates, excellent Staff and service.  A nice place to stay in London ",4,2017,12,27
113,Boutique hotel in London,"This hotel is very well located. You can walk to museums, to Sloane Square and Harrods and at the same time you have excellent restaurants nearby and a great choice of bars and bakeries. You are 5 minutes walking to the tube and buses. The hotel is very quaint and has a very nice lounge bar area.
Staff is very friendly and helpful.  Some rooms can be extremely dark so you do need to request a bright room facing the streets ... ",4,2017,12,27
113,50th Birthday Celebration ,Stayed at The Kensington for my 50th Birthday celebration. The staff could not have been more helpful or done more to make the stay better. We had lovely rooms and a fantastic breakfast on the Saturday morning before we left. Only regret is that we were not able to stay longer. Wonderful hotel!,5,2017,12,27
113,A dream come true,"This was my first time to London and I will be back. The Kensington provided upscale accommodation smothered in British charm and elegance. The service was Superior to any place I had stayed and the restaurant provided an ambiance that you would read in many classic literature novels that I read as a kid. (The lobster spaghetti was excellent.) 

I had always had dreamt of coming to London and the Kensington made it an absolute dream come true. I will be back.",5,2017,12,26
113,First Trip to London,"The Kensington Hotel was amazing. It was absolutely beautifully decorated for Christmas, and it could not have felt cozier! The staff was incredible! George, Martins, Martyn, and Ronnie were super helpful and very kind. They made me feel at home. The first night I was brought a birthday dessert, just because my mom mentioned part of the reason we were traveling was to celebrate it. I can‚Äôt wait to return to London and when I do I will be staying at the Kensington again!",5,2017,12,25
113,Lunch/Tea,"Went for specialty Lunch and tea from my Son and Sophie, service was excellent theme was beauty and the beast it was done extremely well with chip the cup the clock candelabra. It was a delicious tea with savoury‚Äôs as well as sandwiches and cakes, great afternoon Although we didn‚Äôt stay at this hotel on this occasion we are sure to do in future",5,2017,12,24
113,Elegant and warm pre-Holiday Stay!!,This was my first visit to this hotel and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed !! Very convenient to the Tube and lots of restaurants in the neighborhood. The staff was warm and helpful and the decor elegant but comfortable. The breakfast was very nice with enough choices. The only negative‚Äîand a small one‚Äîwas inconsistent warm water temperature in the shower which I mentioned to the front desk. I‚Äôm sure they were quick to take care of this. I‚Äôm often in London at this time of the year and there‚Äôs no doubt I‚Äôll return to the Kensington!!,4,2017,12,23

Friendly, clean and beautiful hotel in South Kensington.",5,2017,12,23
113,Exceptional stay,"Thoroughly enjoyed my brief stay for business meetings.  Upgraded in a junior suite which was more than large enough for two people to be comfortable.  Had a minor issue with the room upon check in but it was immediately resolved beyond my satisfaction.  No issues with noise from the street, although the old floors do squeak quite a bit.  Excellent service from all staff which appeared to be mostly Italian.  Would recommend including breakfast with your room rate - well worth it for the variety and not much more than ordering a la carte.  Bar was lively with pre-theater patrons having cocktails but overall feel was very comfortable and intimate in the parlor.  Excellent area for ease of transit both within London and to Heathrow on the blue line.  The only (very minor) negative is that the toiletries were too generic - would have loved something from a local purveyor to give it an extra local touch.  Overall, a much more enjoyable and elegant experience than the larger luxury hotels in the more touristy areas.  Will be my first choice upon return.",5,2017,12,21
113,Excellent area,"It took a few trips to figure out this is the best location when visiting London,  It‚Äôs Located on the south west part of London, the area is stunning and there is just something really cool about waking up to a view of the Victorian buildings, townhouses, museums and the Kensington palace is just a bliss. The hotel is located along Queensgate and it‚Äôs fabulously well decorated.
The rooms are of a decent size and the staff were really awesome. 
I would stay here again.",5,2017,12,21
113,Charming and magnificent ,"We stayed here on our honeymoon while visiting London and loved this fantastic hotel. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, especially George the bellman. The downstairs parlor was a great spot to relax with a drink after dinner. Overall a fantastic experience ",5,2017,12,20
113,best little hotel in london.,"all dressed up for christmas. a pleasure to return again.
staff seem to be changing but all maintain a great standard, nothing is too much trouble, ever.
ideally placed for harrods, walking distance and surrounded by some of the best restarants in town.
breakfast is as much as anyone can eat.
trendy and brilliant",5,2017,12,20
113,Tale as Old as Time Afternoon Tea,"Myself and my partner visited here for the Tale as Old as Time Afternoon Tea for our 3 year anniversary in November 2017. 

We had a lovely afternoon and were made to feel very welcome. The food is delicious and you really do get a lot of food, I was worried as my partner has a rather big appetite but even he was feeling full by the end of the meal!

We also opted to have the champagne which was lovely. 

The only thing that takes this to 4 stars instead of 5 is that we had inquired beforehand about the use of mayonnaise in some of the sandwiches. The staff were very accommodating and put a note on our reservation to ensure no mayonnaise would be used. When we arrived our waiter also inquired to double check. However once we got our sandwiches we saw that we did not get the salmon or chicken sandwiches at all. These had been replaced with a pea hummus sandwich and so unfortunately for us we missed out. I believe there may have been a misunderstanding. However this only slightly marred our visit, and the pea hummus was delicious!

Definitely give it a go, especially if you are a Disney fan!",4,2017,12,20
113,Good but could be better.,"We stayed at the Kensington Hotel for one night. At arrival we were greeted politely by the door staff and the check in was very fast, no fuss.
We booked a superior room, initially the room we were allocated was absolutely tiny, with a horrible view over some extractor fans. When we asked to change the room, the receptionist was happy to look into it  and after 5 minutes we were moved to a room facing the street which was slightly bigger but the bathroom was still tiny, you could hardly move around it. I am not sure if this is the London standard but you would expect a little more space for ¬£200 per night. Nonetheless, the room was very clean, and the bed was very comfortable with good quality linen. The room was equipped with lots of extras, such tea/coffee making facilities, complementary bottle of water, complementary toiletries, even cotton pads to remove your make up, in case you've forgotten to bring your own, umbrella that you can use if it rains etc. These are little touches that make a difference. On the other hand, the bath robes and towels were not soft, they were really hard and uncomfortable. The curtains were dated and they need to be changed because they look really tired (room 317). 
The lounge of the hotel was very classy and really comfy to sit and have a drink, I liked that the cushions were always fluffed up and the tables clean. Staff nicely dressed, professional and polite. 
Location wise, on a quite street but 5 mins from Gloucester Road tube station which was great. Overall we had a pleasant stay, and I would recommend this hotel, but there is always room for improvement.",4,2017,12,19
113,"Excellent Service, Cozy atmosphere, Great Location","We loved the Kensington Hotel!  While our actual room was quite small and a bit cramped, that fact was quickly overshadowed by all that the hotel had to offer. We arrived jet lagged ahead of check in, but were able to relax in one of the cozy common/parlor areas.  We were given a menu offering a variety of beverages and juicies and I was immediately impressed with the healthy factor of the menu... inclusive of smoothies, fresh squeezed juices etc.  The seating area was nicely furnished, comfortable, included a couple of fireplaces and occupied by people meeting, chatting, working independently etc.  The staff/service was exceptional but not intrusive.  We were more than happy to just relax while we waited for our room.

Our food and beverage experience was the best.  I loved the menu... a smart, healthy and sophisticated menu!  The ""dining room"" was also very nice as was the bar... a good healthy buzz there. Service was very very good.

Location was also great... a 10 minute walk from the South Kensington tube station...10 minute walk to Brompton Road. 

Fitness Center was better than anticipated for a European hotel, though only one elliptical.  Nonetheless, spacious and a variety of equipment.  Accessible 24/7.

I would return in an instant and highly recommend to anyone!",5,2017,12,19
113,Almost stayed another extra night,"There is a small but lovely gym with new equipment. There is a bar in the back of the restaurant reserved for hotel guests  
Wow. Service, decor, wine, food. I'm pretty jaded and hard to please but this place doesn't disappoint...The service is truly next level, Bellmen Ronnie and George and housekeeping staff get five stars and are always prompt and friendly.",5,2017,12,17
113,Classic hotel with a beautiful lobby and lounge,"The Kensington Hotel is a stylish hotel in a great location. The museums, parks and South Kensington Tube station are only a short walk away. The staff is outstanding, unfailing helpful and polite.  The dining room is superb as is the lobby lounge fully decorated for Christmas and with roaring fires in the fireplaces at every turn.

My only negative observation would be the very small rooms and level of noise but that is what you get with such an old hotel full of character.",5,2017,12,17
113,A place where the guest is truly the top priority,"My primary reason to return to The Kensington time after time is the great staff and the way they make you feel valued and welcome.
Yes, it's fairly expensive, but the location, the quality of the public spaces and the charming, if not overly large, rooms make up for it. It has this old-world charm and confidence only very few hotels excude.
Food and beverage in the restaurant and bar are great, there's a good gym and Hyde Park is only a 10-minute walk away
Highly recommended!",5,2017,12,16
113,Best staff and beautiful hotel,"Second time here. Want to visit over and over and will always choose this hotel when in London. Sweetest man named George, makes the stay perfect, so welcoming and friendly!! 

And the venue is amazing, so chic and fabulous!! Very soft beds that one could spend all day in.

The delicious breakfast with healthy options is also a big, big plus! 

Nothing but good things to say!!",5,2017,12,13
113,Short visit in London made much better by hotel staff,"It was the location of The Kensington that attracted me, but it was the friendly, helpful staff that will draw me to return.  The front desk staff was very welcoming and the concierge really provided good advice and transportation information.  Very nice stay and I would happily return.",5,2017,12,11
113,Family trip,George was amazing and very helpful!! Loved the hotel amazing staff and location we really likes the area and they hotel is very luxurious our room is on the floor and very well! The coffee was really good too! Loved staying outside the entrance,5,2017,12,11
113,Always a pleasure,"Third stay this year and it is always a pleasure, whatever the season. Staff are always so welcoming and the beautifully appointed lounges a comfortable spot for a drink or a meal. Tastefully decorated for Christmas this time - last visit it was Wimbledon time. Had breakfast in the restaurant this trip and as expected it was excellent. Had one of my favourite rooms with outlook to Old Brompton Road.",5,2017,12,10
113,Phenomenal,"Phenomenal hotel with an incredibly view and amenities for the room. Honestly, we loved everything about this place. Great price, great location, incredible bed, great atmosphere.  The lobby has a super high ceiling making it feel spacious was great for power meetings, interviews and people on their laptop and ipads. 
 Kudos to Michael at the concierge, George at the lobby & bartender Jamesand his colleagues for making my stay memorable. They took the time to listen to and understand my drinks likes and dislikes and then recommended something appropriate,",5,2017,12,10
113,4th visit to my favorite London Hotel,"My wife and I recently stayed again at the Kensington.  It is our favorite hotel in the UK.  The studio suites are well appointed and it is especially nice to have a Nespresso machine in the room.  The morning breakfast buffet is varied and quite good and the full breakfast menu is excellent. The lobby and sitting areas just call out for you to relax and enjoy the International New York Times along with your favorite beverage.  However the best compliment I can extend is that the Staff are amazing!  Every single interaction with staff is pleasant, and they are always happy to help with even the smallest inquiry.  The South Kensington neighborhood is fabulous with great restaurants and easy tube access. I highly recommend",5,2017,12,08
113,Hotel stay was pleasant,"The rooms were very spacious with actual Queen beds, not full beds, and there were always plenty of towels for 4 people.  The location is great, but where this hotel shines is the staff. I cannot say enough about the friendliness, attitude, and exceptional help the entire staff showed for our visit. Being in customer service for more than 5 years, I guess my expectations are high and were all met. Lol! Team members George and Cillian have been great! Thank you,. Great customer service goes a long way!",5,2017,12,08
113,A tourist home with business facilities,"This is a nice hotel in a great location and probably one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. The people at the front desk were so nice especially George, Ramona and Michael who went above and beyond to accommodate.  The modern style theme is well done and feels comfortable and elegant.  Breakfast on the floor each morning was very convenient too.  It offered a nice selection of breads and pastries you could get toast, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, fruit, cereal, juice and coffee, you could also enjoy the breakfast sitting on your couch or even enjoy breakfast in your pajamas by pressing 0 and calling for a room service. The fitness room is solid.  No pool though but comfortable enough for a good workout.
¬Ω a mile walk to the museums and what as terrific location - right in the heart of things, and walking distance to much of what any tourist would want to see.
All in all, a very solid effort, and a good place to stay if you're visiting London for business or tourism.",5,2017,12,07
113,Opulence with the best service,"Wow!  I believe I have found a new platinum standard for excellence that rivals and perhaps excels the big five hotels in London yet still remain relaxed and individual.

What makes this absolute gem of a hotel stand out is the excellent guest service.  Every single person - check-in desk clerk Ramona, the bell-hops George and Ronnie, the concierges, housekeeping, room service staff who delivered my food to the room with a brilliant attitude and took the tray there after were really good.

Rich, opulent rooms and lounging areas, great choice of British dining (from a quick and casual bar snack or bar food to sophisticated and ultra formal wining and dining inside the townhouse restaurant), great cocktail bar next room too.

Luxuriously appointed rooms that are elegant and understated - they don't scream opulence at you but it's obvious in every little detail.  The superior rooms are comfortable but not huge and this was expected.  The bed was really comfortable and the thermostat very efficient, multiple international plugs, bed side notebook and pencil, the coffee maker was also a nice touch.

I would return here in a heartbeat to enjoy more of this world class service and elegance.",5,2017,12,06
113,A tale as Old as Time,"Having missed the first round of openings for the afternoon tea in February, I signed up for the waiting list and managed to get a reservation for today, booking in June. Well... it was 109% worth the wait and I can tell why there was such high demand! Our server Paul was knowledgeable about the film and food, explained everything brilliantly and was very pleasant. The hotel itself is visually beautiful, especially the Christmas decorations. I have done a lot of themed afternoon teas and so far this one is the best. Every member of staff was brilliant, and I‚Äôd like to make a special mention to the manager Ben who came over and had a chat with us too. He went above and beyond and exceeded our expectations. We are booking up again for this themed afternoon tea and I would definitely visit again. ",5,2017,12,06
113,Excellent hotel,Love it. My second stay here - will return. It's a lovely hotel with fantastic service. I love the hotel bar and the location. A very nice neighborhood with several restaurants nearby and only a 3 min. walk to South Kensington metro. ,5,2017,12,06
113,Amazing Afternoon,"4 of us booked for this afternoon tea experience.  Beautiful hotel, great service and a lovely way to spend time with our daughters. We were allocated a lovely table with lots of room and the room was not overcrowded which made it feel very exclusive.  Food well explained and nothing was too much trouble.  Would most definitely recommend. The only improvements could have been to play music from Beauty and the Beast and also maybe to sell the tea pot/cup/clock/candle stick - we would definitely have purchased these and were mildly disappointed that there was not not the opportunity to do so.",5,2017,12,06
113,excellent location,"The hotel has a beautiful foyer which looked stunning with the Christmas decorations.
The room decor is of a standard that you would expect from a 5 star hotel. 

As I was travelling with my adult daughter, I requested 2 seperate beds and was advised that yes they could provide this, I then arrived to find out that they can NOT do this. Their idea of twin beds is one bed with seperate duvet / linen, but one mattress. 
The bed was comfortable, but had no choice of pillows with the pillow provided being very soft.

The staff service was very good. Rooms were clean and well maintained.
The gym in the basement was excellent. It was much larger and better equipped than I have seen in other hotels.

The hotel locations was excellent, being only a 5 minute walk to Sth Kensington station which is on the line to most attractions.",4,2017,12,06
113,Understated Luxury,"We had a Beauty and the Beast themed afternoon tea. It was exquisite. The whole experience was a delight. The service was 2nd to none, we enjoyed it so much we sat in the hotel until 1800hrs, (we sat down to eat at 1200hrs). We did move to the lounge where the excellent service continued. When I visit the capital again it will be my hotel of choice.",5,2017,12,05
113,I'd give it 10 stars,"this hotel was one of the highlights of the trip- normally I could care less where I stay. Just need a clean, quiet bed. But this hotel may have changed all that. The service was A+++, every Employee I encountered was sweet, kind & gracious. The room was beautiful, soft , cozy with a lot of little touches that made it special. On check in- the front desk gave me a small glass of watermelon juice with some herbs- so nice. I was early and they front desk seemed delighted to let me know the room was clean and available- I love this place- I HIGHLY recommend.",5,2017,12,05
113,Usual high comfortable standard expected from  Doyle hotel,"The hotel is so stylish but comfortable at the same time, we spent 2 nights as a 3 generation family unit, the youngest member only being 12 months. The rooms were slightly on the small side but we had everything we needed. The staff were so friendly and kind, unfortunately as quite often happens with babies our youngest member of the unit caught a tummy bug, I think because the outside temperatures were so cold, and the staff were so kind in changing beds etc at 2.00am in the morning.
Breakfasts were excellent as was the dinner we ate in the bar on the first night and the staff could not have been more attentive. Highly recommend location great fo the museums, Knightsbridge etc",5,2017,12,02
113,Beauty and the beast afternoon Tea,"A Lovely Themed afternoon tea.

It was worth the wait !!

Thank you for death us a little earlier then our time.

Good was all to a good level with a wide range of variety from savouries , sandwiches , and sweet treats.

Our waiter was a little lapse with a few things like forgetting hot tea ,  etc but the overall time was lovely.

Good portions with two rounds of sandwiches.

The hotel is absolutely beautiful and very Christmasy would love to return next time to the bar",5,2017,12,01
113,Fabulous location and wonderful staff,"It is a beautiful hotel with truly beautiful facilities.This hotel can always be relied upon to give customers a pleasant experience. Helpful staff, good location and comfortable surroundings ensured we had another good overnight stay in London.
oved this hotel and staff was fantastic as well. Rooms were lovely. Location was fantastic...",5,2017,12,01
113,Anniversary Night,The room was very small but the hotel is STUNNING. The staff is friendly and quick to assist. We didn't even leave for dinner or drinks! The restaurant and bar located in the hotel offer so many options that we didn't need to wander. We stayed in the lobby for drinks after dinner and it was relaxing and beautiful. Loved our night there. ,4,2017,11,29
113,Value value value,"It is a beautiful hotel with truly beautiful facilities. Our suite was quite pricey, but we were EXTREMELY delighted with it because the room was spacious, windows were big (for this I have to say a separate thank you to the girl manager from the reception) and the setting was sooo beautiful and traditionally British - that it is the only way we want to stay in London from now on. It was really worth the money we payed and this hotel itself has become one of our dear memories from this trip. We also loved the area, because it is really close to the tube, it is near many museums and shopping centers and yet, not too noisy and crowded.",5,2017,11,29
113,Exceptional Staff,"We booked 2 rooms for nights to celebrate our daughters birthday. Every single member of staff in this hotel go beyond the call of duty to make sure your every need and want is catered for. They are truly exceptional and we would not hesitate in recommending this establishment to anyone. We had bookings elsewhere and did not get to sample the afternoon tea or the restaurant but the breakfast menu is extensive and the food very well executed. We will definitely return. The location is very convenient , 5 minutes walk form Harrods and on the door step of the Natural History museum. There is a tube station very close by - but if like us you prefer to drive there is also a reasonably priced (for London) long stay car park within a few hundred yards in Harrington Road which charged us ¬£ 116.00 for a stay from Friday lunch through to Sunday evening.",5,2017,11,27
113,Afternoon Tea at The Kensington ‚ÄúTale As Old As Time‚Äù,"Gorgeous family afternoon tea at The Kensington Hotel Townhouse for a special occasion. Lovely setting in the library mixing old world and contemporary. Very accommodating to our dietary requirements and very attentive to our children. Beautiful presentation of cakes and sandwiches and lovely selection of teas. Everything was delicious and the beauty and the beast themed pots,  cups and candelabras is lovely. Highly recommend. ",5,2017,11,26
113,Another good stay at The Kensington,"This hotel can always be relied upon to give customers a pleasant experience. Helpful staff, good location and comfortable  surroundings ensured we had another good overnight stay in London. We will undoubtedly stay at this hotel again.",4,2017,11,26
113,Nice Spot in South Ken,"Charming hotel in a great location for restaurants, museums and accessibility to the city or West End. Nice bar and public areas. Very pleasant and friendly service.  The only drawback was the size of the room.  For one person with an over-night bag it would have been fine.  For two people travelling for a month away the room was unmanageably small. ",4,2017,11,24
113,Fabulous location and wonderful staff,"I stayed here on business for two nights last week. After a busy day of meetings in Paris and a trip on Eurostar to London, I arrived late and was pretty tired but the welcome from staff was fantastic!
Rooms are well appointed and the in-room amenities are great (generous sizes of toiletries too).
I had a couple of meetings in the lounge area which is lovely and cosy, relaxed and quiet.
The food quality was superb and the breakfast spread was beautifully presented and plentiful.
I'd not hesitate in recommending this hotel to others looking for a convenient, central London base and a warm and welcoming 'home away from home'.",5,2017,11,21
113,The best on queensgate,"A  nice hotel on queensgate unlike most traps around London, Our room was clean, nicely designed, and most importantly the bed was incredibly comfortable. Customer service was great - from the moment we checked in till our last day. I ordered food late at night, and they were able to deliver it in 15 mins. Great service! The hotel is also very accessible to transport",5,2017,11,20
113,Back again,"A few lines cannot make justice to this wonderful hotel and staff. The hotel is perfect in every sense ( location, comfy beds, tasteful decoration, beautiful building, library,..)  and the warmest and most wellcoming staff I have ever come across...always smiling. Breakfast is still amazing. Outstanding hotel and by far the best option to stay in London",5,2017,11,19
113,Exquisite hotel experience!,"The Kensington was just lovely!  Beautiful decor, excellent location, wonderful and friendly staff & delicious food!  It made my first visit to London just Grand.  I cannot wait to return!! Everything was just wonderful.",5,2017,11,19
113,Special Treat,"Chose this hotel as visiting the Royal Albert Hall to see the Classical Spectacular and it was within walking distance of the Hall, the tube and also all the best museums such as the V&A. It turned out that the Kensington was also Classical, a beautifully preserved and elegant Georgian building inside and out and also very Spectacular! Fantastic staff, service, food and rooms. Although a luxury hotel, it was welcoming and relaxed and not in the least pretentious. If you are looking for a special overnight or weekend treat this is the place to go.",5,2017,11,19
113,Beauty & Beast Afternoon Tea,"My wife had booked the Beauty and the Beast afternoon tea months ago as she wanted to go. The hotel is located conveniently close to South Kensington tube station and has a very helpful and welcoming front of house team - concierge and receptionists were very friendly and the lounge where we waited very comfortable.

I wasn't sure what to expect with the afternoon tea and perhaps due to my wife's high expectations I was expecting it to be a bit more themed than it actually was. In reality the theme is quite understated, there are no people dressed up or film music playing although all items on the afternoon tea have some link to Beauty and the Beast which is explained by the waiters. The themed crockery and and table decorations are a nice touch but if you are expecting a Beauty and the Beast wonderland, you will be disappointed. The surroundings are comfortable and staff attentive and the themed afternoon tea does seem very popular. The hotel restaurant does also cater for regular guests at the same time so I guess it can't be too heavily themed. The actual food on the afternoon tea was very nice although extremely rich, the Belle dress biscuits were a nice touch to take home as a souvenir. 

Overall this is a nice hotel and I would certainly consider staying or visiting again as the rooms look competitively priced compared to other five star hotels in the area.",4,2017,11,19
113,Fantastic,"Loved this hotel and staff was fantastic as well.  Rooms were lovely.  Location was fantastic and it was very easy to get around both the neighborhood and London in general.  Decor was gorgeous and lobby and restaurants were beautiful/good. 
",5,2017,11,17
113,5 Star all the way,"The hotel itself is great...beautiful, very clean, and the room is very spacious, overlooking other townhouses in the neighbourood. I loved mostly the cocktail bar where you could get all the drinks at an expensive bar. James and George are superstars and I hope to see you on my next visit. 5 star service all the way. I cannot speak highly enough about this venue",5,2017,11,16
113,Royalty size,"Kensington hotel is clean,  smells fresh and the whole area is refreshing with the best design in mind, This hotel has a  surprise  for those not in the know.... there is a private members club called alberts attached next to it!! I did not visit the club but it was very friendly and the staff were congenial from the entrance. 
World class customer service from Martyn, Vincent, George and everyone! From the entrance, you will be sweapt off your feet, the door man will welcome you with a warming smile and followed by a great to have you and I hope you enjoy your stay. Then the front desk will smile at you big,, then carry you on to the right and onto the elevators.  
From the street level you would think it‚Äôs a private members residence only, you walk into a  lobby area which is actually the best area and also you have to go up the 3 steps from the street or if you are disabled they have a step free access on your right to get to the hotel reception for check-in and concierge desk to your right.
Several restaurants, cute restroom for women, the lobby area is very spacious with lots of chairs and seating for impromptu meetings and to wait and charge up your phone and take a break.

I would not hesitate to live or stay here longer.",5,2017,11,16
113,wonderful stay,"I surprised my wife with a trip to London from NY. We stayed at The Kensington! For 5 nights we were treated like royalty.  The staff, the rooms, the food et al, were just wonderful. Everyone had a smile. A can do attitude rarely seen.",5,2017,11,16
113,Wowed from start to finish,"Lovely hotel in a great location! My husband and I stayed here after a friends wedding. We were skeptical at first because none of the local people knew of the hotel. But, the reviews were so great that we decided to give it a try. The service was spectacular from start to finish. 

We arrived to the hotel early morning. We didn't think the hotel room would be ready, but to our surprise it was and Diana at the reception was able to check us in and start exploring the city. Everyone at check in was spectacular! The concierge Vincent and George were  able to provide us with a list of popular attractions and the best places to eat, mobile apps to navigate traffic etc.

When we got up to the room, we were fully blown away! The rooms are magnificent! There is a large bathroom with a private toilet, walk in shower, and soaking tub. The walls of the bathroom are white greyish marble. The room is tastefully decorated, has a large TV, minibar, coffee  machine, and a phenomenal slumberland bed. We could not have been happier with the room or fantastic service. 

The hotel tastefully decorated and appears very modern and clean on the inside, while retaining the old townhouse charm and feel with hints of historical paintings. I would definitely stay here again!",5,2017,11,16
113,Afternoon tea delight ,"Booked the beauty and the beast afternoon tea and it was amazing, the staff were so attentive and friendly (shout out to Ali who made sure our visit was extra special by getting us a birthday surprise) which made the experience extra special plus the food was excellent. Highly recommend. ",5,2017,11,15
113,Super Awesome Hotel,"This Hotel is a super modern, chic, boutique style hotel conveniently located behind the christies gallery in kensington area... Totally picked this place because it reminded me soo much of the chelsea and kensington vibe. Big shoutout to George and Cillian for an awesome first class service. The rooms have a sleek design and the curtains block out light well. I highly recommend",5,2017,11,14
113,"Ah, London. ","London is an expensive city to visit, and Kensington is not a cheap part of London. Having said that The Kensington Hotel provides a luxurious experience at a price that won‚Äôt provoke a wince. The location is convenient to all the district has to offer and the tube is five mins or less. The hotel staff are most courteous and helpful and the lobby is an interesting and comfortable place to sit, and watch. The room I stayed in was very well appointed. 
When back in London, that‚Äôs where I will head for. ",5,2017,11,13
113,Memories and great stay,"The kensington hotel, It used to be an apartment building when I was a young guy so the rooms are spacious and townhouse build with English charm.
I had a great experience at this hotel and would definitely stay here again during my next trip to London. The staff were helpful and friendly, the rooms were spacious, comfortable, and tastefully appointed, and the hotel itself is very close to shopping, sites, public transit, restaurants and more.
Extra amenities streched Lobby and townhouse Restaurant: the lobby, which was also renovated, is charming and has a very inviting and warm feel. It includes a lot of seating, a fireplace, restaurant/lounge/ bar.",5,2017,11,13
113,Welcome Surprise,"We originally chose the 'The Kensington' for its location to the Albert Hall, and having read some of the reviews.

We travel to London from time to time from the west country and always have difficulty in finding good hotels.

All I can say is that 'The Kensington', is a welcome surprise.  The greeting at reception was first class, along with a complimentary soft drink while signing in.  The ambience, lighting, all compliment the stay, along with the helpfulness of the staff.  From the concierge to the waiters, room and bar staff, everyone was exceptionally helpful and courteous. 

We came back from the Albert hall for drinks before returning to our room and the bar area is quite magical, along with the warm glow of the fires. 

The room itself was very comfortable, clean, with no compliant in any area. A credit to the room staff.  The complimentary aromatherapy products were a really nice addition, which my wife indulged in!

We did have a room at the rear and had to contend a little with the air conditioning system on the roof, but this was not something that spoilt the stay.

We will definitely be going back next time we visit London.",5,2017,11,13
113,Golden stay,"Where do I start with this place?! The fact that they are located steps from the Kensington palace and hyde park gardens and is just amazing, but they have tons of other perks. They give you a welcome glass of fresh juice for you, a warm towel and the the hotel is well built and super luxurious yet comfortable. 

we enjoyed staying here a lot.",5,2017,11,12
113,GREAT LOCATION VERY CLEAN WITH LOVELY STAFF,"Stayed here for three nights.  Staff great and an excellent location with easy walk to South Kensington Tube, Museums and lots of shops and places to eat nearby.  Rooms well fitted with good aircon and Nespresso machine and a kettle! The only slight niggle being our bathroom was a bit tired.  But I would stay here again.",5,2017,11,12
113,The Best place to hide with brilliant service,"We had a wonderful experience at the kensington. It was more beautiful than the pictures can convey.¬†The rooms are fairly small but comfortable. There are plenty of wall plugs for electronics, a desk to work on your laptop, a flat screen tv about as big as one could fit.

the staff here are the best they are all lovely people¬†and welcoming. Cillian and George ensured that¬†all our guests have a comfortable experience,¬†Everything about it was special and lovely We can't recommend it enough.",5,2017,11,12

",5,2017,11,11
113,Luxurious hotel and perfect location,"We were impressed with The  Kensington Hotel from the moment we checked in with the friendly receptionist who offered us welcoming refreshments on arrival. When we mentioned we were staying for 4 nights we were upgraded to a larger room which was spacious and luxurious. The decor was beautiful and relaxing and we particularly loved the duck down and feather pillows. There was a lovely coffee maker which was a welcome extra. We had some wonderful cocktails in one of the many cosy lounges and the staff were so pleasant and helpful. We also had a delicious brunch in another lounge there which was very reasonably priced. The hotel is in a marvellous location with so many interesting places within walking distance such as The Natural History Museum, The Science Museum, The Victoria and Albert Museum and The Imperial College. The Kensington Hotel is also a short walk from the tube station. There are also many interesting restaurants and coffee shops nearby. We really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend it to anyone. It was also surprisingly good value for a luxury hotel.",5,2017,11,11
113,Hidden gem,"I just spent a night at the Kensington and wished it would have been longer. The location is ideal, in a beautiful neighborhood of London, walkimg distance to many major areas. The hotel feels like a private home and the ambience is peaceful and quiet. The staff, from the front desk to the concierge, doorman and restaurant is extremely friendly and attentive to your needs. I cannot wait to come back to London and stay there again. ",5,2017,11,11
113,"Excellent Hotel, Centrally Located",I had a pleasant experience at The Kensington. The hotel staff was very friendly and cheerful. The room was clean and well kept. The hotel itself is centrally located to most major London attractions. It is in walking distance from Gloucester Road tube station when travelling eastbound and South Kensington station westbound. It was about a 50 minute tube train ride from Heathrow.  Plenty of restaurants closer to each tube station in various price ranges. Also a few express grocery stores in the area. Will definitely stay here again. ,5,2017,11,10
113,A Family feel and friendly hotel,"I stayed at the kensington in London for a week or two earlier this Autumn!

There are a lot of great features: transit-wise, it's in a great location between two subway entrances, Gloucester road and south kensington which can get you to most parts of London and heathrow airport with at most one transfer. The staff is genuinely delightful and helpful! It was my first time in London, and they offered a lot of recommendations for places to go around the city that were away from tourists. The lobby does not look like your typical hotel lobby. It's very inviting and cozy when you want to have hot chocolate and a ginger or chocolate cookie late at night by the fireplace overlooking the great art pieces and the deco around the hotel. 

A sincere thank you to all the nice staff that work here who made me feel at home despite never meeting them before Especially Cillian was also very accommodative about the dietary requirements, The concierges Vincent George and Martyn who went above and beyond with endless recommendations of places to visit.",5,2017,11,10
113,A wonderful birthday stay,"The hotel history called my name and since I was taking Megabus to and from the city, it was close to the departure point.
Rented a room for my birthday and had a very pleasant experience. The room was very cozy and I loved the Art Deco style. The staff was helpful and answered all of my questions from check in to check out especially Cillian,Martyn, George and Veronica at the reception.",5,2017,11,10
113,Afternoon tea,"Recently had the 'Tale as old as time' afternoon tea here. From the second you walk into the hotel you know it's going to be special. The hotel is stunning and the staff are very attentive. After sitting in the extremely comfy couches for a few minutes we were brought in for our afternoon tea. 

The table was beautifully decorated with a gorgeous tea set, biscuit of Belles dress and Lumiere! The tea and selection of cakes, sandwiches and savoury foods were lovely. There was something for everyone. One thing that threw us was when 'trying the grey stuff' we kept saying it just tastes like fresh cream.....it was! The white chocolate mousse was underneath haha

We got everyone on our table including chip, cogsworth and Mrs Potts and despite other reviews I didn't see any table missing a character. The staff explained the selection of food very well and even offer to take a picture when the three tiered stand comes out. Not sure what his title is but the tall Irish guy was really friendly and good craic....then again I could be bias ha

We stayed on to have a cocktail at the end of our tea (as you do)...as well as 'trying the grey stuff' I'd recommend trying the va vo vamm or something like that cocktail. Delicious! ",5,2017,11,08
113,The best place to vacate in tranquility,"The Kensington is a very gorgeous new hotel, the entrance is simple but grand, the door men are always opening the door, and the people at the front desk are very nice. Every time we left the building they addressed us by name on the first day. Special thanks to the front desk. They helped my husband coordinate the suite that we booked with my favorite colored flowers, fresh roses, and complimentary bubbly champagne which was a very well thought out surprise. 
The gentleman George who brought our luggage up showed me around the suite, told me about how to do things and use stuff like the espresso machine, where the safe is at, how to operate the lights, thermostat, and curtains, connected us to the internet. He even went ahead and made a booking to a fine steak restaurant and was there to also help whenever we needed him, it felt like we had our own English butler.  
It was Absolutely incredible. Seriously if you need a perfect vacation weekend come here",5,2017,11,08
113,The Best!,"Such an amazing stay at The Kensington. From the moment we walked in the door, the staff especially George went out of their way to help us and assist us with all our needs while visiting London. The hotel is absolutely beautiful and designed to perfection. Make sure to dine in the restaurant or have a drink in the bar. Thank you Kensington for making our first trip to London absolutely perfect! We will be back!",5,2017,11,07
113,having a tea here is as it should be,"afternoon tea with all the works, a surrounding that is buzzing but never crowded, what one looks for in an English setting you will find here, and of course excellent quality. go for extra scones and cream and marmalade, spoil yourself, indulge yourself, here it is worth the money",5,2017,11,06
113,Excellent in Every Aspect,"What an absolutely delightfully charming hotel.  From the friendly doorman, concierge, desk, and servers, the staff could not have been more helpful and professional. There were few luxuries left undone. Top notch.

Guests there for a week, we took advantage of the fine breakfast service at the hotel, and not only were the choices perfect, but the atmosphere perfectly serene to start your day.

The Victoria and Albert is just a short stroll away, as was the Natural History Museum and the Science Museum. The East Kensington Subway (Tube) station is just around the corner, easily accessing DT London easily if you wish. Taxi's are right out of the front door. The Kensington area is itself a charming multi-cultural neighborhood, great ambiance, ethnicities, and restaurants. 
Our 1st stay at The Kensington, our 1st stay in London.  It would be difficult to become used to anything less, now!

",5,2017,11,06
113,Good value for money,"Nice hotel, friendly staff. Bar is nice and the hotel also has a nice ‚Äúlounge‚Äù to have a coffee in the afternoon. 

Breakfast is good . 

Room that we had was small ( standard room) but clean with good beds. 

Next time I Will take a bigger room since I like to have a bath. ",4,2017,11,06
113,Very charming and beautiful Hotel,"Why stay at The kensington hotel  when there are thousands of hotels in London? This hotel not only is beautifully designed from the outside as it is inside. The location is absolutely great, right in the middle of the good amenities to really feel like a local Londoner. The staff is top notch, from the valet service Martins to the front desk George and Veronica to the housecleaning staff. The kensington is a 5 star hotel that's was WELL worth it. This is an a really EXCEPTIONAL service focused  hotel from the time you pull up to the time you leave! 

I would stay here again without hesitation",5,2017,11,05
113,First London Visit,I couldn't have chosen a better place to stay. The staff cared about my experience. The hotel is beautiful and well managed. I would refer The Kensington to anyone. In addition the neighborhood is lovely and a short walking distance from the south Kensington underground. The are fantastic restaurants to choose from as well. ,5,2017,11,05
113,Exemplary,"I Stayed here for 4 nights with breakfast included. Had a great view from our 5th floor room. Plenty of room space with a nice bed and modern room features including nespresso machine to make coffee early in the morning.

Maybe the best breakfast I've ever experienced. Homemade pastries, juices¬†and bread. Made to order omelettes, pancakes and waffles, fresh fruits, veggies, european style breakfast options with beverage table service from Cillia Elena and George the host.

Would highly recommend to visit",5,2017,11,05
113,Londra november 17 asia week,"we stayed here with my family for my mother birthday and for the Asia week we had a really good and beautiful stay in the hotel , The restaurants and the room are good and beautiful and the service is very good expecially at the consierge that is always very helpful... ",5,2017,11,04
113,"Gorgeous public areas, rooms a little disappointing but great staff","I stayed here for one night recently in a deluxe room. I had emailed the hotel a week earlier with a request but never received a reply so I was rather wary about my stay but the staff were all absolutely lovely.  I had quite a wait to check-in as there was only one receptionist working but I was offered a juice and a wet flannel and this made up for the delay.  The receptionist made a show of telling me I had been upgraded to a deluxe room until I pointed out that that was what I had paid for, she then apologised and we had a laugh about it.  The room was rather disappointing after seeing the beautiful public areas.  It was quite small and very plain and dated.  The lower half of the window had frosted glass in, presumably to obscure some awful view, so this made the whole room very dark.  On the website there is much made of the heated bathroom floor and iPod dock - we had neither.  Because the bathroom door is frosted glass, when one of a couple uses it during the night, it wakes the other half up because it lights up the whole bedroom.  Also, there was another small green light in the ceiling (not a smoke alarm) which stayed on the whole night and is quite annoying.  The room was, however, very quiet and the bed was comfy with nice pillows.

The public rooms are absolutely beautiful, with fires in several, lots of little sitting areas, all with a lovely relaxed atmosphere.  The breakfast was excellent, with cold food on a buffet and hot food served to the table by lovely staff.  If they could just tweak the rooms a little, I would definitely return here, but as the rooms stand at the moment, sadly I won't.",4,2017,11,04
113,Great location and service,"This hotel is in a fantastic location with cafes, grocery store and tube station nearby.  Fantastic service. I chose the basic room type however found it was tiny and the bathroom and sleeping area way too small even for London. I suggest you go for the next room type up.The bed was very comfortable.  The maintenance was not great with loose drain cover in the shower and a couple of other small things.",4,2017,11,04
113,Cute little find for a weekend trip,"Easy to find and lovely entrance . Bell boy taking our luggage was a really nice touch , love the decor of modern and old . We ordered a superior room which was a little smaller than excepted and some of the cuboards ect looked a little worse did wear, bathroom was nice however slight bits of mould on the sides of the bath , however pretty clear overall , bedding done and new towels given regularly . Really comfy bed however random milk carton outside on the Terrace area üòÇ . Really lovely staff and breakfast was nice ! My boyfriend went back for 3 times and great location as right near Kensington Hyde park and some museums and close to the London underground .  Cost was pretty good :) overall great stay !! ",4,2017,11,02
113,Easy way to make you smile,"This is my hotel of choice when in London. We visit quite often so it's easy to compare one visit from another throughout the year. Already looking forward to the Christmas decorations going up! The kensington continues to deliver. Smiley faces, kind and caring assistance and a high standard of service and facilities. And that's the staff. We've met some lovely fellow guests, also, who use this  retreat as their home when travelling. Business on this occasion, but often for relax.",5,2017,11,02
113,it was splendid,my girlfriend and I work remotely from time to time and this time round the company sent us to Londo nand we stayed at this hotel for a few days for work. the facilities were up to date and we enjoyed the hotel lobby for meetings with our suppliers. the service was professional and we would like to thank everyone with special mention to Martyn (concierge) &  George (concierge).,5,2017,11,01
113,beautiful hotel and excellent staff!,"We found this hotel online and it looked beautiful so we decided to give it a try. The staff was super attentive, courteous, happy, and made you feel welcome.  They also offer newspapers in the morning which is a nice touch.  Very classy hotel.  We sat at the bar 1-2 times and enjoyed our drinks.  Our room rate came with breakfast included -- i highly recommend including it! The continental breakfast was fresh, cappuccinos huge, and this rate also included the hot entrees on the sit-down menu.  We loved it!",5,2017,11,01
113,Just Keeps Getting Better and Better...,"Stayed very briefly at The Kensington last week. I have always been a fan, but really the hotel just keeps getting better and better. A hotel like this could rest on its laurels given its location, but this one certainly doesn't. It just gets better each time I stay there.  The staff are very welcoming and efficient, the drawing rooms and bar are so inviting I had a great room.  It's a real pleasure to stay at The Kensington.",5,2017,10,29
113,Our new favorite!,Our every wish was granted: we were happily changed to a sunnier room; assisted in every way by the abundantly helpful concierge and doorman staff. Addressed personally the entire week we were there. Impressive Old World service.,5,2017,10,28
113,Tale as old as time afternoon tea,"Wow ..... just wow.... have just visited the Kensington Hotel for their Beauty and the Beast ""Tale as old as time"" afternoon tea. It was wonderful. They served a cute starter of 3 items - including a miniature game pie, a miniature cheese and onion souffl√©; really delightful. Tea contained finger sandwiches including cream cheese and cucumber; salmon; egg mayonnaise and chicken. These were all tasty. And then there were the desserts and cakes. Oh my goodness - where to start?! There was a Cogsworth Clock tart - this had a short crust pastry base with chocolate ganache and raspberry filling - very rich and not for the faint hearted! A Spiced Snowball (coconut) macaroon sandwiched together with a milk chocolate paste - described by the waiter as a ""reminder of the snowball fight"" - simply charming. There was a shot glass with vanilla and gold jelly - this had a red rose petal immersed in it! There were also sweet brioche baguettes with apricot conserve or chocolate spread. But the piece de resistance was the grey stuff!!! Served in a delightful Chip cup it was white chocolate mousse coloured a delightful blue/grey colour and this was heaven in a cup! The tables were decorated with Lumiere candles, Mrs Potts teapots (which held the fresh cream) and Cogsworth clocks also adorned the sideboards but could not be left on the tables as the Hotel have experienced a lot of these being stolen - disgraceful...However, this was the only negative for this visit. I thought the price was very reasonable (¬£149 for afternoon tea for three with two cocktails) and the staff in this place were amongst the most professional, friendly and polite staff I have ever encountered anywhere. I doubt I will visit again as the theme tea cannot run forever (and has already been extended numerous times) and there are so many afternoon teas to experience and so little time but this will be a fantastic memory that I will treasure forever.",5,2017,10,27
113,Horrible experience while celebrating my husband's birthday,"I just returned from a two night stay at the Kensington after traveling around Europe for two weeks with my husband. The Kensington was our last stop, and a very special one, as we were celebrating my husband's 30th birthday. The hotel was nice enough, the breakfast was included in our stay and tasty, and although the rooms were very small we appreciated the quality of the linens and furnishings.

The hotel would have been a nice place to stay, had it not been for our experience at afternoon tea - a planned celebration for my husband's birthday. It started off with quite a few minor hiccups - no email back from the concierge when requesting to book tea, and then confirming a reservation time that, when I showed up, the hostess promptly (and rudely) informed me we had no reservation (we did). 

The tea started off nice enough, but while eating I noticed several thick black hairs in my egg salad sandwich (first noticed between my teeth - awful). Upon further inspection, the egg sandwiches had several black hairs on them. After that bite I set them aside and told my husband they were not good. It being his birthday I didn't want to gross him out with my experience, so when he went to the rest room, I gestured to our my sever. I told her about the hairs, and how upsetting it was to have this happen, and she snapped ""You should have told me this before you ate the food"". At that point I could barely respond, mumbling about not wanting to upset my husband on his birthday, and she responded ""Well you needed to tell me this before and I could have brought you a new tray."" She then proceeded to walk away and ignore my table until we were dropped a bill for ¬£90. 

Not only was I snapped at like a child that had done something wrong after I found hairs in my food while dining for a special event, but I was forced to pay ¬£90+ for it. At this point my husband noticed something was upsetting me, I told him the situation and he too was very upset. I waited at the front desk later that evening to ask to speak to the manager, but alas, after waiting for 10 minutes with no one available to help me, and late for dinner, I gave up.  After this treatment I would never stay at the Kensington, or any Doyle collection hotel, again. I would very much implore guests thinking of entrusting this hotel with a special occasion to go somewhere else. What a shame too, as we had such high hopes for our stay. Unfortunately, I don't come to this caliber of hotel to find hairs in my food and be scolded like a child, all while paying for a luxury hotel experience.",1,2017,10,26
113,Most underrated collection of hotels in London,"I love the Doyle Collection hotels - and, this being my first time at The Kensington,
it did not disappoint. Other hotels in London can be overpriced. You‚Äôll easily pay ¬£400 for a small, low quality room. But with The Kensington, the room was spacious and SO beautiful, and staff were incredibly helpful and hospitable. The food in the restaurant is also VERY good - the type of resto you‚Äôd revisit even if you weren‚Äôt staying at the hotel. Finally, the Doyle Collection loyalty programme is probably the only worthwhile hotel loyalty programme available. Am already on their second tier and they never fail to reward my loyalty with an upgrade. Thanks for a consistently quality experience! ",5,2017,10,24
113,Stayed here for a business trip and was great,"First time staying at this place! Stayed for 3 nights for a work event.

Check in was fine - I arrived rather early from New York - it was about 08:00 am when I arrived, so my room was not ready. I checked my suitcase at the front desk, went out in search of big English breakfast. Found some down the street at Muriel‚Äôs kitchen which the reception recommended. Came back and sat in the lobby and worked until my room was ready.

My room was on the 4th floor. Spacious, comfortable also clean. Room has digital thermostat controls - The room temp remained comfortable during the duration of my stay.

The room has a pre-stocked mini bar - with beer, wine, whisky, nuts, soda, coconut water, etc. Not much room to put your own stuff in there. I managed to wedge a few things in there. Apparently, you can request a separate mini-fridge for your room. 
WiFi was fast and worked well. The room had a flat panel HD TV. I watched Bloomberg tv and CNN .

All the hotel staff I encountered or interacted with were very nice, Especially Cillian and George who were particularly exceptional.
Because the hotel is located in south Kensington - there are tons of dining options available. While I was staying at the hotel, I visited Rocca, bumpkin, Starbucks and Zuma were all splendid. 

I highly recommend",5,2017,10,24
113,elegant,"Gorgeous...absolutely gorgeous! You can't go wrong staying at this property or hosting an event, The hotel is situated on old brompton and queensgate and it's a Great place for Tea. My friend and I have not been here in awhile but service has returned to great. Service was fabulous at the front desk. Best location. The Tea, sandwiches and pastries were all delightful! After Tea, we even went to the bar for a cocktail and walked around south kensington to visit he museums",5,2017,10,24
113,An enjoyable stay,"We stayed 3 nights at The Kensington. Overall, it's a good hotel that's conveniently located. 

LOCATION: It's located ~5 mins walk from South Kensington station and near tons of shopping and restaurants.

ROOMS: We booked the cheapest rooms but were still a little surprised by how small the rooms were. Nevertheless, they are comfortable but showing their age. The soundproofing between the hallways and the rooms really need improvement since you can hear absolutely everything.

We had an issue on the last night with two younger guests across our room blasting their music and screaming. We called reception and I saw a staff member come up. I'm not sure if they did anything, but the music and screaming stopped around 30 mins later. 

STAFF: Staff are very knowledgeable, friendly, and accommodating. 

RESTAURANT: We had both dinner and Tale as Old as Time afternoon tea. The restaurant design and ambience are really warm and inviting. I would say the lounge/restaurant are the best aspects of this hotel. Service was great and the food was very tasty. The Tale as Old as Time afternoon tea is really unique and in high-demand so remember to book early. A huge thank you to Carolina for accommodating us!",5,2017,10,24
113,Excellent service,"I always stay at The Kensington when I'm in London for business. This time, I wanted to take a day trip to Bath and the helpful concierge got me a rental car and had it delivered to the hotel. Upon my return the porter took care of getting the car back to the car rental agency. The staff is extremely helpful, pleasant and welcoming. I will always stay at The Kensington when I visit London -- I love the comfort of its small boutique accommodations.",5,2017,10,23
113,"Thanks you, Thank you, Thank you","LOVE this hotel. When my family and friends first booked this hotel, I thought 'south kensington? Meh.' But, no, the Kensington hotel is super-modern with a homely feel throughout the atmosphere, has great views of the traditional townhouses in London, and, location-wise, is close to a bunch subway stops/lines ..piccadilly, district and circle or simply ‚Äì Yellow,Green, and Blue lines.

I also loved all of the Bliss products in the bathroom, and the fact that the lobby is open to relax and the bar serves drinks all night long.

The staff are out of this world. From the moment we checked in after a long day of traveling- they made our entire family feel special, Especially George the overnight Bar tender, we came back from dinner and theatre at around 2 am in the morning and fancied a drinks, we were a party of over ten people and George welcomed us with open arms at twilight zone when in most hotels wouldn‚Äôt happen. He served all of us with a smile, warmth, personable attitude and he was a REALLY awesome host. I would definitely take him home with us and make him my husband without hesitation.   

It was the best stay ever and I'd definitely stay here again!",5,2017,10,23
113,Great location in London but..üò¢,"This hotel is in a great location in London which has revamped over the years to be comfortable and appealing.
The staff are really friendly and helpful particularly the concierge and the porters.
The price of the rooms is not bad particularly when coupled with a ‚Äúdeal‚Äù for bed and breakfast ü•û 
There is a thriving business in the hotel for morning coffee, lunch and afternoon tea,all at prices that are not too high for London.
However the food for dinner is uninteresting and pricy. Simple put it is not value for money.
The bar is good but the prices for drinks are ridiculously high.
Overall this is a hotel which offers good value with pleasant rooms - though small- and staff that are willing to please.",3,2017,10,22
113,Excellent Stay,"Wonder place to stay in including staff, service, rooms and with staff speaking all the languages. Would book suites in this hotel due to the sizes of the room. it is about a few minutes walk from the kensington tube station with great access to the central of london, the museums and local attractions.",5,2017,10,21
113,Jon B,"We‚Äôve been at The Kensington for 5 years in a row and have never had a bad experience. Great location, beautifully appointed hotel, wonderful staff in a classic London way. Great bar and sitting area. Good tea. Up to date and fully equipped gym. No complaints at all",5,2017,10,21
113,Big breakfast buffet and fantastic Service,"We just completed a stay at the kensington hotel and we were generally very pleased with the property.

Some of the highlights include the great breakfast , which was the largest I've seen in this class hotel in Europe. The food quality was about what you'd expect from a hotel of this standard but they had a lot of very good extras like breakfast smoothies, green juices, yogurts and more. The dining room service was also very fast and very friendly... shoutout to our Waiter George who couldn't be more helpful in his approach to customer service, He brought us complimentary bottles of water and even went out of the hotel to a nearby grocery store to buy for my husband Cigars, Now that's what I call service.

in summary it was a good hotel with Expansive complimentary breakfast buffet, adequate rooms with decent beds, clean throughout, good location, excellent value.",5,2017,10,21
113,Perfect stay,"We try to stay at a new hotel every year when we go to London so this year was the Kensington. When we arrived, concierge came to grab our bags and told us just to check in and they‚Äôll bring the bags up and when we got into our room and they were already there. We got our room immediately and were in a hurry to get to a dinner reservation. We called concierge to ask for suggestions and they had a nice pub called bumpkin, which was great to start our trip.

Our room was updated and looked clean as well The rest of our stay at the Kensington was great! Everyone that worked there was very friendly and helpful. The bed was comfy. Room was clean. Great location on the long avenue Great restaurants and Amazing view.",5,2017,10,21
113,Awesome,"Stayed here for four nights on business.

It's about a six block walk from the south kensington tube station on the Blue line and close to other lines as well.

The rooms are clean and comfortable, and tastefully decorated in a sparse style as you might expect from a london hotel.

The windows are huge and let in a lot of natural light even on lower floors.  The mechanical shades and amenities go all the way down in case you need to conduct some replicational activities or like to parade in a suboptimally clothed manner.

The towels are pretty good and the shower has a giant shower heads, a small yet valuable luxury.

They serve breakfast on every floor from 6:30 to 10:30.  Standard industrial bagels, pain au chocolat etc.
The fitness center located on basement floor is open 24 hours a day has crossover cables, two treadmills..  There is a  tv inside the fitness center if you are one of those people who can't go an hour without watching bloomberg or CNN.

Overall, i would recommend, which is why I gave it five stars.  A good value for a london hotel.",5,2017,10,21
113,absolutely wonderful,"The hotel staff are familiar with many languages thus you can expect help no matter what you speak. The hotel staff was so kind and accommodating. If there is a problem do not hesitate to dial 0. The staff will already know your name and be able to help you in a very fast way. I always see everyone working in the hotel smile. No matter what job they do they treat every guest like royalty. special mention to Cillian, Elena and George
This hotel will always be favourite hotel as it is a legendary part of London with the kesington palace, Hyde park, Harrods, knights bridge, Ferrari and Lamborghini shops. we loved the three key bakeries humming birds, maitre choux, aux meivelleux de fred. and for supermarket -waitrose was the best for fresh groceries.

Our accommodations were wonderful. I can't say this is the greatest suite I've ever stayed in because I've been most fortunate to stay in some mind blowing rooms in the past but this probably comes in one of the best on my list.

I highly recommend",5,2017,10,20
113,Experience like never before,"Reminds me so much of 1900 European boutique hotels. It was raining during our stay and the hotel provided us with umbrellas. Complimentary robes and slippers in your room Complimentary continental breakfast, water and chocolates.In the morning there's breakfast items like cereal, fresh cut fruit and baked goods. There's a great espresso machine. At night, there's cookies and coffee.
The front desk staff was extremely pleasant, sincere, and accommodating. When we first got to the hotel, we were politely greeted and assisted by George & Michael  and check-in went as smoothly as possible.

The overall hotel was clean, bright, and modern, and also had this positive, zen feel to it.  There is a gym on the basement floor, the equipment are upto date, a restaurant/ cocktail bar.

we highly recommend to everyone.",5,2017,10,19
113,EXCLUSIVE,"This is a wonderful little boutique style hotel in a great location on the queensgate. The room was spacious and the lobby decor was very nice. There is a lot to like about this place!

Given the location and the price, I was really expecting a closet when I walked in. The room was actually quite spacious--probably similar square footage to what you'd get in your standard business hotel. What truly amazed me was the quality of service.  My favorite chocolate was waiting for me, the bellmen & doormen and receptionist were extremely friendly, and the free drinks voucher were a welcome touch.",5,2017,10,18
113,perfect experience,"I have stayed at many hotels in London and specifically in south kensington but this in particular has an amazing luxurious homely feeling. They allocated for me a room on the 4th floor and it was pampered with all sorts of amenities.Great bathroom with a soaking tub. Nice lounging area and good breakfast. A perfect hotel, class, comfort, great service from highly trained staff from the reception to the cleaners and a good central location to dine all your favorite food and sushi bars.",5,2017,10,18
113,Extremely cool hotel,"Cute boutique hotel with friendly staff in ideal location!! Hot coffee and amazing pastries every morning made our day start out on the right note!
The staff at the front desk could not have been nicer nor more accommodating Ramona, Vincent, George, Ronnie - that goes for the maids, as well as Margaux I Think thats her name was also very accommodating.  Location is fantastic.  As far as I'm concerned, there's no place else to stay when you go to west London. We would be happy to visit again and explore more of the neighborhood restaurants!",5,2017,10,17
113,The best hotel in this part of town,"Wow! What a service. After spending months on my own scouring for hotel room block options for my family, I was so happy to find this hotel and the welcome vibe from Valeria who helped sort out everything for me and welcome amenities which we all loved. The best part: absolutely no strings attached! Great genuine customer service from the whole staff and specifically the Concierges Martyn and George,and James from the Bar: great results and just a wonderful experience overall",5,2017,10,17
113,A luxury haven with style and substance,"To start, the space is very welcoming and chic. You get a lot of natural sunlight and the sofas were quite comfortable.  they do a beautiful lobby high tea and most importantly they have the best service in the business. 

1. Great location! Right next to the tube and steps away from all sorts of great restaurants, walking distance to hyde park St w, walking distance to glucester road station and the musuems. It really can't get more convenient than that

special thank you to Cillian and George for a fantastic hospitality.",5,2017,10,15
113,Simply fabulous! Stop searching: Book Now!,"My husband and I spent two nights at The Kensington as part of our anniversary trip to the UK. We wanted something special that wouldn't completely break our budget. The Kensington completely surpassed our expectations. 

The service here is simply unparalleled. From the moment we walked in, we were both bowled over by the friendly staff and their sincere efforts to make our stay memorable. The room itself was comfy and cozy--standard size for London hotels--but we found ourselves rather spending most of our time in the gorgeous lobby. Reading the paper next to the roaring fire while sipping on cocktails from the bar was ... simply heaven. Thomas, a member of the wait staff, went out of his way to make us feel welcome and made a terrific impression on us.

We did not pay for the breakfast option, but trust me: the morning ""continental breakfast"" was MORE than filling. (Charcuterie? Pain au chocolats? Um, yes please!) 

And finally, the location: located conveniently between the Gloucester Road and South Kensington tube stops, the hotel is an ideal location for exploring the city. (Our first day, we picked up some sandwiches from the local Waitrose and walked about 10 minutes up to the Victoria and Albert museum for a picnic.) 

In short, The Kensington provides 5-star service at very fair prices. Going forward, it will be the **only** place we stay when we're in town.",5,2017,10,15
113,Charming hotel in the heart of Kensington,"My husband and I only stayed one night but we were so glad that we picked the Kensington.  It is centrally located for Kensington Palace, the Gardens as well as the Victoria and Albert Museum.  It is convenient to the tube and just one station from alot of boutique shopping in Belgravia.  Yes, the room was smallish but it was bright and comfortable.  The  concierge suggested a great gastro-pub called Bumpkins and  we were not disappointed.  Breakfast was included and it was a dining delight.  We would stay here again and recommend this boutique hotel to any travelers to London.",5,2017,10,14
113,charming south kensington hotel,"Amazing hotel, so beautiful and pleasant. The view is phenomenal from the long stretch of queensgate. We had a nespresso machine in the room with multiple coffee options. The gym was fantastically huge inside and  I liked the view, the treadmill felt cushioned. we were so hungry the next morning and the restaurant breakfast and service were impeccable. 
We loved our stay here and hope to come back in near future",5,2017,10,14
113,Excellent hotel!,"Amazing hotel, food (both during breakfast and also dinner) was amazing and absolutely delicious, room was very comfortable with a nice bed and quite large bathroom. The best part of the hotel is the staff, which were all very gentle and helpful, especially George, the doorman, he is a very kind, nice, funny, friendly, helpful and extremely charismatic person.",5,2017,10,12
113,Cozy and Wonderful Hotel!,"Great location, so close to the South Kensington Station, museums, and close to lots of shopping! Awesome service! Staff was super friendly and kind. We also had afternoon tea there and it was wonderful! Teas and sandwiches were tasty treats!",5,2017,10,11
113,"Too expensive, too poshy","This hotel is situated very nicely in South Kensington. But is is too expensive and too poshy. Room was smallish and service although presuming to be first class was not.
When we came to have breakfast we had to wait since the dining area was full. This should not happen in a first class hotel.
We stayed there 2 nights. for the first night we paid 300 pounds and for the second one 400. We moved then to a more modest Chelsea hotel.",3,2017,10,11
113,"Nice hotel, charming, very convenient and posh location","Nice hotel in the posh area of Kensington/Chelsea. The hotel common areas are very charming for breakfast, tea, drinks, lounging. The room we had was pretty nice, definately 4 stars, maybe 3.5, not 5. The mattress was a little lumpy and off-kilter, and there were a strange few stairs up to the bathroom. In all the room was more 'tired' than the lobby and common rooms. Service was as would be expected at this class of hotel, which is to say good, although not remarkable. 

Now, the very best aspect of this hotel is the location. It is ideal. It's in one of the most exclusive parts of London, so it's clean and quiet. Yet, it's a 10 minute walk to the Kensington tube station, which is GOLD -- you can take the train to Heathrow, save a ton of time and a ridiculous amount of money. The taxis in London have become insanely expensive. And it's easy walking to museums, a lovely park, the madness around Harrods and the Circus (which don't even honestly feel English anymore, it's all internationals...). Recommended if you can stay when the prices are reasonable.",4,2017,10,10
113,Gorgeous!,"The Kensington is excellent. Great location and the staff are kind and welcoming. If you're looking for an all around experience, this is the place. Also if you're staying here and looking for restaurants and new experiences, George from concierge has many recommendations of delicious restaurants. ",5,2017,10,10
113,Great hotel,"Loved the hotel, it's in a great location and the room is very nice. The staff are amazing and very kind, especially George from the concierge. He's the best. Martyn from concierge and Veruska from reception are also great people.",5,2017,10,09
113,Above and Beyond at every turn!,"We were just in London for one night, and could not have been more pleased with The Kensington.  The hotel is amazingly plush, but not at all ""stuffy"".  Staff was kind, friendly and the room and amenities were top notch.  Additionally, the ease of access to Hyde Park, Kensington Palace and the underground cannot be dismissed.  ",5,2017,10,08
113,Pretty hotel in a great location for London vacation,"The Kensington is a boutique hotel, formerly a townhome, in a quiet South Kensington neighborhood.  It is just blocks from 2 tube stations in Zone 1 -- South Kensington and Gloucester Road -- which made the trip in from Heathrow and all of our sightseeing a breeze.  The neighborhood has every type of excellent cuisine:  French bakeries, Italian, Indian, New British, pubs, sweets, Lebanese, carryout and much more.  The hotel staff was friendly and helpful.  We easily walked to Royal Albert Hall, Kensington Park and Victoria & Albert.  Our room was small but very well designed with plenty of outlets, mirrors, good lighting and a wonderful shower.  We stayed for a one-week sightseeing vacation and would love to stay there again in the future.",5,2017,10,07
113,A Tight Squeeze,"I would agree with most of the posts that the Kensington is a lovely, cozy hotel convenient to underground stops, museums, Royal Albert, shops and dining.  My only comment would be that the entry-level rooms (Superior) are pretty small for two people and also vary in shape due to where they are tucked into the building.  We occupied a Superior during our stay and had to find a different room, as the space was simply too small for two adults staying for two weeks.  Note, not all Superior Rooms have dressers to store clothes (ours didn‚Äôt), and the closets are very small (guessing 18-20‚Äù), so it‚Äôs a bit of a struggle to find a place for clothes/coats.  Our first room couldn‚Äôt even comfortably accommodate two luggage racks.  For a short stay, a Superior Room is perfectly adequate, especially for one.  For longer stays, you might consider upgrading to a Deluxe Room, which is more the size of a normal hotel room.

While deciding on an alternate Superior Room, we saw the rooms mentioned on Trip Advisor:  a room where the opening to the shower is as wide as a person (both arms touching the walls); a room with no dressers and tiny bedside tables.  This is not to say that the rooms are not clean and well-appointed.  It‚Äôs just that Superior Rooms are not particularly comfortable for two if you plan on unpacking and staying a while.  You‚Äôll be better off paying a higher price for a Deluxe.

Our first cry for help received a lukewarm reception at the front desk, but happily, a few days later a senior manager helped us find a Superior Room that actually had dressers and had a bathroom large enough for two adults.

We had a fantastic experience with one of the door/lobby attendants (George)‚Äîan utter joy every day.  We hope he stays and excels in his career, as each time we saw him, he made our day by his sheer exuberance and enthusiasm‚Äîthe best part of our stay for sure!!  

Unfortunately, we‚Äôll probably find another place to stay next year when we return to London.  It‚Äôs just not worth the hassle of finding a comfortably-sized room (at the Superior rate) at this hotel.",4,2017,10,06
113,The best home away from home stay,"I was quite surprised by some of the small details around the room. For instance, the walls, which were covered in classic wallpaper, featured photographs of the best deco and iPod docking stations were available on the table. My favorite touch, however, was the marbles inside the bathroom!
Big praise to Valeria for showing us around and all her pleasantness, Extended to Vincent, George and Martyn cope too.
We really enjoyed our stay at the kensington Hotel, and will likely stay there again when we return to london next year.",5,2017,10,06
113,Luxury all over this hotel,"This is my fifth visit to London and my first stay at this hotel.
It is a 5-star experience in every way ... location, beauty, service, excellence, food. 
Beautiful little birthday plate and added treats that any kid would just jump all over ! we felt very special.
Today, we walked a couple of blocks around the neighbourhood and we wandered around town and it was so easy from the hotel. We are right in the middle of all the action.
Subway Station wise: There are two stations near by: Gloucester Rd and south kensington. If you ask most locals, they will tell you to take south kensington. (because it's easier to find this hotel --- go straight down old brompton Road.). 
However, I recommend you take gloucester road. Come out to the gloucester road, Cross over the street onto stanhope gardens Rd. until you get to an intersection and  immediately take a RIGHT 
onto Queensgate  Rd. The hotel will be on your left (after a couple hundred yards). 
We took Gloucester Rd. I had four bags (one medium sized bag, a duffle bag, a very heavy suitcase, and a small backpack). We walked from Gloucester Rd and I can say for a fact that the gloucester road is much shorter. 

That being said , service was top notch and couldn't be compared, No request is too big or too small for the staff like Valeria and George. 

All in all a perfect London trip with luxury service.",5,2017,10,06
113,superbly located,"A new and traditional hotel, we were here to celebrate our anniversary and we enjoyed the facilities, the hotel is clean and the rooms are as they are advertised and we really appreciated our early checkin in the morning.

113,London Luxury at a Reasonable Price,"Just returned from a five-night stay with my daughter and we could not be happier with our hotel choice.  

The Kensington is truly a perfect location if you are looking to be away from the heavier populated and louder tourist areas.  A short walk from the Tube and the wonderful museums, as well as beautiful neighborhoods you can saunter through if you have the time.

The room we chose was on the small side but stylish, clean and comfortable.  The staff and great service made the Kensington really stand out.   A glitch in our bill at checkout was addressed quickly and professionally.   I have to point out that every day we were there, we noticed that the lobby, bar, and dining areas were busy, but still remained cozy and quiet enough for great conversations.  

We were comfortable and at home at the Kensington from the moment we arrived.  We would most definitely recommend a stay at this lovely London establishment.",5,2017,10,04
113,I loved it here,"I would without a doubt live in this hotel if they would allow me to. Everything about this hotel is magnificent; personal, individual and luxurious from the service, to the setting, to the rooms. The Lounge is an exceptional experience with dim lighting in the evening towards late night and the vibe is just amazing. Would definitely come back.",5,2017,10,04
113,Star studded Luxury,"The hotel suites offers private access and they are well equipped with free fast Wi-Fi, multi-line telephones, personalised voicemail with remote access too, We went to the hotel's study room with video conferencing. Suites are individually controlled air-conditioning, seating areas, table seating 4, and two fully-stocked mini-bars.

Staff, The key here is that they leverage local talent who know London like the back of their hand, concierges prepared the list in a few minutes saving you the run around.

absolutely charming place, The kensington is my home away from home",5,2017,10,04
113,First class in London service,"First, the staff was responsive and friendly! Everything we needed, they gave and it also came with a smile. When there was a small hiccup in room service, they proactively made it right and I appreciated it when they call you Madame or Sir ...Very English. 

The room was spectacular and the views were amazing. We loved it so much, we will be coming back for my business trip and our luxurious stay as the first time around was mile hit. They really held every other hotel we've visited up to a certain standard, and no one has met them yet.",5,2017,10,04

113,NEW ORLEANS TO LONDON,Our stay at the Kensington has been phenomenal. The staff was very invinting; especially GEORGE. He was personable and took grave interest in our international experience. He greeted my fiancee and I by name everytime we crossed paths! We greatly appreciated George's 5-STAR customer service!!! ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê,5,2017,10,03
113,Pleasant Stay,"I just recently came back from London to see off my daughter attending her last year in University and decided to stay in Kensington Hotel. It was a good decision. I usually stay to a hotel next to a tube station but this time i opt to upgrade myself. The hotel is lovely. The staff are all friendly and heldpful. The ambience in the lobby and restaurant is very English. Although they needed an uplifting on the rooms to match the beautiful lobby, still evrything looks brilliant. The location is centrally located, with nice restaurants around and Museum just few minutes walk. I would highly recommend it.",5,2017,10,03
113,Lovely hotel and excellent service,This is a lovely hotel with high quality furnishings and food.-breakfast was fabulous. The staff went out of their way to be helpful and had a very positive attitude. We loved the area around the hotel and there were lots of nice restaurants to choose from. We would definitely stay here again.,5,2017,10,02
113,"Great location, excellent hospitality by entire staff!","First time to London and was referred to this hotel by a friend who also stayed here. Expectations were fully met from the quality of the hotel, convenience to the tube, restaurants and the above and beyond service from the staff. Specifically, Guido & Martins were so pleasurable to deal with and attentive to every need. As a bonus, the on site restaurant and bar were a nice feature as well. Highly recommend the breakfast package as the food quality was excellent and even dining at the restaurant if after a full day on the town going out requires too much energy (fish & chips were awesome). Not sure I have ever experience a better hotel for the price!",5,2017,09,30
113,Pure luxury,"This is by far my new favorite hotel in London, it is was an amazing and relaxing experience from the second you check in until you leave.  First, the location is amazing compared to the other hotels location by hyde Park.  You get views of the queensgate street and it is located away from the hustle and bustle tourist in the downtown area.  Hyde Park is so lovely, quiet, and a beautiful place to just take a morning stroll around the water pond and only 10 minutes from the hotel.

The staff here is over and above accommodating and special shout outs to George Elena & Cillian and everyone here.",5,2017,09,29
113,Tale as old as time afternoon tea,"We had a wonderful time at afternoon tea which we had booked online being lucky enough to get a booking . We were seated early and advised each sitting was 1 hr 45 mins. The room and table settings were lovely and each table received a lumiere with their tea tray complete with MRS Potts and chip  the food was very tasty and we were asked if we wanted more sandwiches and more tea but we were very full with what we got ! We felt that a beauty and the beast musical soundtrack playing softly would really add to the atmosphere rather than the jazz music playing .
Other than that all was first class including service and excellent photography skills of our waiter who set up our table for the photos like an expert !",4,2017,09,29
113,Californian Girl in London,"we came here for our european summer and we decided to stay at the kensington hotel because it was near kensington palace and the area is a safe area to walk at night given the reputation of kensington and Chelsea. We had a fantastic stay..The rooms are quite okay though given it's an old city hotel. The hotel is pampered with luxury amenities and It's townhouse in the city. It also helps that the location was so close to the best shopping places around the area. we used Taxi's to get around and it was pretty convenient too.  Special mention to the best hotel staff and team that looked after us during our time at this hotel. Martyn booked for the hop on and hop off bus to take us around the point of interests in London, Cillian was fabulous to chat with from locals cuisines to everything, We also appreciated George who welcomed us to the hotel at all times with our door being jammed because we left the keycard next to our  phone. All in all it was a stay to remember.",5,2017,09,29
113,Exceptional hotel,"We needed a place near our daughter, and she recommended this location. From the time we arrived til we departed, we felt welcome. The rooms are usually small, but well appointed, VERY clean and comfortable. The location is quiet. The restaurant for breakfast is worth the cost, although the service a bit slow, and asking a second time for items. Would definitely stay here again",5,2017,09,29
113,Great stay!!,"Absolutely love this hotel!! Fantastic location and the staff is wonderful. The decor is adorable, and the tea experience is a must. Kensington was the perfect spot for my mother's first trip to London. Martyn, Elena, and George were especially great!",5,2017,09,28
113,Best boutique hotel and service in London! ,"This chic, boutique hotel is by far the best in London. The location is perfect - close to museums, the tube, and parks, restaurants and bars. George and Martins greet you with a smile as you arrive and depart and are incredibly attentive and helpful with anything you may need. The townhouse bar and restaurant are so inviting you may never want to leave!",5,2017,09,28
113,From Chile,"Excellent service, the people at the hotel are so nice! Lovely breakfast! It is a very cozy and beautifully decorated hotel.

I just love this hotel, this is my third visit and will come back definitely!

113,London Trip,This hotel was amazing! Had a great time and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The food was great. We had the fish and chips and it was very good. The breakfast is included and is also very good. I highly recommend you stay here if you come to London,5,2017,09,28
113,NFL week ,"The accommodations are excellent and the staff are wonderful  Martin the Concierge and Elena the Hostess, and George the porter were very helpful. I would definitely stay here again.   The rooms were always cleaned and they put candy on our pillows nightly. ",5,2017,09,27
113,Wonderful hotel,"Absolutely a great place to stay! The hotel was gorgeous and very near to the tube, restaurants, and museums in Kensington. The staff was very attentive with a special nod to George who has extremely gracious, knowledgeable and helpful!

",5,2017,09,27
113,Chaotic Service,"The hotel itself is very nice and it's a great setting in which to stay but the service is simply chaotic. The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. We were shown to three different rooms on checking in only to find the first two already had guests in them. To follow, despite the fact that I confirmed at checkin that I had prepaid breakfast, they had no record of it when we arrived for breakfast. The service at breakfast was also slow and chaotic - we waited over 40 mins on our last morning. I am a big fan of Fawlty Towers but it's less funny when you pay to receive a high standard of service and end up with incompetence. To be fair the duty manager met me at check out to apologise (I hadn't made a fuss) and offer me an upgrade on my next stay. I won't be taking them up on it.",1,2017,09,27
113,a visit to remember,"we stayed at the kensington hotel and the rooms are good spaced and the interior gives me a very traditional London. I love their beds who always gives me an excellent nights sleep, even with jet lag .

The service is more than excellent all the way from the entrance and throughout your stay. Just walking into the magnificent lounge gave me a feeling that I will be well taken good care of here. Room service is an excellent choice if you are too tired to find a good meal outside your own walls. Special mention to Elena at the lounging for her attentive service.

fabulous range of restaurants on old brompton road, sushi to sashimi and even bumpkin for a classic london cuisine.",5,2017,09,26
113,Celebrated my stay,"I stayed here for one wonderful night celebrating my friend's birthday along with 7 other people.  The room was as advertised and we were very satisfied. When we checked out, they also offered luggage storage without additional cost. The staff members were very courteous like Martyn, Cillian and George. The location is great -- plenty of restaurants around, and a whole foods a few blocks up. No problems with our stay. I'd stay here again.",5,2017,09,26
113,Second to none,"This is one of my favourite hotels I've stayed in while being in London over the years. Clean modern friendly outgoing lively helpful staff and always willing to accommodate and help with anything you might have on your mind.  From looking for the best places to eat to just a general chat and meetings plus events about your day.  They're genuinely interested in your vacation and where you are from and now they can make your stay more enjoyable. 

This time when I stayed here I was thinking about trying a different hotel, right across the street to be more precise the double tree by hilton . But no, I love this hotel that much I had to come back. And I will be back when I return to London next year

The management plus team make an excellent stay that why I was really moved to write this review, Vincent was a world star concierge, Elena waitress, Diane receptionist, George (bellboy) and Cillian (Restaurant) among others . I highly recommend and will always come back here for business or pleasure",5,2017,09,26
113,One night stay passing through...!,"We flew in from Gatwick on Saturday after a week's holiday and needed a hotel in London for the night as our son was performing at the Royal Albert Hall on the Sunday and it was pointless driving home. We chose The Kensington and what a great choice it was.

The hotel is exemplary; beautiful facilities, spotlessly clean rooms and bathrooms but above all else, their staff are fantastic. Also, this is an outstanding location being one of London's finest areas, surrounded by many drinking and eating establishments if you choose not to use the hotel's facilities.  We used the K Bar where the staff were amazing and took time to ask us about our holiday and the show we were attending the next day. A very personal experience.

We had reason to make a very minor comment regarding the room we were given and without hesitation, we were moved and upgraded. The rooms contain everything required for a very comfortable stay including the lovely hotel umbrella for your loan or you can purchase one of your own at reception if you so desire....I did desire...!

All in all, we had a very enjoyable stay. We would particularly like to thank Veronica at Reception for making us feel so welcome when we arrived and for arranging our change of room.  Service such as this is becoming much rarer and it was a pleasure to be a guest here.

Thank you very much.",5,2017,09,25
113,Second visit as awesome as the first!,"In mid-August, my husband and I stayed at The Kensington Hotel in the charming South Kensington area. It's located in the perfect spot ‚Äì surrounded by great restaurants and a short walk to the beautiful Kensington Park. We enjoyed our stay here during the summer of 2015 and decided to give it another try. Totally glad we did! We had an amazing stay once again and the staff was as accommodating as ever! The room we were initially assigned to had a small flight of steps leading into the bathroom. I had a foot injury six months prior and did not like the idea of climbing steps in the middle of the night. The staff member we told immediately changed our room and we were completely satisfied with our new room ‚Äì it was immaculate and cozy. The concierge and door staff were also very helpful. We needed to call an Uber to get to the airport and Gvuido was there to help us every step of the way. We would definitely return to this great hotel in the heart of London!",5,2017,09,24
113,Love love love ,"We love The Kensington! 
The staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are nice. The food is excellent. We have tried other London hotels and always come back to The Kensington. If you walk around the corner there are many great restaurants and shops. It is also within walking distance of some of London‚Äôs great museums.

113,Wonderful Stay!,"We stayed at The Kensington for a week and had an amazing experience. The hotel is charming and is located in a perfect South Kensington location. The staff are all kind and attentive. Particular kudos to Ramona for recognizing that it was our 5-year anniversary and sending a bottle of champagne to help us celebrate. Also to George for his unrivaled customer service and making us feel like honored guests. Thank you to both of you and to the rest of the staff. Cheers!

We arrived on Sept. 6th spent two nights, returned again on Sept. 20th, we were so impressed with the service, spotless rooms. We were on a two week trip to include England, Scotland and Wales. The Kensington was our top place to stay and by far the best breakfast, we will assuredly return.",5,2017,09,22

The tale as old time afternoon tea is fantastic and I would recommend it for everyone, the food is beautiful and the hotel is too. The selection of tea is fantastic I had Cloud tea, all the cutlery and tea pots are silver which adds to the feel and of course you have Mrs Potts, Chip and Lumiere. We found parking about 200yds from the hotel for ¬£4 per hour. All in all a fantastic experience ¬£35 each or ¬£55 if you want Champagne.",5,2017,09,21
113,Business stay,"4 days on a business trip, this was the second time I stayed at the Kensignton and it will not be the last if I can help it. Always extremely smiley and helpful - this is a real asset to welcoming guests and making you feel at home and welcome. I have been to hotels where everything is impeccable yet I have the impression I am just a number. The Kensington sets the benchmark when it comes to personal touch. I have only had this kind of experience once before ...in a hotel in Lisbon!

So to start with the doorman, George, ever so smiley, Martyn nd at front desk Vincent the Concierge. Very helpful indeed! I look forward to coming bak!",5,2017,09,19
113,Love this hotel,"This hotel is in a great location. It's very close to two tube locations which is nice. It's a quite safe area with lots of dining options but not too busy or crowded. The staff are super nice and attentive. The floors in the room are a bit squeaky and although the rooms are supposed to be sound proof, you can still hear doors slamming from other rooms on occasion. The squeaky floors kind of add to the charm of the hotel so I'd still stay here again. ",5,2017,09,18

113,So good; I don't want to review it!,"This area is devoid of decent bars.
I am so pleased I did a random internet search after leaving a nearby restaurant. I struck gold. This place was so good. Not too busy; great variety of areas to sit; perfect level of attentiveness of staff, great music.

I wi definitely could again... probably over and over again.

113,Fantastic boutique hotel in a brilliant location,"I've had the pleasure of staying at The Kensington a fair number of times now, each time for work, and have always been happy to return. The hotel is extremely well located, a stone's throw from South Kensington station, a short jog to the Thames/Chelsea, with great amenities all around. Boutique and cosy, with warm service to round it off. Special shout out to George the doorman who always has a warm smile and remembers your name and Elena. I look forward to coming back again.",5,2017,09,14
113,Spent a delightful week.  Loved the elegant location and setting.,"This hotel makes you feel in London in the best way possible: it's elegant, classy, classic and politely friendly.  Why stay in a nondescript hotel?  The common areas are beautiful and the staff is helpful and easy to find.  Service is what you'd expect from a fine hotel.  The rooms are comfortable (love the Nespresso) and the decor is classic and a bit subdued.  On the downside, hallways are surprisingly very narrow.  Food at the hotel is quite good. The location is quiet, convenient and enjoyable.  The bar area offers a relaxing sanctuary to enjoy a drink at the end of a busy day.",5,2017,09,14
113,Simply The Best,Undoubtedly the best Hotel in the west end of London. Rooms are exceptionally clean and comfortable and the staff couldn't be more helpful. I try to stay here every visit whether it is business or pleasure. ,5,2017,09,14
113,Great comfy stay,"We had a great stay visiting from Texas. Though we are used to larger accommodations, we had a beautiful room with a king size bed. The hotel is gorgeous and vintage with really contemporary upgrades to the rooms and bathrooms. Our bellman George was really helpful with our room and bags, he even gave us a crash course in driving!! Gvido helped guide us around town and pointed us in the right direction for food and shops. Elena in the restaurant was really sweet too. We really enjoyed everyone. Also thank you to management, we unfortunately had to switch rooms due to a shower leak we were unaware of, but did give us complimentary breakfast for the trouble. Try to get a room with a shower, not the tub stall üòâüöø",5,2017,09,14

We had a lovely afternoon tea here with perfect tea and lots of great sandwiches and small pastries. And of course the scones with jam and clotted cream. A perfect treat for two. ",5,2017,09,11

113,boutique hotel,"stayed again. home from home. genuinly a very friendly hotel from front door to the breakfast. nothing is too much trouble for the staff and they all set out to help.
fire still burning in middle of summer. right in the middle of meuseums and only a short ride into town.
nearest tube station is on line to heathrow all terminals so easy commuting for a flight.",5,2017,09,09
113,Wimbeldon,Hotel Ok. Uncomfortable.  Small rooms but nice.  Tennis was fantastic! Food was excellent.  Many of service people did not speak adequate English.  No electrical outlets in barhrooms. No mirrors in bedroom. Bed was comfortable and excellent quality.  My upgraded room had a small patio outside on bottom floor. Hotel is in a fantastic location.,3,2017,09,08
113,"Great Location, Staff, Service + Good Rooms Make for a Good Stay","We recently spent 3 nights at The Kensington in a 'Superior Room' while on a long weekend in Central London.

If you know London then you'll know that the location here is a good one for any kind of trip as you're right near all the museums, there are lots of restaurants and pubs and the hotel is perhaps 3 minutes walk to South Kensington tube station. It's also within easy walk of Kensington High Street, Knightsbridge and then on into the parks and palaces.

The hotel is right on the end of Queen's Gate and it's an attractive run of buildings and turned out to be larger than I'd originally expected.

We were greeted by the doorman and at reception by the staff who were really friendly, gave us a little shot of beetroot and showed us to our room.

The room was well appointed, in excellent condition, had everything that we might need and a fairly decent bathroom. It was a 'reasonable size for London' - i.e. it wasn't huge but it was in line with what I'd expect when staying in town.

I was impressed by the lounge and the bar - really nicely furnished and with lots of light and air and quite a lot of space to sit and read the paper or have a pre-dinner drink.

We didn't eat in the hotel beyond breakfast where we were very impressed. So many London hotels fall apart at breakfast but it's done really well here.

The breakfast room is lovely, the staff were really friendly, efficient and polite and the food was really good. We really enjoyed breakfast and complements to the hotel on this - please keep up the good work here as it makes such a huge difference to a stay.

I'd happily stay at The Kensington again when in London. I think it offers good rooms, great service and decent value compared to lots of London properties. Recommended!",4,2017,09,07
113,Nicely appointed hotel close to many convieniences,"I stayed here for 4 nights at the end of a 12 day visit to Europe.

Pros:  beautiful comfy common spaces, very close to good tube stop and citibikes, good location overall, good casual restaurants nearby, comfy bedding, front rooms get good light, nice turn down service, nespresso machine and pot to boil water for tea - good selection for both, free bottled water in room.

Cons: tiny closet, very little storage space, bathroom and shower were very tight even for 1 person, bedside tables were so small they were useless, staff was ""cool"" versus friendly.

Overall a good choice, but the standard queen would be extremely tight for two people, especially if you have more than a day or two of clothing.  ",4,2017,09,06
113,A special afternoon tea!,"We visited the Kensington for our daughter's 9th birthday. We had booked in for their 'Tale as Old as Time' afternoon tea. The staff were amazing from the off, the doorman knew my name and the fact it was my daughter's birthday as soon as I gave our surname. We were early so were shown to a sofa in the lounge area. I had spoken to the manager via email in advance as I had organised a cake to be delivered which was all handled brilliantly and after slipping a member of staff some candles the cake was brought out to us once we were seated. The afternoon tea itself was stunning and our daughter thoroughly enjoyed herself. The hotel is beautiful, we will definitely being staying overnight at some point in the future.",5,2017,09,06
113,Awesome experience + great service and well located,"I had the most incredible experiencie at The Kensington, the area is beautiful, just 5 minute from South Kensington tube station.

113,Loved the Kensington!,"My husband and I spent 2 wonderful days at the Kensington and we couldn't have been happier.  Just as the reviews stated, the staff could not have been more welcoming , nicer or helpful during our stay.  I fell in love with this lovely
hotel the minute we arrived and saw the trees and lovely exterior.
The inside of the hotel was equally lovely and our room was very clean and well appointed.  It was a great location for us and there were good restaurants literally just around the corner!  I will definitely stay at the Kensington if lucky
enough to return to London.",5,2017,09,05

Breakfast very very nice , lots of choices. 
We will definitely stay again when in London and highly recommend the Kensington. ",5,2017,09,04
113,Top notch!,"This is a wonderful hotel in an excellent location. We only stayed one night before our cruise. Wish it had been longer, They treat you like you are the only guest. .  The rooms are well appointed and very clean. The breakfast was awesome. They have a buffet of the cold items and bring you a hot entr√©e which was very delicious. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. I will stay here on my next trip to London!",5,2017,09,02
113,Great place to stay!f ,"Hotel was clean, quiet, and friendly.
Location is great, in a quiet and safe area. 

Hotel worker, George, was amazing. George was friendly, helpful, and courteous. He made us feel at home, and took extra time to explain things to us. 

George is an exceptionally nice man, and is reason enough for us to return to this hotel. 

Thank you George! Cheers! ",5,2017,09,01
113,Great hotel!,"We just left the hotel and had a wonderful stay. The location is perfect, close to all subway lines and the rooms are a perfect size.

The staff was lovely - George especially made our stay truly special. He was kind, thoughtful and always there for anything we needed. It wouldn't have been the same without him and his cheer!

Thanks Kensington!",5,2017,09,01
113,Saudi vip in London ,"this is a very good hotel and I'm always happy here, hi, from Saudi Arabia and I stay with my whole family and the hospitality is so amazing. Special mention to George, Elena, Martins. We are near Queens gates and the Hyde Park Corner is just a few blocks away. I highly recommend.",5,2017,09,01
113,Family vacation ,"My favorite hotel in every way! Great staff specially the lovely George, good size rooms, very clean and generally a happy authentic boutique hotel. My favorite spot is the beautiful fireplaces which I love having a drink or two in front of. ",5,2017,08,31
113,Stop over in (best part of) London...,"Super friendly staff like Martin at the concierge on the Dormans George, Gvido and Martins , please do something about the Wi-Fi because this kind of slow at the moment otherwise everything is fine!!! Very clean and quite convenient to get around from the hotel. Very much recommended!!",5,2017,08,31
113,Unassuming comfort ... thank you ...,"From the moment you pull up to the property to entering your suite the vibe is welcoming and congenial.

A seamless greeting by the front desk (thank you Valleria) check-in was efficient and calming after a long travel day. The welcome 'oshibori' and shot of fresh pressed juice a pleasant surprise.",5,2017,08,31
113,"A ""give it a one more try hotel!!""","I was looking forward to my weekend trip to London, with musical tickets in my pocket and experiencing the channel tunnel for the first time. I was sure to have booked an excellent hotel, so good that I sticked to the standard room. The photos on the site of the hotel ate good.
As big as my expectations, as big my dissapointment!! We got a back room, with small windows overlooking nothing, so tiny that we could not move if the cupboard door was open. The bathroom was a shame, would not support two persons inside, and had to do lots of exercises to enter the shower box and close its door. Really, a shame of a room, maybe the worst in my life and with a price tag on it. 
Please, owner of the hotel (it`s a family hotel), do something about this room, make it for singles, merge it with another one or just offer it for a small price as an 'exception"" in your hotel.
I complaint and the manager offered an upgrade, this time a huge room. As the gesture was genuine and their preocupation was real, I think it worth to give it another try when in London.
The rest of the hotel is nice: victorian architecture, the common areas are tasteful decorated, the breakfast is interesting and the location is great.
However, I think a four star classification would be more suitable for this hotel.",3,2017,08,30
113,Vacation,Checked in to the Kensington today and was greeted by George! He was very pleasant and he went above and beyond to ensure that my friends and I were comfortable and check in expeditiously! The hotel is also amazing. I will always come here when visiting London. Thank you George for your superb customer service!!! And thank you to the Kensington Hotel for providing such a fabulous and comfortable stay!!! ,5,2017,08,28

113,"Our ""Go-To"" Hotel in London","We always book The Kensington Hotel whilst traveling to London. We love the elegant yet homely feel of the design, the big comfy beds with soft hotel sheets (our favorite!) and the menu choices for enjoying a quick lunch before our departure flight or arranging to meet friends at the upscale cocktail bar! We've had many a lovely stay at this hotel and really appreciate the fact that George and Martins on the door remember us each and every time we return, with a big welcoming smile and a friendly conversation- they make it even more enjoyable to return! 
Fyi- I also have food allergies and the staff are really good at taking care of my order efficiently, plus I love all the Wellness juices and smoothies!",5,2017,08,28

113,A Victorian feel to this lovely hotel...,"This is a luxury hotel in a great location. After a warm welcome we enjoyed 3 nights in this fine hotel.  The decor makes you feel you were born into English grandeur. The quality is evident in the smallest details from the finest bathroom products to the softness of the sheets.  The staff are attentive, polite and knowledgeable.  The restaurant is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. We only had breakfast there however, the selection was extensive and the food was delicious.  The lobby area was spacious with quite nooks and crannies to enjoy a quite meal or cocktail.  The hotel is a 4 min walk to South Kensington Station along a road filled with wonderful cafes and restaurants.  In regards to a few suggestions, the standard rooms are not very big and the suites are overpriced for their size however the quality of the rooms are superb.  Of note, there are no irons in the room so you will need to ask for that if you need it but you will enjoy the perks of robes, slippers and newspaper delivery.  Overall, a lovely stay in London.",5,2017,08,27
113,Magical Afternoon Tea.,"My friend and I visited Kensington with my daughter to attend the Beauty and the Beast Afternoon Tea. 

My daughter is 9 now so a little older... and harder to please but still the smile didn't leave her face the entire experience.

The room and tea were beautifully presented and subtly in theme. 
 All the courses were served with a story of how each item tied into the fairy tale. We all agreed the food was delicious (especially the 'grey stuff'). 

What really made the experience so magical was the staff. They were all so lovely and friendly but in particular our waiter was really attentive and kind to my daughter, helping to make it a special memory for her.",5,2017,08,27

A huge thank you to the staff for a wonderful experience - we'll be back! ,5,2017,08,23
113,Another Fantastic Stay at The Kensington!,"This was my second time at this fabulous centrally located hotel in South Kensington.  It was my mom, sister and niece's first time there.  We had a wonderful stay and great service, especially from George, he's awesome and always has a smile. He remember all of our names and  was very helpful in recommending restaurants that my nieces would have no trouble finding something they would like, home run!  That said, everyone at the hotel is extremely helpful.  We were directed accurately on which tube line to take to our destination, being it was the first time for me an my family.  The last time I stayed with my husband, we cabbed it everywhere.  I would highly recommend this hotel again, and when I return to London, take a wild guess where I will be staying???",5,2017,08,23
113,Beauty and the Beast High Tea,"I was treated to a visit to the Kensington Hotel for High Tea for my birthday. The whole experience from start to finish was amazing. George greeted us at the entrance and his welcome was warm and friendly. Nothing was too much for the staff. They were attentive and helpful. The food was delicious and plentiful and the Beauty and the Beast concept was amazing. There was no rush and mood in the restaurant was relaxed and very comfortable.

113,Luxury and great service at a fair price,"I stayed for four days at the Kensington.  The staff was friendly and all service was prompt, accurate, and friendly.  I had a really beautiful room with beautiful en-suite bathroom, roomy and well-appointed, and beautifully decorated.  It was quiet too, and the location in South Kensington, near the South Ken Tube station and many restaurants, was very convenient for forays into shopping areas and the City of London.  The public rooms are beautiful and comfortable. I will definitely stay there again.",5,2017,08,21
113,Excellent service courtesy of Elena and George,"This hotel really understands the importance of small details. I came here for high tea with my friends. Upon entering I was welcomed by George who showed me the lavatory area, wifi network name and the afternoon tea dining room through to the restaurant, the side was the cocktail bar. We were immediately seated and greeted by an extremely pleasant waitress Elena. The thing that really stood out of me at the Kensington in comparison to my other high tea experiences was how informative they were. They brought out each loose-leaf tea to smell and describe before pouring. The overall experience was great. They had the best savoury sandwiches I've ever had at high tea and pretty decent portions. I left feeling full and happy and will definitely go back.",5,2017,08,21
113,"Small rooms, but great hotel","Other than a smaller than average room (which comes with the territory in London), my girlfriend and I had no complaints regarding the hotel or the immediate surrounding area. Santander bikes directly across the street. Great service from all hotel staff, including the doorman (Guido).",5,2017,08,21
113,Great service at the Kensington,"Our friend was staying at the Kensington, so we met her there after the flight to check our bags. George met us there with a warm welcome and took care of our bags for the day. He was friendly later when we came to pick up our things, adding to a wonderful experience at the Kensington. Would definitely stay here next time I'm in London!",5,2017,08,21
113,The only place to stay,"We were visiting our daughter who lives in London. Several friends and family members had recommended The Kensington, they were not wrong. Great location in a charming neighborhood, away from the throngs of tourists and the tourist traps but close enough to see the sites. Already planning our next visit.",5,2017,08,21
113,Wonderful hotel in a great part of London,"Stayed 4 nights (3 at the beginning of our trip, 1 at the end), it was our first time in London.  Loved everything about this hotel, it was comfortable, welcoming, beautifully decorated.  We arrived early morning hoping that our room might be ready and it was. (I did send an email in advance requesting an early check in). The room was small but it did have everything we needed for our stay.  Breakfast was great each morning, good selection on the buffet, very nicely presented, friendly and  attentive wait staff.  The front desk and concierge staff made you feel welcomed at all times.  It was a great place to return to at the end of the day after dealing with the crowds at the various attractions around the city.  The neighborhood is a great place to walk, several good choices for dinner.  Loved the bar in the hotel, a great space to relax and have a cocktail. We also had a light dinner one of the nights and it was very good, loved sitting in the living room space for that meal as ne of the options to the dining room.  On our return, we did request a larger room, we were upgraded, the room was much larger, loved it.  I highly recommend this hotel, it is a gem!",5,2017,08,21

113,3 in room,"Excellent location and staff, clean, well run. Only hesitation is rooms, even deluxe rooms, are a bit tight as it is a townhouse hotel. Family rooms and suites are available, we chose to save some money, asked for a roll-away bed be placed in our deluxe room. The roll-away could only fit at the foot of our bed. This made getting around a bit awkward but it was our choice. No hesitation going back as a couple. Perhaps we'd spring for the family room as a three-some.",5,2017,08,19
113,"The Davis-Dewitt,Bolden,Connor Girls European Excursion",This is my first trip to London and we stayed at the no Kensington Hotel it was absolutely beautiful in George one of the concierge staff with awesome.  He was always very helpful. His recommendations were on point. THe restaurants that he referred were excellent and very close to the hotel. ,5,2017,08,18
113,first review for a nice Hotel,"My wife and myself wanted to visit London for a short trip for my birthday in early August. It was kind of a last spur of the moment travel plan since we didn't know we'd end work so quickly that Friday, but we had a great time!  The hotel is relatively old on the outside with a traditional townhouse feel and it was so new on the inside; everything was quite up to date.
We checked in late in the evening and we were greeted by a friendly Front Desk staff Carlos who helped us to all our reservations, checked us in, explained clearly the breakfast times, breakfast and emergency number to dial; thereafter George helped us with luggages to our room, showed us the common areas before heading to our room on the 3rd floor with a nice view of the Queensgate Street.
The entire team is lovely and very good at what they do. They really made our stay very pleasant. Special mentions to Cillian, Vincenzo, Vincent and the exemplary team here at this hotel.
There are two elevators that take you up to your room. All of them had access to the lounge although if you wanted to go down to the fitness centre you will have to take the elevator on your left hand side because the fitness centre was located on their basement, Stairs also will take you up to the third floor and with great portraits to admire along the walls.

Our room was great! The bed was really comfortable and warm. The room itself was very modern and chic while it had classic elements throughout keeping the room simple. I liked how our lounge chair was by the window - with a great view like that in our room, I would've loved to enjoy some room service or get some work done while being comfortable. There were more than enough lamps, which I really appreciated because I don't like it when a room isn't well lit.
Inside our room closet was a mini bar fridge and your basic hotel amenities including a coffee maker and an electric kettle. 
I really loved the spacious bathroom with a bathtub. Overall the bathroom was very clean and it was one of the best I've been in awhile.
Our desk was very spacious and well made to get some serious work done! The only thing that was disappointing was the old Apple charging cord - we would've loved it even more if it had the most recent charging cable.

The view from our room was incredible! On a bright sunny day like we had, you could see really far out!
Hotel has really nice lounging rooms plus direct access to business Centre. It was a really nice place for reading, browsing the web or just relaxing.
The Fitness Centre was on the lower ground floor of the hotel and it was being enjoyed by many hotel guests. Quite big and really great if you have time to work out your muscles. If you like exercising during your travels, you'd probably enjoy breaking a sweat while you view the latest news or listen to music, I found the fitness centre larger than I had expected it to be, it had everything you needed for a great workout. It's open 24 hours so if you're a night owl like me, you probably have no excuse not to exercise... Overall, our short stay at the Kensington Hotel was really great. The hotel itself is in a really beautiful area of London, just by the Kensington palace, Hyde park and Knightsbridge with lots to do! If you're here with family, not only is there the palace, but the Kensington gardens is just nearby and the Science, Natural history ,and Victoria and albert museums are just footsteps away. Business doers will find the city of London center very close, we really enjoyed the hotel and will definitely come back when we get a chance!",5,2017,08,17
113,Great place,"My first time at the Kensington hotel. I usually stay in Mayfair but wanted to check out this hotel. I was very pleasantly surprised and had an overall great experience. Definitely a place to recommend and to return, provided I need to be in this neighborhood ",4,2017,08,17
113,One of my best hotel experiences,"What a fabulous hotel. I've stayed in multiple hotels for years and this was definitely one of my best experiences. The location is fantastic, the views were great and everyone was so willing to help. The young porter George was very welcoming upon our arrival and he remembered us throughout our stay, asking how our day was, what sights we saw etc. the concierge , I believe his name was Martyn, spent so much time with us, giving us recommendations on what to see in the city and making reservations for us at the restaurants, cafes and local eateries. The breakfast room had a wonderful buffet  in the morning. As a frequent traveller, I've stayed in lots of different  hotels and properties, and definitely recommend this one and just had to write a  feedback . Great location, nice decor and feel and great service.",5,2017,08,17
113,The Kensington ‚Äì An Elegant Victorian Boutique Hotel in London,"When I walked into the hotel, I was immediately drawn to the elegance of the exuberantly furnished common areas with cozy family style seating and period architectural details. Such elegance extends to the restaurant and bar. The entire ground floor feels like an upscale exclusive club, comfortable and relaxing to have a cup of tea, coffee or cocktail. 

The Deluxe King room my tour company booked for me is quite spacious, with comfortable seating area and large marble bathroom with separate shower and tub. I like the heritage Victorian d√©cor and the modern facilities, and the bedding is very comfortable. The hotel staff are friendly and attentive.

The hotel is not in the center of London by the Thames River, but it is in a bustling neighborhood nearby to many great attractions and is very convenient to get around London.",5,2017,08,16
113,A fantastic stay and would come back again,"The location is fabulous, between London Chelsea area and Kensington It‚Äôs a 3 minute walk from south Kensington tube station. This is a very nice hotel‚Ä¶Front desk staff is friendly and helpful especially Vincent and George. The room we got was tidy, spacious and very quiet. We got to test the night menu, and were served quickly. The deco is contemporary and still fresh looking for both the public area and rooms which I liked a lot and a few extra mentions are Cillian, Elena and all wonderful staff at this hotel. We would definitely recommend staying here",5,2017,08,16
113,Good location and good service,"The hotel is 5 mins away from the South Kensington tube station. The room is a bit small but in a hood condition. The staff is very nice, especially the doorman martins and George, they always carry a big smile and very helpful when i have some trouble in calling uber. Recommended. ",4,2017,08,16
113,Highly recommend - Boutique hotel with big rooms!,I would recommend this hotel to young families who still would like to stay at a boutique hotel (like they used to before kids!) as the hotel rooms are very spacious. The two doormen George and Martins were outstanding and did everything to make our stay as comfortable as possible. Big thanks to the Duty Manager who also extended us a big favour. Fantastic location too!,5,2017,08,16
113,Mr ,Top class hotel great rooms. Amazing service. Extremely clean a must to visit. Big space for London standard. One of the friendliest faces i met here was George. Overall come stay here in this hotel. It is near to the metro station and is near really good location it helps to be close to the metro so that we can travel all around London in a more efficient way especially if you get a oyster card if you are staying for more than 48 hours. Bens cookie is a near walk. I recommend to go get some cookie as well. ,5,2017,08,15
113,London 2017,The Kensington was a great hotel. Very well priced for the area. The rooms were spacious by London standards and we got a free double upgrade to a studio suite. It is very clean and beautifully decorated. Everything is close by via the underground and bus system. The staff were all very friendly and helpful from George to the receptionists and room service. I would definitely recommend this hotel.,5,2017,08,15
113,Very Nice London Visit,"We arrived at the Kensington for our last 3 nights of holiday.  We booked 2 rooms as we were a family of 5 (with tweets).  Our rooms were not in close proximity, so we needed to request different rooms.  George was fabulous in accommodating our needs.  He immediately got on the phone to the front desk to find a solution.  We ended up switching both rooms for a studio with larger suite (with an additional entry door so that we could keep interior doors open to both rooms).  This was an additional 80 per night, which was a lot, but worth the piece of mind to be so close! We opted for the breakfast, which I highly recommend!  The food was outstanding and the fresh pressed juices were very nice!!!  My only complaints- a Gin and Tonic at the lounge bar was 18 pounds (which was ridiculous!).  The bar service was very slow and absent most of the time!  The only other thing that was distasteful was that there was a new hire working the front desk.  She was really trying her best to be helpful, but at one point when the desk was busy her manager kind of belittled her and shooed her away.  I felt very bad for this woman, and thought that it was a bit unprofessional to see.  That aside there was a very bright and shining light in George!  He was the most friendly and accommodating person working at this hotel!!  He greeted us very warmly and was offering much help in booking restaurants and in giving us tips on things to do!  Very much appreciated his helpfulness.  The hotel itself is older, but does have a charm about it.  The larger of the two rooms was wonderful, but the suite was very cramped.  Overall a nice stay at the Kensington.  Would recommend!",4,2017,08,15
113,Just Ladies Traveling,"I went to London to tour the four palaces of Buckingham, Kensington, Tower of London and Windsor Castle.  I felt like a royal in the Kensington Hotel.  I loved the bar ambience, especially the warmth of the fireplace.  Great place to wind up the day with a glass of wine with a friend.  Room very comfortable.  It was great to sink into such a luxurious bed at the end of a hard day being a tourist.
Thank you, Kensington for a great stay.",5,2017,08,14
113,"Excellent location, average rooms.","The hotel location is fantastic, walking distance from many museums, and to an underground station.
The lobby looks really good, inside a beatiful building.
The staff were just great, trying to help with any questions or recommandations.
The down side are the tiny old rooms. Very small for 2 people, and we had only 2 small suitcases. When we realized how small is the room, my wife and I argued if the bed was insert into the room, or built in it. The bath is very simple designed, and it was quite a challenge to turn inside without hitting the sink or the toilet. The bath need some refurbish work to fix little holes.
For the same price I think we could get a better room.",4,2017,08,13
113,Top notch staff and home away from my home,"My partner & I recently stayed here for 3 nights on a short vacation while visiting family in the area. We were tourists as neither of us had visited London in about 5 years. The hotel was conveniently located to everything.....restaurants, shops & tourist attractions. The ambiance of the hotel was warm, elegant & inviting. The service was outstanding from the go; we were welcomed by George and immediately made to feel at home by his warm and enthusiastic mannerism. They have an in house restaurant which was convenient and was served by the amazing waitress Elena, another extra highlight from our hotel.
The bathroom has a whirlpool tub large enough for two and a separate, large, glass enclosed shower offering both hand controlled and overhead rain showering.  Two terry-cotton robs are provided along with an iron, a hair drier, an adjustable, lighted make-up mirror, and appropriate body lotion, soap, shampoo, and beauty & shoe shine kits.
I can't say enough good things about the local restaurants & the walkability to everything. I would definitely go back to this hotel & would highly recommend to anyone",5,2017,08,13
113,Lovely well-located hotel,The Kensington common areas have great charm and the hotel is extremely convenient as it is a mere 5-minute walk to the Southern Kensington underground station. Also a short walk to the Victoria & Albert and Natural History museums. Harrod's is walkable too. Our room was small but well-appointed. Staff very attentive. ,5,2017,08,13
113,"Beautiful hotel, excellent location, good service, poor WiFi","We stayed at The Kensington for a family visit to London. The location is excellent -- a few blocks from the Tube and nearby to many great attractions.  Despite being in a bustling neighborhood, we found the hotel itself to be very quiet inside.

We booked a family room, which consisted of two king beds, one of which was separated into two single beds.  The beds occupied most of the floor area, but there was still space for a small table with two chairs, and a bench. There was also a private foyer which provided additional space, including a closet.

The service was very good on the whole.  Michael, the Concierge, was very helpful in responding to our emailed questions both before and during our stay, and the bellmen were friendly and knowledgeable.  Staff in the restaurant, Town, seemed a bit distracted.

The main disappointment was that the (free) WiFi was so slow in the evenings as to be unusable.  This was a problem for us, as we tend do a lot of online research each evening as we plan the next day's activities.  (I reported this to the hotel but received no response.)",4,2017,08,12
113,"Simply the best in London ! Excellent food , ambience and location ","This hotel I am a regular guest at and I cannot rave more highly about the excellent service ! 
The recently appointed general manager Mr Sardelli  has taken it to the next level . It was brilliant before  now it has reached supreme heights . 

I recently injured myself -""broken foot"" and this was when the support of excellent breakfast staff - Barbara , Collins and Paul , the new bar manager - Ashley assisted by the faithful James . The brilliant concierge Martin . 

Thank you sincerely ..... I will not stay anywhere else . 

",5,2017,08,12
113,Perfect hotel in London!,"The hotel's location within an easy walk to a number of restaurants, sites, and South Kensington tube; super comfortable and inviting lobby area where one can order food and drinks; welcoming staff; our beautiful room with a lovely view, all worked out wonderfully for us. We would not stay anywhere else while in London.

The Kensington is not inexpensive, so we took a chance to reserve the advance rate without a cancellation opportunity. It worked out for us but it was a chance to take. We also reserved a deluxe room due to a number of reviews stating that standard and superior rooms may be too small. Our deluxe room was perfect. 

We are walkers so the location was perfect for us to explore the area, walk to dinner and to Harrods. But, the hotel is also a two block walk to the tube so perfectly located to explore the entire City and beyond. We took a day to visit Salisbury and it was a painless experience from our central location.

We hope to return soon!",5,2017,08,11
113,Fabulous stay as usual :),"I've stayed at The Kensington many times and this place never fails to deliver.  From the moment I walk in the door and the lovely George greets me, I feel at home.  I especially appreciate everyone's kindness and tips for the local area.  The beds are especially comfortable.  I very highly recommend for a great London stay!",5,2017,08,10

113,cozy townhouse,"Love the Kensington! I come here for business trips quite often and at the end of the day is like going back home. Highlights are definitely the living room, with the lovely couches and fireplace, the bar, and the amazing breakfast. The staff is very nice and helpful.
The rooms are not huge, but very nice by London standards. I love the ones on the last floor, overlooking the street.",5,2017,08,10
113,Charlotte M.,"This is my second trip to this hotel. I came 5 years ago with my 2 children. Each time I have had an amazing stay. I love the warm and beautiful decor but even more special are the kind and courteous staff, especially George. They do everything possible to make your stay exceptional. Being an English expat it is nice to have a 'home' to come to. I can't wait to come back!",5,2017,08,10
113,Week's holiday,"Myself and my son (14yrs) stayed here for one week. It has beautiful d√©cor, the lounge area very nice and the entrance to the hotel, we had cocktails there and afternoon tea which was lovely, the ""Beauty and the beast"" tea was very popular and booked up for months, but as we were guests they had a table for us, which was lovely. The room (5th floor family room) was nice and spacious 2 separate double beds, TV, desk etc, en-suite bathroom with open shower, nice and big space. Quiet at night time, could open the window's for fresh air as well as air conditioning. The only down side was the internet/wifi, terrible connection, the hotel put in a BT booster but it didn't really make a difference, very slow, kept crashing, even the business centre computers in the reception area had poor service, although in the lounge area it did seem to work, and there were a few guests using their computers etc in that area. The hotel is in a great position close to South Kensington tube, walking distance to Harrods in about 25 min, Fulham Rd close by, and then in the other direction close to Hyde Park.",3,2017,08,10
113,London biz trip,"I came to London and I enjoyed my business trip at the Kensington hotel, the facilities were lovely and up to date and I met George and Gvido and Elena and all the staff were amazing and I hope to come back again soon and this is a perfect place to stay.",5,2017,08,10
113,London trip ,I like the place and I stayed at the Kensington on the queensgate nice place and we enjoyed sitting in the lobby by the fireplace and we had a fun time. The hotel is new and is located in South Kensington we met George and he was lovely to talk to and we highly recommend.,5,2017,08,09
113,Great location........,"We stayed at The Kensington for five nights in July while attending the tennis at Wimbledon. A short walk to South Kensington tube station and an easy stroll to Hyde Park and Harrods Department Store.
Service at the Hotel was excellent and an enjoyable breakfast was provided each day. Our room was comfortable but very small - we could not get a suitcase past the end of the double bed !! Well maintained for its age.",4,2017,08,08
113,The Kensington,"Fantastic place to stay. Stunning building and location, very nice rooms, great shower! I had the full English breakfast which was excellent. Very helpful staff and accommodating staff, we were in the lobby drinking until the small hours, which seemed perfectly acceptable. Would highly recompensed and will stay again. ",5,2017,08,08
113,Fabulous place to stay.,"I have just had four fabulous nights at The Kensington. I would like to thank all the staff for being so friendly and helpful from the moment I walked in... George at the front door was welcoming and full of smiles. Ashley at the K bar was very polite, professional and welcoming. I so enjoyed having breakfast and lunch in the lounge area where we were served by a gorgeous lady (I think her name was Laura). All the staff who work behind the scenes, ( the housekeepers) the room was immaculately kept. It was a real pleasure to be somewhere that delivered great service and I felt that all the staff enjoyed working at the hotel. A compliment to the  management for keeping your staff motivated and delivering great service with a smile. I will return. ",5,2017,08,07
113,Amazing staff,"The Kensington in its entirety is a wonderful experience, one that would not be made possible if not for the amazing staff. They make it their mission to get to know you and your family. Make sure to look for George when going!! He is an amazing employee, one which makes every day just a little brighter.",5,2017,08,07
113,Lovely,"Very quaint hotel that was a bit warn out, you can tell it was loved by many people. The staff made the stay worth staying at this hotel. George and Martins specifically were extremely accommodating and helpful. ",4,2017,08,05
113,Amazing experience!,"My first trip to London and the Kensington has been the best place to stay. Very clean hotel with comfortable beds and amazing customer service! George at the front is amazing! He's always smiling, friendly, and ready to lend a helping hand. The location is great and is only a 15-20 minute walk to Knightsbridge/Harrods and Hyde Park. A 5-10 minute walk to the tube also.",5,2017,08,05
113,Beauty and the Beast Afternoon tea,"Fantastic experience visiting the Kensington for their Beauty and the Beast afternoon tea. Lovely hotel and surroundings. 

Service was fantastic and everything explained well before your order.

My slight complaint would be that I like a traditional afternoon tea and this was a little bit quirky!! Instead of scones jam and clotted cream they serve brioche !!! NO NO NO like the film said if it's not baroque then don't fix it.... we asked for scones instead and they were very obliging but we did hear lots of other people asking for scones but the waiter said they were running low.

A great experience and I would recommend but ask for scones ! üëç",5,2017,08,04
113,Beauty and the Beast Afternoon Tea ,"Booked the Beauty and the Beast Champagne Afternoon Tea for myself and my husband months in advance as it was so popular. 

We don't live in London and the travel was well worth it. 

The hotel is gorgeous, beautifully designed and is comfortable and bright. 

The afternoon tea was excellent. We had a selection of starters to begin, including Mini Venison Pie, Mini Cheese Souffl√© and Mini Beef Arancini. All delicious. 

The afternoon tea itself was wonderfully themed to Beauty and the Beast, with plenty of novelty cakes and pastries (the vanilla jelly was amazing). 

Sandwiches were delicious with a selection of fillings and staff checked prior to serving if we had any allergies or dietary requirements (we didn't) and were happy to supplement items. 

The staff were exceptional and made you feel welcome at all times, they were extremely friendly. 

The hotel itself is in a great location, within easy walking distance of the Natural History Museum, which we headed to after leaving the hotel. 

Would love to return to the hotel for dinner and an overnight stay, it was lovely. ",5,2017,08,04
113,Stunning hotel with exceptional service,"From start to finish my  stay at the Kensington was truly exceptional. From the booking over the phone with Georgiana to the concierge and reception teams our stay was one to remember (Tip - Vincent and Michael have a wealth of knowledge of London in concierge and are members of the illustrious ""Keys"" society). The room was exceptional and we really enjoyed the strawberry and champagne amenities! We also dined in the townhouse and K Bar - the cocktails by James in the bar were gorgeous and the seafood special was the best fish I've ever tasted! It truly was a 5 star stay!",5,2017,08,03
113,Wonderful Hotel!,"We just returned from a trip traveling through England and The Kensington was one of our favorite hotels!  So charming and clean with a fantastic restaurant and helpful staff.  We absolutely loved their bellhops, George (Baby George) and Gvido!  They were always there to greet us with a smile, a helpful suggestion for dinner or just to welcome us back from our travels.  If we ever find ourselves traveling to London in the future, I would absolutely book another stay at The Kensington!",5,2017,08,02
113,Lovely place to stay,"The Kensington was a very nice hotel. It's a very clean hotel and we love the turn down service. They were very helpful, from storing the buggy and getting it out for us to getting us in to the Tale as old as time sold out tea.  It's a wonderful location however cabs were still needed to travel around and they were awesome at getting us a cab when needed.  Very friendly staff.  ",4,2017,07,31
113,Great Hotel with great service,"At the end of our holiday 4 nights at the Kensington really topped off our experience. Great service, location and presentation made us welcome and looking forward to coming back. Staff were always courteous and attentive.",5,2017,07,30
113,Londres ,"Very good the Hotel! The service is great and the Bar's food is delicious... really recomendable! 
George the concierge is very helpful and gave us very good information, and recomended us some places to visit!",5,2017,07,30
113,Pure elegance and class!,"We've stayed at the Kensington several times over the years and it consistently maintains its impeccable standards in every regard. The interior is simply gorgeous, with beautiful seating areas, including some newly revamped exterior seating spaces called their ""Portico"", which I completely LOVE! The ideal spot to have a cup of tea or a cocktail and people-watch on Queens Gate.

The standard rooms are comfortable and immaculately clean, although small (it is central London, after all). The gym is very modern and larger than expected. The breakfast offerings are varied and the waitstaff extremely attentive. The bar at the Townhouse serves beautiful cocktails in an old-world upscale setting.

The Kensington is the perfect balance of bright hospitality and glamour--a true delight in every aspect! They've also got a great Instagram account which paints a really accurate snapshot of the hotel's charm.",5,2017,07,30
113,Perfect 5 day stay.,"The service, standard of accommodation, location and ambience of hotel made this a wonderful 5 day stay. The helpful staff at all levels certainly enhanced our stay. The rooms are magnificent. Highly recommend this hotel. The location is perfect.",5,2017,07,30
113,Excellent!,"I really enjoyed my visit here. Well appointed, quiet, elegant hotel with excellent service and an excellent location - especially for street shopping and very close to the South Kensington tube stop. Live evening string music out front was a lovely touch. The concierge provided excellent restaurant recommendations as well.  (Really enjoyed Thali just down the street). I left for the airport this morning and discovered when I got there that I had left my passport in the hotel room safe. The hotel staff were incredibly helpful at retrieving it and dispatching a driver to Heathrow with it - I'm happy to say - in time for me to make my flight! Thanks so much for your help and kindness. I will be recommending this hotel to everyone I know who is travelling to London!",5,2017,07,29
113,Birthday trip. ,"I stayed here for a two night break with my wife to celebrate her birthday. The hotel was fantastic. Just a short walk from the tube on a street that was quiet yet close to plenty of bars an restaurants. It is also ideally situated for the natural history museum, the science museum and the Victoria & Albert museum. The staff at the hotel are all very welcoming.",5,2017,07,26
113,"rooms, breakfast, service, location all excellent","I have stayed in this property several times, it is becoming a bit of a home from home in London. I have always had good experiences, the property is on a human scale and so is the service (e.g. I was ill and one of the staff went to the local supermarket to get me some Lemsip, life saver). On this occasion, I had the good fortune to be upgraded and had a large and charming room on the first floor. I was greeted with a platter of fruit and a bottle of wine (but I only ate the chocolates!). My only regret was that i was there for work and was in late and out early most days, so I couldn't hang out a bit more in the hotel (e.g. there was a lovely little balcony to my room which would have been a perfect spot to read a newspaper over breakfast!).
That said, the breakfast is great, the dining room is again on a human, more cosy scale the service is fast and the staff are attentive.
anyhow when I go back to London I hope to stay here again. 
The only drawback is no USB plugs in the room, had to bring convertor.",5,2017,07,26
113,"Lovely hotel, wonderful staff","The Kensington Hotel is in a lovely location - slightly out of the central-London hustle, but really close to several of the big museums (V&A, Natural History etc.) and not far from the shopping areas of Knightsbridge and Sloane Square. It's a beautiful building and it really lives up to its looks. There were a lot of thoughtful touches throughout - on check-in we were offered a glass of fresh juice and a hot towel and when my Mum and I came back to our rooms on the first evening we had both been left a basket of fresh fruit. The rooms were very comfortable - great beds! - with both a kettle with teas etc. and Nespresso machine. Most important, however, were the staff - they absolutely made the weekend for my Mum and I with their care and attention. Martins and George, the doormen, were both so sweet and considerate; they always had a nice word for us and looked after us when we spent hours chatting on the outside patio! And nothing was too much trouble for Elena or Sandor either, who brought us drinks and delicious breakfasts. For me at least this is the perfect London hotel - comfortable rooms, great location and absolute 5* staff.",5,2017,07,23
113,London 2017,This hotel has great service and a very nice staff. The concierge was very knowledgeable about the area with lovely accommodations. Great complimentary breakfast buffet also being able to order off the menu. Definitely would stay here again.,5,2017,07,23
113,Wonderful coffee time,"We really enjoyed spending time in this lovely hotel. It's such a great place to spend an afternoon - cosy and elegant. The staff is very friendly. We were served by Saverio. He provided such a great service. The concierge - George, is also a super friendly man. Thank you so much for having us. We will come back for another cup of coffee.",5,2017,07,23
113,Great hotel ,"Great hotel, the location is amazing very close to the south Kensington train station.  Several great restaurants nearby.  The hotel itself is outstanding.  The service is great and the rooms are nice as well.  Highly recommend ",5,2017,07,20
113,Wonderful experience with amazing staff,"We stayed here last weekend with some friends and found the whole experience truly outstanding.  The first room we checked into was small so we asked if we could change to something bigger and this was sorted out without any fuss whatsoever.  This is a beautiful hotel with gorgeous common areas and spotless, well appointed rooms.  But these factors pale into insignificance when compared to the staff.  Friendly, professional without ever being over formal, and giving the impression that they are genuinely proud to be part of the hotel's team.  And finally, the breakfast was outstanding.  We would definitely stay again next time we're in London.",5,2017,07,19
113,Amazing ,"I visited The Townhouse at The Kensington with my mum for the Tale As Old As Time afternoon tea. Having had my booking since February, I had a lot of anticipation and excitement about this visit. I had phoned in advance to inform that this visit was as a celebration for my mum's birthday, and my goodness did the staff pull out all the stops to ensure it was special. From the celebratory Birthday plate, to the complimentary glass of champagne for mum- all these little touches really made the visit extra special. 

Coupled with that, the food was brilliant, the presentation and the whole experience was filled with delicate touches and made for a wonderful occasion. The service was also outstanding, nothing was too much trouble for the staff, they were attentive but did not rush us, offered extra sandwiches etc where appropriate.

Special thanks to the chefs as well who ensured that I had a gluten free afternoon tea, and did their level best to make it as similar to the ordinary one as possible and didn't make it so obvious!

But finally, my sincerest and warmest thanks to Vincenzo who was fantastic and oversaw everything and ensured it was perfect! ",5,2017,07,19
113,The best hotel that I have ever stayed in,"The hotel also has a really nice lounge and restaurant inside which serves fine food, 
This hotel is amazing and If you want to stay here for a few nights or just show up to enjoy their amazing drinks and food they have, either one would be a good choice. This place is so fun to come to with family, friends, or as a couple. Everyone I ran into-from staff to even guests-greeted me with a hello or smile. I've stayed at several (so-called) high-end places, but this place takes the cake where even I was impressed. The staff at this lovely establishment are all wonderful from Martyn and George at the concierge and the young waitress Laura(from portugal).  I had a pleasant afternoon chatting with her Finishing off my afternoon tea with the standout green terrace, I figured I'd better return to the real world. True to my word, I took a walk on the streets all the way to hyde park gardens . The swans were taking a break on the side out of the water, but it was nice to see something I've heard so much about.  Later on coming back to the hotel was a bliss, the flags lining outside the door, the fabulous English townhouse and the avenue full of trees were all fabulous. I do wish I could have seen it prior to the renovation a few years back; I hear it was even more spectacular.",5,2017,07,19
113,A hidden gem with great people,"Great hotel for families seeing the city due to its location. Or great for businessmen needing to do meetings in across areas of town. Free fast Wi-Fi worked, and the security and service were great.  This place has a good location. There's a Starbucks across 3 minutes from the street, Dajani and boots pharmacy downstairs, subway station in the same street with access to both Victoria and circle lines and eastbound /westbound lines, liquor stores within 2 minutes, and lots of restaurants within walking distance on old brompton road. The front desk was super helpful too-- when we checked in, We asked for a dinner recommendation and Andre suggested Bumpkin pub down the street--- amazing English pub! The bellman agent George & James our bartender were fantastic in their service. The hotel‚Äòs staff overall were very pleasant to be honest.",5,2017,07,18

2) Would there be availability, at this late   stage, to stay overnight in our favourite London hotel?

Yes! Saved by The Kensington Hotel...
Customer Care at its best!!!

Approached the hotel... Fully booked...
But... A suite had been reserved for viewing next morning, & was available if necessary...
We were so fortunate...
A cute cosy suite... with the skyline of London included!!!

We arrived after midnight (so late) to the usual warm welcome of The Kensington's staff...
The Duty Manager, Porter, Reception guy ""pulled all the stops out"" for us... 
an abundance of smiles & effort!!!

We were so grateful to be in the homely, familiar surroundings of The Kensington again... 
It had been a difficult day... 
our original plans had been destroyed, 
But... 
What a relief, now...
We could relax!!!

113,Unmatched,"We stayed here for a couple of nights before heading out to Rome Italy and our stay was wonderfully and unforgettably fantastic. The hotel is modern, clean, stylish and so homely. The buffet style breakfast the best, and wonderful turn down service was a nice touch. The most important of all though was the level of service that we received throughout the hotel, it was extremely personal and very attentive. Special Mention to some of the staff we talked to like Cillian, James for all his amazing cocktails and not to mention the front desk staff Vincent concierge, Ronnie and George from his team, If we forgot someone sorry but you were all lovely . thank you and we'll recommend this hotel a lot.",5,2017,07,12
113,An Upscale Hotel near Underground Station,"My wife and I stayed at The Kensington for four nights in June 2017 as part of an Arts and Crafts Tour in England and Scotland sponsored by the Frank Lloyd Wright Trust.  The Trust's travel partner, Benefactor Travel, selected this hotel.  It is a beautiful property and the public areas and the rooms are very nice.  The room in which we stayed (#329) was very spacious and it had a very large bathroom.  We had breakfast at the hotel each day there and were pleased with the selections offered.  The only dinner we had at the hotel was the meal that kicked off our tour and it was very tasty.  There are plenty of other dining options in easy walking distance.  Since we tend to use public transportation rather than taxis when traveling, we were pleased that the South Kensington station on the Underground was within an easy walking distance. ",5,2017,07,12
113,Kensington Hotel Luxury ,"This is a fine, friendly hotel with a beautiful classic decor and a great location. We visited the Championships at Wimbledon daily from this location by underground but it is handy for local restaurants and the museums as well.
Rooms are well serviced, WiFi is free and the staff are attentive. Breakfast a la carte menu is excellent. Rooms are comfortable and pleasant if a bit on the small side for visitors from the new world, otherwise a great experience.",5,2017,07,12
113,Not what it used to be,"Stayed here a few times a few years ago and loved it so, shunning our new favourite, we decided to return for nostalgic reasons. What a disappointment. Not sure quite how our room could be called a bedroom; we could barely get around the bed and there were no curtains so we were bolt awake at 5am.  To top it off, on calling room service at 7am to order breakfast, they call back 5 minutes later to clarify ""it was toast and ham wasn't it; not toast and yams?""  Really?!  Not exactly unusual to order toast and jam you'd think!  Not the sort of service you expect.",3,2017,07,12
113,Excellent Hotel...,"Always stop at The Kensington when visiting this part of London. The location, rooms and staff are excellent, with the staff always polite and helpful. The overall ambience of the hotel is very relaxing and look forward to visiting again soon...",5,2017,07,11

113,London 2017,"The Kensington was absolutely amazing. London was everything I ever dreamed it would be and more. I was especially thankful for the kindness of one of the employees at the hotel, George. He gave us many wonderful suggestions about where to eat and secured us a reservation at the ""Beauty and the Beast"" afternoon tea. ",5,2017,07,11
113,Fantastic stay,"We recently stayed at this hotel & it exceeded our expectations! We were traveling with two teens and stayed in a "" family "" room. This was a large room with a king & two twins with a large bathroom. This was a great set up for our family, plenty of room.  The staff was fantastic, extremely attentive. A special shout out to George, for his kindness & suggestions of restaurants &neighborhood attractions. Our kids still talk about how nice he was. The hotel is also in the Kensington neighborhood, which we adored. The breakfast in the hotel is also a plus, lovely service. We wish our stay was longer & hope to return.",5,2017,07,09
113,Great location and staff,"Greeted on the steps by the doorman and checked-in with refreshing cool drink and hot towel.. the staff were just lovely and made us really feel our holiday had started.
Great food in the restaurant. We particular enjoyed the superfood salad, Dover Sole and the greens( cabbage or kale...fantastic)
Small but comfortable bedrooms . traditional period feel hotel common areas that were very well styled
Will be back",4,2017,07,09
113,Top Notch,"Boutique hotel with snap service from Martins and George. Beautiful traditional rooms that make you feel at home.  Top neighborhood, excellent Town House dining, close to all - will certainly return and recommend it to our friends and colleagues.",5,2017,07,07
113,Very friendly hotal,"I stayed here for one night on business. Staff were very kind and friendly. Offered a cold towel at reception on check in as it was a red hot day in London and a complimentary bottle of cold water on check out. Very quiet room which was a good size for London. Even came back after a late evening event to find they had been in to re-tidy the room, refresh towels and close the Curtains which was a nice touch! I believe the building was originally 4 town houses merged and they have retained the original features very well. Breakfast was continental although you could pay extra for hot food but the continental choice was varied and excellent. Hotel is only 5 mins walk from tube, parks, V&A etc so nice and central. I will stay there again and would definately recommend.",5,2017,07,07
113,Real London Experience courtesy of the kensington,"We have been coming to London during our summer break from Australia, but this trip was a big highlight.

Our room was gorgeous with plenty of amenities - Nespresso machine, fluffy pillows and a giant screen TV amongst others. We toured the shopping places while staying here from Harrods a few minutes from the hotel, selfridges, harvey nichols and other cool places by Kings Road thanks to our lovely concierge Martyn for the recommendations. Special Thank you to Sandor for an excellent breakfast service and finally gorgeous George for all his help and he still didn't tell us how he remembered all our names, I'm talking about 10 people + in our group but what a service. We'll come back again to the hotel next year.",5,2017,07,07
113,Best Honeymoon Hotel!,"My husband and I decided to make London our first stop on our honeymoon and the service exceeded all our expectations! Not only is this hotel gorgeous, but our room was spacious and immaculate. It felt like a home away from home with everything that we could possibly need. The entire staff was so friendly and helpful, it felt as if they were all old friends of ours! Everyone went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and welcome, without being overly pushy or hovering over us. We were greeted with fresh juices upon check-in and offered to hold our luggage after checking-out so we could explore the city a bit more. Upon learning that it was our honeymoon trip, the staff surprised us with a bottle of champagne with a congratulatory card during turndown service. George was especially kind and helpful- he gave great restaurant recommendations and checked on us throughout our stay to ensure we were comfortable. I can't thank everyone enough for the lovely stay- I will absolutely be back and miss the hotel already!",5,2017,07,06
113,Wonderful hotel on Queen's Gate,We returned to stay at the Kensington. The friendly and helpful staff once again made our stay a joy. Love the comfort and design of the public rooms and bar. Great breakfast selection and service too. Doormen and conseirge services are exceptional. Great help from George and Ovdd getting Uber. Love the neighborhood and restaurants. Highly recommend the Kensington for a smaller hotel and more intimate experience.,5,2017,07,06
113,Couldn't of asked for a nicer afternoon,"I came here with a group of friends for the Tale as Old as Time afternoon tea and it didn't disappoint. Everything about the hotel and afternoon tea was simple superb. We had a fantastic time and couldn't of asked for nicer servers. Nothing was to much, thank you for making our time so special.",5,2017,07,05

113,Great Staff!,"The staff is very friendly. Martins, the doorman, was fantastic and provided excellent recommendations for restaurants. The hotel is located close to the metro and to many museums. We booked a ""superior"" room which was clean but VERY small. We were not able to open our suitcases anywhere but on the bed. I would definitively recommend this hotel but upgrade to a deluxe room if possible.",4,2017,07,03
113,Nearly there,"Early June, having arrived in on a red eye from NYC we didn't expect to get a room immediately and we were correct. We left our bags and asked to be called when the room was ready. We had a wedding reception from 3 to attend and the staff said the room would be ready by 11. We went up to a local coffee shop and chilled out expecting a call. It never came so we walked back to a hotel to be told it would be closer to 2 by the time it would ready. It was going to be cutting it so decided to walk to Harrods department store for some browsing. We arrived back at 2 to the hotel and were told to take a seat in the lobby. To cut a long story short, we got to the room by 2:40 and rushed to get ready. We asked the staff to have a taxi ready for 3.15 which was never ready and ended up hailing one ourselves. Totally disappointing. nice interiors but let down by service which was not 5 star. total incompetence and not great service. on a plus, the bar and restaurant served great food and cocktails.",3,2017,07,02
113,Excellent Service,The Kensington Hotel was our first stop on our bucket list 3 week trip of Europe. This hotel was awesome and the staff were very friendly. Gvido meet us on the first day and helped us with our luggage and was so helpful getting us around the city and always so professional. Another staff member that stood out and nothing was to hard and he always went out of his way for us was Sandor both are great members to have in your employ they deserve recognition we had a fantastic stay and will revisit this hotel again Sharon & Peter Gallagher ,5,2017,07,02
113,Staff,"Great housekeeping, concierge and front desk.  Felt like home - excellent staff.    Felt like home. Booked a package with a superior room.  Seemed small to me.  Hotel was able to upgrade us at a reasonable price to a deluxe room (this is not always possible, I assume).",5,2017,06,30
113,The best most understanding and kind staff and hotel ever!!!!  Made me love London.,"I have to tell how great they were with me and my son.  We had to leave early because my son was having anxiety attacks.  They did everything they could to help us feel more comfortable but we had to cut our trip short and go back to US.  I totally didn't expect a refund because it was prepaid but they understood our situation and made an exception.  I got a refund, they changed our room during our stay because my son was feeling claustrophobic due to smaller quarters than he is used to.  It helped a lot but my son was very nervous about being there with the recent terror attacks he heard of on the news.  Please be rest assured travelers, it is totally safe and London is the most loveliest safest and nicest place ever.  I will definitely go back and stay at the Kensington.  Thank you sooooo much.  I believe there are more beautiful and wonderful people in this world and acts of kindness that go unnoticed or unrecognized.  Unfortunately we are bombarded  with 24 hrs of so many news channels that keep showing us the ugly and bad.  There is always hope and I believe.  Thanks again Kensington for showing me why I do believe.    God Bless The Kensington and London.    ",5,2017,06,29
113,Did not want to leave!,"What a lovely gem in London! I spent 5 nights in room 415, huge accommodation with 2 great queen size beds. Silent and cozy, perfect for my 3 working days at Canary Wharf. The underground (South Kensington) is only 3 blocks away and very convenient to travel anywhere in London (it was only 25 min to Canary Wharf on the district and jubilee lines. The decor of this hotel is wonderful,color in sofas and chairs yet elegant and soothing. The bar is special and so are the terraces overlooking Queen's Gate. I personally loved the neighbourhood, elegant, beautiful homes and atmosphere. There are many pubs only a couple of blocks away. Bumpkin was quite special! but what made my stay absolutely perfect was the service and staff. Everyone was genuinely warm and friendly. Nicolas and his front desk team, Marresa, the host at the breakfast room, the cleaning staff, everybody had a smile on their face! I would return to this hotel in a heartbeat. I really did not wish to leave!",5,2017,06,27
113,Great hotel coupled with fine Hospitality,"The hotel was very good also very true to its description. Staff were fantastic and delivered first class level of service and professionalism at all times with few mentions Martyn, Vincent, George and Cillian, they checked up on us every time to ask if we were enjoying our stay without being obtrusive. The room was beautiful and luxurious. They provide towels, lotions, bath soaps, shavers and blowing dryer for your hair, Free Wi-Fi is provided too. The room has a mini bar fridge, safe and international adapters unit which is a bonus. We slept great and enjoyed the beddings a lot. It was a Great place of great value. We needed a place to stay while we visited London for the weekend and a show at the royal Albert hall which is a large expense on its own so this was so affordable and worth it.",5,2017,06,26
113,Fantastic and unbelievably the best,"My mum plus others in our family came to London for our European tour and we stayed at this gorgeous, stylish and luxurious hotel in south kensington. When we arrived our room wasn't ready but they took our bags and kept them in the storage and we freshened up took the maps from the concierge and some directions to check and explore the neighborhood. 
We loved the decor and the English townhouse with a hint of 1900's feel and everything inside the hotel was just perfect. Our most memorable highlight was the service Specially from George and Martyn the concierge who went out of their way to make our stay spectacular and the lovely suggestions that they recommended to us. We'll definitely come back again soon and of course stay here.",5,2017,06,26
113,Pleasant stay in London,"Unbelivable experience, everybody smiles, everything works as expected.
The general Manager Francesco Sardelli is a realgentleman.
Next trip to London: The Kensington. And the next too!
George at the front door is everything you expect when you arrive from a long trip.",5,2017,06,24
113,Great bar and service to be had in Kensington ,"The service here is old school service  like MadMen and a must add to any trip to Kensington area . The hotel is very upscale and every member of the staff is helpful . The room rate is very affordable for the area. Some of these other reviews are rubbish !

",5,2017,06,23
113,Couldn't be better,"A superb hotel full of charm and character. It's so refreshing to stay somewhere with personality and a touch of individual luxury. The staff are so friendly, attentive and professional. One of my favourite places to stay.",5,2017,06,23
113,A lovely cozy hotel in an excellent location.,"I have visited this lovely cozy hotel three times so far and I have never been disappointed. The rooms are decorated with attention and character and overall the hotel has a very ""British atmosphere "". The reception, the lobby and the restaurant are full of lighted candles and the whole building smells so good!! The breakfast and the afternoon tea are excellent and the staff is very well trained, always smiling, polite and helpful. Congratulations to the manager and his team!! I will definitely go back in my future trip to London ",5,2017,06,22
113,Excellent hotel where you can feel like home,"I have stayed at this hotel several times and have never been disappointed. Staff always make you feel welcome and at home with both facilities, cleanliness and location being great as well. During this stay, the staff exceeded my expectations by dishing up food late in the night, long after everything else had closed in London. Only minus (which is really not a minus and something you should get used to when staying at London hotels) is that rooms are relatively small.",5,2017,06,21
113,Consistently Great,"I've stayed here several times now and referred friends and family.  Everyone has been pleased with the accommodations, amenities, service, and location.  It's big enough to stay anonymous if you want, but it's also small/intimate enough to feel like ""everyone knows your name"", if you prefer to have that kind of experience.  Overall a great boutique hotel experience.  My go-to London choice.",5,2017,06,21
113,Absolutely Wonderful Stay,"My colleague and I were traveling for business.  We stayed at The Kensington for a week.  I work in the customer service industry and this hotel is spot on with superior customer service.  The property is beautiful and the service is outstanding.

In the evenings, we received stellar service from Laura and our bartender, Gabriel.  They were amazing with their recommendations on fantastic food and drink after a long work day.  Also, Chef Tiago was incredible for making us desserts when it was a little past the time the kitchen would normally serve desserts.  The lemon flip cocktail and the lemon posset dessert are heavenly.

In the mornings, we received first name greetings from George and Martin.  George even went out of his way to make sure we had cold water before we left the hotel.

It is a fantastic place to stay while away on business.  The hotel was comfortable. The sleep was great.  And the service was simply the best.  I'm looking forward to my next trip to London and hope to stay again at The Kensington.",5,2017,06,20
113,Great Location,"The Kensington is located near a great museum complex, the Royal Albert Hall and Harrods.  Beautiful rooms and friendly staff!  The hotel is within walking distance of ATM and trendy restaurants and food shops.",5,2017,06,19
113,Memorable Experience in the Kensington Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Kensington Hotel for seven nights in June.  The hotel and its staff provided us with excellent services and the room was spacious, comfortable, posh decor, and with a modern bathroom.  The daily breakfast was loaded with a variety of food and beverages. We had dinner at the restaurant one evening and were very pleased with the high-quality of the food and excellent services.  Overall, it is a hotel we will return in our next visit.",5,2017,06,18
113,Not good enough,"Recently stayed two nights at The Kensington, location brilliant, staff brilliant, ambience brilliant, room clean, nice , prison cells are bigger, two of us crammed into a room less than 3 metres by 3 metres, just not acceptable, it was a superior deluxe room, I would hate to think what the size of a normal room would be.
Just uncomfortable, and not good enough,",3,2017,06,18
113,Just tell the truth !!! Hate being lied to,"Ok so to start we booked a DELUXE double at the Kensington hotel ! ( deluxe will be come important shortly) 

On arrival we are told that three floors are flooded so we have to stay at the shall we say scruffier one round the corner 
Having read the number of people on here had the same this hotel is clearly scamming selling it on the DELUXE looking nice hotel then shoving any one on a deal into the cheap seats round the corner ! Why lie it's a clear thing the hotel is doing if you had said from the start wouldn't have mattered 

So on to the room which was nothing more than a cupboard with just enough room to fit a bed and a wardrobe in, the official pictures on the web site look nothing like the rooms you have been warned ! My partner had trouble walking round the bed it was so small, the TV was broken and the room very dated. The bed was soft, uncomfortable beyond belief, the fridge kept me awake all night and the view overlooking a wall underwhelming ( ok this is London you don't expect a view but at least tell people the truth 

I will say breakfast was nice and the staff were very accommodating 

So on check out I asked what made our room DELUXE receptionist said it has a tv and a kettle, so I asked do you have rooms without TVs and kettles which she said no so the double deluxe is another nonsense her own words they are all double deluxe !! So another lie 

And just to be clear I told the guy who took us too our room and the receptionist we weren't happy and got a guilty looking not our fault response, one said well this is London like somehow that's ok 

Be very wary of these hotels lies appear to come very easily to them shame really could be a great little place",1,2017,06,18
113,Wonderful hotel with outstanding customer service!,"My husband and I were traveling with our parents for a trip to London and the Kensington Hotel made our stay truly a pleasure. At check in we were greeted with a warm hand towel and fresh juice, and proceeded into a beautifully decorated room for our stay. When jet lag hit at 1 am we ordered room service and the staff was very friendly even for so late an hour, not to mention the food was divine. We will be back again the next time we are in London!",5,2017,06,15
113,One of the best,"Short visit to London 1 day and was looking for something nice to relax for 1 night. Couldn't have made a better choice. Ambience in the hotel  bar and restaurant is just right. service at breakfast was excellent. Rooms spacious, clean and up to date! Couldn't fault this hotel.",5,2017,06,14
113,Excellent Hotel in South Kensington!,"My friend, and I, recently spent two nights at The Kensington as part of a girls trip to London. We had a fabulous experience, and highly recommend the property! The rooms are on the smaller end, although it was perfectly fine with two friends. The staff went out of their way to be friendly and helpful, and always greeted us with a big smile and a helpful attitude! It's very conveniently located, only a few blocks from the South Kensington tube station, the Victoria & Albert Museum, and a short walk to Hyde Park. I highly recommend a stay at The Kensington!  ",5,2017,06,12
113,Comfortable & Convenient,"Excellent place to stay. Close to the train, we were able to move about London easily and get back to our hotel with ease.  Nearby street had everything from small cafes to pubs to groceries. 
They were very accommodating and friendly. Strongly recommend.",5,2017,06,11
113,"Smart , Convenient and Comfortable",Excellent hotel in a very nice and convenient location. Very thoughtful service culture operated by a pleasant and respectful team at every level. The rooms and public areas are fine and the overall impression is of a very well balanced mix of sophistication and comfort.,5,2017,06,08
113,Treat,"The hotel and location were great especially for the Royal Albert Hall, I thought the staff were very attentive throughout our stay nothing was to much trouble.  Room was excellent, comfy bed a good nights sleep.",5,2017,06,08
113,A Delightful Hotel,"My wife and I arrived in London from New York at 7:30 A.M. The hotel staff quickly made us feel comfortable, and arranged to call us when our room was ready. The hotel staff were all very friendly, courteous and helpful, making our three day stay in London an enjoyable experience. The hotel common areas were very inviting and comfortable.",5,2017,06,06
113,Very satisfied!,"nice hotel, excellentt staff. The rooms were very comfortable. People were very helpfull but also kept their distance. Easy to reach from the underground as well. The restaurant looked very good. All in all a very nice place to stay",5,2017,06,05
113,Beautiful hotel & great location,"We loved The Kensington Hotel. The location is great if you want to be further from tourist crowds and surrounded with beautiful architecture of South Kensington. Hotel itself is lovely, very quiet and elegant. Food was great for breakfast, dinner or just cream tea. Staff was very helpful all the time.  Tube station is only few blocks away and it takes about 10-15 minutes to be in the center of the City. The Natural History museum is just down the street and Victoria and Albert few minutes away. We enjoyed walking to Kensington Gardens, Albert Hall or Harrods. There are quite a few good restaurants near by. Strongly recommended.",5,2017,06,04
113,Elegant hotel and fantastic service,The reception staff were excellent specially Carlos and George and Michael at concierge were very helpful all the time. Nice and polite staff. The restaurant was great and our sever Martin was amazing.,5,2017,06,04
113,Good location ,"Stayed for 2 nights in a one bedroom suite and was very nice. The room was spacious with beautiful decor and the bathroom offered desperate bathtub and shower. The location is great and so easy to walk everywhere. 

The service and staff were okay although many didn't seem to know what they were doing. I think they were in training but they definitely weren't ready. Every meal we had at the hotel ( 1 late lunch, 1 dinner and 2 breakfasts) the order was wrong somehow. Also, once we would give our order, about 5 minutes later someone else would come ask for our order. In a five star hotel, that shouldn't happen. The service definitely could have been much better. The afternoon tea was cute though... beauty and the beast theme. 

The hotel offers parking at a near buy garage for ¬£50/day. 

Checking out was quick and easy although make sure to check the final bill carefully as they had an extra ¬£100 in charges that we didn't have. It was an okay stay but probably wouldn't rebook next time in London. ",3,2017,06,01
113,First time in London,"The room was spacious and service was excellent.  But not flexible with checking in and checking out times. 

Hotel location was excellent for food hunting, moving around London using the tube and room rates were reasonable.",3,2017,06,01
113,Beautiful hotel & friendly staff,"My wife and I spent the last 2 nights in London in this hotel and had a great experience. All the staff with which we interacted was very courteous and friendly.
The shared spaces in the hotel were beautiful and classically decorated. The room was very clean with elegant furnishings and thoughtful amenities included.
The location was also outstanding. Very close to many restaurants, 5-min walk to South Kensington station and Hyde Park. ",5,2017,05,31
113,"Beautiful hotel, great location, great staff","My husband and I spent four nights there 2 weeks ago. The rooms are very clean, comfortable and the hotel itself is in a great location. Everything we needed was readily available at the hotel. The staff were wonderful and super friendly and helpful. And most of all the price was very reasonable for London. The only thing I can say is that I know the last day we were there they had some big management from the hotel visiting and it made me feel that the staff were more uptight and almost fake when they were around. What I liked best about the hotel is that the staff were easy going and still professional at the same time, so I was a bit disappointed when the staff seemed stiff on our last day. It's a shame that it felt more corporate than personable and real when the big management were there. However, it was still a great place and everyone was friendly at all times. The most important thing is we were happy with our stay and if ever we are back in London, we will comeback to this hotel without a doubt. ",5,2017,05,29
113,2 Night Break,"Very friendly atmosphere,EVERY staff member said hello when we passed them anywhere in the hotel.Had cocktails in the bar and they were happy to make-up our own choice.Asked for a quiet room away from the road but got the fans going constantly all day & night.
Good location for Natural History,Science & V & A Museums.
Would return.",4,2017,05,29
113,Great Experience at the Kensington!,The hotel was very clean. The food was delicious. The service was exceptional. All the employees were very accommodating and extremely helpful. Two very nice guys in particular. George Micheal and Gvido. George even showed us an App. that was super instrumental in helping us get around the places we wanted to visit. I would highly recommend this hotel and the area around the hotel as well. There were great restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance. The train was also within very close walking distance. I would most definitely stay there again.,5,2017,05,29
113,surprising excellence,"I had never previously stayed in South Kensington, but had reason to do so and was astonished at the environment and particularly the hotel.  the staff were efficient, helpful and the accommodation was superior to the hotels I usually stay at in Mayfair, and at a more favourable room rate.",5,2017,05,29
113,"Comfort, Cordial, and Convenient","Happy to have chosen this part of London to stay 4 nights--close to Underground, convenience stores and take-away stores, pubs, and restaurants. Hotel staff seem to enjoy working there. Breakfast continental buffet offers many food choices--cereals, bread, hard-boiled eggs, yogurt, meats and cheeses, fruit, pastries. We thought the room was large based on our experience with London hotels--high ceilings, firm beds, comfy pillows, air-conditioning that could get cool enough. Gym has weights, bosu and stability balls, strength machines, treadmills and bikes. Bathrooms could use more places for your personal items.  Bathroom linen supply a bit off--only 1hand towel, no wash cloths some days, no bath mat another day. Received 2 bottles of water each day.",5,2017,05,28
113,"excellent service, good location, small rooms, expensive (but hey, it¬¥s London)","Had three rooms here - of three different categories. And - those categories don¬¥t make much of a difference. All rooms are expensive, the hallways are extremely narrow, the rooms are small. 

example: room 206: ""normal"" room size, Queen Size bed, flat screen, coffee-maker, relatively spacious bathroom. 

checking-in: really fast, very friendly - no complaints

As you don¬¥t want to spend more time than absolutely necessary in your room, you visit the bar or the lobby or the restaurant. All of which are recommended. 

breakfast: continental buffet was very limited in choice, so we ordered a la carte. again, very friendly service. One breakfast plate with eggs benedictine was badly cooked and replaced without fuzz. 

bar: prompt and very friendly service all night long. again - no complaints. 

Lobby food: again - excellent service, friendly, efficient - all good. 

location of the hotel: close to Picadilly line and in walking distance to South Ken, Museum of Natural History and a like. Perfect. 

WIFI - worked without fail. 

All in all: splendid hotel, mediocre Rooms - as usual in London. Service Top Quality.",4,2017,05,27
113,A wonderful place to stay ,"Stayed at The Kensington Hotel while attending the Chelsea flower show. On the first night we stayed in a superior room but had a few problems. Spoke with the front desk in the morning before going to the show. On our arrival back late afternoon to be told that we had been upgraded what a great surprise, now that is what you call guest services and all done with a smile.

",5,2017,05,25
113,1. class hotel,"Stayed for 2 nights May 2017 in this wonderful hotel. Nice room, friendly staff, cleanliness in top, nice area, close to museums and Albert Hall. Breakfast very good, buffet, but very good, in quiet resturant. Have no remarks but OUTSTANDING. ",5,2017,05,24
113,Wonderful time at the Kensington Hotel,"We stayed for two nights at the Kensington Hotel. It was a lovely time. The location is great, the hotel is classic and beautiful. Rooms are not large but very comfortable. Most impressive was the service: staff is so courteous, helpful and just generally wonderful. Starting from night receptionist who helped with explanation on how to get to hotel from Airport, through day receptionists who accommodated our early check in and late check out and were super helpful with everything else, through the cleaning services and of course concierge and porters who were so friendly and helpful with everything. We loved the hotel and will definitely consider returning if our travels bring us back to London.",5,2017,05,23
113,A dreamy hotel,"Amazing experience, beautiful vintage hotel, great service.
Loved the afternoon tea at the romantic lobby. Very friendly concierge. Excellent coffee in room. Note that some rooms are small, if you got one of these, best to complain and you would get another if available.",4,2017,05,22
113,Honeumoon,"The hotel is great with a nice room, we stayed in room 226 and we loved  the room. The staff is very good and attentive especially George and Michael at concierge. We hope to come again in future in south kensington london ",5,2017,05,21
113,Great location and excellent staff.,"The Kensington is conveniently close to the best museums, public transport, restaurants, and pubs. The staff, especially concierge and reception staff are excellent - nothing was too much trouble. Our room was small but worked well and the lounge areas were comfortable and smartly furnished. The bathroom lacked shelf space for toiletries but was otherwise functional.",5,2017,05,19
113,Silver Wedding Anniversary stay ,"Beautiful hotel in a lovely location on London leafy road. Immaculately decorated and furnished with a lovely atmosphere - not too big. 
On checking in we were asked if our stay was for a special occasion and I mentioned it was our Silver Wedding Anniversary. 
We checked into our room, fresh with lovely crisp white bedding and towels and on returning later from shopping we found a note with an ice bucket and champagne with special cakes personalised and congratulating us. A lovely touch! 
Both dinner and breakfast in the hotel were fantastic and to be recommended. 
Reception and concierge very obliging and helpful. 
We will definitely be returning to this hotel. ",5,2017,05,17
113,Great hotel,"We stayed at The Kensington for a long weekend.We felt welcome the moment we entered the hotel..Our room was very clean.,the staff was very polite and friendly.The welcome card inviting us to have a free drink at the bar was a special touch.Especially the bar was exquisite and a retreat after a busy  day.",5,2017,05,17
113,Wonderful service great location.,"This historic hotel provides all the bells and whistles, you don't have a chance of opening the door yourself. Our room was very nice, decent size and a great shower. Internet was strong and the bed actually was good for my back. 

The hotel opened in 1911, but the building must be much much older. The floors throughout offer wild ramps and sags. In our room the table with two chairs was tilted several degrees, which made them a bit uncomfortable. 

The neighborhood was great! A couple of blocks from the tube, walk to Royal Albert Hall and Kensington Palace. Really good restaurants and pubs very close by. 

The only thing keeping the 5th star away is the price. I don't mind paying 350 EU a night for the hotel, but paying 5.5 EU for a half cup of coffee in the lobby seems a bit overpriced. 

All told, we'd go back again for the people and the area.",4,2017,05,16
113,Great location and excellent little hotel!,"The Kensington is the best location! It is a short walk to the tube and has a ton of great restaurants around it! The hotel is clean and comfortable. The rooms are pretty small, but that is to be expected in London. It feels refreshing to come back there after a long day. The breakfast in the morning is a great plus as well!",5,2017,05,16
113,Wonderful Trip to London,"We had such an amazing time in London and staying in South Kensington was perfect for us! It was close to the Underground and we were able to get around to every destination we wanted. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful (especially George, Martyn, and Andre) They even helped get everything figured out with our flight when we were having issues confirming it. We were so happy with our trip and their service! ",5,2017,05,14
113,Beautiful hotel - a must stay!,"Beautiful hotel with lovely people.  Staff is extremely helpful and very welcoming.  Restaurant has delicious food, breakfast and dinner is a must with superb service. Excellent location, easy to get around, and close to train station.  Will definitely book again when visiting London. ",5,2017,05,14
113,Turn off that damn music,"The Kensington has the most friendly and helpful staff I have ever enjoyed. The hotel is very well maintained and immaculate. It has a terrific location with many shops and restaurants nearby. The nearby tube station makes getting around easy. We also used buses on occasion but the traffic was terrible.

Our room was very small with no place to store luggage and a closet which would only hold five or six hangers.

The public spaces, restaurant, and bar are handsome and stately. However, they all feature constant music which would not be out of place in an elevator. Drove me crazy.",4,2017,05,14
113,Superbly quaint,"I am here for business and this is my second night. The staff is exceptional, concierge is great, and the rooms are quaint. The toiletries are high quality and the nespresso is a nice touch!! Very great location, many great restaurants and convenient stores. There is an odd odor in my room, like marijuana almost, but opening the window a bit helped. Highly recommend this hotel! The staff truly are exceptional.",5,2017,05,13
113,Amazing staff and beautiful hotel,"Without a doubt service like this does not happen very often in London hotels. The staff are amazingly attentive. The GM is one of the best I have met worldwide. Restaurant great and the bar has a wonderful relaxed vibe. I'm back here next week for a business stay and wouldn't even bother trawling through the sites for an alternative anymore. Yes, the rooms are on the small side but this is a London townhouse and retaining this adds to the character of the hotel, so ignore the 'moaning' on here. No point in having a huge room elsewhere with mediocre staff! One of London's best!! ",5,2017,05,05
113,exceeded expectation graduation stay,"I came to London for my MBA graduation at Imperial. Chose to stay in The Kensington with my husband. My first time in this hotel and is more than great. I have my birthday and graduation in the same week, the hotel prepared me wine and welcome dessert in the room which surprised me...although I have been too tired to drink lately. Room is very clean, nesspresso machine serves my favourite Vivalto Lungo which i usually have at home. My husband love the gym, it has great variety. I rarely do any sport but still attracted by the gum facilities and enjoyed balance ball (the easiest)! Restaurant also brilliant, we had dinner here once, breakfast once, and tea lounge too. My husband loves the service and quality. 
I particularly wish to thanks the staff George and one other night shift staff who gave us high level of hospitality and arranged us warm milk for coffee in the very early morning everyday. Everything great here, we would stay here again when we visit London again. I had a memorable stay.",5,2017,05,05
113,"Elegant, quiet, refined","We booked The Kensington sight-unseen as part of an air and hotel package, and I figured a 5-star hotel couldn't be that bad. It was definitely not bad! :)  The hotel is inviting, the staff are friendly, and everything feels very luxurious. The one thing we immediately noticed was that in London, five-star means high quality and good service, but not necessarily ""spacious."" The room was smaller than we were used to, although there was enough room to get around and in the bathroom (especially compared to the other hotel we stayed at!). Plus, the lobby is comfortable and spacious, so we spent a lot of our free time there (I had work to do on vacation, alas).

The breakfast was tasty and I appreciated their interesting flavors (try the French toast!). If breakfast isn't included in your room, I don't know if it's worth the ¬£16 just for Continental, but I ordered off the menu. The lobby and breakfast rooms all have different arrangements of furniture for each table (some with chairs, some with couches, etc.) -- it feels luxurious and homey, not at all like a restaurant with dozens of identical tables. The ambiance of the fire places was excellent.

Our room was very comfortable and functional, and the tea service in-room was SO much better than I get in the States (though I would expect nothing less in the UK!). They had both a water pot and a Nespresso so that I didn't have to drink coffee-flavored tea, and the Drury sachets were excellent.

There are plenty of restaurants close by -- it's a short walk to South Kensington station, less than 10 minutes, and plenty of Italian and deli-style on the way, plus more in the area. However, since it's Kensington, even the pubs are ""foodie"" type. No greasy pubs here! Not a bad thing, just know that the pubs will be more expensive. Rocca Italian had great pizza. ",5,2017,05,02
113,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed in London for two nights on our way to Venice. We were not in London to sight see - we visited with friends and spent 48 hours recuperating from jet lag. The hotel was lovely. Very well appointed and the staff very helpful. We had great cocktails in the lobby one night and noticed quite a few business travelers or business people conducting meetings. We did notice a few couples but no families or small children. Our room was small (much like a Manhattan hotel - room for a queen bed a chair and dresser) but it was fine - it's London...how long are you actually in the room! We used Uber to get everywhere - it did seem like a shlep to get to the sights. We arrived by train and walked from the train station - about a 5 minute walk.

Great hotel!",5,2017,05,02
113,Great Hotel!,"Service, Flower Arrangements, Location and Staff all TOP, especially Guido and George where wonderful.

Only small objection in our rooms: no space in the wardrobe for our clothes.

We would choose again this hotel for an other stay.",4,2017,05,01
113,Excellent Accommodations ,"My mom came to visit me for Thanksgiving when I was studying abroad in London, and she was staying at the Kensington. I ended up crashing with her there for a week! Everyone working there was exceptionally friendly, and you really couldn't ask for a better location. When I had classes I could leave my mom in a city she didn't know at all, and she'd take a quick walk to the park, museums, even the tube. Everything was clean and the food was great. We had the afternoon tea once and the breakfast a couple of times. Overall a very cozy and comfortable place with a little London charm. If you have a lot of things with you, I could see the rooms being a little on the smaller side, but for us it wasn't a problem. ",5,2017,05,01
113,"Great for its: location, beautiful design, comfort, accommodation and hospitality","The location is great nearby the museums and the Kensington shopping area, steps away from the tube. The hotel is perfectly done: Modern Classical Design all over public areas and rooms: in spite that our room was very small with a tiny bathroom. 
I must add the friendliness and the attentiveness of all the staff and the delicious and the generous breakfast. Everything was excellent.
Just a suggestion: Not enough lights in the bathroom",4,2017,05,01
113,"A wonderful hotel, location and first class staff who are so friendly",Located only a few 100m from South Kensington Tube station and in the heart of the wonderful area with lovely small shops and places to eat. The museums are so near you could almost touch them and a walk up towards Harrods is a delight. The staff are first class. So friendly it is like coming home to family ( we have been twice now and will return ).,5,2017,04,30
113,"Amazing Service, Location, and Staff!","We just relocated to London and stayed at the Kensington Hotel for a few nights. Having their staff to help us with little things was extremely helpful! The rooms are a bit small but the staff accommodate it by storing it for us and we would just call for when we need to access a bag. The common areas, restaurant, and bar were beautifully decorated to be everything you think of British luxury. Their location was perfect: 6 min walk to tube, restaurants around, and easy to jump in an uber. We had a problem with our original booking and not only did they help us sort it out, they even followed up after we checked out. It was stressful with the move in general so having such a genuinely helpful team of people there to help was priceless. Highly recommend for couples and business travelers!",5,2017,04,30
113,Wonderful Hotel,"My husband and I just spent 9 nights at The Kensington. We had a wonderful time, and would definitely stay here again. The staff were all extremely helpful and knowledgeable, and the hotel itself is beautiful. It is a short walk to the South Kensington tube station. The only problem is that the tube line that runs to that station, is extremely busy during rush hour, so we either had to come back to Kensington early, or wait until later in the evening. ",4,2017,04,29
113,"Somewhat expensive, but worth it","Very nice hotel, great location. Close to underground station at South Kensington, quiet and pleasant neighborhood.
Clean, pleasant, lovely room (we enjoyed a suite). 
Breakfastbuffet was not impressive though. ",5,2017,04,29
113,Perfect place for our Anniversary Trip!,"When I travel to London, I usually like to stay in the Kensington area. Beautiful area, easy access to tube stations, close to museums, Harrod's, the Kensington Palace, etc. The Kensington was the perfect place to stay for our last trip. The hotel itself is very beautifully decorated and the staff are all very friendly and helpful. The concierge assisted us several times. We had tickets booked, cabs waiting for us, seats at the musical reserved. George, in particular, was extremely helpful getting us set up with different places to eat and remembered us by name every time we greeted him! The bar downstairs is a great place to grab a nightcap before heading up to bed. The rooms aren't huge, but we had plenty of space. They turned down our sheets each night, had chilled water waiting for us on our bedside tables, and had a nice laundry service that we used as well! All in all, we had zero complaints and felt right at home here! The restaurant, rooms and common spaces are lovely, and the hotel staff was just a cherry on top! Will definitely stay here again!",5,2017,04,28
113,Classy without being stuffy,I have stayed here several times.  The staff always makes me feel welcome and the hotel itself is beautiful.  Location is great - you can easily run through Hyde park from here.  It is my favorite hotel bar.  Excellent drink selection and a cool old school feel.  The beds are firm and they have Nespresso machines in each room.  Highly recommend.,5,2017,04,27
113,Anniversary Trip,My wife and I came to London for our 1st anniversary! The Kensington was a perfect place to call home while we were visiting London. The hotel is beautiful and the staff very friendly and accommodating. George always greeted us with a smile and a warm welcome and made sure we had everything we needed while we were here. The location of the hotel is very convenient to get to the museums as well as it is only a 5 minute walk to the South Kensington tube stop. Would highly recommend this hotel. ,5,2017,04,27
113,AWonderful Experience,"We had a delightful stay. The location is great. Our room was very comfortable, the ambiance was fantastic, meals and drinks were great,  We found the staff were all very professional. The Concierge was incredibly helpful, in fact the entire staff went out of their way to make certain our experience was perfect (Gvido especially made us feel welcome).",5,2017,04,27
113,Lovely Hotel,If you are looking for spacious rooms this is not the place for you ... If you are looking for great staff and comfortable and charming lobby and bar this is the place. We spent many meetings having tea or a glass of wine. I would HIGHLY recommend The Kensington. ,4,2017,04,26
113,One night of luxury,"I travelled over with a friend to watch our friend run the london marathon.  We got an early flight on Saturday morning so we arrived the hotel not long after 10:30am.  Not expecting our room to be anywhere near ready.  Alas! it was! The checkin staff then brought us out hotel towels to freshen up, then we were shown to our room.  It was just perfect.  We went to a show and came back to the room being turned down for us.  It really was a great stay!  so close to south kensington tube station.

Definitely recommend",5,2017,04,25

Perfect London feeling. Thank you!",5,2017,04,25
113,Terrific location for touring Central London,"Great location and lovely accommodations.   Staff friendly. George took great care of us at checkout. We appreciated the small touches:  Nespresso, bottled water and slippers. Well worth it for the breakfast where the food is delicious and the setting is both bright and cheerful or warm and cozy depending on where you are seated. Easy access to South Kensington station. Several good restaurants and food shops nearby. An easy walk to the Victoria and Albert Museum, which is not to be missed. The bar at the hotel has some great cocktails to choose from; try the Regency Rickey. The Creme Br√ªl√©e martini makes an excellent dessert nightcap. 

The bathrooms are tiny but laid out for efficiency. We had standard rooms and you might have trouble negotiating tight quarters. 

We found the rooms to be quiet and comfortable. Staff is helpful but not intrusive. We felt like we got good value at The Kensington. Enjoy your visit!",5,2017,04,24
113,Euro Trip,"Hotel was wonderful! Staff was extra friendly. Great area around the hotel as well ! Many food options and easy access to the tube! Basically everything is nearby and if not, it's about 20 minutes on the tube. Definitely would recommend.",5,2017,04,21

113,Spring break in London,"We landed at The Kensington when our Airbnb had a problem which precluded our stay. Our host arranged for us to come here and we could not have been more delighted by our entire experience. Rooms are well appointed and very comfortable, public spaces are gorgeous and perfect for gathering and raising a glass with friends. All the staff are friendly and helpful. George and Martyn, in particular looked after us to make sure we were absolutely delighted. We could not have been more pleased and will plan to return for sure!",5,2017,04,20
113,An amazing little piece of London ,"The Kensington came highly recommended by someone who stayed there many years ago, with a very affordable room rate and the hotel centrally located it was an easy decision to book this hotel.

Upon arrival we were greeted by friendly staff who catered to our every request and continued the excellent service for the duration of our stay. The rooms were quite small but very comfortable as expected from a boutique hotel. The decor throughout the hotel oozed old English sophistication.

As mentioned before the hotel is quite centrally located with two underground stations situated within walking distance as well as the famous museum mile and Harrods.

I would definitely stay at The Kensington on my next visit to London, but I would advise to book early as the hotel seems to get fully booked quickly.",5,2017,04,19
113,London Visit,"Greeted with a smile and hot hand towel.  Friendly staff all around.  Bar was good with drinks prices comparable to other places.
Room was comfortable with all amenities needed.

Recommend to others!",5,2017,04,19
113,The Heart of where we needed to be,I was lucky to stay at The Kensington for 4 days on a business trip The staff starting with the delightful concierge dressed in top hat at the door were so friendly and welcoming and also extremely helpful. My room was spotless and heaters on ready for my arrival so very warm and cosy with the most comfortable bed and a spectacular bathroom with full size bathtub and bathroom essentials that were top self .The location is within easy walking distance to the tube with plenty of eateries on the way. Not that I had time but also within walking distance to V and A museums etc. Taxis easily hailed off the street with the help of the friendly concierge.Totally recommend you check in for a stay during your visit to Central London.,5,2017,04,17
113,My London Home! ,"I have stayed at The Kensington previously and this has seriously become my London home for both work and personal trips.  The property is beautiful, well located and the staff very friendly and attentive.  On this and previous trips, George has gone above and beyond! He's become a very good friend keeping me up to date in places to see, new cocktail lit he's to check out and is really just an absolute delight! I had an event which I needed white gloves for and he was able to arrange, even on his day off!!!  Can't wait to return again to The Kensington. ",5,2017,04,16
113,Great visit!,Had a wonderful stay at the Kensington.  Hotel was beautiful although room was a bit small. Shout out to all of the wonderful staff but George in particular. His happy demeanor and pleasant smile were a welcome site after a long day of site seeing.  ,4,2017,04,16
113,"Friendly staff, cheery large cockroach in bar","Good location for Royal Albert Hall, quiet streets despite being in the capital. Bedroom was ok, but small compared to others that I have stayed in recently; very small bathroom, but you are in Central London. Breakfast was nicely presented and served, very friendly service from the staff. Nice bar area, unfortunately this was offset by the large cockroach trundling across the floor from the bar to the dining room.",3,2017,04,16
113,Easter trip in London ,"We had a lovely experience at The Kensington. The location in South Kensington is amazing, close to the tube station and very charming shops and restaurants. The staff made the stay even better - George always greeted us with a friendly smile, a willingness to help however needed and we shared some good laughs! Martins and his brother were always quick meet us at the door, keep us comfortable if sitting out on the porch and make sure we knew where we were going before leaving the hotel. Overall, these members of staff took an interest in our lives and our activities while in London, which made the experience all the more personal and enjoyable. We had a fantastic Easter in London thanks to our great stay and attentive staff at the Kensington! Will definitely be back soon. ",5,2017,04,16
113,Special Vacation at The Kensington,"We went on an unplanned, last minute trip to London and after reading reviews of the hotel and our first grandchild, born the week prior was named Kensington we decided on this very special hotel. We made the right decision as the staff was amazing, location fabulous, and we were given an upgraded suite when we mentioned it was our anniversary! 
George could not have been more helpful!

But a special moment was when we were telling our breakfast hostess, Carolina, that our first grandchild, Kensington was born the week prior and after sharing pictures, she took the time to get us a Kensington Hotel Teddy Bear to bring home to our grandchild!

Thank you Carolina, she loves it!

Fondly, Stan and Amy Dumoch ",5,2017,04,12
113,Nice hotel with a super staff,"The Kensington Hotel is a very nice hotel conveniently located with very nice restaurants and nubs nearby. The rooms are on the small side as are the bathrooms. What makes this hotel is the staff. Everyone we dealt with was pleasant and helpful. Michael, Guido, Robert and Laura were especially helpful.",5,2017,04,12
113,A Wonderful Weekend in London,"My mother, grandmother and I stayed in The Kensington during a weekend break to London to celebrate my grandmother's 70th birthday. The hotel itself is beautifully decorated and in a great location. We love the Kensington/Knightsbridge area of London and so the location suited us very well. It is a tube ride away from the more touristy areas but it's quite nice to stay outside of the madness. We enjoyed drinks in the lounge/bar area of the hotel every evening before and after dinner. The bar was a pleasure to sit in, it was very inviting and comfortable. The drinks menu was also very reasonable compared to most hotel bars in London. The staff in the hotel in general were diligent and friendly. George was always available to help us when we needed it and was polite and chatty. The only downside to the hotel was the size of our room, it was quite small and cramped and a bit dark. This was not a major issue however, as we did not spend much time in the room itself. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a city break in London.",4,2017,04,12
113,Amazing stay!,"My wife and I visited London to celebrate my 30th birthday and I'm glad she picked The Kensington. We took a red eye in and arrived to London around 9:30 am on April 6th. We made it to the hotel by 11:30am and we were greeted by Oana. She was very welcoming and checked us in right away. They even gave us a delicious fruit juice and hot towel during check in. Oana was able to get us checked in early so we could go up and relax a bit before heading off to explore the city. Thank God for this because we were exhausted!

Everyone at this hotel was extremely friendly and welcoming. Special thanks to those who helped us during our stay: Oana (front desk), Michael (concierge), Martin (waiter-restaurant), and George Okoko. George brought up a few things to our room that we were in need of and helped recommend some great places to eat. Very friendly guy. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Kensington to anyone. This hotel is very clean, quiet, safe, and everyone on staff was always friendly and always willing to help. ",5,2017,04,09
113,London Trip 2017,"Great hotel, location and service! Comfortable rooms and easy access to all the sites and activities of London. George, the concierge, was incredibly helpful and was the perfect person to welcome us to London. We look forward to coming back again soon!",5,2017,04,09
113,Great Stay!,I arrived at The Kensington after a long day of flight delays and a lost bag from the west coast of the US. The hotel staff was very accommodating upon my arrival and got me a room right away so I could freshen up. They were more than helpful in getting me what I needed due to my lost luggage. The room was wonderful as well and had great views of the city. I had a great nights sleep after a busy day of touring around. I would certainly stay here again. The service is top which certainly adds to the experience.,5,2017,04,09
113,Excellent stay!,My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Kensington. Our room was beautiful and spacious. The staff was superb! George went out of his way to help make our stay extraordinary! We will definitely return.,5,2017,04,09

113,Short stay in London,"We spent 2 nights in the Kensington. Being new to London we found the Concierge service extremely good. Staff clearly went out of their way to be helpful, friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Highly recommend ",5,2017,04,05
113,Loved our stay and the staff,"We really enjoyed The Kensington. The staff was all very professional, polite, and friendly. The concierge, Martin, was a great help to us. We needed to exchange a pair of Premier League tickets from a Sunday game to a Saturday game, and he arranged it all for us.  And, the assistant concierge/greeter George was super friendly and fun. As for the room, it was a bit small - but you're in London, so to be expected. It was absolutely clean and high quality, with an awesome shower. The Kensignton neighborhood is very nice, with two tube stops a very easy 5 min walk away. You can get anywhere in London within a half hour via the tube.  It was a great stay and we'd definitely recommend The Kensington for anyone looking for a boutique, quiet, friendly, and ""lovely"" place to stay in London.",5,2017,04,03
113,A hotel Fit for a King,"When you enter, you have a sense of the grandness and the splendour of the hotel at first sight, as for the amenities themselves, my deluxe room faced Queensgate and it was excellent. It's not huge, but the bed is very comfortable, I really enjoyed the curvature of the main room as well...it is a very unique design that gives the room a slightly cosier feel without the sharp edges. The bathroom has both a shower and a bathtub, and the rails on which the towels hang are quite a nice touch. 
The amenities are comfortable in the room, and the options in the hotel itself are excellent; both the K bar and townhouse are top-notch in their own right, I will definitely ensure that I have an opportunity to enjoy beauty and the beast  tea next time round, The old-school English elegance, combined with what one would expect of a modern hotel - solid Internet access, excellent in-room amenities and a workout room are all well-appointed are all well-executed, There may not be a better spot to be situated out of while you are in town. Hotels all around the world need to come to this place to learn about excellent customer service. Special Mentions to Martyn, Martins (Doorman), George and Sandor‚Ä¶ Holy moly, they went the extra mile with excellence!",5,2017,04,02
113,Couldn't Love It More,"What an incredibly special hotel. Truly a home away from home. Beautiful and elegant,  cozy and welcoming and relaxing all at the same time. Fantastic food ~ we didn't even feel like experimenting with all the great London restaurants ~ just wanted to come ""home"" to The Kensington for late dinner and cozy time together in the lovely restaurant and lounge spaces. Beautiful, elegant, cozy, clean room, lovely bathroom ~ pretty neighborhood views. Perfect location for exploring the city, easy to get everywhere. Incredible staff really make you feel welcome and cared for.....and manage a perfect balance of noticing and helping with everything that you need, friendly and fun, but never being over bearing in any way at all. Just truly incredible and we ended up hating to say good bye to them and this beautiful hotel when we had to leave.",5,2017,03,31
113,Kensington Hotel- Great Hotel!,"We stayed at the Kensington Hotel and had an amazing experience! Friendly staff, very clean rooms/bathrooms (I'm typically a stickler on this), and exceptional service! The concierge, George, was charismatic and always met us with a smile. He was also more than helpful with restaurant recommendations and tourist help!George made our experience that much more personal and we truly enjoyed our chats with him! 

We visited the hotel specifically for the Beauty & the Beast afternoon tea- which did not disappoint!  It was magical and made us feel like kids again. What charm! Not to mention, we had chocolate covered strawberries and champagne in our room for my birthday as well! 

I would highly recommend this hotel! They are a class act and it's beautifully decorated!",5,2017,03,31
113,Great location but terrible service!,"Never experienced such a bad check-out service in my whole life! Had rung the Front Desk for a late check-out, which they have granted.  But way before the check-out time, one of their staff rang to ask if we were leaving and then, their housekeeper came into my room and offered luggage assistance, which simply hint that it was time to go.  It was not even time yet!  And when we got down to the Front Desk, my bill (with my personal details) was already on the desk!!! Obviously, really wanted us to go huh??!!!  What kind of service is this?",2,2017,03,31
113,London Holiday,"The hotel was very nice and we met a nice man named George! He was so kind and helpful. Very nice experience, loved the morning buffet and the gym was nice. The room had a lovely bathroom with a great tub and a nice shower. ",5,2017,03,30
113,Proper boutique experience,"Unfortunately I only stayed for one night, but it was long enough to determine that this is a proper boutique hotel. Small, cozy and very classy. Admittedly my room was tiny (you had to squeeze sideways between the end of the bed and the wardrobe), but it was extremely well appointed. The bar area is lovely, and the attention to detail throughout the property is of high standard. If you are going to be based in West London, this is a great choice.",5,2017,03,30
113,Always excellent!,"A long overdue review of the lovely Kensington Hotel. I stay here frequently when in London and have never been disappointed. The staff are fabulous. The day manager Andrei in particular is always very accommodating. The rooms are always clean, tidy and very comfortable. They have lovely bath products. The location is excellent. 
After living in London for years I can say this is a top quality place at fair price for London standards. Look forward to staying there again this week!",5,2017,03,29
113,A place to call home away from home,"My husband and myself came to London a few weeks ago to see a few things before heading to Paris, Rome and Prague for the rest of our trip. It was our first time in this area of London and also at this hotel and we were left with one of the best memories of our trip.
The hotel is well located in the heart of kensington, there are lovely shops and restaurants on the side and a few minutes walk too, going to caffe nero and and vini italiani wine shop. we had lovely view by queensgate street and the room was very well designed from the mirror to tiled bathroom. 
We loved sitting in lounging area and read newspapers provided by the hotel, or just relax at the cocktail bar, James is an excellent bartender and looked after us very well. The service was fantastic with smiles and professionalism all round, special mentions to George - a charismatic staff and others who looked after us. 
We will be staying here again next year as we had a pleasant and enjoyable stay.",5,2017,03,28
113,"Quaint hotel, close to gardens and the tube","I only stayed for one night but I loved this hotel from the moment I walked in.

113,Second visit just as nice and worth every cent!,"Just returned from a four night (second visit) to The Kensington.  We loved our first stay there in 2011 and since the TA reviews were just as strong in 2017, I booked this latest trip without hesitation. 

I do a lot of research for trips to Europe. I do not want to fly 4,000 miles from Chicago to stay at a hotel that could be in any big city in the world. I want a ""pinch me, I am in London vibe."" The Kensington has that British, cozy feel - several small fireplace sitting areas, fresh flowers, beautiful town home. Fulll English breakfast, perfect location in South Kensington.

In addition to the immaculate property, large - very quiet - room and wonderful food, we experienced stellar service from booking room (Anna P. in reservations), to the concierge service (Martyn, you are a gem!) to the wait staff at the hotel breakfast (Sandor).  What a great trip - thank you Kensington!",5,2017,03,28
113,Loved the place from the moment we walked in,"From the first moment we came inside the hotel the staff was super close with us, very helpful and friendly. The floor is just like the photos, a very cozy place with a very modern decoration. The area is well connected, about 5 minutes from metro stops, a charming place where you can feel a Londoner more. An experience that if we had stayed in other areas we would not have lived to enjoy. The Hyde park garden, the royal Albert hall, the natural history museum are one of the best things to enjoy in this venue. we truly enjoyed the outdoor area reserved on the queens gate side, There was a terrace which was lovely and elegantly decorated with spring pinkish flowery wall as well as a bed of lilies on the bottom. we loved sitting in this area and enjoy seeing the locals going about their business. 
The hotel currently serves a beauty and the beast themed afternoon tea which was very delicious and an experience never to be forgotten from the clock tower to the ice cream cone. 
We were amazed how they over delivered on the service especially Martyn,Vincent and George at the Concierge's department, they gave us excellent tips and advice. we highly recommend this charming hotel.",5,2017,03,27
113,The most wonderful staff of any hotel we've been to in ages!,"Great location. Pleasant room with lots of light.  Helpful and cheerful staff. Great restaurant, ask for Sandor . He's the king of all waiters. Intelligent, most capable and cheerful.  Food is good too.",5,2017,03,27
113,Great Hotel!,"I spent two nights at The Kensington, it is very well located to go to the Natural/Historic museum.

113,Wonderful place in South Ken,"The Kensington as a perfect location, just a few minutes away from South Kensington station and then 20 mn from St Pancras Station.
We really appreciate the atmosphere, British style in the cosy way but also design.
The breakfast is wonderful and the service very friendly. The bar is also very nice at night. ",5,2017,03,23
113,Ms,"This place is amazing !!! Awesome location, fantastic service.. Feels like home not a hotel. There is a tube near by and some excellent diverse food selections. Walking distance to many awesome sites. Make sure you indulge in morning tea.. England culture that we are going to miss ..George is the face of The  Kensington.. His bright smile and helpful attitude is fantastically charming. We will be back and this is the place to stay !! ",5,2017,03,21
113,"Location, Location, Staff","My review of this hotel will be excellent.  I will start with information for the first time traveler to London.  This hotel is located in the best of neighborhoods.  You step out the front door turn left another quick left and you will have a grocery store, a bank, an exchange bureau, an abundance of restaurants and shortly down the road access to South Kensington tube station.  Take a right, the Museum of Natural History, Victoria and Albert Museum, and shortly down the road Kensington Palace.  This is an ideal location for the first time traveler.  For the repeat traveler to London, this hotel is exceptional in service.  I read many reviews before I decided to stay here and most revolved around the hotel needing to be updated.  I really don't understand that.  It is picturesque.  The furniture completely fitting to the atmosphere and let's add a fire to the fireplace in every room for effect.  The authenticity is so great that many locals have tea and casual meetings in one of the two adjacent rooms to the lobby and the bar.  The staff is exceptional.  I don't have to name them because they are all exceptional.  I have rated this hotel with five stars, not because it is the most extravagant hotel in London, but because it is the most realistic.  ",5,2017,03,20
113,lovely public areas,"this is a good hotel.  Lovely area, very well and tastefully furnished public areas, with comfortable airy lounges and bar, but the room we were in was very small, with an even smaller bathroom.  the shower screen didn't fit properly, and we managed to flood the floor (my bug bear with hotels) and the bath was cumbersome enough to get out of without having a wet floor.
The staff were attentive and helpful, and its in a very central location.",4,2017,03,20
113,"Great locally, friendly staff and high standard","South Kensington was a nice suprise - a local feeling, but still very central all everything. The hotel is stylishly re-furbished.  The rooms small but very comfortable. Receptions staff very friendly and helpful.
We did get a bit put off when we came down for breakfast and there was no tables available, we resorted to go own to one of the many good options the streets around. Overall - a bit anonymous but friendly and nice hotel estay.",4,2017,03,19
113,Charming,"I found everything about the property charming: the hotel, restaurant, neighborhood and staff.  I spent 5 days and 4 nights at The Kensington.  Let me first say that you won't find a better neighborhood.  The tube station is a short, five minute walk from the hotel.  Several museums and restaurants are within walking distance of the hotel.  I had  breakfast at Town House, the hotel's restaurant, on three occasions and found it delicious.  The hotel's common areas are wonderfully posh.  

My deluxe room (209) was spacious with lots of storage.  The room had outlets from all continents.  If you didn't have an adaptor, it was no problem.  It was awesome to relax under the rainfall shower head after a long day of sightseeing.  The staff is what makes The Kensington extremely special.  From the front desk associates, bellman, valet, concierge and wait staff, they went above and beyond during my entire stay.  On the day that I checked out, I accidentally left behind one of my bags without realizing it.  While in route to the airport, the concierge phoned me.  Luckily, we were only a few minutes away and my driver was able to quickly return to the hotel.  I am so grateful to the concierge for his quick thinking.  I will most certainly return to The Kensington!",5,2017,03,19
113,"Great staff, great location, lovely hotel","We have stayed at the Kensington several times over several years, and we return because the staff is genuinely friendly and helpful, the rooms quite comfortable, and the location very convenient for all the places we want to get to when we visit London.   On this most recent trip we arrived Sunday afternoon a little after 1 pm and had to wait until almost 3 pm to get a room -- apparently the hotel was full, and with lots of weekenders who did not have early planes to catch and were in no hurry to head home.   The hotel front desk staff did seem to try to make up for the wait by giving us a very nice room for the category we'd booked, and we had no complaints the rest of the stay.   With three underground lines available a few blocks away at the South Kensington underground station, the Kensington is convenient to the theatres, museums, major sites, the South Bank.   One can walk to the V&A, the Museum of Natural History, Hyde Park, the Serpentine Gallery, and the Princess Diana memorial fountain.   There are a lot of nice bakeries, shops and restaurants right in the area.   If lots of walking or stairs are an issue, though, this may not be the best choice, because the tube station is not step-free (and so while coming in on the Piccadilly line from Heathrow might seem like a great idea, it only works if you can carry your luggage up and down stairs).
But if you like to walk to explore a city, stairs aren't an issue, and you want a bit of luxury that's not at 5-star prices, the Kensington is lovely base for a London visit.   We've never tried their afternoon tea, but it seems popular.   The Bar is very comfortable.  But it's the friendliness of the staff that make the hotel so welcoming and relaxing.",5,2017,03,17
113,Staff is best,"Hotel staff is best and they treat you appreciate as customer.
Food is also good and with good verity and even can be customized.
Rooms are pretty clean and as per details mentioned on package.
My visit will be on same hotel if got another chance to visit.",4,2017,03,17
113,"Good hotel, good location, small rooms","The Kensington is a good place to stay, its location is good, the hotel is close to many cafes and restaurants, the staff is great, but i think the rooms could be improved, sleep quality is not bad but it's just average, not great, bedside tables are almost useless, it's impossible to place a book and your mobile at the same time, and the throw placed at the bed was stained as you can see in the picture i uploaded. Building is very classic and the bar area is great to sit and have a drink or an informal meeting.",4,2017,03,15
113,Excellent hotel in Queen's Gate/Kensington area,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Kensington. The staff were excellent and the rooms were new and lovely. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was surprisingly spacious. This hotel was conveniently located near the tube, museums, and lots of restaurants and cafes.",5,2017,03,15
113,Posh and quiet-would highly recommend,"We stayed here for part of our first anniversary trip. They had chocolates waiting for us in the room as a little gift, which was a very sweet touch. Bathroom was beautiful marble and our room was spacious. Perfect location--very close to two different metro stations, and in walking distance from most things depending on how far you will walk. Check-in was super easy. We went to Scotland for two days during our trip, and not wanting to take our huge luggage, the hotel agreed to hold our big bags until we got back even though we had already checked out-making it easy to take little duffel bags for our quick trip. 

There was a great little bar downstairs, and they also gave us a complimentary cocktail for our anniversary, too. 

Would highly recommend.",5,2017,03,15
113,Kind Service,Very pleasant stay for business porpuses . Very good location and premises. Outstanding breakfast in a charming room. Extraordinary service and kindness. Special mention to Marresa: outstanding attention.,5,2017,03,13
113,"Brilliant hotel, impeccable service","A quiet, cozy, comfortable hotel in London's best neighborhood. Afternoon tea is simply brilliant, the hotel's own dining facilities and common areas are top-notch and very boutique in nature. Rooms, while a normal London-smallish, are rather comfortable and not-too-cramped. Sleeping was whisper quiet and cozy, we could adjust the room temperature ideally. Location was perfect to where we wanted to be in London's West End, a short ride to Harrod's and shopping, and mere walking distance to the South Kensington Underground. Staff was attentive and saw to every detail. What a wonderful boutique hotel, and we're already looking forward to our next stay when in London!",5,2017,03,09
113,Fine stay,"If you're looking for a quiet, comfortable and convenient place to stay while you travel in London, this place it is! Staff here are the loveliest, the hotel was beautiful, newly furnished, and super clean! The staff  made our stay very enjoyable especially Martyn and George The bed is definitely a highlight (so comfortable after a long day out). We wished that we were able to stay longer but we will definitely book here again when we come back!",5,2017,03,06
113,Pleasant stay in London,"I spent five nights at the Kensington Hotel while visiting colleges with my daughter. I booked the reservation as part of a flight/hotel package so I'm not sure what I paid for the hotel, but the package deal was very reasonable.

The hotel was well appointed, clean and quiet. Our room was ready when we arrived straight from the airport at 9am, which was very convenient, rather than having to wait for the afternoon check-in time. Hotel staff were very professional, welcoming and helpful. We did not use the food services, bar or exercise facilities and so can not comment on those.

The hotel is conveniently near the South Kensington and Gloucester road tube stops, so getting around London was very easy. There are a good variety of food options within a short walk.

In every way, our experience at the Kensington was great!",5,2017,03,06
113,Beautiful Christmas Stay,"The Kensington is such a gorgeous hotel & situation in a superb location (around 15 minute walk from the shops in Knightsbridge, or only 2 stops away using the Kensington tube).

The decor of the hotel is perfect - a beautiful balance of modern & traditional to give a gorgeous sophisticated feel. The staff immediate greet you & do anything they can to make your stay more enjoyable. The hotel lobby is lively with a lovely bar & open lounge boasting a gorgeous lit fire to enjoy coffee or afternoon tea. 

The room itself was tiny!!! But everything else in the hotel makes up for it - plus, when visited London you don't tend to spend a lot of time in the room anyway. 

Would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone visiting London.",5,2017,03,06
113,Classy and centrally located ,We stayed here for 10 days and were very happy with our stay. The hotel is very classy and the service is excellent. The Kensington Tube station is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel. There are several pubs in the area to visit and the neighborhood is very elegant. ,5,2017,03,05
113,Great Staff and great hotel,"It had been our first time in London City and the concierge Martyn helped us immensely! The room was great and it was a quiet neighborhood. The neighborhood was very clean with charming townhouses lined up and down the streets, we never had any trouble and it was right across the street from Hyde park! We were provided with lots of amenities, toiletries and maps. The room was lovely and the bed was so comfortable. We bonded with Staff members over the love of musical theatre,restaurants and London life and enjoyed catching up with everyone after a long day out. We dined at the townhouse restaurant and enjoyed the unique chandeliers and soothing music in the lounging area. The hotel is located with nearby shops/late night snacks and waitrose supermarket is a stone throw away. Thanks so much everyone for a hospitable and memorable stay, also special mention to Segolene,George and Sandor.",5,2017,03,04
113,"Fabulous Hotel, amazing staff !!!","Stayed one night with my friend and had such a lovely experience. The staff were polite, the studio suite was clean, luxurious and just beautiful. We had some drinks at the bar and an amazing dinner.
The location suited us perfectly, as we needed to be in central London the next morning.
Highly recommend this gorgeous hotel, extremely good service.

Best,
A.",5,2017,03,02
113,Very good!!!,The first thing I want to mention for this hotel is the service.  JUST PERFECT.  The people are ready to help you at any time with smile.  The rooms are good (only bathroom is a little small) and very clean.  The location of the hotel is very good and close to shops and restaurants.  For sure a good choice in London,5,2017,03,02
113,London Charmer,"This is a charming and stylish hotel in a beautiful part of London. The decor is stunning and rooms are beautifully appointed. Some are super tiny (to be expected in London) so worth spending a little extra for some space. The dining room is stunning and the breakfast offering is one of the best I've seen. One of the few places that manages to cover breakfast, lunch and dinner smartly. The bar is a great place to meet friends for cocktails too, meaning that you don't actually have to leave the hotel! Although if you do the underground is short walk and there are some cute restaurants close by. A delight. ",5,2017,03,01
113,Excellent South Kensington Location,"The Kensington Hotel is a very good hotel located a short 5 minute walk from South Kensington station.  A reasonably healthy person could walk in good weather to Gloucester Rd (Da Maria!), Knightsbridge (Harrods!), Belgravia (Boisdale!), and Museums.  But one stop on the tube or 5 minutes in a taxi could also cut the walking.  

Rooms are small as you would expect with most London properties.  But the public areas are spacious. well decorated and inviting.  Very comfy sitting area outside both the bar and the restaurant and good amount of seating within.

But the real attraction here is the staff.  They're everywhere!  And well trained.  Everyone we encountered was happy, friendly, competent and ready to help.  What more could you ask!

If you enjoy adult beverages please take time to sit at the lobby bar and watch as an old fashioned or sazerac is prepared.   You'll see how it's supposed to be done.  Delicious!

And don't miss the avocado toast from the ala carte breakfast menu in the restaurant.  Fabulous!",5,2017,02,28
113,"Fabulous hotel, but lounge can't handle large groups","We had a fabulous girls trip.  The hotel was kind enough to let me do an early check in.  Great view and location.  Concierge's were lovely.  Carpet was very old and stained, but bed was awesome.  Had an issue as bar could not handle a large group for cocktails and had no back up so the waitress encouraged us to order beer or wine as it was faster.  Told us she was very busy.  I'm the customer. Do not care for someone to make things easier in themselves.  Need backup for the bar.",4,2017,02,28
113,Great Boutique Hotel at the Heart of London,"I have recently stayed in this wonderful Hotel . From the moment of arrival all the staff put a smile making you feel so welcome and at home . The service is discreet and efficient at the same time .Great bath room amenities in generous size. A mention to the Town House  Restaurant , very cozy atmosphere and wonderful food . The breakfast as well is a delighful experience as the selection is very curated  and you have the little extras for a really complete and healthy breakfast. The atmosphere at the Bar is also nice , it has a modern twist being a nice place to have a drink. The Hotel is perfect for business women travelling alone , as the ambiance is so serene, discreet that you do not feel observed, just the opposite a warm smile and welcome everywhere . The location is fantastic either for business or pleasure . My thanks to the reception staff as well , coming back tired from a business journey and have an smile makes you happy and appreciated . ",5,2017,02,27
113,Excellant and Lux Hotel,Absolutely a gem of a hotel and experience. From the moment you pop out of your cab you are greeted with a smile and genuine feel as you are whisked to the front desk for a speedy and friendly check in. Rooms are gorgeous as well as the hotel lobby with outstanding service and attention to detail. Location is great!! ,5,2017,02,27
113,My best hotel in London,"It's a great experience in this hotel. I can't imagine visiting London without staying at the Kensington Hotel. The room, the services, the incredible bar and cocktails, the delicious breakfast in the incredible decor, the one and only Doorman Martins, make my journey always unique. Thank you.",5,2017,02,25
113,So very English,"This was our first trip to London in 36 years so i wanted a hotel to meet certain criteria, one being its sense of place.
This georgious property was just perfect, it has great character, friendly and well trained staff, lovely rooms and its position unbeatable for our needs. Cant wait to return and now that our daughter lives in London it should be a lot more often!",4,2017,02,24
113,Wonderful hotel in a perfect area!,"This hotel has everything you need around it- access to a train station, museums, shopping and food. The hotel staff was wonderful on our stay and the room was fantastic. The only downside is our tv remote didn't work, but that's about it!",5,2017,02,22
113,"Small, quaint, with best staff anywhere!","Stayed last week for a brief abbreviated vacation in London and this hotel was one of the highlights among many in this trip. The staff is the best of any hotel I've been to including many 4 and 5 star properties.  Location is great in the heart of Kensington.Like many London hotels, the room itself wasn't big and the bathroom was even smaller but the amenities were all very modern and the overall stay was great.  Also, having arrived after a six hour flight, early access to the room in the morning plus a nice steaming hot shower with great water pressure was just what was needed.  Didn't get a chance to eat at the restaurant nor go to the gym there but the hotel was great.  The Natural History Museum as well as the Victoria and Albert Museums are nearby.  Many restaurant options within a couple of blocks.  One odd thing was this unidentified aroma (food?) in the second floor hallways always greeted me upon exiting the elevator.  Nothing major but preferred if it wasn't.",5,2017,02,22
113,Perfect atternoon tea,"My daughter and I recently visited the Kensington Hotel for the tale as old as time afternoon tea. Beautiful setting, attentive staff ,delicious food. One of the very best afternoon teas I have experienced. The staff were friendly and helpful and nothing was to much trouble. The theme was perfect and the food amazing. I had the vegetarian option which was superb.Excellent value for money.  A fantastic day out.",5,2017,02,21
113,Amazing staff who cannot do enough for you,"Usually stay at The Marylebone but as they were full chose the Kensington and delighted I did. The moment I arrived the staff and service was of a high standard, checked in by Dan and made very welcome and special, Vincent Head of Concierge Vincent was brilliant in helping me as were his staff George and Vjdeo. I will definitely return.",5,2017,02,20
113,Excellent service!,"This was my 5th visit in London but The Kensington is the first hotel that really kept their promises. Nice location, clean rooms, comfortable beds and ecxellent service! Room was a bit small for two ladies with big luggage but we managed üòÄ (Well, room is never big enough) ",4,2017,02,18
113,Decent hotel for short business trip,"Stay here regularly for business when in London. No major faults. Staff helpful and bar is nice if a little expensive.

Only minor niggles are that there is no iron in the room and avoid the 5th floor where the rooms are tiny.

Overall not a bad place to stay and in a good location ",4,2017,02,18
113,Lovely Hotel with Friendliest Staff,"We had a wonderful 40th Anniversary London vacation staying at The Kensington. From the beginning, we had a warm and welcoming check in with Lillian at the front desk. Lillian immediately acknowledged our anniversary and provided us with a refreshing beverage and warm towelettes.
The concierge staff was most helpful with providing us directions. dinner reservations and theater tickets.
Thank you for a great stay!",5,2017,02,15
113,Beauty and the beast afternoon tea,"Fantastic time,  it was perfect. The staff were so welcoming. Nothing was too much trouble from the lovely manager to Barbara who served our table.  Fabulous. Will definitely be returning. Lovely atmosphere.",5,2017,02,15
113,Relaxing stay with great staff,"As with most London hotels the rooms can be on the small size but the standard of them makes up for it. 

The staff here really make the hotel. Very friendly and helpful. The bar is a great place to start an evening. 

We'd love to return on our next visit to London.",5,2017,02,15
113,Elegant Refinement,"We'd booked the Kensington for one night for a Christmas party, but due to work we couldn't go (ironically).  The Kensington were wonderful and let us move this to January.
When we arrived were greeted with a bottle of water and hot towel, the bedroom was stylish and very comfortable with large beds.
We had dinner in the The Town House: courteous service, comfy seats and a very relaxed atmosphere made the exquisite food taste even better!
We retired to the bar where service was quietly attentive, friendly and a chilled way to finish a great evening.
The Kensington is British hospitality at its best - quite, refined, welcoming and luxurious.
Thank you for a great stay!",5,2017,02,15
113,Beauty and the Beast afternoon tea,"The staff were fantastic; so polite and accommodating. From George at the front door to Richard serving us...it was a fantastic day made even better by the staff. A lovely hotel and great staff...who were all amazing, you are all a credit to The Kensington Hotel. Thank you all for everything.",5,2017,02,13
113,Always our pleasure to stay here,"This hotel continues to impress me. It's been 4 years since our last stay and while the hotel has grown to take over a large portion of the street (Queens Gate) behind it, the service is still excellent. We were kindly upgraded upon check-in, given hot towels and refreshments from the juice bar. We were on a tight schedule to make a reservation and the staff was incredibly helpful. We ended up on the 3rd floor facing Queen's Gate, it was quiet and while the room was small, it was comfortable. The bathroom was a bit too tight, my only complaint. The door to the shower wouldn't open all the way because it hit the toilet making the person wishing to shower to turn sideways and squeeze through the opening. It would not accommodate a heavier person. We did end up taking afternoon tea at the Kensington this stay as well and we were both very impressed with the tea service. The tube stations are quite near and it is easy to catch a cab or Uber at this location. Ultimately, I see us staying here again and again as long as the service remains and the quality of rooms.",5,2017,02,13
113,Gem in the heart of the city,The Kensington is my favorite hotel in London. The charm of a town home converted into a hotel.  I recommend afternoon tea in the living room. It's a must or try their fresh squeezed juice options. A must stay on your next trip to London. ,5,2017,02,12
113,Just fabulous,"We stayed here just a few days ago and we were happy with the facilities and the service hence our first review on this property. The staff were all amazing with special mentions to Vincenzo, Elisa and Edel at the front entrance who were pleasant at all times, also the neighbourhood was very safe and we felt a good value for our money. I can't wait to come in the near future.",5,2017,02,12
113,Another great stay at our favorite London hotel,"I‚Äôm writing this review well after our second stay at the hotel but that should in no way imply anything negative because The Kensington is quickly becoming the only hotel we stay at in London.

Our first stay at the Kensington was for 8 nights in September, 2011. This time around we stayed four nights in April, 2016 and had another fantastic visit.

The lobby is really nice and a great place to hang around and relax. Front desk personnel and doormen are always pleasant, helpful and make you feel a little more at home. I don‚Äôt know what candles they burn in the lobby but they are amazing. 

Room was clean and well appointed. Always love the wrapped chocolate that appears when I return to the hotel each night. Bed this time around was not as comfortable but it was fine. Bathrooms are great on each visit - clean with good water pressure.

Used the hotel gym and it was bigger than most that you would find throughout the US. Had everything you need for a good cardio or weight training workout.

Location is great - within walking distance to the South Kensington station which can get you all over London. If you are wanting to stretch your legs you can honestly get to parks, shopping and many other attractions if you are willing to get on some comfortable shoes and head out.

Embarrassed to say we‚Äôve never taken advantage of the great bar on either of our visits but we will certainly do so the next time around.

Plenty of great little places to get a pastry, lunch, or dinner in the area but I highly recommend Rocca for Italian food as it is right around the corner.

Can‚Äôt wait to get back and call The Kensington our temporary home during our next visit.",5,2017,02,10
113,Birthday Treat,"Stayed two nights as we were in London for my birthday. As it was a special occasion we had been allocated a lovely room, spacious, good view and on the day itself I was presented with a complimentary cake with Happy Birthday written in chocolate on the plate. I also received a note welcoming me to the hotel. These were nice touches. Not intrusive but made a special occasion even more so.  I have stayed here previously and find it to be a good location and a comfortable stay.",4,2017,02,10
113,Excellent hotel,"This was a lovely hotel, who gave you a great welcome from the start. The staff were friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble. It was spotlessly clean, the lounges had lovely warming welcoming fires going all day. Food was good and was served hot. 
Six of us went and everyone agreed we would definitely stop here again. ",5,2017,02,06
113,Sophistication south of Hyde Park,"My husband and I stayed at The Kensington on a recent trip to London, and it was divine. The Kensington itself is very beautiful and sophisticated. The rooms are small, which is not surprising for London hotels, but our room was very clean and quiet. We had drinks in the hotel bar, which was dark and cozy. Staff are helpful but remain out of the way. The location is excellent, every morning we would go for a walk or run in Hyde Park, and there are several tube stations that are quite close. The hotel is not inexpensive, but it was a decent value for what you get for your money.",4,2017,02,05
113,Excellent!,"Our stay at The Kensington was excellent. The hotel is in an excellent location, easily accessible via public transit to all of london. Plenty of restaurants and bars nearby -- and walking distance from Hyde Park. The staff was superb (especially Carolina, who was incredibly helpful during all meals in the restaurant!). 

Highly recommend for all interested in a pleasant day, weekend, or week in London. ",5,2017,02,05
113,Very nice,"The hotel is very nice and 2 minutes walking to metro station. About 15 minutes walking to Horrods and Hyde Park. The hotel location is very central. Quite a few restaurants are near the hotel, which provide you comprehensive dinner-out choices.",5,2017,02,04
113,Indulged with hospitality!,"The location of the Hotel was ideal close to two tube stations and the exterior of the building is so elegant. We were greeted from the taxi by friendly helpful staff and that continued throughout our stay with every member of staff we engaged with. The receptionist was so pleasant and made you feel welcome from the start. When we passed any staff member be it in the corridors or lifts they would always be so professional and friendly. It was very refreshing. As for the Hotel itself well the downstairs areas are delightful with fires glowing and a kind of grandeur yet maintaining a warm homely feeling. Great for a relaxing drink and a fruit drink menu was an option also. The bar with its chandeliers had a lovely ambience and we had lunch an evening meal and breakfast all of which were very enjoyable and very professionally managed.
The room was on the small side but very clean and the bed very comfortable but as the downstairs is so inviting there is no need to spend too much time in the room here. We had a Nespresso coffee machine in the room and the room was attended to before we returned for the night with fresh supply of milk and biscuits, chocolates and fresh towels.
We would definitely love to stay here again we felt cared for and relaxed when we left. Thank you to the lovely people that make this Hotel home from home.",5,2017,02,04
113,Christmas shopping ,"Good start for a relaxed weekend in London, everything decorated for christmas to get the right vibe! The breakfast is superb a lot to choice from! And even the lunch and high tea are amazing good in front of the fireplace and christmas tree. The tube is 5 minutes walk and the kensington area is very clean and safe to walk in the evenings!",5,2017,02,03
113,"Great staff, wonderful location, amazing decoration","First of all I'd like to thank to Guido, George and Elisa for their warm welcome. helpful and friendly approaches during our visit.
Hotel is great, rooms and WCs are clean and ok. 
Decoration is wonderful. 
Food is fine if you stay in the hotel for dinner . 
Location and general look of the hotel are great. 
I strongly recommend this hotel especially if you go to London for pleasure. 
",5,2017,02,02
113,A lovely treat,We had a lovely weekend treat by staying in the Kensington Hotel.  It was an oasis of calm in the busy city of London both in the public areas/lounges and our room itself.  The staff were more than helpful and nothing was too much trouble.  We used South Kensington tube station which was 5 mins walk so the location was perfect.,5,2017,01,31
113,Birthday weekend away,"Our 2nd stay at the Kensington. Junior Suite. Room and service was excellent. Birthday cake, drinks and flowers in the room was a very nice touch. Special Hotel for a special occasion. Looking forward to our next stay.",5,2017,01,29
113,"Beautiful rooms, great food, and service that would put the best hotels to shame","We have just finished staying for a night at The Kensington - in fact, I'm actually writing this review from their lounge area in front of a roaring fire. We arrived early yesterday afternoon for our stay and were greeted by wonderful staff who offered to carry our bags for us from pretty much the moment we set foot on the steps to the hotel, offered a lovely refreshing juice and hot towel to freshen up with while our check-in was sorted. We enjoyed chatting to the gentleman who checked us in and spoke briefly about our plans for the weekend while the check-in was processing (we were in town for my girlfriend's birthday).

Our room (on the fifth floor) was spacious and well furnished, with a four poster bed (the mattress was the perfect balance of softness and substance) and a beautiful large bathroom complete with couples sinks, rainfall shower and bath. The complimentary toiletries which were provided in abundance were also fantastic and I don't think we could have used all of them if we'd tried!

After settling in to our room, we decided to go down and check out the bar. Trust me, this is not something you want to miss. The cocktails were superb (a specific mention to ""Millionaire"", an infusion of havana rum and sloe gin I'm going to be sure to attempt to recreate myself), and the ""bar bites"" were fantastic - the steak sandwich with caramelised onion was our favourite.

After enjoying our cocktails, we returned to our room and the staff were more than happy to accommodate our every need (ice bucket for champagne, ironing board and iron, etc). Alongside these items the staff also (unexpectedly!) delivered a birthday cake, complimentary cocktail vouchers and a handwritten birthday card wishing us a pleasant stay from the staff. This kind of service is what makes the difference between a great hotel stay and one you will always remember.

Honestly, I could go on and on. I have never posted a TripAdvisor review before, but the quality of service at The Kensington compelled me to register just to leave this review so others don't miss the same magical experience we were lucky enough to have.

5/5, and we will definitely be staying here again in future.

PS: Make sure you don't miss the breakfast, either!",5,2017,01,29
113,Afternoon Tea,"Fantastic afternoon Tea for a 50th birthday, Family of 7 attended and service was excellent. All staff very attentive , the one waiter Alfonso took pride in a brilliant service. Food was very enjoyable, would 100% come back again !! ",5,2017,01,28
113,Very nice area and staff,"Kensington area generally speaking is a must in the city. This residential area is beautiful, full of restaurants and ancient and stylish buildings. The rooms are small,London hotel rooms are usually slow,however the staff is very kind and helpful. The internet is very fast,the rooms are cosy and the hotel is close to the underground station. A stay you would enjoy indeed. ",4,2017,01,27
113,Great place,"I really enjoyed my stay here.  It was my first trip to London and I splurged on booking the Kensington and was a little nervous about the size of the superior double.  It turned out to be a spacious and quiet room (fyi- I was on a higher floor).  The service was excellent.  I arrived, exhausted, at 10:30am and was pleasantly surprised when they were able to accommodate my request for early check-in (I had called in prior to my arrival).  The front desk was warm and welcoming and very easy to chat with.  I met the much talked about George, who is as fantastic as everyone mentioned.  I spent most of my stay exploring London and wasn't in other parts of the hotel.  What I saw looked very lovely and when I return I'll be sure to take a moment to enjoy the common areas.",5,2017,01,27
113,"Good location, nice hotel","We stayed here over the summer.  The room was very small, similar to rooms you would find in New York and Paris in similarly ranked hotels, but even smaller.  However staff was very nice, the rooms were clean and comfortable.  We had the tea in the lobby one afternoon and it was very tasty and elegant!  The location was really nice.  Lots of restaurants within walking distance, and since we were there during the summer we walked everywhere - Buckingham palace, Harrod's, and Victoria & Alfred Museum.  Overall we had a nice stay and would consider staying here again.",4,2017,01,26
113,Elegant and Comfortable,"This hotel is very elegant in it's decor and furnishings. There is a Nespresso machine in each room and tea time each afternoon. The building has historic charm and the common areas for breakfast, a cocktail or just reading are beautifully decorated but at the same time comfortable and relaxing.",5,2017,01,24
113,"Cozy yet elegant, friendly yet discreet....perfect combos for a perfect stay!!!!","Staying here for 4 weeks with work and the thought of staying so long in a hotel was a little disappointing. How wrong I was!!!!!! 
The hotel is cozy and elegant,and, the staff are friendly yet discreet, with nothing being too much trouble for them. 
The food is delicious and there is plenty of choice.... I've never been one to get up earlier than necessary, always opting for room service, however, I'm a convert to their breakfast!!!!!!! Roaring fires with Eggs Florentine.....Heaven ",5,2017,01,23
113,Superb hotel and staff,"Meet all our expectations and beyond; fantastic staff ( I cannot just point out anybody in particular as they all were exceptional, from concierge, reception, doorman, waiters,....) friendly, courteous, willing to solve any questions and always with a smile.
The room and bathroom superb, best breakfast ever; clean, comfortable, pretty quiet rooms full of details...
Only drawback: that I did not stay at the kensington in the previous years I have been travelling to London. Will not make same mistake again!
Thank you all for a fantastic stay; looking forward to return.
Fantastic team; fantastic hotel",5,2017,01,22
113,Afternoon tea delight,We spend a wonderful afternoon with our family in the very comfortable lounge of this gorgeous hotel being thoroughly looked after. The great service was topped off with amazing food and the best clotted cream this side of Devon or Cornwall. Amazing and definitely will be back!,5,2017,01,22
113,well looked after,"The hotel does offer luxury and classy old style charm and opulence that you would expect in London The staff service and staff in general was gracious and attentive. On my round trip to London, I called an old friend and happily booked a large room.  Without a doubt, this is one of the finest hotels you can book in south kensington London. Happy with service and I flew back to New York thinking how wonderful my stay was. Much Appreciated!",5,2017,01,21
113,Excellent hotel,"We were in this hotel for 7 nights and loved it. We had 3 rooms booked and each one was unique in its own way. The breakfast was delightful and had many options which we could order from. They really took care of our dietary requirements, because we were halal , making sure that our food did not mix with the meat products. Every single member of staff were very friendly and helpful. Verushka ,the manager on duty when we checked in was excellent and very helpful.  Will definitely visit this hotel again when I'm in London. ",5,2017,01,20
113,Well-being in Kensington,"This is an elegant, sophisticated hotel in which the staff give impeccable service with a smile. The decor and furnishings have been tastefully selected and induce feelings of well-being and relaxation. Our deluxe room was spacious, comfortable and quiet.",5,2017,01,19
113,Christmas in London,"This is such a special hotel. We have visited the hotel in years past and will never stay anywhere else. Amazing staff, to a person , lovely and helpful. The hotel is cozy and beautiful and at Christmas time it is especially so. Breakfast was amazing , also room service was excellent. London was super busy at this time , so reserve your tea times early. Will be back very soon and cannot wait. Love this hotel.",5,2017,01,17
113,Wonderful Weekend Stay,"What a great hotel! From the check-in we were made to feel welcome and relaxed as guests.The Check-in was effortless & the lady who helped us here was wonderful unlike the robotic response you get in many places nowadays.PS The bed has to be the comfiest I have ever slept on and I have stayed in a lot of hotels over the years with work & play, so much so we have contacted the manufacturer to see if we can buy one!",5,2017,01,16
113,Small but nice,"I stayed at two different hotel rooms in London over the span of a week. This was a little smaller than the other location but it was very nice and had everything we needed. The location was close to the tube, and the continental breakfast was more than adequate. Depending on the rate you can get, this is a good option.",4,2017,01,15
113,perfect christmas,"Wonderful service, delicious food and wine and a lovely, comfortable room.  It was such a treat to be able to have our Christmas here  and be so well looked after - and all with such friendliness.  nothing seemed too much trouble.  The staff were all really kind and attentive.",5,2017,01,15
113,2nd stay just as good as the 1st,"This hotel is in a great position for sightseeing, the staff are very friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is very relaxed with a country house feel in the centre of London. Rooms are well appointed with all the usual touches you would expect. Breakfast is very good with a great selection of dishes, my only issue is it is always really warm in the building but its a minor grumble.",5,2017,01,13
113,Brilliant time Kensington,This beautifull hotel is one of the jewels in the crown of the Doyle Collection. The level of service is above extraordinary. The staff is friendly. attentive and beyond efficient. Treat yourself to a cocktail in the beautiful bar. A rare experience.,5,2017,01,12
113,A relaxing restuful oasis in the city!,"we always enjoyed coming back after a busy day of touring. The ambiance and staff were amazing. The room was always immaculate. We loved breakfast, and enjoyed having tea in the evening. The crackling fireplaces and hushed peaceful atmosphere was always so soothing to return to. ",5,2017,01,09
113,Festive wedding stay and a very Happy New Year.,"We arrived 30th Dec for 3 nights as part of a group attending our friends wedding in Chelsea on 31st December and thoroughly enjoyed The Kensington hotel experience. The family room #223 we were allocated was fine directly opposite the lift doors. Comfortable beds with crisp linens, nice touch with a fresh fruit bowl, milk shakes and cookies for the boys upon arrival. 

Only issue with the room was the bathroom or wet room after we'd all showered since there was no door to stop water flowing all over the floor towards the toilet. We improvised by rolling up towels and used them like sand bags in an effort to contain the water during our showers. 

Lovely comfortable lounge areas off reception and bar area with gas living flame effect open fireplaces. The Christmas tree, lights and festive decorations throughout the hotel and common areas were all tastefully arranged. 

The hotel staff were all very polite and attentive, only couple of small issues with the breakfasts on two mornings; orders mixed up and wrongly delivered to our tables and other guests tables nearby. Quickly sorted out by the waiting staff however room for a few improvements perhaps.

The bar area is very cozy, comfortable not too brightly lit which I liked. The staff are all very polite, professional and knowledgeable, All in all we all enjoyed a lovely stay in this fine established hotel which is well located for many amenities and nearby attractions, easy to get to on the underground as well. 

We would love to visit again sometime and would thoroughly recommend The Kensington to anyone. Well done to all the staff who worked tirelessly over the busy festive and new year period.",5,2017,01,08
113,Made it up,We originally got a room but had to wait for a long time before the room was clear. I still give this five stars because they made it up to us by giving us a discount and a free bottle of wine. Nice location near the subway or tube and is not far from the science museum. We visited Harrods and it is only one tube stop away from South Kensington (it was Knightsbridge).,5,2017,01,07
113,"very pretty hotel and great location, but..","Had a wonderful holiday stay at the Kensington.  The room is small, but furnishings nice.  And, with all the decorations for No√´l, the lobby & bar were very cozy and inviting.  A couple of minor points though: restaurant service was a little off.  I think the servers, while nice enough, need additional training.  Waited 15min for luke warm cappiccino then received another one exactly the same when ordered again.  Also, when ordering a simple smoothie - it took 3 people to figure it out.  Hmmm??

Just little things, but make all the difference in the final experience!!

Location was great - close to High Street and Chelsea and you can take any of the 4 buses that are near hotel to get across the city (and see the Christmas lights) - so good for exploring.  Tube close too!",4,2017,01,06
113,wonderful stay from start to finish!,"wonderful & luxurious stay from start to finish! great location and wonderful staff. A true retreat in the heart ok Kensington... Felt at home, secure and pampered. Each member of staff we encountered was delightful",5,2017,01,04
113,"Wondeful Staff, Great location!","My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel over the Christmas holiday. On first impression, the hotel seemed really nice and the staff was very attentive. The holiday decor was beautiful! Our room was small, but we knew that going in based on other reviews. What we didn't know was there is a weird half shower door we'd be dealing with. It wasn't inconvenient, just a little weird and I spent lots of time having to soak up all the water I got everywhere each time I showered. Also, for some reason, the floor we were on (2nd) always smelled like gravy. Delicious smelling gravy, but constantly gravy nonetheless. As previously mentioned, the staff was really great. We really enjoyed talking to Ben at the bar (keep those experimental cocktails coming!) and made several friends throughout the trip. The location of the hotel was really perfect for what we wanted to do. Overall, it was a great experience and we would definitely be back!",4,2017,01,03
113,Lovely Christmas dinner on Christmas Day ,"Had a lovely relaxing dinner with a nice choice that would suit all tastes.  Nothing was a hassle.  Many thanks to all staff.
The Kensington is a beautiful hotel and hope to return maybe in the afternoon for afternoon tea.",5,2017,01,03
113,"Class, signed, sealed delivered","This hotel breathes style and class. If you're looking for genuine grandeur, you'll find it at the door, the reception, the lobby, your room, the bar. 10/10, constant attention to detail and no mucking about. What you see on photos does not do this place justice!",5,2017,01,02
113,perfect base for the sights,"a fantastic hotel in a great position, staff were brilliant, room we had (116) was a little on the small side with no view at all as it's out the back but that didn't spoil our stay, breakfast was fantastic",5,2017,01,02
113,Lovely hotel with some minor issues,"Pros:
--Great location, only about 2 blocks from the South Kensington tube station as well as the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Natural History Museum, and walking distance to various shops including Harrods.
--GORGEOUS sitting room and dining room downstairs. Really special.
--Good food and great afternoon tea
--Prompt room service
--Clean rooms with nice, albeit simple, decor

Cons:
--Service in the sitting room was extremely, painfully slow, even when it wasn't that busy, and many (though not all!) of the waiters seemed totally checked out.
--The rooms are quite small (though this isn't entirely uncommon in Europe)
--Slow/spotty Wifi
--Thin walls. Bring earplugs!",4,2017,01,02
113,Unforgettable & Awesome Hotel!,"I just returned from London yesterday. Stayed 6 nights at the Kensington last week. Prime location (about 5~7 minutes walk from the South Kensingtion Underground Station). Nice and safe neighborhood. There are two supermarkets nearby (Little Waitrose & Tesco). ALL staff at the hotel were so friendly, helpful, and professional. My room was on the higher floor facing the main street (Queen's Gate) with nice views; it's a quiet street so no noise at all. The hotel staff made me feel like at home. I was very impressed that they remembered me as early as Day 2; they always welcomed me when I returned to hotel everyday. The hotel lobby is so beautiful. My room was a bit small but very clean. I really enjoyed my stay and will definitely choose this hotel when I visit London again in the future :)",5,2017,01,01
113,Absolutely perfect stay!,I can not thank the staff and hotel enough for an absolutely wonderful stay. Every staff member we met as more than accommodating and polite. Afternoon tea was a dream. Perfect location. Perfect stay. Thank you!,5,2017,01,01
113,Wonderful stay in a beautiful hotel,"We stayed over 2 nights in this beautiful hotel and had a great experience. We travelled with a baby and a child in the deluxe room. The room was big enough to have a baby cot in it although I wished the bathroom was bigger. We were given children toiletries and the Kensington bears as keepsake which our children loved. The ginger bread and chocolate drink left in the room was a nice touch as well.
The service was good overall and the christmas decorations around the hotel created a lovely ambience. The staff was helpful, especially the concierge (George, I think). My favourite part of the hotel is the bar as it has got this lovely ambience.
Breakfast was one of the best I have had in London. I love the selection of healthy breakfast like soaked chia seeds with mango especially after eating bacon and sausages day in and out. Don't find that often in hotels.  
In terms of location, it is pretty close to the Natural History Museum and Hyde Park. We walked over to both places and had an enjoyable day as the weather was beautiful. 
Would definitely go back to The Kensington if we were in London again.",5,2016,12,31
113,London at its best,"Decided to drive with a rental car to this hotel, and that is an amazingly easy thing to do; even without modern GPS. Parking is 100 meters away and staff is very helpful transferring the luggage. Rooms are modern, and nice with high ceilings. Hospitality is still written here with a capital H. Elevators are quick and efficient, even during rush hour. Breakfast equally nice and well looked after. Including the 2 fireplaces that add to the atmosphere. It was a family stay, and even walking, it is easy to reach Hyde park, or Oxford street without too much hassle...",4,2016,12,30
113,fantastic,stayed over for 3 nights lovely hotel beautifully decorated lounge areas nice bar hotel staff very wonderful ever go to london don't miss a chance to stay at this place that's if you need a hotel lol hope to visit again london on company business and use this place keep up the good work,5,2016,12,29
113,"Nice, but bar staff is awful","We were here for 3 days and had mostly a lovely experience. We came off a red eye from NY, and they were nice enough to find us a room at 8am so we didn't have to walk the city like zombies on our first day, and that was very much appreciated. Rooms were small, but fine by European standards. Common areas were great, and breakfast was amazing. But unfortunately need to dock the score because the bar staff on our last night was so incredibly rude, it would prevent me from recommending this hotel or staying here again. We were hoping for a nightcap around their closing time at 11, and would've been fine to have been refused and gone to bed, but they said sure no problem and asked us to wait in the lounge, which was lively with many other parties still being served. It took 30 minutes to get a drink order, after two trips to ask if it was still possible, and then when they did come, we had two people who couldn't provide us with a drink list, and a third who was an ultra pretentious guy questioning if we were even guests in the hotel, standing over us like hawks while we hastily ordered, and making snide comments about our sophistication with their pretty basic menu. If I took a moment to look, it was because I was being browbeaten and they didn't have anything special, not because it read like some elevated language beyond my grasp. It was a super basic list of alcohol. Perhaps I should have had an arcade fire haircut or British accent and things would've gone smoother? I ordered a 30 pound bourbon that they put ice in without being asked for some reason (I'm guessing because I was judged an unsophisticated American), and was advised to perhaps not order it because it might be too expensive. Anyway, it was a pretty silly experience, and unfortunately tainted an otherwise good stay. Didn't realize I'd get judged poorly by an arbiter of taste and sophistication unfortunately miscast as a hotel barkeep. Hope others have better luck.",3,2016,12,28
113,Excellent Kensington base,"Stayed in the hotel for 2 nights.  Great location in nice area, rooms are nicely finished, lots of lounge areas for relaxing and enjoying something to eat.  All the food we tried was to a high standard.  Staff were friendly and very helpful.",5,2016,12,28
113,A truly special hotel.,"Hotel staff went above and beyond top to ensure that this was going to be a perfect Christmas and Birthday celebration. Lovely cake of choice delivered to our Room on the morning of my girlfriends birthday, and christmas sock with all sorts of goodies delivered on the evening before christmas day. They also arranged lovely flowers with the cake that we had to take with us home because it would've been a shame to leave them behind. 

In terms of the Hotel itself, it's just perfect. Lovely ambience, homely and we truly left wanting more.

A truly special hotel. Thank you.",5,2016,12,26
113,Afternoon Tea,"Beautiful hotel, absolutely beautiful!
All the members of staff were friendly, helpful and welcoming.
We enjoyed an excellent afternoon champagne tea sitting in front of a toasty open fire in spacious elegant surroundings. The sandwiches and cakes were of a very high standard and despite our best efforts we didn't have room to finish them all!
I'd definitely come here again and book to stay. ",5,2016,12,23
113,Amazing as always ,"We've stayed at The Kensington a number of times now. And this one night stay was a great as always. 

The rooms are spacious and well appointed. The bathrooms spotless and well stocked with decent products. 

It's great to have a big TV when you just want to crash out and watch. 

The thing that sets this hotel apart is the staff. They are great. All of them. Super friendly, relaxed. And you get well looked after. Book. Stay there now if you're going to London. ",5,2016,12,23
113,Superb Hotel,"With such an abundance of hotels in this area its sometimes hard to choose. The price of the Kensington maybe a little higher but on this occasion you definitely get what you pay for. Its the little things that set this place above the rest. Complementary newspaper every day (sat & sun time & telegraph), glass bottle water, Nespresso pops, Sky Sports in room, exceptional breakfast, real fires in the lobbies etc etc",5,2016,12,22
113,Weekend away ,"Really impressive, a beautiful hotel with a fantastic team of friendly staff. A lovely welcome from the receptionist Chardonnay on the front desk all the way through housekeeping and the team behind the bar.  Highly recommended.",5,2016,12,18
113,Xmas break / Royal Albert Hall,From the moment we arrived at this charming British hotel we were made very welcome. The room was very nice with a delightful bathroom. With a lovely lounge area with roaring fire's we were happy to just soak in the atmosphere before hitting the shops. Decorations to suit made the hotel very Christmassy. Cocktails in the plush bar at the end of the day then a very nice breakfast finished our stay to perfection. ,5,2016,12,18
113,Could I have some marmalade for the Royal slice of bread?,"My husband and I have been visiting this hotel since 2001 - it is handy to both the Royal Marsden Hospital and The Brompton where both of us have had business over the years.

Considering our most recent visit which was a week with no particular business commitments.  

The purchase of the hotel by the current owners saw its removal from the Jury's  group, it saw a major revamp, and the concomitant up staging of its general hotel rating.  I do not recall the previous star rating, but the current rating of 4 stars is probably right on track.

In the big picture, nothing has changed since our first visit in 2001.  The locations is convenient to just about everything, the staff are more than on top of their game and 
the public rooms where food and drink are served are outstanding.  There are masses of staff to politely, courteously,  and efficiently service your needs.

There is a down side to this hotel - in the first instance is the size of the room you book.  Bearing in mind the building was built during the reign of Queen Victoria so immediately one must deal with all sorts of issues relating old architecture with contemporary needs in terms of plumbing, heating, and so on.  It is a great shame that the revamping project did not address the smallness of some rooms.  

Safety of the deep baths is a concern for those of us who are a touch on the elderly side,  But otherwise the bathroom and bath products were very good.  Having said that, I was a touch annoyed that my towel for this mornings shower was clearly yesterdays that had been followed up - damp.

Minor problems - but I really am of the opinion that a map of the rooms by price should be freely available.  On arrival, we were assigned a room that was small to the point that access to one side of the queen side bed was virtually impossible and the prospect of safely and comfortably accommodating 2 average size suitcases and 2 carry on's was not going to be a possibility.  We requested another room which was found with good grace and good wishes.

Please stay at this hotel and enjoy.  Martyn at the front will make it all happen for you and Chandonnay will put a smile on you face.",4,2016,12,14
113,Absolutely wonderful hotel,"My husband and I spent four nights at this beautiful hotel on our 25th wedding anniversary and were so happy with our choice.  It is a by far one of the nicest hotels we have stayed in.  It was perfect, everything we could possible want was provided and it was so very comfortable.  Our accommodation there was one of the larger rooms with sitting area, king size bed, a full size bathroom with both shower and roll top bath.  Our room had a beautiful bow window looking out over pretty streets and the bathroom was amazing, it provided a large rain shower with super water pressure and lovely hot water.  There was a double vanity with drawers and lots of shelf space in the bathroom.  It too had a large light filled window with shutters.  Our room had two easy chairs and the King size bed was so very comfortable with lovely bedding. 
The staff were very nice, friendly and efficient and George was most helpful and pleasant on our arrival and departure, he's a treasure! 
The location of the hotel is great with the museums and tube just a short walk away    There are lots of local restaurants and shops near the hotel. 
It is such a beautiful hotel , feels more like a private club than a hotel.   I loved the decor of the hotel.   Breakfast was great, both buffet and full English. 
Absolutely nothing wanting in this hotel.    Upon our return to London we will for sure stay once again at our favourite hotel The Kensington.   ",5,2016,12,08
113,weekend with my daughter in london.,"As a middle age mum. it was pure heaven to arrive at our beautiful hotel.The bedroom was amazing and it was lovely to relax into the bed after a long day.The Christmas decorations were out of this world and having breakfast by an open fire was the icing on the cake.

",5,2016,12,07
113,Nice 4 star gem,"You can't beat the location near Knightsbridge, the great restaurants and museums. The staff are kind and accommodating, and the breakfast buffet is excellent. It is a fabulous location for a coffee or morning meeting in its large and sunny sitting area. 
While all the rooms are unique they're not particularly special; many are stuffy, and the decor seems drab. The bathrooms can be small, even in a higher category studio suite. 
If you don't spend a vast amount of time in your room the Kensington is a great hotel. 
I have tried many boutique hotels in the South Ken area, and feel the golden age of boutique hotels has passed. 
These hotels can be charming but unless you know the hotel and its rooms well you're never sure what you're getting. 
Off season rates are often reasonable. The Superior King category at the Kensington seems the best all around value. 
The Christmas season rates at the Kensington are insanely high for a 4 star hotel, and are of little value, in my opinion. I'd rather spend an additional ¬£100 and stay at a five star brand hotel.",4,2016,12,07
113,November stay,"The hotel was in general excellent, however my room 101 was very small indeed. Breakfast was good again expensive. I had a problem with my bill, I was overcharged on my bar bill, this was sorted by my bank.",4,2016,12,07
113,Christmas Shopping,A wonderful way to get into the spirit of Christmas.  The hotel is beautifully decorated and is quite luxurious.  We had a very comfortable stay and also used the restaurant for dinner and breakfast.  The staff and extremely polite and professional.  I recommend it any of the time year as the location is excellent,5,2016,12,07
113,Excellent will return soon!,"This hotel was recommended to us and pleased it was.  We had a 3 night stay in a loft 'suite' which was great in all aspects.  Nice to have a room in London that you could swing a cat!!  Superb location near to all that Knightsbridge has to offer and convenient to the tube. 
Staff and customer service amongst I have encountered.  We will be back again next year 
(Only minor suggestion and don't be put off by this -  can the coffee at breakfast be served hot!)",4,2016,12,05
113,Perfect,"Simply Perfect. Costumer service is excellent. There are no bad things to say about The Kensington. It is in the best location, the staff is caring and prompt, great designs, and food is divine! 

What to expect:
Arrive to a warm welcome and a guide on how to survive the London life. Find a genuine care for your room to be well equipped for your stay. Consistency with tea bags, chocolate, towels, etc. If you are able to meet George, you are lucky! George was one of the sweetest staff members there. Always giving us the best London advice as well his undivided attention. His smile beats the London weather any day! I would (without a doubt) stay here again just to say hi to him! 

A close proximity to the South Kensington Station and the best museums! In December visit the Natural History Museum for some fun ice skating and a quick hot chocolate that overlooks the rink and Kensington! (Student discounts on Wednesdays if you book online). This is a must since it is only a 5 min walk from the hotel. If your lucky you may even get to see some fireworks (usually around 7pm). 

There's also Chelsea which has King's Rd. King's Rd has tons of dinning places! The top for me where: Byron, Made in Italy, and Oka (best sushi EVER). If you just want a banana for before your tour of London, I recommend going to Tesco. 

Take a quick pic because let's face it, The Kensington is way too cute for our camera roll not to have that photo. (: 

If you picked this place, I promise you.. you did not make a mistake! Enjoy London and The Kensington. 

Quick Tip: CityMapper is a life saver in London. (;",5,2016,12,04
113,A wonderful British ambiance and charm,"The hotel had a solid British vibe to it and it seemed that a majority of guests were Brits from outside of London. Lots of families during breakfast.

The staff were very helpful. The rooms were smallish but comfortable. More importantly it was a quiet. 

Was here for business and although there's nothing very close to it. The South Kensington Station was conveniently close.",4,2016,12,04
113,Wonderful Country House ambience in the heart of London,"We had a very good lunch at Town House Restaurant within the excellently located Kensington Hotel.  Comfortable country look with fireplaces, charming Library and excellent modern cuisine. Imaginative dishes, good selection of wines.
Very kind waiters, the restaurant manager being particularly notable in the way he kept a very attentive eye on every guest  and on all his staff to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience for all his guests.  We will most certaily go back.",5,2016,12,03
113,Wonderful stay - can't wait to return!,"Just returned from a 3 night stay in the hotel.  We booked through Expedia and had requested twin beds in the room. Check-in was efficient with hot towels and water offered on arrival. However our room was far to small for 2 people - there was barely room to move and there was no storage for any clothes apart from a tiny wardrobe space with about 4 hangers. We raised the issue and requested if there was an alternative room available. We were very quickly shown to an alternative room in the same price range which was far bigger and was a super room. The service and response to this problem was exceptional and was handled so well.  That started us off to a wonderful stay!
The hotel is in an excellent location, close to South Kensington tube station with a lot of key london locations etc just a few stops away. There are some lovely restaurants close to the hotel. 
We ate in the bar and really enjoyed it. We also enjoyed drinks and cocktails in the bar and the surroundings of both the bar and lounge areas are really lovely.
The staff in thie hotel are wonderful and can't do enough for you. 
We hadn't booked breakfast and easily found places to eat.
Westfield shopping centre is also a short bus ride away - well worth a visit. Recommend the concierge hands free shopping !!",5,2016,12,02
113,Perfect location with very friendly staff,"Having booked this hotel because of its location, we were greeted by extremely friendly staff. Our room, whilst small, was well equipped and stocked with high quality toiletries, Nespresso coffee, slippers and robes. The turn-down service was also much appreciated. The bed was very comfortable, which is important as one of our party suffers from back pain. As it was a joint birthday celebration, we were very touched to receive complimentary cocktails, which were excellent. The only down-side was the room decor, which appeared to be a little tired, but this did not affect our overall stay. Breakfast was first class, served in beautiful surroundings and again, service was of the highest standard. We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others who are looking for somewhere handy to the Natural History Museum, The Victoria and Albert Museum, The Royal Albert Hall or many of the other London museums. Thank you to all the staff for your hard work and commitment to making our stay so enjoyable.",4,2016,12,02
113,boutique hotel with service values,"excellent mid size hotel. brilliant staff really just couldnt do enough for you. every one tries hard to make it a home from home enviroment. full on cocktail bar serving just about anything you could imagine. 2 roaring real fires, all dressed up for chritmas just a nice place to stay at.",5,2016,11,30
113,Great location,"As other reviewers have said 'superior' room does in fact mean their basic room so our room was rather tiny and only 1 person could just about fit into the bathroom at any one time. Having said that, the room was very well equipped with clever storage of bathrobes, kettle, hairdryer etc. Air conditioning was effective and although there was no view, being at the back of the hotel meant it was nice and quiet.
The hotel was beautifully 'dressed' for Christmas, we loved the bar - decor, ambience and staff were great, breakfast was also lovely although the service a little hit and miss. 
The location was perfect for our lunch in South Kensington followed by shopping on Kensington High Street and a visit to the new Design museum. We visit London quite frequently and we would return to the Kensington Hotel.",4,2016,11,29
113,Afternoon tea,"I went to this hotel for an afternoon tea with my family as I wanted them to experience the true essence of this English tradition and I must say it was even better than expected. The hotel is lovely, very comfortable seats and a nice atmosphere. The staff are welcoming  and absolutely a pleasure to deal with. The tea selection is good, and the food is of very high quality. 
It's also fairly priced. The only ""negative"" thing was the hot air stream that was a bit too much as it was exactly above us and felt a bit too intense. I highly recommend it!",5,2016,11,29
113,Outstanding Service and Warmth,"While we only had two nights at the Kensington, we were welcomed and catered to by the staff, ensuring a return visit.  The room was cozy and extremely clean.  All the amenities were available plus chocolates the night of our arrival.  We highly recommend the Kensington and hope to visit again.",5,2016,11,26
113,An amazing Civil Ceremony Drinks experience,"After our civil ceremony this month, we did some drinks at The Kensington. Valentina Piana was the event organiser, and she made sure that every detail was taken care of flawlessly. Valentina's enthusiasm and care made sure the event was an absolute success. 
The hotel is a beautiful building in the heart of South Kensington, very close to Kensington and Chelsea Town Hall, where we got married, as well as South Kensington station, which was quite handy for the guests. 
I highly recommend this hotel for anybody who wants to stay in a quiet and central part of London, as well as anybody who's looking to organise some drinks for any occasion. 
",5,2016,11,25
113,Deluxe experience.,"First, the small matter of semantics. The hotel offers 'superior' rooms thereby suggesting that there are rooms which are in some way inferior or of a lesser standard. This is not the case and something that I didn't pick up on when booking a package which was confirmed by email as '...a beautifully appointed room or suite.' On entering the room, we were underwhelmed by the size and then the brick wall which was the view from the window. I spoke first to the receptionist and then the Duty Manager, who both explained that a superior room was, in fact, the hotel's 'entry level' room and therefore there are no rooms below this. Thankfully, the Duty Manager, Veruska understood my complaint and moved us to a deluxe room. This room was wonderful with a comfortable bed, tasteful furniture (including two chairs for us as a couple), good quality toiletries (some boxes were empty though!) and coffee (although no milk). The room was also spotlessly clean and warm. Where this hotel really sets itself apart is the staff: they are polite and friendly without being too familiar or overly subservient. Every member of staff smiled and said hello; the reception staff were all helpful, knowledgable and keen to resolve problems professionally. The door staff were kind and efficient. The restaurant staff were lovely and   the service was second to none. The food was excellent, although I found the main course a bit limited as I am gluten intolerant. All in all we had a wonderful time at the hotel which is beautifully furnished and located in an architecturally classic area within walking distance to the museums and wonderful shops. I really would recommend it - as long as you understand that superior means basic when applied to the rooms.",4,2016,11,23
113,Best kept secret in London,"This is by far one of the most charming boutique hotels in the area. I wouldn't hesitate to return. The only downside is their smallest rooms are terribly small (although very well designed), although the comfort of the bed compensates. The staff are also very friendly, but can get a bit flustered during check-in/check-out time if its too busy. Overall, would recommend without hesitation.",4,2016,11,21
113,Just okay,It's hardly a 5 star hotel. There were no special touches. The toiletries in the bathroom were average. I had to leave a day early because of a family emergency and they wanted me to contact expedia. Where's the customer service you find a true 5 star hotel? It's not worth my time or energy to contact expedia. I'll just let it go. The bed was just okay. Truly average experience,3,2016,11,21
113,Classy hotel,"What an amazing hotel. Besides the fact that the premises are absolutely beautiful, the staff members are both professional and nice. Specially Vincent, Martyn and Elisa whom Upon arrival the first impression was fantastic welcoming and professional, you are transformed in time and space. The room was spacious and comfortable. I literally melted into the bed. our room was fitted with a modern nespresso machine, ipad dock and phones to easily access the guest services agents 24 hours a day. I had forgotten my brush and with the touch of my finger, I asked for one to be delivered to my room. Within 10 minutes, there was a knock on my door with a dental kit.  The bathroom was so big and had every amenable imaginable.The drawing rooms and receptions were fantastic. The gym was full of top notch equipment,The lounge is a great place to relax, servers bring drinks with a smile. All in all fantastic place.",5,2016,11,20
113,Exceptional,"First time staying at The Kensington.loved everything about it,cozy great atmosphere and wonderful attention.bonus was the heated bathroom floor. Highly recommend. For business and family stays. Close to underground and easy walking distance to many attractions. Loved being in a residential neighborhood.",5,2016,11,20
113,service orientanted,"We came from Norway and we stayed here for a few days while in London, because my girlfriend is a huge fan of the west end show and I love english football. the hotel was very beautiful and very warm just like we expected, good breakfast and the best fire places around the lobby and the staircase next to the restaurant.all staff were friendly and professional. thank you Carolina,james for lovely food and drinks also  George and Martyn for restaurant recommendation.",5,2016,11,20
113,Excellent Location,"Perfect location for a stay in London within walking distance to the V&A Museum, Natural History Museum, Kensington Park, and Harods.  Great local shops, bars, and restaurants.  Beautiful common areas and the rooms are well equipped.
The doorman, Guido, was especially helpful in recommending terrific restaurants in the area.  He and George were very attentive and accommodating.",5,2016,11,20
113,"Lovely service, great location","There are several things to love about this hotel.  The location is South Kensington, an area of London we love.  Close to tube and lots of restaurants and pubs we've visited often. 
The public rooms of this hotel are beautiful and the service is excellent.  The staff were very friendly and polite. We were greeted every time we entered and left the hotel.  The bar is wonderful and although we didn't have dinner at the hotel, we had afternoon tea and breakfast.  Both were delicious.   
The room was small. But we chose that ourselves in advance and the fact is, when in London, how much time does one spend in a hotel room?  Very little.  We could have asked if there was a larger room available (who knows? busy weekend) but we had arrived from the US, it was one p.m. and the room was ready and that was important to us. 
The room had everything we needed, queen bed, safe, mini bar, TV, free WiFi, Nepresso machine and tea making options. Nicely decorated.  It was very quiet and away from the street.  The bathroom was up-to-date with lovely toiletries, big fluffy towels and bathrobes.  There was turn-down service and the room was always clean.  
On the whole we enjoyed our stay very much.",4,2016,11,19
113,Fabulous!,"Have just spent 2 wonderful nights at the Kensington with my three girlfriends! WOW! From the moment you walk in the door of the Kensington, you feel at home! The staff, the decor, service.....everything is perfect without being pretentious and uncomfortable! The drawing room is so beautifully appointed and decorated-it's warm and inviting with lovely fires, beautiful flowers, comfortable seating and a lovely bar!! We had a fantastic supper in the restaurant which you really could not fault for quality of food, service and ambience. The attention to details in the bedrooms/bathrooms was great (magnifying mirror in the bathroom a bonus for ladies of a certain age!!), umbrellas in the wardrobes-everything has been considered! But I think what blew us all away were the amazing staff-so professional, yet warm, friendly and eager to please-without exception!
The only downside was having to leave!!!!! Congratulations and thanks to all the staff who made our stay so special-we will definitely return and recommend!",5,2016,11,19
113,Out Standing Hotel,"Well I don't know where to start  from the minuet you arrive you get such a warm and friendly welcome from the door staff who where totally charming, The hotel is  beautiful inside and out, Cozy homely feel warm and welcoming sitting areas beautifully decorated in pastel colours with lovely roaring fires, great bar and the food in the Resteraunt  was excellent the service from Sinead was friendly and professional,  I can say this was the best hotel I have stayed at in London due to the out standing staff from every level. Even the manager Francesco chatted to us and had a laugh and joke. This was a girls get together for 2 nights. And we all said the staff where trained to perfection. The location is great a taxi rank just out side So over all a Superb stay we didn't want to leave. Thank you The Kensington",5,2016,11,18
113,Just like home,"We had a wonderful stay at this hotel, It was my mum‚Äôs birthday and we really enjoyed every minute of this beautiful spacious place. The General manager was very service minded, and he said hello to us whenever we saw him and asked us if we needed anything which was a lovely touch and making everything at the best. Special mentions goes to Audrey and George for their personal notes in the morning and great birthday wishes to my mum. The hotel is well equipped, clean and nicely furnished. Especially happy about room and bathroom facilities having a mother/daughter time. This south kensington hotel enlarged our London experience with its charming atmosphere, easy to get by, only 20 minutes away from central parts with the train. For sure a place we will recommend to friends who would like to have a convenient and genuine London experience, if we may, we'd be happy to return any day! Thanks again",5,2016,11,18
113,Cozy perfection,"As we were celebrating our wedding anniversary, we stayed at the hotel for the second time (honeymoon), which confirmed our first very positive experience. Still you will be served at your beck and call, anything is possible and  in an excellent quality manner. 

A cozy, jazzy atmosphere creates a warm feeling, with a perfect balance between formal and ease.",5,2016,11,16
113,Perfect nights stay in great location,The first thing that hits you as you walk in the door of the hotel is the lovely smell. The staff were all very helpful and friendly. Love the addition on the turn down service. Breakfast was nice but wee did have a long wait and it was quite expensive. This was a great location for visiting various locations in London,5,2016,11,14
113,Cosy Elegance in the heart of London,"Welcome: there's a lovely warm welcome when always.  The atmosphere is relaxed, informal elegance - plenty of comfy sofas and roaring fires, grand fireplaces, cosy corners.  

Comfort: comfortable bed & the room has all the little bits you might need on a trip - slippers, dressing gown - even an umbrella!

Quietness: the Windows have an inner glazing that block out street noise. 

Food: lovely breakfast choices & the dining room is bright and spacious.  Food is available at any time.  There's a nice bit of buzz at the bar in the evening, I got a bite to eat there. The cocktails look lovely! But I didn't try one.  There's also plenty of other eateries more or less on the doorstep.

Location: Just a few minutes walk from South Kensington tube station which connects to anywhere you need to go. Discovered that you can just tap your credit card at the turnstile and the charge is the same as for an Oyster Card.

I'll stay here next time for sure. If I was sending my mother or daughter to stay in London, I'd send them here. I know they'd be looked after.",5,2016,11,13
113,"Great hotel, superb service and staff","My wife and I stayed three nights at the Kensington. We reserved with nothing but trip advisor reviews as our reference and were not disappointed. 

Very friendly and professional check in with hot towel and a refreshing juice service. The room was a double and very nice and clean. No rough edges to be found and all amenities were reflective of the higher end hotel range. 

Best part of our stay was George at the front door who warmly greeted us each and every time we left or returned. He was an exceptionally friendly and knowledgeable help during our stay and recommended many great restaurants around the area!  Thanks again George and the Kensington for a great stay!",5,2016,11,13
113,Get VIP Service and Comfort in South Kensington,"We've stayed at The Kensington three times in the past year and each time has been even better than the last.  The staff works hard to make sure every guest feels welcome and comfortable.  The food is great.  The bar is warm and relaxing.  The rooms are cozy.  And, the location can't be beat.",5,2016,11,08
113,Outstanding Five Star Service,"We spent three nights recently in this beautiful Hotel.  Excellent location, World Class Service and beautiful food.  We would highly recommend the hotel for all of the reasons stated.  We did however stay in a very small room, even for London standards, unfortunately there were no other rooms available but we will book a bigger room when we return and we will definitely be back!

Just wanted to mention some of the exceptional staff in relation to their excellent customer service, Michael and Guido at the front concierge, Dan at the reception area, Barbara in the restaurant and Francesco the General Manager.",5,2016,11,07
113,"Great service, but really small rooms","I stayed at the Kensington twice on this work trip.  The first night I had a nice small room.   I checked out and came back two days later and was put in room 116.    I think the room number may have stood for the sq ft.  Basically a bed and my suitcase.  

Some pluses: 
+the gym was very nice
+good location 
+concierge gave great restaurant recos ",4,2016,11,06
113,Very good if large Mr & Mrs Smith hotel,"I book most of my hotels on the Mr & Mrs Smith service. Most are boutique-ey. This is much larger , around 116 rooms I think. Front of house service was very good. Despite being a 3 night stay and booking a superior room with the hope of a Mr & Mrs Smith upgrade, was allocated a disappointing small double. Hotel were very accommodating with my request to change and was given a bigger room. Whilst lovely, I've had a lot better in London for the money and a few signs of age. All in all, the lovely communal areas and super staff left me with a positive memory of the stay. ",4,2016,11,04
113,Minuscule rooms,"We chose the Kensington hotel because of all the positive reviews and it is true the quality of the service is impeccable.
Unfortunately it is not enough to compensate for the rooms... We were first located in a room that I would like to compare to a shoe-box. So tiny it is impossible to be more than one at a time, and no closet space. We asked to be moved and were suggested a slightly bigger room with a terrible non stop Fan noise just outside the window. THe next day, we did get another room with a more convenient size, but with tiny windows very impractical to open so we stayed without any outside light for the rest of the stay. 
The continental breakfast is not extraordinary and the service at this meal is terrible (coffee was ordered when seated, but served at the end of the meal, or not at all...)
The room service and the reception are very efficient and the staff is very kind.
Too bad we will not be staying there again.",3,2016,11,04
113,Love everything about this hotel!,"We stayed for my fianc√©es birthday for one night and we couldn't have asked for a better experience. The staff were fantastic, especially the concierge, including George on the doors. Would stay again",5,2016,11,03
113,A Wonderful Stay at The Kensington,"I stayed in The Kensington on a business trip and it was absolutely great - the staff couldn't be nicer, my room was lovely (and a good size), the common areas of the lobby were so nice - a perfect place to relax, catch up on work, eat a meal or have a drink.  The hotel is decorated well and captures the feeling of an upscale boutique hotel The  location is fabulous - very close to the V&A and excellent shopping.  If I am lucky enough to return to London I will absolutely stay at The Kensington, and I would certainly recommend it to others!",5,2016,11,02
113,wonder hotel,"Good location in south kensington. Lots of restaurants and bars and walking distance. Service is top notch from the Concierge Vincent and George . And the facility in the room is nice, everything was great and we had a lovely time . There is an ipad charger, very ample space, we had enough to open my suitcase. Bathroom is also very cute and complimentary supplementaries There's beautiful smell in the hotel when I first came in, which I really loved, citrus, lavendish flowery scent.",5,2016,11,02
113,Excellent Location,"We stayed four nights at this location.  The staff was friendly and accommodating.  The room was comfortable, although small, but that is typical for London. Great location - short walk to South Kensington station.  Lots of restaurants close by.",5,2016,11,02
113,The smallest room I have ever had,Not far from Chelsea is this string of hotel and I decided after passing by then for 30 years I would stay in one of the better ones . The public spaces are very nice a lovely tea room a good bar a pretty breakfast dining room . Once I got upstairs it was as tiny as a university dorm room yet the total bill was almost 300 pounds for the night . I have been in London hotels numerous times . Everything was there but you had no room to move . If you like a tight space this one is for you ,3,2016,11,02
113,"Boutique yet luxurious hotel, staff genuine and thoughtful!","I stayed at this wonderful hotel before but this is the first time I have rated it. 
I was here for medical reasons and initially put in a smaller yet pleasant room. As soon as the staff found out I would be mostly confined to my room they moved me to a beautiful princess like palace. I almost cried when I saw it as it was simply romantic and beautiful.
The room was quite large, with a grand poster bed laden with thick sheets and a soft comforter. Six people could have fit in this bed! The walls were beautifully decorated and there was enough furniture to seat a family. The bathroom was huge with a television right over the bathtub. I am a clean freak and for a second time, there was not a speck of dirt in this room.
The downstairs is lovely, decorated for a relaxing lunch or formal dinner. Tea looked fabulous but again, I was mostly in my room. That did not stop the wonderful food from being delivered to my room. The breads were amazing, eggs, salads, fruit trays you name it were more than enough for one person. Fantastic cooking staff!
Perhaps the thing that stole my heart the most were the people. The staff were genuine.
They were caring, helpful, everything a hotel should have as my father once owned restaurants and Inns. I did not want to leave this magnificent treasure. 
A huge thanks to Andre, and Audrey and Robert. You are all exceptional people. And finally my prayers and thanks to Melania. You are without a doubt, the biggest asset of this establishment. Also thank you to all the bell boys, including Guido who will get you the safest cabs at the best price.
Finally, this wonderful hotel is situated in a great part of London. My first trip here I was within walking distance to the Natural Museum, Harrods, and dozens of sweet restaurants, boutiques and stores. You are very safe in this area. There is no noise from busy London streets.",5,2016,11,01
113,Lonodn home away from home,"I have now stayed at the Kensington several times and when I arrive it feels like coming home. The front desk staff and the concierge are friendly and helpful and always happy to help. the location in South Kensington is more of a neighborhood and a little less frenetic than staying right in the thick of things in central London, however, the South Ken tube station is under a 5 minute walk and convenient to wherever it is you are spending your time in London. The area around the hotel is nevertheless busy and thriving with excellent bars, restaurants and pubs and other conveniences. Rooms are comfortable and bathrooms modern; rooms are not huge as this hotel is a converted series of townhouses and as a result hallways are also narrow. Fitness facilities are very good and the bar and other public spaces very inviting. ",5,2016,11,01
113,A proper place to stay when visiting London,"We booked the least expensive room, because this was a bit out of our budget. We were treated like royalty. The room was small, but very quiet, beautiful everything. The eating areas were posh beyond belief. Breakfast in front of the fireplace!It doesn't get any better. I wanted to ship the entire bar home. It was gorgeous and the staff, including bar tender were attentive and accomplished at their jobs. Well located, near Harrods and V and A museum, easy tube access. We had their driver pick us up at the airport. He is a treasure. I have nothing negative to say about our experience. We are saving up to go back",5,2016,11,01
113,Very Nice Welcoming Hotel,"Conveniently located a few blocks from the South Kensington tube station. This is a modern, neat and clean hotel with very accommodating and friendly staff. A surprising number of Americans were there when we visited. The rooms were a bit smallish but in line with what you find in larger cities. They had all the amenities you could desire and were always glad to see you and help in any way possible, particularly when you needed assistance finding a location or setting up reservations for dinner or a show. The food was also good. Would definitely return for another stay.",5,2016,11,01
113,Gorgeous,"A gorgeous property. Very elegant and at the same time comfortable. The hotel staff were lovely and helpful, they even gave our daughter a little teddy bear. The rooms though small are well appointed. The location is great.",5,2016,11,01
113,Simply superb,"The beautiful hotel is warm and welcoming. The reception and sitting area in the ground floor is beautiful. Rooms are a tad small and if you have two large suitcases you may have a problem in the room. But the room, the bed and the bathroom amenities of this boutique hotel is very nice. Breakfast is delicious and fresh. Staff are very welcoming and helpful. The location is superb if you want to visit museums and shop. It's good for a walk as well. Taxis are available from just outside the hotel. I loved the music that they played in the lobby and outside. The hotel is very clean too. All in all a great stay.",5,2016,10,31
113,Love this hotel,"So many good experiences here. My client stayed here in 2015 - I visited her and they treated me like royalty. Excellent people skills, real attention to detail. Then I had afternoon tea there - equally lovely. A few weeks ago I stayed for my birthday. I wanted a slightly different room and they did everything to help. This is luxury with a very personal touch. No snootiness and everyone makes you feel like family. Food is good. Afternoon tea is very good. Cocktails fine. Public rooms fab. Bed is sumptuous and bathrooms spacious. I liked it so much. If I could afford it, I would live here....",5,2016,10,31
113,"Lovely hotel, even better staff","My wife and I spent a delightful two nights here on a visit to London for a family celebration. Without exception the staff were superb, helpful, cheerful, attentive and made you feel very welcome indeed. The room , whilst compact, had everything you need, the bed superbly comfortable, the quality of linen excellent, a pleasant place to be. The public rooms are very comfortable and spacious , the restaurant is the same. Whilst we only enjoyed our breakfasts there the quality of food and service was what we had become used to at this hotel. We will definitely return.",5,2016,10,31
113,Lovely Stay at The Kensington!,"We are on our last day of a 7 night stay here at The Kensington. The hotel, location and staff are all fantastic, and we would be very happy to stay on here. The room is a bit small by US standards but very comfortable, clean and quiet. The lobby parlour and bar areas are very pretty,  quaint and comfortable with cozy seating, lighting, fireplaces. Whether for high tea or cocktails, or just sitting to relax, these areas are a perfect setting. There are little porches off the parlour area where you can sit privately as well. The wait staff are top notch - attentive but not intrusive and warm and friendly always. 

This is a beautiful hotel that has achieved a unique understated elegance - balance of 5-star service and setting with a casual ambiance such that you feel at home whether dressed to the nines or in jeans and sneakers for city touring. 

We would definitely come back.

113,Fantastic staff,"I had the pleasure of staying in this lovely hotel last night and was treated with  kindness, attentiveness and respect. It was a relaxing evening after some hectic days of travel and the location in London couldn't be more convenient for me. The quality of the amenities is outstanding as well. I especially enjoyed the cozy bar and was quite impressed that my name was remembered at the front desk after stopping by earlier.  I would love to visit again. Thank you for a memorable stay.",5,2016,10,28
113,Second time,"My boyfriend and me came back here to enjoy our weekend in London and we loved the hotel once again, same charm and good service. The hotel has a new refurbished look from last time and we enjoyed our morning breakfast in a well lit and modern atmosphere. We will come back again soon.",5,2016,10,28
113,The Emperors new clothes ( for lack of a more apt title),"I hope not to make this review rather tiresome, it is my first ever. I mentioned this incident to a colleague while we were having a chat and he convinced me that to not mention a problem is to not give an opportunity for change. I do not see any prospect of this supposed change in the concerned individual but maybe certain corrections can be implemented by the hotel to save someone else this experience.
On a business stay at The Kensington, which was my first and a rather pleasant experience until I ventured to the reception to check if I could have a room with a street facing window. I was just about finished explaining this to the receptionist when i was cut in by the Front Office Manager, Nicholas [-] ( I am writing this from the business card he handed me if in case in a state of insanity i may wish to interact with him again)  It was a simple request that could maybe have been graciously accepted or politely declined, it isn't my first stay in a hotel and certainly not my last. Now to this the gentleman started what he may presume to be a clever explanation but reeked of arrogance and fast turned condescending. For a brief passing moment I had the fleeting thought that i was probably privileged to be staying here in the first place and if by any chance i had neglected that thought, boy was i well informed.

I won't delve into this any further than I have as I hope this is taken as positive criticism. I would hope someone with a fair amount of experience would explain to their staff, some in particular, that there is more than just 2 letters that differentiate aptitude and attitude.",2,2016,10,28
113,Great hotel for a couple of nights,"Booked the hotel of a one night stay. the hotel has a good location and got loads of things in walking distance. We do like walking so distance is relative, but the metro station is a couple of blocks away. The neighborhood is quiet so your stay will be relaxing.

The hotel room although felt to be on a ""corner side"" of the hotel with an awkward  shape was spacious enough, clean, quiet and had everything needed. The bathroom was small but was not a issue. The view from the window due to the rooms location has not the best but again not a problem. The bed was very comfortable which was important!

The rest of the hotel areas like the reception, lounge and breakfast room all very stylish and quiet to relax and have a tea. Breakfast was everything we expected from a hotel like this.

The hotel staff was friendly and polite. We would stay again and we would recommend it to friends.",5,2016,10,27
113,AWESOME,"Second stay at the Kensington and awesome as the first time. Staff is so friendly & attentive to your needs , they treat you like family.

113,Honeymoon in London,"This was our first trip to the Kensington in London.  I came across it via the Doyle Collection, having previously stayed at one of their (former) hotels in Boston.  We've been to London a few times now and were looking forward to staying in the Kensington/Chelsea area.

I booked quite early before our trip and secured a very good price for a King room (¬£179 per night).  I asked for a quiet room on a high floor away from the elevator.  Our room was ready upon arrival and were greeted with champagne and strawberries in our room, a very nice touch.  Our room was located on the fourth floor, away from the elevator which was much appreciated.  The hotel is made up of several townhouses which like the city, are a bit older!  So the floors were a bit loud, you could often hear people walking in the hallways (more so than normal).  This would be my only minor issue with the hotel.  The room was an excellent size, with a large walk-in closet and large bathroom.  The king size bed was also very comfortable.  Free wifi as well helped.

The staff were incredibly friendly, perhaps the most I've ever encountered at a hotel before (and I've stayed at some great ones with great staff).  It was a very nice touch.

We were supposed to receive a ¬£20 bar credit for booking via the Doyle Collection's website, but didn't hear back about it after asking upon check-in and I was too lazy to follow up.

The hotel is conveniently located close to South Kensington and Gloucester Road tube stations.  It's also near to many museums, and most importantly, just a few tube stops from Stamford Bridge where we saw a Chelsea match during our stay.

We absolutely enjoyed our stay at the Kensington and hope to visit again in the future.  I will also be certain to look at more hotels that are part of the Doyle Collection, as both our experiences with them in two cities have been fantastic.",5,2016,10,26
113,first stay and loved it,"It was my first stay at this fabulous hotel in south kensington London and I absolutely loved it, not only because of the food, drink and great room, but also because of your amazing staff who went above and beyond in suggesting and exceeding my request all the time. special mentions to Carolina,Alexandra at the morning breakfast area; George & Martyn from the concierge department, highly appreciated.",5,2016,10,20

113,London Holiday,"My family and I traveled to London to visit our daughter who is studying in England this semester. We arranged our trip through a travel agent who highly recommended the Kensington. He did not lead us wrong. From the moment we walked in, we felt welcomed and highly valued. My baggage was lost coming from the USA and the airline finally delivered it to the hotel. Even though we did not check in for several hours they secured my bag and when I mentioned the ""lost"" bag, they brought it to me immediately. Our doorman Guido and the entire concierge staff were amazing. Breakfast was enjoyable and very relaxing. Thank you for providing us with a wonderful first stay in London. We will be back and when we do, the Kensington is our destination.",5,2016,10,19
113,Loved London again,"The Kensington was very nice - well located, lovely sitting rooms, nice staff.
Room was a bit small - but didn't ask for upgrade.  Bathroom was tiny -
stall shower and sink and toilet very tight.  Evidently there are larger
rooms available.",4,2016,10,19
113,Great Stay,"Stayed In the Kensington hotel, for a long weekend a few months ago.  Beautiful hotel, very friendly and accomodating staff. The room was fantastic.  Love the area. All in all a great Stay!  Will definitely be back.",5,2016,10,19
113,"Exceptional Staff, Exquisite Hotel ","Easily the nicest hotel I've stayed in globally. George and the rest of the staff are flawless in their service, willingness to help and unwavering good cheer! The food is wonderful, but I highly recommend an evening at the bar for cocktails - ask James to make you a Kensington Lavender :)

Pro tip: Business travelers should request a room with a desk as not all rooms have them.",5,2016,10,19
113,Held baby shower at The Kensington,"I held my baby shower at The Kensington over the weekend . The staff were absolutely fantastic , very accommodating and did everything possible to ensure I had a great day . The food & beverage was also excellent. Couldn't recommend highly enough . 5* rating. ",5,2016,10,17
113,Beautiful hotel,"This hotel is gorgeous. The common areas are wonderfully decorated and very welcoming. Check in was quick and easy, and our room was ready early, which is always a relief. The room was small (no surprise for London) but well decorated and quite comfortable. Loved the swanky marble shower, and the nespresso machine. We had no view at all (inner courtyard), but we weren't there to spend time in our room. Our rate included breakfast, which ended up being a little confusing -- we weren't sure what exactly was included, but we asked and figured it all out. There was a diplomat there on the day we departed, so the hotel was filled with security and many official looking people. Also, everywhere in the hotel smelled WONDERFUL, including our room. The hotel is very swanky, and I'd love to stay again!",4,2016,10,17
113,Wonderful Hotel,"My sister and I stayed here in May as part of our London/Barcelona trip. It was an excellent choice of hotel. It is centrally located. Many museums, shopping and eating are within walking distance. Access to public transportation is also a short walk. The room was clean and beautifully decorated. We had afternoon tea at the Townhouse and it was a wonderful experience. I will surely stay here if/when we return to London.",5,2016,10,16
113,The Kensington Hotel,We stayed at the Kensington Hotel for four nights last weekend and this was our third stay. We were slightly disappointed to start with as we had requested preferences which were completely ignored despite receiving an email prior to our stay confirming the preferences. We were finally sorted although we were kept waiting on two occasions wasting our time for the short stay we had in London. However we have to say this is a lovely hotel in a very convenient area for sightseeing London.,4,2016,10,16
113,Lovely Stay,"We had the pleasure of staying at The Kensington for 3 nights.  The hotel is charming and elegant.  The staff was very attentive and friendly.  Our breakfast was very good.  The bar is warm and comfortable.  Our room was small (as expected), but beautifully appointed.  The bed was comfortable.  The only drawback was the lack of space to put clothing.  The hanging portion of the closet was very narrow and there was not a drawer nor shelf space to put items so we chose to live out of our suitcases.  Perhaps the larger rooms have more storage.  That said, I would stay at The Kensington again.",5,2016,10,14
113,Watch the staff ,"I stayed there for 3 nights. Very well located. The restaurant and bar areas were amazingly beautiful. The room was very comfy and perfectly clean. 
The only negative thing was about the staff. I didn't find them so friendly and they were not as professional as they should. 
At the bar, the first cocktail I asked for was a signature of Kensington but they couldn't make it because they were running out of 2 ingredients. Also they couldn't give me wine list because they were changing it so I didn't know how much they'd charge me. I complained as I did want to drink wine for my meal but wanted to know how much I'd pay for it. They finally decided to charge me the lowest price of the old wine list. Not very good for such a big place. 
Apart from that I felt very good over there. 
I guess I can recommend it but make sure you don't let the staff get you in a bad mood.",4,2016,10,12
113,Better and Better Each Time,"I have now made three visits to the Kensington and on each occasion the service and feel of the hotel has improved stay on stay. This isa  very comfortable, traditional English experience from dining ambience to room design. Great service with nice touch of internationalism in the staff. Just love returning to the Kensington",5,2016,10,12
113,Very nice hotel - with fantastic staff and atmosphere,"The whole hotel experience was very nice, from the friendly and knowledgeable staff to the comfort of the room and the extremely nice downstair areas.  We were two adults and a child of 11 who stayed for three nighs. We had plenty of space even with an extra bed in a ""Deluxe Room"". 
The hotel restaurant was very nice, and the staff was very knowledgeable and accommodating when it came to adapting the food for allergies.
The hotel is also situated quite close to several museums, Harrods and Kensington park which is an added bonus. ",5,2016,10,12
113,London visit,"This hotel was great in every way. It's beautiful, its location is perfect, the rooms are decorated prettily, and the staff are just what you would expect for a hotel of this caliber. 
The doorman Gvido and Ronnie, the inside aid knew so much and were able to help us get anywhere we needed to go. 
The breakfast buffet was more along the lines of a typical English breakfast and anything hot needed to be ordered off menu. They had cheese, cold meats, nova, peppers, bread, cereals and some fruits. 
I would recommend this hotel. ",5,2016,10,12
113,Boutiquey hotel with a great location,"Loved this place and would definitely stay here again and/or highly recommend it to friends. Well-appointed rooms (bathroom was a tad small to maneuver around in) with a very friendly, helpful staff. Love that their rooms come equipped with every type of data port/power source option to make it more convenient for international travelers. You simply cannot beat its location and price!",5,2016,10,12
113,Lovely London Experience,"We had a lovely time at the Kensington and were pleased with everything about this stylish, well-located hotel from the front desk staff to concierges who always seemed cheerful and happy to engage. Kudos especially to Melania the manager who went through some trouble to organise a larger, airer room and personally ensure that we were comfortable.  And we were.  Other than the slight inconvenience of having to change rooms, our stay at the Kensington was perfect. Our room rate did not include breakfast which was not a problem given the many available eating options in the area. Restaurants & cafes were open even as early as 8 am. Food-wise we were spoilt for choice. South Kensington is a great location for a visitor with its proximity to beautiful parks, museums within the historic Brompton precinct close enough to the city centre (but a safe distance from the tourist hordes) with its own distinct feel about it. Lovely hotel in a great location. Couldn't ask for more. ",4,2016,10,10
113,"Our wedding hotel, we were so looked afer","We chose the Kensington as my wife to be had stayed there in the past. It was for our wedding night so we chose very carefully. The Kensington delivered. 
Not only is the hotel lovely in its own right, we were spoilt. We were lucky enough to be upgraded (=happy bride) the hotel left bubbles on ice and chocolate strawberries in the room for us, and rose petals on the bed. 
We were treated so well that it made a lasting impression on us.
Thankyou, its these things on top of a gorgeous hotel that make special days truly special. 
",5,2016,10,10
113,"Great ""old world"" London hotel with contemporary ammenities","One the best hotels I've been to in a while.  Charming yet comfortable with everything you'd want in a hotel.  Great location - close to Hyde Park, underground, museums, shops, restaurants, etc. - yet still in a residential-like area.  Staff is great too!",5,2016,10,10
113,Stylish comfortable hotel with friendly staff,"Good location close to the South Kensington tube, museums and neighbourhood restaurants and shops. Hotel was very stylish, loved the d√©cor, relaxing and comfortable. Superior queen rooms are on the small side but have every amenity you would need (e.g. nespresso machine, kettle and most importantly for ladies, a proper hairdryer and cotton face pads). Excellent breakfast with a good range of choice including plenty of quality healthy options. Friendly staff made for a very pleasant stay - in particular Sinead who served us at breakfast with a smile and Chardonnay who resolved an issue we had with our bedroom quickly and efficiently. The first room we stayed in was unbearably warm; we changed rooms and got a much better sleep the second night. Would stay again, especially for the breakfast!",5,2016,10,10
113,Afternoon Tea,"The Kensington is a friendly hotel. Our party of 4 had Afternoon tea in the Townhouse which was airy and relaxed. Our waiter, Sandor, was very welcoming and could not do enough for us. He explained the different courses and teas available and even enquired whether it was a special occasion. Service was efficient and the food delicious. Scones were warm and moist and the sandwiches had generous fillings. There was also a selection of small savouries that were very tasty. Overall, a lovely experience and would certainly visit again.",5,2016,10,09
113,Class act,"I can't say enough wonderful thibgs about this hotel. The location is perfect, a 5 minute walk from the South Kensington tube station, plenty of restaurant options right around the corner. After a long day of being in the city, this place was a much needed sanctuary.

The Kensington is so nice from the many common rooms with fire places on the ground floor and the lovely tiny details. We stayed in a standard room which I actually expected to be smaller, but it was plenty of room. The only draw back to the room is there wasn't a convenient place to put our luggage. But there is central air, the bed was beyond comfortable and the bathroom was roomy and very nice. Ourvroom faced the street and the windows were double paned glass do we didn't hear any street noise. 

The customer service is impeccable and the staff was so friendly. Our favorite place was the bar, it's warm and inviting and we had a drink (or two) there every night. Lucca who runs the bar is a class act, professional but warm and friendly. As well as all of the bartenders and staff. Thank you for such a memorable stay. ",5,2016,10,08
113,In 1990,Stayed at this wonderful hotel in June 1990. Wonderful building. Friendly staff. As usual got into trouble with their in house TV smart box back then....The staff were extremely courteous in sorting out the problem. Great views from their rooms. Real old world charm. Of course my review is from my memory of 1990.,5,2016,10,08
113,Quite lovely,"Very clean, great location, friendly staff and tasty food. There's a Little Waitrose and Tesco Express around the corner if you need small grocery items and a Tube stop within walking distance. My only two criticisms are that when they clean your room for the day, they spritz it with some sort of rose-scented spray that's overpowering after several consecutive days. When I came home and did laundry, my sleeping clothes still smelled of it. Also, when my fiance and I first checked in (around 6:30pm), we had to wait 15 minutes while they checked to make sure our room was ready. Considering check-in had been available for several hours, that room should have already been ready to go. And after being on a plane for 9 hours the least they could have done was offer us a glass of water while we waited.",4,2016,10,07
113,Memorable stay,"Stayed here only one night in a family room.  2 adults and 1 10 year-old.    Location is perfact for museums.
Luxury linens, very spacious and clean. No bath as it was also a handicapped accessible room. 
Room service has options for kids (not a kids menue) like fish and chips and hamburgers. Lovely lobby area and wonderful afternoon tea.
Definitely will stay here next time.
",5,2016,10,07
113,Good Value and stay,"The value can't be beat but it should be known the size and comfort of the bed is splendid, email and follow up communication and flexibility was excellent and I enjoyed the neighborhood plus the building is in a very good location. It was just ample and comfortable for me and I would recommended staying here for longer stays.The hotel is as described and very good value for money I would say, easy to get to London central for the sightseeing, also some really good bars nearby. The hotel has a very laid back and good ambience feel to it. General manager Francesco I believe seemed really nice though I only met him briefly and amongst other staff like George who were also amazing during my stay.",5,2016,10,06
113,Good accommodation if somewhat cramped,"Stayed 2 nights.
Room and bathroom very small however this is London
Bathroom not cleaned well and partially use toiletries not replaced
Dinner in the restaurant on the first night very good with lovely waitress Sinead who was very attentive
Breakfast--not a very good choice. Had to ask for toast",3,2016,10,06
113,Magical stay,"My partner and I stayed one night for her birthday and we had a fantastic time. Upon arrival we were greeted by the fantastic staff and shown to a beautiful room. Very modern, well presented, and clean. We stayed for breakfast, which was out of this world (that smoked salmon, oh my goodness), before exploring the great location.",5,2016,10,05
113,Fantastic Destination,My wife had stayed here the previous year visiting our daughter who was studying abroad. We loved the Kennsington which is a perfect combination of traditional England and the modern era and talked a lot about how we can spend more time there in the future..,5,2016,10,05
113,Absolutely brilliant,Me and my friends stayed at the Kensington hotel for 3 nights and I must say it was absolutely beautiful the professionalism from all the staff was absolutely outstanding I really mean that but the one thing I can take from the trip was the Irish man named dean been honest we actually tried to see if we could ever catch him not smiling and not happy it's just impossible he is a tremendous worker who has great recommendations to suggest to you the menu was just there for show because we clearly didnt need it we listened to all of his recommendations from the king of queens gate cocktail with whisky (I'm pretty sure ) to the vegetable plate to the lovely crisp glass of Albari√±o I just want to say thank you to dean and all the staff thank you so much it was an amazing experience,5,2016,10,05
113,Wonderful place to stay.,"my husband and I stayed at the Kensington recently for 6 nights while we vacationed in London. Great location, great place.... Couldn't have been any nicer. Friendly staff, clean room, nice attention to detail. Hands down would again stay here with breakfast included.....what a beautiful presentation that tasted as good as it looked. Morning breakfast staff of Sandor and Barbara helped  make such a wonderful pleasant start to our day. It's the ""little things"" that make a difference and this place 
""gets it!"" Love the coffee in the rooms and the sparkling water with the turn down service/",5,2016,10,04
113,"Lovely Hotel, Great Staff!","The doorman who greeted me by name, the incredibly friendly staff, the delicious food in the restaurant with huge breakfast spreads, and convenient location made my stay at the Kensington Hotel an incredible experience.  The neighborhood is safe with plenty of restaurants and shops within walking distance.  The tube station is located just a short walk from the hotel.  I highly recommend this hotel!  ",5,2016,10,04
113,The Amazing Kensington Hotel London ,"We stayed at The Kensington Hotel for 7 days, a huge thank you to GM Francesco and his staff for their excellent service and contributing to a memorable holiday in London. 
The location of the Hotel is perfect, surrounded by great restaurants and shopping, easy access to public transport- what more do you need to explore London. 
We will be back .

113,Special,"Stayed at this hotel with friends for a concert at the albert hall, we enjoyed ourselves throughout the entire stay, The hotel facilities are up to the standard, great lobby area, modern european restaurant and bar, fitness gym on the basement. We also liked 
 that the wifi was free and fast and we could use the business center as much as we pleased without the extra charge. I want to thank Vincent, George,Elisa and Martyn for all their attention and expertise.",5,2016,10,04
113,My Short lovely experience,"The hotel is amazing, full of character and quirks. I stayed for a day and it truly felt like home by the end of my short say, Thank you Cillian and Alexandra for a filling breakfast.  The area is well worth exploring, sadly I had injured my ankle so was limited to just the immediate neighborhood. However there are still some great places a few mins walk from the hotel, there‚Äôs  an interesting italian Wine shop on the corner - vini italiani which was my favorite, many great restaurants, and places to drink.",5,2016,10,04
113,"Unparalleled service in a charming, upscale hotel","This hotel exceeded my expectations on so many levels, I couldn't skip writing this glowing review. The Kensington is the perfect combination of classic and modern. Most notably, the staff offered such personalized service that will no doubt have me speaking fondly of this hotel until the next time I return. I was greeted by name by most staff I encountered making the hotel feel more like a home for my long work-week. They made every effort to make my stay comfortable and responded immediately and thoroughly to any request. (Numerous staff members deserve accolades from my week's stay, including the new bartender, George, whose warm demeanor and above and beyond attention to detail and comfort was superb, the lovely maid who managed to quietly tend to my room while I was stuck inside on business calls, and a very sweet Spanish-speaking waitress who provided impeccable and friendly service). Location was perfect yet still quiet. Great gym facility.

The only downside was the size of the room. London hotel rooms can be quite small, and this was no exception. For all of the comfort of the hotel, while the room was nicely appointed, if you intend to do anything apart from sleep (it was so tiny I had just enough room to walk around the bed and unfortunately I spent a majority of my time in the room working during the day) you'll find it less than ideal.

I'm looking forward to my return to London, no doubt to the Kensington (but will give more attention to my room type), and am already referring my closest of friends...",5,2016,10,04
113,Top Class Hotel with a personal feel,"Stayed at this hotel for a business meeting. It's beautifully decorated, excellent location and really quiet. It has a very personal feel and manages to avoid the big hotel chain generic formula.
It's a comfortable place to stay.",5,2016,10,03
113,Good value for money ,"Have stayed here on more than one occasion. The bar offers a great selection of cocktails and has a great atmosphere. The hotel itself is very attractive. The rooms are clean and despite the location, it's possible to get a good nights sleep here. My only issue would be that I was served undercooked pancakes on one occasion but, for the most part, the quality of the food is good. ",4,2016,10,03
113,Long weekend in London,"Really loved the Kensington hotel, especially the beautiful lounge area. The room was nicely decorated and very comfortable. Personnel was helpful at all times. George was great and he also took some amazing pictures for us :)",5,2016,10,02
113,Long weekend in London,"Our 2 day stay in this hotel was relaxing. We were there for a 2 day westend show weekend and our hours were long exploring everywhere. The hotel is quietly located, yet convenient to many destinations. The hotel itself was comfortable. Its not formal, so it was very welcoming. The room had everything we could need, even coffee and tea. The hotel  has fast and free wifi and the lobby area downstairs has enough space for everyone to relax. We highly recommend.",5,2016,10,01
113,Opulent hotel and hospitable staff,"This is a really family oriented and personal hotel, All staff were enthusiastic, social, independent, open-minded and they treated every guest like their families, which we greatly appreciated. They did very delicious breakfast with different flavors every morning. special mentions goes to Martyn and George at the front and Anna the breakfast hostess. The atmosphere of the hotel made us comfortable 3 times. I love the environment around the hotel also, the hyde park is a nice place to relax only several blocks away. Portobello road Market, french restaurant, japanese restaurant are also nearby. It is a good place to relax and enjoy life.",5,2016,10,01
113,Nice and luxury,"we stayed here at this beautifully designed hotel in south kensington London, The hotel was very clean with a few outlets to sits outside, our room was small but very luxurious and we loved every bit of it. The amenities in the hotel were first class and the restaurant served fresh made breakfast. overall it was a lovely stay in London and we really recommend the hotel.",5,2016,10,01
113,a lovey stay and hospitable staff,"The hotel kensington is a charming and well maintained hotel, my girlfriend and myself checked in around 3pm and we received a warm and polite welcome from the doorperson to the receptionist. Our room was ready and we unpacked really quickly and headed straight for the bar downstairs but instead of enjoying vodkas and martini's we opted to try the afternoon with champagne and it was all very lovely. Our room was spacious enough for the both of us for a weekend in London and we truly appreciated the hospitality from each and every member of staff who made feel so welcomed specially Cillian,George, Sima, Martyn and Rafael. The hotel is situated between queensgate and brompton road which was easy to get to hyde park via queensgate and if we wanted to do a little bit of shopping there was harrods at a stone's throw away and we loved this factor about it.",5,2016,10,01
113,Fabulous stay,"Wonderful location and amenities. Hotel is luxurious but European in feel. The staff are amazing- so competent and welcoming. The concierge was especially helpful and made our trip memorable. The only downside was lack of wardrobe space so we had to ""live"" out of our suitcases.
",5,2016,09,30
113,What everyone should strive for,"I could write reams of pages of accolades for the Kensington hotel, but I'll be concise and applauding as I can without babbling on.  

As I walked up the steps a smiling bellman greeted me.  Took my bags and immediately made me feel like the hotel was specifically awaiting for me...it was 10:15am and I'd arrived much earlier than expected.  
I was able to check in right away.  Fantastic !

Led to my room by one of the staff, each amenity was pointed out, room temperature adjusted to my liking and another resounding smile as he wished me a good stay.  

The bed was king sized and wrapped it's arms around me.
The amenities in the room covered everything you can think of and all of those you haven't.  
Evening turn down service had me find chocolates on my pillow and I'm certain my first nights stay had housekeepers efficiently tidy my room and leave it crisp and new at least 3 times.  

The food and professionally made cocktails from talented mixologists in the K lounge is a whole other review.   

The Kensington hotel is a treat, a delight and an experience all hospitality workers should have so they can fully understand what service, style , grace and quality really are founded on.  

",5,2016,09,29
113,A luxurious hotel,"A great lobby, bar, etc.,very friendly and helpful staff, but ultimately an old London building. Our room was OK and reasonably quiet, but the facilities are not quire up to the standards of a modern hotel building,  The price  was right and if you look for a hotel in London/Kensington, probably no bad choice. The breakfast was good and in enjoyable setting.",4,2016,09,28
113,THE place to stay in the Museum area of London,Our family group of 10 relaxed at The Kensington for a 4 night stay while touring the sights of London. It is walking distance to a number of museums and closely located to train and bus routes. It is a short walk to Gloucester Avenue with a variety of pubs and quaint restaurants. The hotel staff was upbeat and so helpful. The bar and restaurant are was clean and food was great with resonable prices,5,2016,09,28
113,Afternoon Tea for birthday celebration,"A bright, clean, comfortable and stunning location, with excellent customer  service, and a beautifully created savory and sweet selection.  A lovely experience and highly recommended. Definitely value for money.",5,2016,09,26
113,Lovely stay for our 1st Wedding anniversary ,"We have just returned from 1 night at The Kensington to celebrate our wedding anniversary and we will
definitely be returning in the future. Lovely location, staff are all extremely helpful and Hotel has a lovely ambience.  We ate breakfast at the townhouse restaurant inside which was delicious. Staff stored our bags for the whole of the day after we checked out so we could really enjoy ourselves. Other reviews have said the rooms are small but ours was not, great size with a 4 poster bed and lovely bathroom with bath, separate shower, separate toilet and twin sinks. Coffee machine also in room.",5,2016,09,26
113,Amazing hotel in a beautiful area,"We stayed for a week at The Kensington and loved every minute of it.  Our room was charming and the service was impeccable.  With a convenient location to the underground and restaurants, it was the perfect choice.  The friendly staff accommodated every request from ice delivered to our room each morning to securing taxis to having a scale to weigh our luggage before heading to the airport.  We want to return to London just so we can enjoy another stay at The Kensington.",5,2016,09,26
113,Lovely stay in great location,Really nice stay here. Sweet boutique type hotel. Very friendly service. Proper British amenities. Easy walk to dining and shopping options. Rather small (cozy) room but just fine for two people without a lot of luggage. Lovely covered porch seating to watch the world go by. ,5,2016,09,25
113,Great Stay,We had a very pleasant stay at the Kensington and truly enjoyed our service at the bar with George every night. The food was also delicious! The service was good and our room was a nice size for Europe. ,4,2016,09,24
113,Small room but staff was kind & helpful with great location,"I stayed at The Kensington Hotel for 4 nights. It's allocated in the nice area of South Kensington where a lot of museum are. It's around 5-8 min away walking distance from the tube station. The hotel looks very good outside but rooms are slightly disappointing.   Very small room and even smaller washroom. The hotel front desk staff was very friendly when we arrived, and he immediately arranged us a room at 7AM in the morning. It's such a great help because we flew for 13 hours and we were exhausted. However at the same day afternoon, the staff called and said we need to move our room upstairs because the room we are staying is for another customer. I was not happy with this since no one told me when I checked in. And we already unpacked our luggage. I asked them where I'm gonna stay and the staff said just the same room but one floor upstairs. The arrangement was poor. But after I refused to move the staff was not forcing me to. I had a very nice stay afterwards. But it would be nicer if the hotel price was breakfast included. Otherwise I don't think it's very money worthy.",4,2016,09,21
113,Lovely and Centrally-Located,"This was our first trip to London so being at the Kensington was a great central location. Right around the corner from the Royal Albert Hall, right down the street from Harrod's and within walking distance to Kensington shops and restaurants. The service was wonderful and all of the concierge folks were very, very helpful. We loved the atmosphere of the bar and restaurant. We always received top-notch treatment. The rooms were lovely with beds turned down every night. The breakfasts were great. This is a place we will definitely return to again!",5,2016,09,20
113,Very pleasant,"I stayed here for the first time and I think it is a very good choice. Location is not wonderful for tourists but it is in a very nice residential area close to Hyde Park, to the river and to Chelsea. The lobby and the lobby bar are very nice. Staff was incredibly friendly. The rooms are spacious and cozy. The bar is cool and welcoming. They accommodated my laundry needs out of schedule. Would definitely come back. Breakfast probably not worth it though, somewhat limited on choices.",4,2016,09,19
113,Elegant London Hotel,"We stayed at The Kensington for two nights. Great location, short walk from the tube, close to the museums and not far from The Royal Albert Hall. Modern, well appointed room, quiet. Comfiest bed I have ever slept in. Perfect stay. Highly recommend. ",5,2016,09,16
113,Once again great service and well located,We were upgrade to a lovely suite (122) when we stayed here recently. The room was beautiful with lovely decor and furnishings and had a lovely ensuite bat and separate shower. Breakfast in the morning was very nice. The room being on the main road means it is a bit noisy for sleep.  Service here is exceptionally good with cheery and helpful staff - nothing is to much!,5,2016,09,16
113,A real pleasant surprise,"I am used to booking hotels closer to the lively part of London and resorted to the Kensington because I had to stay close to Fulham. But then....

As you walk in, you find a series of small salons where you can lounge, have a tea or a drink. These are all superbly set up, providing enough privacy but also making you feel that you belong (none of this cold lounge feeling that seems so reign in the boutique hotel world). There was a fireplace in each room adding to the cozy atmosphere. 

I booked my trip through Trip advisor and got immediately upgraded to a gigantic room. Quite unusual for London...  This room was reminiscent, in comfort, to a room at the Dharmawangsa in Jakarta or the Jefferson in DC. We are talking 5 stars here. 

I tried the bar and while found the atmosphere very nice, found the service not friendly. The bar tender was almost rude.

This was fortunately compensated by the excellent breakfast and friendliness of the breakfast room. 

Overall, a great experience and while it is far from the buzzing center, I will undoubtedly go back.",5,2016,09,16
113,Lovely hotel,"Excellent value in London lovely rooms
Only 20 minutes walk to Harrods , would reccomend this hotel if you want to stay
Around South Kensington area.
Staff were very nice nothing was to much trouble
Bedrooms very nice and well kept and the bed was very comfortable.",5,2016,09,16
113,"One of my fave hotels, ever!","LOVED The Kensington Hotel. Yes, the rooms were small, but clean and beautiful. The best part of the experience was the staff. George Ohlden made our stay wonderful from the moment we walked into the lobby for the first time. And one of the concierges, Michael Buckingham, went over and above to help us get show tickets, find good restaurants, etc. We celebrated our anniversary while in London, and they brought a tray of goodies to our room, and we came back that night to find a chilled bottle of champagne. They all knew our names and made our stay very warm and welcome. Location of the hotel was excellent. Loved the cozy couches, chairs and fireplaces.",5,2016,09,15
113,Amazing Service,"We stayed at the hotel for 11 nights and from entering on the first day to leaving the service level was magnificent. The staff went out of their way to make sure eveything was ok and to see if there was anything extra needed. An added sense of humour was a welcome bonus.

The food was excellent at breakfast lunch and dinner, a great selection and first class quality.

Our room was great with plenty of space and a big bathroom.An easy to operate shower, unlike some you experience where you need a comprehensive user's guide.

There is a lovely bar with an extensive selection of drinks, with a special mention of the Negroni.

Location is good with easy acces to Tube etc

As you will appreciate from reading this, I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and will be returning. My thanks to all the staff.",5,2016,09,15
113,Great stay,We had a fabulous week at The Kensington.  Great staff and central to everything.  It is close to the Tube but yet not in the thick of crazy urban warfare when you are ready to go home to sleep.  I want to go back.,5,2016,09,14
113,Not worth the money-rooms tiny,"Really disappointed for the money we paid. Reception & foyer were lovely as was the bar. However the rooms are ridiculously small. We had a deluxe room & rang reception to see if we were in the wrong room. Basically the room comprised of the bed & there was barely room for our suitcase without falling over it (literally). You cannot open the bathroom door properly as it hit the toilet. 
Very disappointed & certainly not worth the money. Would not return.",2,2016,09,14
113,Absolutely our best stay in a London hotel,"The Kensington hotel is fabulous hotel, stayed here for a couple nights with my husband and we had a wonderful time, they created a wonderful setting for our afternoon tea service delivering exceptionally attentive, professional and personal levels of service and I am delighted that this was such a highlight throughout your experience.
George looked after us and went always the extra mile to make our experiences that little more special, when we arrived we were all sweaty and tired and he rushed behind the reception counter and brought us warm towels and refreshing juices from the hotel‚Äôs juice bar, my husband wanted to buy cigarettes later on, that wasn‚Äôt a problem either within a few minutes he was back with cigarettes bought from a nearby shop. Plus many other wonderful requests he assisted us, all with a warm smile.
South Kensington area was fabulous, and we are glad that we chose to stay in this neighbourhood, we had the abundances of interesting and independent restaurants & caf√©‚Äôs, cocktail bars, private members clubs and traditional pubs. We visited natural history museums, kensington gardens, christie's gallery for great art. Great place to stay in kensington london.",5,2016,09,14
113,Fantastic Hotel in Beautiful location,"My mum and I shared a twin room as were staying in London for a shopping trip. From arrival when our bags were collected from our taxi to the welcome drinks from reception we could  not fault the hotel or the staff....who actually make this hotel very special indeed....lovely room, fab location, amazing breakfast....highly recommmend",5,2016,09,14
113,Visit to London,"My stay here was nothing short than excellent, one of my highlights here was none other than your concierge George. He was exceptionally friendly and undoubtedly helpful, he guided me to a lot of spots here in London. I'll be staying here again the next time i come back to London for sure. ",5,2016,09,13
113,A unique hotel with style. ,"We stayed here, recently. My husband on business in the city & for me... a happy & homely place to relax...

The entrance, to the Kensington Hotel, draws you in like a magnet... So warm & welcoming with a character all of its own... A unique hotel with style!!!
It is elegant & 'classy', but casual too. 
The soft subtle tones of the decor blend & help you to feel relaxed & comfortable in your surroundings.
All so clean & neat & perfect. 
So many places to sit... Even a sheltered & cosy outdoor terrace as you enter!
So much care & attention to detail has been given... 
The lounges flow one into another... & then there is the surprise of the warm wood panelled bar.

The well chosen staff are knowledgeable, accommodating & friendly... 
They take an interest in you!
And what beautiful food the chef prepares & so attractively presented. 
Mr Francesco Sardelli, General Manager, who although new in the hotel, 
already 'looks part of the furniture'... And what a 'smiling delight'! 
So unassuming, personable & enthusiastic...
He so capably draws together, into 'the warmth', his staff & hotel guests.

A great deal of thought has been put into everything involved in this successful hotel...

We'll most definitely be back!!!

",5,2016,09,13
113,Lovely Stay in London,"My husband and I had a great time staying at the Kensington hotel. Good location with a quick walk to the tube. Our room was lovely and always smelled amazing - and I am very sensitive to perfumes so I was really surprised that I loved the smell of the hotel. The lobby, restaurant and bar are beautifully decorated and just really nice places to sit and have a drink.  The bar had really good drinks and the restaurant was delicious.  We never heard any noise from our room.

The only negative thing I would say is that one night at the bar we noticed that only our bartender was working while the other bar staff were not helping at all. He was a sweet Irish kid who was working his tail off while the other staff talked amongst themselves.  I could tell he was ""in the weeds"" and needed some help. He, however, was great. He recommended drinks and made them perfectly.  

Most of the other staff during our stay was really lovely. Especially Luca who was our waiter when we eat at the restaurant.",5,2016,09,11
113,Amazing and Absolutely Lovely,"All of the staff was wonderful - the doorman, the concierge, the front desk, the restaurant.  Very friendly and excellent customer service.  Offered hot towels upon check-in, which is a very nice touch, especially for the overseas travelers.

Neighborhood is great - in walking distance of various museums, restaurants and shopping.  The South Kensington station is just a 5 minute walk from the hotel.

Had a lovely late night dinner in the hotel's restaurant, Town House - the ambiance was perfect and the staff was great.  It was like being in a elegant and cozy library - books on along the back shelves, a lit fireplace, and comfy chairs and couches instead on regular dining chairs.  Looking out the window and the background jazz music made it feel like we were back in the 1920's.

Had a great stay and would definitely come back - thank you!",5,2016,09,11
113,Lovely hotel overall ,"Lovely welcome by the reception staff who were friendly and efficient. Spotless room - it was very small but only to be expected in central London. Doorman always acknowledged us and asked if we needed anything .  The only let down (apart from the ordered newspaper not being delivered) was the service at breakfast. We had to queue for some time and then wait a long time for tea and coffee. Then an even longer wait for somebody to take our order. We did mention it and were told it was busy. It really wasn't that busy with loads of empty tables, they just weren't being cleared. However, overall it was a very nice hotel with excellent staff and I would definitely return .",4,2016,09,11
113,Quiet elegant hotel in central London,"We come to the Proms frequently and have always stayed at an hotel near the V&A.Last time we found it a bit noisy so we cast around for another hotel and from reading reviews we lit upon The Kensington.We did not start off too well as when we arrived at 2.30 our room was not ready (check in time is 2.00).However,after a short wait in the comfortable lounge we were taken to our room and offered a free drink in the bar for our inconvenience.The room was spotlessly clean but appeared a little on the small side.(Other reviewers had made mention of room dimensions).However,as we were staying the night(3 actually) in the room and not living in it,being on the small side is not a problem-all you really need is cleanliness,quiet and a comfortable bed.These three you will get at the Kensington.My wife was so taken with the pillows,she had a look at the label to see where she could get some!The bed was just as comfortable.As for being quiet,the room was the quietest I have been in in central London.Traffic noise was minimal and the air conditioning was only the very faintest background hum.Most other hotel rooms I have stayed at in London have had such noisy air con that you have to open the windows,and then you get deafened by traffic.Not the Kensington-peace and quiet!The room had all the extras you could want.The only minor criticism I have is that storage space for clothes is a little limited.There is a lack of drawer space for the likes of shirts etc.The bedside cabinets could easily be adapted to accommodate drawers for shirts,knickers etc.
We had also booked the full breakfast.A full English is one my delights on a short holiday.The Kensington does not disappoint here.Cooked to order and all fresh,high quality ingredients.There is also a full continental on offer.As the charming female Italian maitre d would say,""Perfect"".
If you want a quiet,comfortable hotel with a touch of luxury  in this part of London then you need look no further than The Kensington.Highly recommended.
Throughout our stay,all the staff were extremely courteous and helpful.",5,2016,09,11
113,Amazing,"What a beautiful hotel. Everything about it is just gorgeous, however the friendly & efficient staff are what make it so fabulous. Especially George at the front concierge. He is so genuinely interested in your travels and consistently offered a helping hand to make life easier for me, an international guest travelling alone. He recommended a great app that I used daily and always had a smile on his face.
Room & bed was very comfortable. Bar & wine list great! Lovely food. Thank you The Kensington. See you again one day.",5,2016,09,10
113,Perfect Hotel,"I was only here for one night, but loved the hotel, its location, the service, decor, style and class.  This place is as grand on the inside as it is on the outside and the staff and management clearly go to some lengths to make sure that the standards are constantly maintained.  I have tried getting back, but every time I return to London, the hotel is fully booked.  A testament to is popularity, but disappointing for me.  I'll get there again eventually.",5,2016,09,09
113,Gorgeous hotel ,"Recently stayed for a night and what a lovely night it was. Check in was a pleasure and staff couldn't be more helpful, Michael the concierge was a fantastic help to find us a restaurant. The bar have a great selection and lovely staff, The room was spacious and very comfortable, breakfast was great with plenty of choice. Check out was easy and we will be back. ",5,2016,09,09
113,Amazing hotel in the heart of Kensington,"Kensington hotel is Sleek, sophisticated and ultra-luxurious hotel that represents a new level of sophistication. Located in the center of south Kensington  and Chelsea, the iconic views of queensgate and stunning interior appointments must be seen to be believed, are awesome - you won't get better than this! The hotel was a great size for what we needed and access to and from the hotel was secure and easy after sightseeing. We also liked the fact that there were bikes outside the hotel which you could cycle to Hyde Park anytime for free for the first 30 minutes, The staff here are all the foundation of the place, we enjoyed speaking to Michael concierge for his impeccable knowledge of London, James bartender and also George the late night bartender were very hospitable plus everyone else whom we haven‚Äôt mention. We‚Äôd happily stay here again.",5,2016,09,07
113,A lovely and Charming hotel,"This hotel was perfect for solo traveler like me! I got off the train at south kensington station, sat down at a cafe near the hotel to enjoy a cappuccino at cafe nerro which is just a few minutes away! The rooms itself is small but has everything you could need. staff even provided a generous sized water bottle and fruits upon arrival, For me that even added to the experience. Reception, restaurant and concierge staff were all very nice, I would like to specially mention Teodora, Martyn, George and Elisa . The shower worked very well (hot+good pressure) with the glass door pulled out of the shower so there was plenty of space! Only let down was that because I booked last minute I could only stay here for the first 2 nights of my trip, I would have loved to stay the whole time.!!Overall a perfect stay",5,2016,09,07
113,Nice place and great staff,"This is a lovely place in a great location for exploring London. The fireplaces were quite nice too and made this place that much more charming. The staff was very friendly, professional and accommodating upon my arrival and throughout my stay. I was stuck in traffic and made it late to hotel and received a warm welcome from the doorman,bellman and front desk staff which was a bonus.  I would definitely stay here again!!",5,2016,09,07
113,Beautiful setting and incredible staff,Very well appointed and beautifully decorated room. Slightly on the small side but enough space. Lots of nice extras in room too. One of the most comfortable beds i have ever slept in. Very friendly staff who are very happy to help with anything you need. Dinner in the restaurant was absolutely delicious and the service was great,5,2016,09,05
113,Amazing,"Beautiful hotel. Wonderfully attentive staff.

We stayed here for the night of our wedding. They upgraded our suite and we came back to roses, champagne and a message from the guest manager. Lovely touch.

Definitely recommend. ",5,2016,09,01
113,My favorite London place,"Every time I am in London, I come here. Great location, nice staff and delicious food. Yep, and I love  the hotel style, it has its own personality.. not very common thing in nowdays.. I am looking to accommodate myself very soon again..",4,2016,08,30
113,We will be back,"I strongly recommend this hotel. The location was perfect for us, the rooms welcoming and the staff really friendly and professional. The view was great and the food was ok. See you soon! We love London! ",5,2016,08,29
113,Great for London; not an American hotel!,"Things that were really good:  the breakfast was outstanding for London.  Buffet style with waiters who brought hot water.  The breakfast staff were really impressive and responsive.  The room was crazy small but cleaned properly every day.  The front desk staff were professional and responsive.  They have an information desk (apart from the front desk) that was very helpful.  A large bar area, connected to everything, was a nice feature.  Lots of elevators, close to the metro, close to shopping.  Tour busses are a constant feature out front but hotel staff are constantly ""working"" the busses to keep it going smoothly.  lots of taxis out from if that's your thing (no need! use the metro!).  It was expensive (but competitive with other hotels).  No restaurants near but the metro is near so, I guess, everything is near.",4,2016,08,29
113,Absolutely gorgeous,"We recently stayed for a week at the hotel. Its location, amenities and styling were precisely as advertised. Yes, some of the rooms and bathrooms are small (hey, it is London people!), however, it was a small inconvenience and was outstandingly outweighed by the professionalism and warmth of the staff, the superior meals in the restaurant, the delightful breakfast and coffee.
The Kensington Hotel is a boutique hotel in a fabulous location which lends itself to walking everywhere. There is a museum, restaurant and shopping precinct in every direction you turn and the tube is a block away.
The staff without exception have an obvious pride in their roles and it shows.
See you next time.",5,2016,08,29
113,Beautiful cozy hotel,Excellent location in the beautiful South Kensington. Lovely staff however a couple of the ladies at front desk need training in customer relations. Room was very small but lovely. Great food & cocktails served in the restaurant. Stunning Christmas decor! ,5,2016,08,29
113,My stay,"Professional and exquisite. I was very happy with everything. Also a thoughtful touch, they left me a happy birthday note in my room. Peaceful yet very central and a true English experience. Highly recommended.",5,2016,08,28
113,Absolutely fabulous 5* service ,"From the moment we arrived at the Kensington Hotel in Queens Gate, we received top class service. A lovely little touch with a fresh beetroot and mint juice. We had a deluxe room and although the view (room 319) was not great, the room was amazing. The beds were amazingly comfortable - we literally did not want to get out of them. Lots of lovely teas with fresh milk are complimentary, as is the Nespresso coffee machine with capsules provided. Wonderful modern bathroom with lovely aromatherapy smellies. 
We had drinks in the cocktail lounge and they were the best cocktails I have ever had. People seemed to be having afternoon tea and the cakes and sandwiches looked mouthwatering.
The staff cannot do enough for you. Nothing is too much trouble, always with a smile. I forgot my hairbrush, so they went out to the pharmacy to buy me one.
It was my birthday and I could not have chosen a better place to stay. We went to Bumpkin around the corner for late lunch and the food was fresh and delicious and reasonably priced with great selection of wine and cocktails.
The hotel is only a few mins walk from south Ken station where you can pick up the tube or a 74 bus into Oxford street.
I will definitely return and 100% recommend this fantastic hotel.
Thank you so much. ",5,2016,08,28
113,Excellent hotel and Excellent staff,"We stayed here for a wedding at Chelsea Old Town Hall- a few minutes walk away so the hotel was in the perfect location, the hotel was clean and newly renovated and felt like home away from home which was great  plus exactly what we needed. we had a lovely view of queensgate avenue and It was a well catered room with iPad, coffee machine and tea making facilities. The staff were all nice with special mentions to concierges -Vincent, George and restaurant manager Cillian.  I would recommend this place if you are in this area!",5,2016,08,26
113,A classic Kensington address.,"Loved staying right in the heart of Kensington and taking a quiet break amidst the hustle and bustle of London. 

Rooms at the hotel are tastefully decorated and the public areas are a joy to sit in and just read books or newspapers. 

Ate breakfast, lunch and dinner at the hotel and greatly enjoyed every meal. 

Service was impeccable throughout and the staff really go out of their way to make you feel like an individual. 

Would definitely like to return.",5,2016,08,25
113,Brunch at the Kensignton ,"Lovely , lovely place !!!
Service was great and the food was lovely , we had a great rose with a delicious piece of carrot cake among other items.  

We also had the traditional English breakfast 

Eggs , sausage , bacon and toast 
It was ¬£ 24 pounds for the full breakfast and the tea is ¬£35 and ‚Ç¨45 with a glass of champagne 
",4,2016,08,24
113,Beautiful hotel,"This hotel is located in a beautiful area of London with easy access to the Underground, which makes it very convenient to get around. The checkin process was efficient and made you feel welcome. Our room had a nice view of the street with its matching white buildings and flowers in bloom. The rooms aren't large, but by London standards they are above average and we had more than enough room with our three suitcases. The rooms are also well equipped with Nespresso machines and large televisions. We enjoyed our stay at The Kensington and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.",5,2016,08,24
113,Good,"Good location.
Nice room and hotel.
Room a little bit small.
You won't have a bad surprise at this hotel.
A lot of restaurants nearby.
Close to metro station,
Did not try the restaurant as there are many other options near the hotel.",4,2016,08,23
113,Great drinks and venue,Me and some friends were here last week for some drinks and we were all impressed by the warm and progressional service! We ordered different cocktails and all of them were fantastic! The lounge is great..seats are extremely comfy! We will definitely be back!,5,2016,08,22
113,Lovely afternoon tea,"I had afternoon tea with my family last week and it has been a wonderful experience. The food was good and fresh, nice selection of loose leaf teas as well.
The lounge area is very relaxing,lovely sofas and comfy chairs.
The service is really attentive too.
Highly reccommend.",5,2016,08,22
113,JT,"A sumptuous setting for a fleeting visit to savour an evening meal, prior to going onto a concert. It is quite easy to understand the label of 'Luxury' attached to this hotel, as it pampered for your every whim! The meal was quite exquisite, and of course the service afforded was first class. Be prepared to pay accordingly for the amenities offered!",4,2016,08,20
113,High class hotel & High class service,"I had the pleasure and opportunity to stay at the Kensington hotel at the end of May this year. The location is really great and the staff is very friendly. I had an executive suite which was really spacious and had all the amenities one could imagine (including a Nespresso machine with capsule at your disposal). The breakfast was spectacular with a lot of choices.
I really felt like in a Country Club! I can only recommend!",5,2016,08,18
113,"Great Location, Wonderful staff, Exquisite Common Space & bar - small rooms","We stayed at the Kensington for a 4 night stay in late July. Loved the place and more importantly loved the people. George (concierge) and Gvido (bellman) provided us with a caring hand when we arrived and became a key component in creating the joy in our visit... Directions, restaurants, museums, parks, etc. We even captured a picture with them before we departed (couldn't get it uploaded). The Kensington is in a great neighborhood, just a short walk from the South Kensington station. We had incredible pastries around the corner, perfect pubs within walking distance in all directions (Anglesea & Arms, Hereford Arms, and Duke of Clarence) and fantastic restaurants (Bumpkin, Rocca and De Maro). Now, our room was small, but really who cares? We also waited too long to book a High Tea at one of the recommended places in the area, so we had it at the hotel. We were disturbed by a rude family with their loud kids on their ipads, but we moved and still enjoyed it. It was a little pricey, and we could have probably had one serving for the both of us. Lots of food. Alexander was a great server. He and his colleagues work in the bar too and do a great job. Terrific craft coctails. In the end, We gave London our all and the Kensington provided us with a Proper Roof over our heads and terrific people! Well Done Kensington, Well done!",4,2016,08,16
113,Wonderful time in London!,"We enjoyed our stay at The Kensington hotel during our first visit to London. We were booked at this hotel by our travel agency and we are very happy with the choice. We arrived in London at 6:30 AM  but we were happily accomodated by the staff and were able to check in at a much earlier time of 1 pm. Our family enjoyed the elegant breakfast buffet  and were attended to  by a wonderful staff.  The hotel is located in the beautiful area of South Kensington , and is but couple a blocks away from the very popular Museum of Natural History, The Science Museum , and the Victoria and Albert Museum.  A bit further down the road on Queen's Gate is the Kensington Palace and Gardens.  The South Kensington Underground station was also within walking distance to the hotel.  A grocery store is conveniently located round the corner , and there are lots of good places to eat around the hotel as well. ",5,2016,08,16
113,Wonderful,"We stayed at The Kensington Hotel for the first portion of our Honeymoon. We absolute loved the hotel! The lobby area is so cute and our room was beautiful!! We were updated to a studio suite, which was a great size. The Bathroom was spacious and gorgeous with a clawfoot tub. We also LOVED the bed. I've seriously never been more comfortable in a hotel. There also had a great coffee maker in the room with little cookies.

Location wise, it couldn't have been better. It was off the main road but so close to South Kensington tube station. We loved the little restaurants on the road right next to the hotel, including Bosphorous kebab (spelling?).

We plan on staying at this hotel any time we return to London.",5,2016,08,16
113,"Nice room, but continuing service problems","Our deluxe king room was fine, but we had continuing service problems. Room was not ready on arrival at 2 pm. When we asked at reception to have the afternoon tea included in our package, we went into the lounge and were given only a cup of tea.  The waiter explained that the people at the reception desk didn't know the difference between afternoon tea and a cup of tea. We then had to wait 30 mins to get the afternoon tea we wanted.  

Other service problems: Housekeeping: dirty rag left in bathtub; hand towels not replaced; turndown erratic -- one night at 10pm (much too late), another night  6:30 (much too early); bill at checkout had additional charges for the breakfast included in our package and had to be removed.

The concierges were quite helpful on several occasions.",3,2016,08,16
113,Fun in London,Our first time in London and we really enjoyed staying at the Kensignton. Staff was all very helpful and friendly. Wanted to make sure you as a guest had all your  needs meant. We chose this hotel because of rating on tripadvisor and it did not disappoint.,5,2016,08,16
113,always a pleasurable stay,"I have stayed at The Kensington at least 10 times, and I always come away satisfied. Service quality is outstanding, building and rooms represent a casual/traditional style that makes you feel at home. Excellent bar as well",5,2016,08,16
113,A divine delight,"Less than 24 hours later, I find myself already yearning for the polite opulence of this magnificent hotel. My purpose in London was to watch a BBC Prom - the Royal Albert Hall being a short, yet pleasant stroll - and thus I only stayed for one night; this, however, was sufficient to sample part of the hotel's mesmerising flavour.

From arrival to departure, the hotel's staff were absolutely astonishing, from the cordial and informative receptionists, to the maids and their sweet touches, such as refreshing my room while I watched the prom. The guest is made to feel luxurious; each staff member I encountered lacked any insouciance and seemed entirely sincere. 

Unlike some other posters here, the superior room I stayed in was adequate in size. Any disappointment derived from a blas√© view was quickly defeated by the lavish furnishings and the room's scrutiny for sophistication; the air-conditioning, marble bathroom and facilities were a delight. 

The breakfast, which I had preordered, arrived promptly and was delectable, though there was admittedly not enough toast - one slice, which tasted more like fried bread - to properly appreciate the dainty collection of preserves. While I may be mistaken in thinking the fried bread was toast (if it were not, though I did order toast), two slices would have been preferable. Nevertheless, the rest was delectable. 

The only other thing that bothered me was there being no sparkling water offered, along with the current still, at check-out. I hope you can grasp how minor the issues are at this establishment. 

In conclusion, this heartwarming hotel is wholly recommended for the solo traveller, its location being one of London's finest and its employees, in my opinion, one of London's finest endowed. 

Undoubtably 5/5 stars. ",5,2016,08,15
113,Lovely Stay,"Charm, comfort, politeness, great food, very friendly and accommodating staff. That describes our stay at the Kensington! Carolina, Elisa, Ronnie, Martin, Vincent, Michael,Oana, Awo, Guido - the best!",5,2016,08,15
113,"Great location, nice experience",We had a couple of friends visiting from Canada and we joined them for a coffee in the lounge before going to the museums together. Good quality coffee and great service. We were very well taken care of although we did not stay in the hotel. Will recommend.D&A.,5,2016,08,15
113,Great location and excellent service!,"My daughter and I visited London for the first time with friends to explore the city and The Kensington was the perfect hotel choice for our visit. It's located on a beautiful street in South Kensington near the underground and excellent
Restaurants. We would definitely stay there for our next visit. ",5,2016,08,15
113,"Business meeting, dinner and drinks","Met a business colleague at the hotel for dinner and drinks, food was excellent and service, I couldn't see how they could've done more for us ! went for cocktails afterwards had an negroni that was a speciality to this particular hotel, was probably the best I've ever had, only issue now is the disappointment I will feel when having cocktails at a lesser venue. Overall feel to the place was exceptional couldn't recommend it more highly.",5,2016,08,15
113,Miss ,"Lovely hotel,  lovely stuff,  excellent customer service!!Great location,  comfy bedsWe,  great common areas with excellent taste. We already are  planning to come back for another weekend in October!! Five stars ‚ú®

113,Fraudulent,"Nice hotel, small cramped badly equipped rooms, lousy service, no line of communication or management. I was handed a bill that was ¬£700 out, don't use it, the first manager tried to defend it the soc became embarrassed and apologetic I felt they are utterly corrupt and dihonest.",1,2016,08,14
113,Great location - Small Room,"At the end of July we spent three very pleasant nights at The Kensington.  This is a first class hotel with all of the amenities and fantastic service.  If there is one downside it is the size of the rooms and the limited views (at least from our room and the other couple we were traveling with).  Our room was small at least compared to what we were considered the American standard.  We only had a few if we craned our necks to the left and looked through the space between the buildings.  It was billed as a Superior room and we paid over $1000 for the three nights.  I guess we had higher expectations although this may be the norm for a room in the best neighborhoods of London.
   We had not one complaint about the hotel staff.  They were all well trained and extremely helpful.  I will single out our concierge, Martin, or was always ready with a map and a recommendation.  An extremely pleasant fellow who we enjoyed meeting and speaking with.  The public spaces of the hotel are light and airy.  We had the included full breakfast in  a beautifully appointed restaurant with more food choices than any one person can absorb.  The neighborhood itself, Kensington, was magnificent.  The building architecture was a pleasure to behold and it was a short walk to the South Kensington Underground station, convenient for starting the days activities.  It is also a short stroll to Harrod's world famous department store where my wife spent way too much time.
   If you're not planning on spending a lot of time in your room anyhow, The Kensington will absolutely fit the bill.  The bed was comfortable and the AC worked admirably on a hot day in London.",4,2016,08,14
113,Gorgeous with a Great Location,"I would give this hotel four and a half stars if thate were an option. It is in a fabulous location, near the underground as well as museums and restaurants. The public areas are stunning....exactly my taste as far as decor. The staff is helpful and kind, really wonderful. I loved arriving at the hotel and seeing the gorgeous lobby. Having a drink near the fireplace was lovely.

We had two rooms...one was for our three children and it was perfect. Spacious and well laid out, with fantastic closet space. Our room ( my husband and I's) was quite, quite small. So small that it was difficult to walk around! The closet was big and the bathroom was modern, but both in our bathroom and the kids' , there was drainage issues, making it flood sometimes. The toiletries were very nice. 

We had sent two emails requesting rooms close to each other ...and ended up on floors 3 and 5, on opposite ends. A bit disappointing. I also found the service in the breakfast room to be lacking...we waited for a long while to get coffee and juice, we were a bit ""forgotten"" the day we decided to have a special breakfast there. 

Overall, we were very pleased with the hotel. Some little details could be improved, but it is wonderful in many ways. I would stay there again .",5,2016,08,13
113,"Friendly staff, great location","The only thing that can be bettered is the decor and size of rooms. A superior bedroom should not feel like a broom closet and the bathroom was far too small.
Otherwise, this hotel is really comfortable, friendly and the food is good. The bearkfast is too expensive, but it is good!",4,2016,08,13
113,outstanding service in the k bar,"i just want to honestly tell everybody how much of an experience last week was upon my arrival the hotel was beautiful lots of smiling faces, everybody was in a good mood but i just want to comment on the one face me and my wife Cathy remember the most it was the young Irish guy called dean in the bar this gentlemen is an absolute credit to the hotel he is so good at upselling that the night we were in the k bar we didnt even need to see the menu i had a beautiful whiskey Dean recommened and my wife had what she called the best gin and tonic she has ever had. He then made sure that we were always okay he also served us some bar bites which were absolutely amazing the chorizo burger and the prawn ravioli, i just honestly want to thank Dean and all the staff at the kensington for a reallly and truely memorable experience thank you.",5,2016,08,11
113,Needs maintenance and very small,"Found The Kensington on a few sites, mid-priced ($280/nt) but with good reviews.  Lobby and ambience are very nice, location is good mid-London.  But, for the price, the rooms are quite small and there are consistent problems.

The rooms feel like they belong in New York.  My ""superior"" queen had no closet, and a small armoir with no drawers as they had been used for the mini-bar and safe.  Literally nowhere to put a small stack of clothes.  The bathroom had barely enough room for my shoulders (I'm a 44 jacket), and in the shower, quite literally,  my shoulders touched the walls.  It was very uncomfortable for one, and you couldn't have your spouse in the bathroom at the same time.

When I arrived, I brushed my teeth, and the water didn't drain in the wash basin.  I called downstairs, no one was sent.  The next morning, I reported it and was told it would be handled.  When I arrived back at the end of the day -- water was gone.  Except it wasn't fixed, just drained.  Every time I add water, they need to come to the room to drain it.  Never got fixed.

Also, They use some type of cleaning spray that has a very strong scent.  I've never noticed this elsewhere, and I'm not particularly sensitive to these things, but in my room it was over-powering, almost to the point of my leaving the hotel.  At first I thought it was my room, but it turned out to be used all over the hotel.  Very annoying and they should switch.

The hotel is classified luxury, but that is a reach.  It's more of a nice boutique.",3,2016,08,11
113,Awesome,"I've stayed here 5 or 6 times. It is great, great, great. It is very English. The bar is my favorite hotel bar in London. The breakfast is solid and reliable. The lobby is a great place to read the morning paper or have a drink at the end of the day. And the food is surprisingly good by any standard. 

",5,2016,08,11
113,Short Vacation in London,"Great location and very well kept small hotel with very friendly staff. They offer you mulled wine and baked goodies at the lobby every day during December. The hotel is quiet and the rooms are small (but spacious in London standards). It's perfect for those who need a central London location, clean and friendly stay without enormous hotel spending budget. 

We ran into Russell Brand at the hotel lobby!",5,2016,08,10
113,Pleasant hotel in a great location,"Located near the Kensington Palace and park and within walking distance of the V&A and numerous embassies, this hotel has a lot to offer.  The exterior lobby, which features a lovely black/white and green decor, is worthy of a magazine photo shoot.  The rooms are small (as are many in London) but well appointed and comfortable.  Importantly, the rooms are clean and fresh smelling. We had an in room espresso maker, along with a plush bathrobe and aromatherapy bath products.  All nice touches.  An umbrella was also in the room, for those inevitable London rainy days.  The hallways are narrow which can translate into 'in room noise'.  Breakfast offerings at the hotel include a nice continental buffet, which met our needs.  We had no issues during our stay.  Overall, a very pleasant hotel.",4,2016,08,10
113,A lovely memorable experience.,"This was one of the best overall travel hotel experiences i have ever had.  I was traveling with my 16 year old daughter. The staff were exceptional, the room beautiful, breakfast delicious.  It was an exceptional experience.",5,2016,08,08
113,"Beautiful hotel in a lovely location, if only the bathroom had been bigger than a microdot.","This is a really lovely hotel, most elegantly appointed, and in a lovely location on Queen's Gate in South Kensington.  The staff were very helpful and well-informed, and the breakfast was delicious.  Overall a great experience, except for the fact that the bathroom, though very well appointed, was just too small to get around in with any ease at all.  The room was not that big either, but acceptable for central London, which was not the case for the bathroom.  Perhaps, when booking, inquire about how big the bathroom is.",4,2016,08,07
113,Our stay at the Kensington,"My husband and our children stayed at the Kensington for five days and we were very pleased with everything, especially the staff. Our waiter was Dean, his friendliness and attitude made our stay that much better! He was extremely professional and very polite and accommodating (plus he had really cool hair). I am very pleased with my experience.",5,2016,08,06
113,Perfect Family Vacation,"Our family of 4 spent 4 nights in a family room in July 2016.  The hotel was everything we hoped it would be.  We desired a smaller family-friendly type of hotel and it lived up to our expectations.  The staff were all extremely friendly and very accommodating.  We arrived from the US before noon (the hotel even helped me pre-plan a car service to/from the airport) and even though our room wasn't ready, they put together a very good breakfast for us even though I'm pretty sure they weren't serving it anymore.  The room was extremely comfortable for the four of us.  The location of the hotel was great.  It was convenient to the underground and was in a quiet area of the city.  In terms of food, we had good experiences eating within the hotel during our stay.  We did a late room service one night (after a full day tour didn't get us back to the hotel until very late) and the food was excellent.  We had one dinner in the bar and one in the dining room and they were both excellent as well.  We had one breakfast in the dining room and that too was great.  Overall we were very pleased with our choice to stay here and would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2016,08,05
113,Very nice,"The hotel is in obviously in Kensington which is a beautiful part of London and very safe.  Very upscale and lots of restaurants in the area to choose from.  It is a 2 minute walk to the tube and a few stops from Picadilly and the main tourist attractions.  It is about 30-40 minute walk to these sites.  So if you plan to walk everywhere, there are probably closer neighbourhoods to choose from.  The hotel is very nice, the lobby and dining/bar area is beautiful and very quaint.  Yes the rooms are unbelievably tiny by North American standards but welcome to London..:)  The staff is excellent, our concierge was extremely helpful and spot on.  Would definitely go back.",5,2016,08,05
113,Fantastic stay in London,"My husband and I stayed here for four nights in June and had a wonderful experience.  The staff was incredibly accommodating, pleasant and helpful. They were always happy to help, no matter how small the issue.  We got the basic room and didn't find it to be that small, although certainly smaller than American hotel rooms.  The bathroom is amazing and my husband declares the shower the ""best he's ever had.""  Lovely toiletries, and from a local shop. There are plenty of good restaurants within walking distance, and it's very close to several museums, Harrod's, Hyde Park and Kensington Palace.  A great location for feeling a part of London without being mobbed by tourists.  We would definitely stay here again in London, it was a fabulous experience!",5,2016,08,04
113,Mommy daughter trip to London,"The Kensington was such a wonderful hotel.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The hotel was charming and although we only ate breakfast there, it was very good!  Seeing the other photos I wish we had a few more meals there!  The hotel is in a great area, not far from the underground stations.  There were 3 museums close by that I wish we had time to explore them but it was such a quick trip we didn't have time.  Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone.  What a great experience!",5,2016,08,04
113,Excellent service and food in a well appointed room.,"The room was small as one would expect in London, but very well appointed and clean.  The staff was excellent and even carried drinks to my room for me when I ordered some from the bar for my wife and I at night to take them back to the room.  We had breakfast included in our stay, which was delightful.  The traditional English breakfast was very well done and the continental buffet was sizable including fresh fruits, yogurt, cheeses, meats, cereals, and breads.  The concierge was very helpful as well booking reservations and providing recommendations as we needed.  Wireless internet was complimentary and there were two computers and printers in the lobby that were free of charge.  They did have multiple outlet types (UK, Europe, and US) in our room, although we still used an adapter because we had multiple US plugs to charge phones, etc.  Our room had a standard hotel safe and bottled water, tea, coffee and biscuits to enjoy daily.  There was a workout facility in the basement with a large TV, ellipticals, treadmills (I believe two of each), a weight machine, and some floor space/mirror to do other workouts.  They had water and towels there as well.

The hotel is conveniently located about 2 blocks from the South Kensington tube stop, which can quickly take you to any part of London and is extremely close to the majority of the museums.

We flew into London in the morning and they had our room ready for us when we arrived about 9am so we could freshen up before heading out for the day!  We would gladly stay at this hotel again.  Everything we would want in a hotel, although as mentioned, the rooms were a bit tight with us having a double bed in our standard room.",5,2016,08,03
113,Highest level of customer service,"Could not fault this extremely welcoming hotel in any way , customer service was on the highest level , hotel had great ambiance and location was ideal for South Kensington tube station. Lots of very nice restaurants and bars within walking distance. Will definitely use this hotel again when visiting London.",5,2016,08,03
113,an absolutely delightful stay ,"A two night stay at this hotel wasn't enough to appreciate it fully. The staff were extremely welcoming, very friendly and really gave the hotel a warm atmosphere. 
We enjoyed some of the tastiest scrambled eggs on toast and thoroughly appreciated their particularly well made espresso martinis. Somewhere we would visit again for sure. Big thanks to Dean in the restaurant for making our last evening so enjoyable. ",5,2016,08,03
113,"Incredible staff, Incredible stay. Faultless!","We wanted to stay as close to Wimbledon as possible, but still within easy reach of Soho and surrounds. The Kensington was an ideal base to take in the finals. The hotel was decked out, very well, with Wimbledon themed decorations, but didn't over do it. There was a lovely pop up bar, which had some great Nyetimber - which we love. 

We've known Simon for a while, and it was nice to see some familiar faces. Though, to be honest the hotel greet and treat everyone like a friend. 

We had drinks in the bar while we waited for our room to be ready and when we were taken up it was a lovely room ample space, super comfortable bed, great bathroom and a few treats. 

For me, I really like to be in a quiet room, and always like to book a top floor, we were on the 2nd and had no issue with noise from above. The other pleasant surprise was an air-conditioning unit that did what it said on the tin. Cooled when it was too hot and heated as necessary. It's surprising how many places get this wrong! 

The website will give you ample pictures of how great the place looks, it really does look great. It's tasteful and well done, and more importantly you feel at home and at ease. 

Breakfast is great. Lots of choice and served in a lovely setting. The juice bar is a nice addition. The bar serve great cocktails, and becomes a nice spot to have a night cap later on. 

The staff make this place, and give it the edge. Simon has always built a great team, and there is no exception here. 

I have a feeling this will become our base when we are in London! Stay there you'll love it as much as we did.

113,Amazing!,"We were in London last Saturday for a friend's birthday and decided to stay at The Kensington. What a beautiful hotel! There was plenty of free (at weekends) parking right outside and as we checked in we were given warm flannels to refresh up. We then found a hand written note and a bowl of fresh fruit in our room, welcoming us to the hotel; small touches but they really added to the experience. The room itself was stunning, with a beautiful 4 poster bed, air conditioning and wonderful views. There was an incredible selection of fresh pastries, breads, cheese, meats etc at breakfast, served in an elegant drawing-room style restaurant. The full English which was perfect! We walked to Knightsbridge on Sunday morning, and the hotel's very close to the Natural History/V&A museums too. It was really handy to be able to leave our car outside the hotel until we left that afternoon. A lovely hotel with friendly staff who made us feel really welcome; we'll definitely be going back to The Kensington. Highly recommended. ",5,2016,08,02
113,Fantastic experience at The Kensington!,"From the moment we walked in The Kensington, it was a fabulous experience. The staff greeted us and welcomed us with open arms. We enjoyed our room, all the amenities and enjoyed the breakfast (which was included for us). Our only complaint is that our room was small -- that's fine, but there wasn't too much room to hang or store our clothes. But that did not ruin our stay at all! We would return there in a heartbeat.",4,2016,08,02
113,A very classy hotel!!,"We spent 4 nights at this gorgeous hotel.  The staff were exceptionally helpful with any queries or requests we had.  The lounge/sitting rooms on the ground floor were beautifully appointed and decorated and very popular with hotel guests.  
Our room was small but very nicely decorated and a lovely bathroom
Close to South Kensington underground station, good restaurants and cafes.",5,2016,08,02
113,Amazing hotel!!!,"Such a wonderful hotel! I went to London several times but it is my first time in this hotel of course not the last one for sure. Exquisite options for breakfast, spotless rooms, great location! Service is charming and amazing.",5,2016,08,01
113,Wonderful hotel with wonderful staff!!,"Stayed here for weekend trip to celebrate our wedding anniversary. After horrendous transfer experience from airport, we arrived with spirits dampened a little - well a lot actually. The hotel check in lady was lovely and when we arrived to our room, there was a bottle of prosecco and petit fours on a plate with Happy Anniversary and a card from staff!! This token from the hotel transformed our mood completely and we were thrilled with ourselves!! I dont know how they knew it was our anniversary as family didnt know where we were staying. 
This hotel is in such a great location too. You wouldnt want to stay anywhere else in London. The location is ideal and literally around the around the corner you have Brompton Road, Fulham Road, National HIstory Museum, V&A Museum, Science Museum. Kensington Palace and gardens at top of road. Wonderful! Food great, breakfast fab - hotel room - we had standard and people have said they're small/ Yes they're small but they're still perfectly adequate and I would describe them as  ""cosy""!! Stone stairway in middle of hotel lovely - reminds me a bit of JK Place in Florence, another gem! Cant say enough about this hotel. I want to go back NOW! ",5,2016,08,01
113,Absolutely brilliant,"Flawless hotel, great atmosphere and a really lovely birthday treat for a weekend in London. Couldn't fault the service or the attention to detail. Extensive choice for breakfast and the whisky bar offered a number of cocktails. Want to do it all again!",5,2016,08,01
113,Charming Hotel in excellent location,We had the large family room and were very comfortable with our daughter sharing the room. Super comfortable beds and large bathroom for London standard. Loved the location being able to walk to Hyde Park and museums and found some good Italian restaurants near by ,5,2016,07,31
113,Traditional,"A room without a great view, due to being located on a fairly residential road with similar architecture.

Great location, room, reception, comfortable, everything you could want from a faultless stay.",5,2016,07,31
113,The Superb Kensington Hotel,"We chose The Kensington Hotel due to its location (close to our daughter and son-in-law's flat) and its reputation which we read online.  From the moment we arrived, the staff made us feel extremely welcome and that we were ""almost family.""  We stayed 12 days/11 nights and were never dissatisfied in regards to anything the hotel offered.  This was the best hotel we have stayed at after four trips to London and we will be back.  Thank you Kensington Hotel and all of your wonderful employees.

113,Quaint boutique hotel in quiet neighborhood!,"Stayed for an extended weekend in London after business meetings.  This was a beautiful boutique hotel that met our expectations.  Staff was warm and welcoming throughout our stay.  
Rooms were on the small side yet quite comfortable.  South Kensington location was nice and quiet away from the busy areas of London yet there was plenty of sights, food and shopping within walking distance.",4,2016,07,27
113,wonderful evening,"We spent an evening in the restaurant and it was unforgettable experience. The food was amazing and the hospitality was even better. Kilian who served us was brilliant, friendly and made sure that we had the perfect night. He helped us with amazing recommendations  for wine and dessert. We will definitely come back!!!!
Thank you again Kilian!!",5,2016,07,27
113,Terrific London Hotel in a great location,"The Kensington is a small luxury hotel in South Ken.  Lovely rooms, terrific staff, great restaurant and bar.  Extremely helpful and knowledgable staff.  Good location ....walking distance to Knightsbridge, Brompton Road.  Not far from Kings Road.  Surprisingly good rates for a hotel of this caliber",5,2016,07,26
113,Small Room Great Service,"Amenities, location the best.  Room was so small you could not open the dresser drawers or closet door or refrigerator door.  Room would not fit two people.  Enough words, I am only writing more words to satisfy the minimum letter requirement",5,2016,07,25
113,"Kensington Hotel London, South Kensington.","A beautiful classic hotel in a lovely part of London, with excellent staff and service. Quite expensive for Australians with the dollar conversion, especially when the size of the cheapest superior double room (we paid $430 per night) is so small both lots of luggage could not fit in the room unless we put one case on the bed. (2 cases plus 2 carry on).  We ended up paying $210 extra a night for a very large studio room. Our stay was 4 nights. The rooms were very clean, modern clean bathroom and lovey toiletries. 
Great part of London with a lot of restaurants just around the corner and around forty minutes easy walk to Victoria Station. I would recommend this hotel if you can get a good price and maybe a deluxe King room at a different time of the year, July is high season.
",4,2016,07,25
113,Anniversary weekend celebrations,"This is a small but beautifully decorated hotel especially in the public areas. Staff were very attentive and accommodating throughout the stay and made you feel very welcome. Amazing cocktails served in the ornate bar and a great selection of things served for breakfast in the calm dining space. 
We had three rooms booked and two were fine but one was not as it was a bit gloomy and surrounded by walls as a view, once mentioned we were moved without any fuss. We hired Pashley bikes and posh picnics for us all as part of day twos deal. There was a problem with numbers of bikes and picnic items missing but again staff went out of their way to sort this out and on checkout we were acknowledged and compensated by the efficient management team, again without a fuss or being made to feel as if we were a nuisance. The location of the hotel is great and easy to find. We would recommend staying here without hesitation despite a couple of hiccups, but due to service and response were satisfied issues were listened to and dealt with. If you prefer smaller more intimate hotels this is one for you as I am not sure in a larger hotel issues would be dealt with in the same way .",5,2016,07,25
113,"Simply lovely... the people, the place, the setting","What a fabulous find just off the touristy street yet only a five minute walk to the South Kensington Metro and the museums.  Just around the corner you will find a bank, pharmacy, some restaurants, shops, and a grocery to pick up anything you might need for your room.  

The front house staff are superb at their job: friendly, professional, knowledgeable about the area, and extremely helpful.  Exactly what you would expect at a hotel of this caliber. The bellman (George) won my daughter over with her very own little Hotel Kensington teddy bear.

The room was luxuriously appointed and simply lovely.  We loved oh so comfortable four poster bed!  The pillows were perfect and the sheets were delightfully crisp and inviting.  The lighting was good and there were two small reading lights on each side of the bed in case there was a night owl in the room.

A word of caution though, the room was smaller than expected.  We booked a ""studio suite"" and, being typical Americans, we expected a large room with a bed area and seating area, as well as a refrigerator.  As it turns out, the studio suite was more in line with a typically sized hotel room in America.  There were two small chairs and a round table about a step or two from the foot of the bed but it was not a ""seating area"" as we anticipated, no desk for your computer or for a lady to have her dressing ritual.  There was a mini bar in the wardrobe but there was no place to store a bottle of water.

There is a Nespresso machine in the room.  Heavy coffee drinkers beware, they ration the number of pucks they give each room each day.  The room also has an electric kettle for tea if you prefer and Walker's shortbread to compliment your tea or coffee. Each day we were also left with bottles of still and sparkling water.  Another added plus:  they had an outlet strip that accommodate US, UK, and European power sources as well as a USB charger.

What the studio lacked in bedroom size, it made up for in the huge bathroom.  We loved the bathroom with its huge tub, marble floors and counter, heated mirror, walk in soaking shower, and private WC with toilet and bidet. Ahhhh.  The towels were nice and fluffy too!

The staff in the restaurant were off the charts wonderful and very accommodating.   Europeans are famous for being testy with people that come in right before closing for service ‚Äì be it a restaurant, department store, or whatever ‚Äì so when we came running down the stairs our first morning at 15 minutes before breakfast closed, imagine our surprise when we were not only offered our pick of food from the buffet but also presented a full menu from which we could order.  The restaurant staff could not have been lovelier and the food was terrific.  We enjoyed trying English breakfast favorites while our young daughter was delighted with cereal and pain au chocolat every day. 

We love this hotel and will certainly stay there the next time we are in London.",5,2016,07,24
113,Excellent service in a great location,"First let me state that the staff here are wonderful: friendly, accommodating, helpful and polite from the moment they open your taxi door until we check out.The rooms are average size for London ,great location within walk distance of London attractions.(Victoria and Albert Museum is a must see)The atmosphere of the hotel is very pleasant especially the bar where we meet Gabriel the barman.Very  professional and knowledgeable with a great sense of humour he recommend us the perfect pre and after dinner cocktails plus a treat of romanian history and facts.
Overall an excellent hotel to which I would not hesitate coming back.
Stayed July ,travelled as a couple.",5,2016,07,23
113,Wonderful!,"This place truly feels like a home away from home.  Everyone is pleasant and accommodating.  The common areas are beautiful, comfortable, and inviting.  They have a delicious afternoon tea with live piano music. The rooms are small, but clean and comfortable-though very dimly lit.  The dim lighting was really my only complaint.  There wasn't enough light in the room at night.  This hotel is expensive by most standards, but provides value for the money. If we stay in London again, we would stay here. ",5,2016,07,23
113,Regular guest...,"I've been staying at The Kensington for 2/3 nights a week now for the last 10 months. It's an amazing hotel with an amazing location. 
The best thing about it is the team. They are warm, generous and really passionate about great service. Fabulous food, and wonderful bar service.
I can't recommend this hotel enough. You won't be disappointed.",5,2016,07,22
113,Class Hotel with great service,"we stayed here for a no kids midweek break to watch the cricket and see show at the savoy.We booked this hotel because it had great reviews on trip advisor and it didn't disappoint from the moment we arrived and was greeted by the doorman and reception staff the service was attentive and friendly we had some hot towels and a welcome drink.
We had booked a deluxe room and it was very clean and spacious.
After dinner on the first evening we went to the bar for drinks the barman were both friendly and knowledgeable and we had a lovely evening until the residents bar shut,the cocktails were fabulous.we stayed for 3 Nights and we would both highly recommend this hotel for both service and location",5,2016,07,22
113,Really amazing evening,"Celebrated my partners birthday at this hotel.  The staff were amazing and really lovey to us from the moment I checked in to when I checked out.  The room was amazing and room service was really quick. 

Really positive experience, can't wait till we go back.",5,2016,07,20
113,One of the top hotels I've ever stayed in,"As someone who travels often, I must say this hotel was one of if not the best one I have stayed in.  Staff was amazing, room was spacious (because of their complimentary upgrade), rooms and hotel were clean, there are bars down below, as well as a juice bar...its in a prime location...shall i go on?? Highly recommended",5,2016,07,19

Will definitely be booking again soon. Highly recommend üôÇ",5,2016,07,19
113,Great Hotel with Excellent Location,"We visited London for Wimbledon and family vacation this July (2016).  The hotel was perfect!  
-- Location = literally 5 minute walk to the South Kensington tube station
-- Multiple restaurants, coffee shops just outside the hotel doors
-- 10-15 Walk to Harrods 
-- 5 minute walk to multiple Museums 
SERVICE:  Excellent.  While I'm sure all of the bellman are great - George - was friendly and made sure our room and overall hotel experience were exceptional.  On the day of departure, without even asking, he arrived at our room to pick-up our bags... just little things, that really mean a lot.

Also, at first, we had the wrong rooms (different than what was expected); However, Joshua (apologies if name is wrong), front desk manager - remedied the situation quickly and very professionally.  I don't even consider it an issue because we enjoyed everything about the hotel!",5,2016,07,19
113,"Very good hotel. Beautiful room, friendly staff","When I arrived at the hotel the staff were friendly and showed me to the bar (I was meeting my friend there and this was my first visit). I was delighted with the room we had booked. The room was lovely and everything had a touch of class to it. It wasn't too small or too big, but I think if we'd been spending more than one night there I may have preferred something a little larger (just my personal preference). The location of the hotel is fantastic. Lots of nearby places to eat and drink, as well as the neighborhood being lovely. I'd love to stay here again and it's a great romantic hotel if you're staying there with a partner.",4,2016,07,19
113,"Nice lobby area, but otherwise just okay","Recently stayed here with my family for one night and thought it was only okay overall. The service was great, but our room was a ""family"" room and also an accessible room. It was about two steps from the elevator, the bathroom floor was dirty with missing grout and the shower was run down with globs of grout oozing from the corners... Because it was accessible the shower was completely open so water was everywhere. Maybe install a curtain? We felt like because we have children we were stuck in this only okay spot. The people above us were doing sprints. Maybe another family? We picked this location due to its proximity to the airport. The Location was great for Hyde park and museums, but far from many other London attractions. If you do stay here ask for a room far from elevators... Definitely Not worth what I paid. ",3,2016,07,19
113,Another great stay.....,"As ever, a stay at the Kensington was a pleasure. Great staff and comfortable rooms...Simon and his team offer a 5* service that leaves you feeling highly valued and very relaxed. Well done Simon and the team. ",5,2016,07,18
113,fabulous Hotel,"We were visiting london and some friends brought us to the kensington for some drinks one night, it was such a treat the setting of the k bar was so perfect and the staff even better one in particular was a young man called Dean excellent at his job very helpful and pleasant.",5,2016,07,17
113,Lovely boutique hotel,"The location of this hotel is perfect...near the subway, Kensington shopping the V and A Museum and more. The lobby and bar staff were friendly and helpful. The bartenders were especially fun to talk to. The lobby is beautifully appointed and I was happy with my room. It was definitely on the small side, but the amenities, comfortable bed and small but luxurious bathroom made up for it. I ate breakfast there one day and the service was the only let down of the visit. It took a really long time to get the coffee I ordered. I had to ask two people for help with that. They were slow to bring milk, jelly, etc and charged me for the incorrect items. The breakfast food was good, but the service needs some help. My dinner in the bar on night, though, was really good. ",4,2016,07,16
113,"Beautiful Hotel, fantastic bar","Stayed here for 2 nights, Have to thank the man behind the Bar, he was from Lithuania, great block and made some top drinks and had a great attitude, which help make a fun stay. When you book a room, check the size, as my first room was tiny and I had to pay to get a room that didn't feel like a shoe box!  ",5,2016,07,16
113,The Kensington Hotel - perfect location for Wimbledon,"The Kensington is a wonderful hotel with excellent staff.  The location is perfect, close to good restaurants, museums, Kensington Gardens, and Kensington Palace.  We were going to Wimbledon, and the tube station is 5 minutes away.  
However, our room was very, very small.  I guess for the room rate, I expected something a little larger.

113,Business stay,"I stayed in this establishment for a week and know the pricing in London and location I decided to go with The Kensington even if it wasn't centrally centered. Now the underground is just a 5 mins walk from the hotel so I found that the location was not a problem. In a nutshell the service and professionalism of the staff was excellent, always helpful and smiling. It was like a breath of fresh air when compared to other locations. I was very nicely upgraded, thank you, their media setup in the rooms was Internet based so this created a few issues with the TV reception. The manager assured me that they would look into this after I had made my comments at the end of the stay and I know I can count on them to do the necessary. I would strongly recommend this hotel for visiting London, it is quiet, lovely area, super staff and on top 5 mins from the tube (underground)....what more could one want. I shall definitely go back with my family when I visit London. Even for business this location was great!",5,2016,07,14
113,Perfect... but the room....,"I would like to say it was perfect, but there was one flaw. And this 'one flaw' is what usually separates the 'perfect' from the 'very good'. Wonderful building, location that cannot be better, fantastic service, cool breakfasts and... a room. Some prison cells are bigger. Thus, 4/5.",4,2016,07,13
113,Great location for a family walk. Good service and food.,"Overall very happy. We found the location to be well suited and the decor was exceptional. The food and drink experience was also very good. Management was also very accommodating. The rooms are nice but a little smallish and the floor was a bit creeky, otherwise, excellent.",4,2016,07,13
113,Elegant Hotel - Terrific Service and Great Location!,"This hotel is a former Regency mansion in Kensington - it's been lovingly preserved, especially in the public areas, and we adored wandering the different rooms admiring the architecture and decor.  One morning it was so chilly and rainy that we had breakfast next to the fireplace and there was actually a fire - that's unheard of in the summertime months where we live!  Our room was fairly small but we chose a less expensive option when we booked because we were only staying for a few nights.  It was clean and comfortable and the bathroom, while also small, was very nice with a rainforest shower head and lots of beautiful marble.  The hotel's food was good - they have a really nice breakfast buffet with a lot of options, and we also tried some of the bar bites once afternoon, which were reasonably priced and quite tasty.  The cocktail bar was lovely and the drinks were well made and inventive - we only wish they'd opened earlier in the day so we could have enjoyed a little more time there.  And I would be remiss if I didn't mention the lovely service we received from the moment we checked in until the morning we left.  The desk clerk got us into a room right away so that we could recover from our jetlag, and when we discovered a leak in the bathroom, we were immediately moved to a different room. The bellmen, dining room staff, bar manager, and concierge were all highly professional and very personable - they helped make our stay truly memorable.  We have always liked staying in the Kensington area and now we have a favorite hotel to come back to on our next visit.  We just hope that visit is sooner rather than later!",5,2016,07,12
113,"The Kensington unites first-class location, luxurious bedrooms and exceptional dining‚Ä¶","If you‚Äôre thinking about spending an extravagant weekend in London, then make The Kensington your very own West London residence. The hotel, which is part of the Doyle Collection, has undergone an extensive refurbishment in the last year to make it one of the finest townhouse hotels that the capital has to offer.

Situated in one of the world‚Äôs most sought-after postcodes, The Kensington is only a short walk from London‚Äôs must-see museums, including the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum and the V&A, so why not combine your stay with a slice of culture? If shopping is more your thing, be enticed to spend the afternoon at Harrods (it‚Äôs practically on the doorstep!), or jump on the tube to hit the shopping meccas of Bond Street, Saville Row and Oxford Street. Just don‚Äôt forget your credit card! 

But, it‚Äôs not just location that this exclusive retreat delivers on! All of the 126 rooms and 24 suites are beautifully decorated, each benefiting from light-reflecting large bay windows, extremely comfortable beds, antique furniture, sizeable TVs, and super-spacious bathrooms complete with separate rain showers and bath tubs, so you can relax and unwind after a busy day‚Äôs sightseeing. 

A plethora of culinary establishments are only a stone‚Äôs throw away, but you don‚Äôt even need to leave the hotel to enjoy some of London‚Äôs most exquisite food and drink. The Town House restaurant offers fantastic food in comfortable surroundings (we recommend the steak!), while the drawing rooms on the ground floor are an ideal setting for afternoon tea. Or, perhaps the ultra-glamorous K Bar will hit the spot? It‚Äôs just the place for pre-dinner cocktails! 

And after a good night‚Äôs sleep, sit down to a hearty breakfast, whether it‚Äôs a full English or continental buffet that you crave. Feeling active? The hotel boasts a fully-equipped gym, or why not go for a run around nearby Hyde Park?

Ticking every box on the discerning traveller‚Äôs checklist, The Kensington unites first-class location, luxurious bedrooms and exceptional dining‚Ä¶ This reinvented bolt-hole has it all!",5,2016,07,12
113,Have stayed there two times and it is one of the best hotels I have ever been to.,"It is beautiful in side with its decor in keeping with the outside. I went into a lobby of near by hotel and when they tried to put a modern interior it just made it weird looking.

It is near tube stations. Walking to museums and Harrods is a easy stroll. 

Restaurnats near by and the hotel one is great.

Staff is wonderful.",5,2016,07,10
113,Papery small room and narrow corridors,"Stayed here for one night. Looked lovely from outside and reception area and dinning room were very smart. Bedrooms however were small. First room had no bath so had to move second room, had a bath but small and room dark. Ate in hotel for dinner with our family and had a good meal. Breakfast next day in same room ,but service very slow. I am sure I left my jumper in hotel room but sadly the hotel say I didn't. Wouldn't stay again though.",3,2016,07,10
113,Glorious Visit,"My kids and I had a lovely time at The Kensington Hotel. We arrived to champagne, fruit and the kids were each given a teddy bear and a book - which made their trip. The staff were all very friendly, helpful and courteous. We had breakfast included and it was also quite exceptional",5,2016,07,07
113,Fantastic,"Beautiful hotel in a stunning neighbourhood. The location is fantastic, around the corner plenty of restaurants and cafes, short walk to V & A museum and Hyde Park, Harrods shop is 10-15 min walk. 
Rooms beautiful, staff amazing especially the doormen! We didn't eat breaky here as there was do many nice cafes and patisseries in the area but we did enjoy the bar for a couple of late night drinks.

Only downside is the hallway in the hotel by your room can be quite noisy... It's just the old hotel but don't let that put you off - we got a good night sleep every time and we would be back tomorrow if we could!

113,Wimbledon wonder!,"A great place to stay if attending the Championships.  Located near the tubes, in a wonderful part of town.  They have a wonderful staff that goes above and beyond good service.  The rooms were well-kept and the common areas were very relaxing.  Highly recommended.",5,2016,07,06
113,Pricey but great!,This is a beautiful hotel in a wonderful location. It is worth the splurge. The room was very small but they have numerous lobby areas where you can relax. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly. I would stay here again and would highly recommend it to anyone traveling to London. ,4,2016,07,05
113,Exceptional Experience,"We stayed at this hotel for a wedding celebration. It was absolutely beautiful, and more importantly the staff were so attentive and helpful. Best hotel experience i've ever had, definitely recommend! ",5,2016,07,05
113,Charming and calming,"Too many boutique hotels tried to differentiate by going edgy in decor and in so doing destroyed the harmony with the exterior facade that is honed by history. Not the Ken. Situated on a beautiful tree lined avenue bedecked with flowers in South Ken, this set of three townhouses preserved the gentility inside that goes well with the atmosphere on Queens Gate. The afternoon tea is quite adequate even though these days many people have forgotten how to make a proper pot of leaf tea, pouring it too early etc. We took the Brampton Suite because we needed to have a business meeting. It was a perfect choice for business and pleasure: 4 poster bed with chinoiserie motif, claw foot bath tub enough for two and separate shower in a sunlit room. The separate living room sits 4 comfortably for long chats. During a break, we strolled on Queens Gate and right around the corner in the Old Brompton Rd, there is a nice patisserie and other goodies.  Will be back for sure.",5,2016,07,05
113,"Incredible property, amazing service and a great location","This is a gorgeous property with beautiful decor throughout.  My room was a double standard room and it exceeded my expectations.  Large and spacious with a nespresso coffee maker, tea, yummy smelling shampoos, body wash, et.  The service was amazing with turn down service and checking in on all of the details daily. George who works downstairs, was particularly helpful and arranged for a driver to take me to Gatwick airport when he saw I was trying to take all of my luggage in a taxi to Victoria Station and then the train to Gatwick.  Was a lifesaver! Also a terrific location close to attractions, charming cafes, shopping and the train stations. I look forward to returning!",5,2016,07,04
113,"Great hotel, wonderful staff","Great hotel in a very nice part of London. Anna and the rest of the staff are amazing! They'll make you feel at home. Yes, it's their job, but there are ways and ways of doing it, and they do it in the best possible way! Real London experience! Highly recommended ",5,2016,07,04
113,Great hotel,A great place to relax in the hustle and bustle of London. We loved relaxing in the lounge. The bar was excellent and concierge helpful. Tube nearby and lovely gastropub around the corner for dinner. We will definitely stay here next time we're back in London. Tip: get breakfast included it was fab! ,4,2016,07,03
113,Fantastic,"From start to finish, a beautiful hotel. 
Amazing staff and great location. 

The whole hotel is immaculate, fantastic decor. 

The bar staff are attentive and amazing cocktails. 

Rooms are a little small. But it was perfect for our one night stay. 

Would highly recommend. ",5,2016,07,02
113,Charming,"This is a charming old world hotel located in South Kensington, about 5 minutes from the tube station.  The standard rooms are very small and with couple of large suitcases they are crowded.  However they are nicely decorated and housekeeping keep them very clean.   The rest of the hotel, including the restaurant, has a lovely Downton Abbey feel and the staff are excellent.  A nIce place to spend a couple of days when visiting London.",4,2016,07,02
113,Lovely hotel,Lovely hotel. Very clean and well maintained. Probably our only criticism is that rooms are on the small side.  Staff was vey cordial and helpful.  Great location -- close to subway and restaurants. Would definitely stay here again.,4,2016,06,30
113,Awesome Stay for a Group,"A fantastic location. The staff hosted and attended to our group of 21 with professionalism and efficiency in every way. The rooms were nice and comfortable, the restaurant and lounge was great, the concierge team was extremely helpful with dining and entertainment plans and the front desk and bellmen were very friendly, helpful and attentive.",5,2016,06,29
113,Wimbledon package,Stayed as part of a Wimbledon Package. Glad we did. Beautifully presented. Well located to underground. Rooms not huge but more than adequate and serviced twice daily. Breakfast was excellent as was light food in the bar. Staff happy and polite and eager to be of assistance. On check out Chandonnay was extremely helpful with our needs. Would stay again should we return to London. Would not hesitate to recommend it to people looking for something special in a hotel.,5,2016,06,29
113,An amazing hotel but rooms some rooms need a bit of care to keep up with a five star hotel,"The Kensington is fabulous- location, decoration, ambiance. Some rooms however need a bit of care to keep up with other hotels in the vicinity. But we still highly recommend it, above the best hotels in London.",4,2016,06,28
113,"Kensington hotel, Queensgate",Lovely hotel in a nice area of London. We have stayed at techies twice. If there is one small critism it would be that the lighting in the bedroom is quite dim which is fine but it is difficult to dry your hair in the dim light.,5,2016,06,28
113,Delightful stay,"The hotel was unknown to us, and somewhat out of the way of our usual London. Nice well appointed large bedroom with good amenities. Excellent reception service, elegant public rooms. Very pleasant and accommodating staff. Breakfast pricey but good quality, although the staff seemed somewhat overwhelmed and service was slow, always with a smile.Close to the V&A which we have never been to, so that was a great plus.",5,2016,06,27
113,Nice Boutique Hotel,Third stay this year and excellent service from friendly staff.  Rooms are small but nicely furnished with good bathrooms.  Convenient for South Kensington underground station and well located generally.  Nicer than a big chain and similar price point too.,4,2016,06,26
113,"Fantastic stay, service, and sweets.","My friend and I stayed at the Kensington for four days and were blown away with our entire experience. The location was not only superb, but as two twenty-year-old girls traveling alone for our very first time, we felt very safe and at home in this fabulous hotel. When we first arrived in the room, we had a box of sweets and a wrapped present waiting for us, and at the end of every day we returned to a smiling concierge who asked us about our day and was eager to help us out in any way possible. I highly recommend the breakfast which is an adorable buffet as well as a variety of off a menu options. Also, be sure to indulge in their tea time (which if you stay for 3 days or more is complimentary!) as you will be greeted with delectable pastries and sandwiches. I would without a doubt come back to this hotel in any future visit to London.",5,2016,06,26
113,Wonderful Service in a breathtaking setting,"We didn't stay here, but we had a wonderful experience in the K bar here one evening and was waiting on with great service and attention to detail by a young Irish man called Dean. He was very professional and knowledgeable and made some fantastic recommendations. The menu was extensive and the setting was very warm and welcoming. Would certainly recommend to my friends and family.",5,2016,06,26
113,Breakfasts are amazing!!,"Rooms are the usual (small) size, nice bathroom, comfy bed.

The hotel has a lovely scent or orange water in reception, staff efficient and friendly.

Breakfast was the highlight of our stay, fantastic choice of continental style or full Irish breakfast which was perfectly cooked.",4,2016,06,25
113,Old and tired hotel,"to be honest we only stayed at this hotel one single night but i have to say that it's an old old old tired place.  The rooms are extremely tight, the bed takes up the entire room and the bathroom, although nice and neat still shows its age.  The hallways are dark and dingy, old carpeting and tired old paint with dead cockroaches in corners that have dust on them so you know they've been there for a while.
The staff is very nice but is lacking in thought.  An example here is that we ordered room service with 2 meals and they brought only one set of utensils.  
Yes, i'm being nit-picky but with so many hotels to choose from i'd say they are way overpriced for what you get.  A name is not enough anymore.",3,2016,06,24
113,Fantastic Relaxing stay,My wife and I stayed for two nights at the Kensington on the weekend of the 17th June. We had a fantastic stay. The breakfast was a really enjoyable experience. It is in a great area. The staff were friendly. I will definitely return. ,4,2016,06,23
113,Wonderful Hotel,"My wife and I recently had a six day, five night stay at The Kensington.  From the moment we walked in the door to the time we left, we were very impressed with the level of service from the staff, the elegant surroundings, and the comfortable suite that we were given.  The concierge staff, Vincent and Martyn, were both very professional and offered great advice on everything from directions, to places to visit and eat, to obtaining tickets for attractions.  Front desk staff members were very attentive and helpful getting checked in and out as well as different times in our stay.  The restaurant manager, Killian, was very professional as was our waitstaff person, Luca.  Food in the restaurant was very good with emphasis placed not only on the taste but also the presentation.  On one occasion, a dessert was not to the chef's liking from a presentation perspective.  While it tasted fine, we were invited back the next evening to have a dessert prepared and presented properly, complimentary to us.  Our suite was very well attended with morning cleaning done very nicely and the added touch of evening turn down service and chocolates.  The room was very comfortable and clean.  The hotel is located near the South Kensington tube station and easy walking distance to Hyde Park.  All-in-all, this was a great experience for our first visit to London.  We'll stay here again on our next visit.",5,2016,06,22
113,First trip to London.,Everyone was so helpful assisting us to assure that we had the best experience possible. Breakfast was exceptional. Location was close to tube and therefor easy to get around. Neighborhood was safe and a wonderful place just around the corner was also good to eat at. Bumpkins was he name.,5,2016,06,20
113,Just what we needed,"After a week of hiking through the Scottish countryside, we were looking to rest and relax in London. The Kensington made it happen. We were informed upon checkin that we had been upgraded from a Deluxe to a Luxury Suite. The staff couldn't do enough for us. The Suite was palacial and a welcome relief from the smaller rooms we had experienced the previous week elsewhere. The suite was appointed nicely, and the exra large bath room was heaven. Breakfast was fresh and delicious each morning. Even a Scotch at the bar was a delightful experience. We felt well-taken care of. We will be back, hopefully next year.",5,2016,06,20
113,Beautiful hotel with amazing staff,"Although the room I had was small, it was beautifully maintained and had everything I needed, really comfortable bed and nice bathroom.  The ambience of this hotel and the truly fantastic staff are what make this hotel so special.  5 minutes walk to the Kensington South underground station with lots of restaurants and small supermarkets near by.",5,2016,06,19
113,Beautiful,"Just perfect, the rooms are beautiful and the service is impeccable. The location is superb right on Queensgate, five minutes leisurely walk to south Kensington tube, exhibition road and 15 minutes walk to Knightsbridge. I can't wait to stay here again.",5,2016,06,19
113,Our fabulous stay at the Kensington,We needed a hotel in the South Kensington area. We were pleasantly surprised with the wonderful ambience of this beautiful hotel. The rooms were each unique and very comfortable. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. We will definitely return,5,2016,06,18
113,Fine hotel with Amazing service ,"My patner brought me here as part of my birthday present and we truly enjoyed our stay...Check in and check out was smooth and efficient. We stayed on the 3rd floor and we loved our room , It had a comfortable bed and a nice view facing the street. Breakfast was plentiful in the morning and the staff were really good and professional. 
We liked taking long stroll across the streets and to Hyde park which is really near, special thanks to concierge Martyn and George for being helpful with directions to shops, restaurants and other landmarks. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,06,18
113,Spectacular Hotel,"The kensington was perfectly located on the old brompton Road, directly opposite the intersection of queensgate avenue our room was compact and had everything you needed and more, including a Nespresso machine and a dvd player for watching films on. The terraces on the outside were also  fabulous and a real added bonus to the traditional french riviera styled building- a lovely calm spot to relax after a busy day! The bathroom is small and basic but again has everything you need., Dinner was also fantastic at the hotel‚Äôs restaurant and we went outside to try local restaurants and bars and we discovered a few of our favorites too, Bumpkin most probably beat them all in old british charm, and Muriels kitchen for breakfast or if you fancy some more substantial you could try the bluebird restaurant on kings road which will be more pricey but worth the experience. All in all we enjoyed everything in this part of London from clean streets, bars, museums and shops. Would definitely recommend for a reasonably priced stay in south west London",5,2016,06,17
113,Really enjoyed hotel and restaurant,"We just spent 3 nights at The Kensington.  It is a fabulous loccation in a posh neighborhood.  The staff would bend over backwards to make sure we were happy.  Concierge got us tickets to Wicked on the day of the show.  We ate breakfast every day and it was wonderful.  Loved the coffee.  Dinner was good,  relaxed atmosphere, superb service.  the portions were rather small for the price but it was very good.  Will definitely return.",5,2016,06,16
113,Four Star with nearly five star service,"A great four star hotel with excellent service. Stayed here for an extended weekend in may. Booked an update, unfortunately they are lacking the five star service when it come to room updates. The room had a view towards a narrow backyard, no daylight at all. As many hotels, they prioreties regular customes. The room was nice decorated and clean. Quiet as well. Nice bed. The Bathroom was large, but very small shower! Nice amneties, good quality .
Breakfast was basic, but nice. You can order side dishes.
Nice area, lots of nice cafes just around the corner from the hotel and walking distance from the tube.
Close to museums and parks.
Good money for Value? Well, you might get what you are looking for just across the street for less money.",4,2016,06,16
113,Trip to Europe,"Great to meet George.  Great ambassador for the hotel. 
Beautiful hotel & great location. Convenient to many shops, restaurants & a quick walk to the tube.  Hotel offers lots of amenities & a wonderful breakfast in a wonderful setting.  Staff always welcoming and helpful when approached for assistance. ",5,2016,06,15
113,Fabulous,"I stayed at the Kensington for 3 days with my grandmother and we loved it. The entire staff was genuine and amazingly helpful, tending to our every need. George was so fun! The location is perfect, very central, near the tube, Harrod's, and small shops. We would recommend the high tea, as it was relaxing and delicious. It is so elegant, and this hotel is very authentic.

113,The most elegant and caring home away from home,"It has everything you would need to support your visit to London. 
Especially great Martinis by Ben the Barman. 
The service and the food is impeccable. 
Cannot say enough about the quality of the experience.",5,2016,06,14
113,An absolute winner ! ,"This is the third time I have stayed at this hotel and it is my go to place in London . Excellent barman James and concierge - Michael always add a bit of magic to a stay ! 

There is variability in room size but one always gets an excellent offering and combination of brilliant breakfast and affordable bar and menu service . 

The hotel is also in close proximity to excellent and I mean excellent restaurants like michellao and Rocca. Simply a winner ",5,2016,06,11
113,A treasure in the middle of London ,"This was my second stay in this beautiful luxury hotel. Having enjoyed a first stay here in 2015 following a recommendation from a friend, I didn't hesitate to book in again when I returned to London. 
The location is great, stroll to the V&A museum, the natural history museum, Hyde Park and The Kings Road in Chelsea just to name a few close by attractions. Attention to detail in this hotel is fantastic and the staff are really friendly, genuine and attentive to your every need. 
I checked in late in the evening and this was no problem at all.
The rooms are luxurious and feel spacious for the middle of London. The aesthetics of the hotel are superb.
I enjoyed the breakfast,  plenty of fresh options and the staff were accommodating to my dietary requirements. The bar is a wonderful spot to enjoy a wind down in the evening and the piano player adds ambience. 
George the concierge was welcoming and exceptionally helpful, courteous and friendly and my stay was made easier by being able to leave my luggage at the hotel after an early check out and a trip to And from Europe during my stay in London. ",5,2016,06,10
113,"Beautiful hotel,fabulous staff",We were in London a couple of weeks ago visiting family and we were brought to the Kensington one evening for drinks and snacks .The k bar was superb all friendly staff willing to make you as comfortable as possible with great recommendations on what drinks and snacks available we took the advice from one fellow Irishman called Dean and had the monkey47 gin one of the nicest I ever tasted we also loved the goats cheese popcorn thanks to all in the k bar u will be seeing us again in the future .,5,2016,06,10
113,Best hotel experience ever. Superior service and comfort.,"My fiance booked this hotel to provide a more boutique setting for our trip. Neither of us expected the incredible service and attention from the staff. For the price, this hotel might be the best hidden jewel in London. It was incredibly clean with modern bathrooms, comfortable beds, and some of the most luxurious towels I've ever touched. There is a beautiful breakfast room with comfortable small tables and a delicious buffet of fresh food, including cheeses, charcuterie, eggs, smoked salmon, yogurt, fresh breads and pastries, etc, etc, plus french press coffee and fresh squeezed juices. There is also a gorgeous bar finished in bookshelves and low leather furniture. The bartenders make delicate and perfect cocktails, and provide a quiet dark atmosphere to end the day. Finally, I can't say enough about the staff. They were incredibly helpful getting us tickets, recommending sights and restaurants, calling for reservations, checking on us and providing anything we requested. It was an oasis in the bustling city, and I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a fabulous hotel in London.",5,2016,06,09
113,Fabulous stay at the Kensington,"I have stayed here many times and always loved it.  The staff are incredibly attentive and lovely, the food delicious and the drinks fabulous.  And there are always interesting people at the bar.  The rooms are gorgeous and location is very central so easy to get to any location around London.  I highly recommend a stay here.",5,2016,06,08
113,Lovely Hotel with friendly staff.,"I was visiting friends in London last week and they brought me to the kensington for a treat, well it was a pure treat everyone was so nice and friendly. 1 lovely young man in particular was Dean he couldnt do enough for us and had a constant smile. Will definitely return here. Thanks guys.",5,2016,06,08
113,Lovely hotel with excellent staff and amenitie,"Loved this hotel and will stay here again if in London. Heated floor in bathroom.  Nespresso coffee machine in room.  Very comfy king size bed and large flat screen TV.  The only reason for the 4 star and not 5 is because it is a little noisy.  That's the only con.  But, that's easy to fix...just bring ear plugs.  ",4,2016,06,06
113,superior quality for little outlay,"best staff I London. Could not do more for us. from fresh warm hand towels at the point of check in to complimentary bottles of water when we left. They seem to have a knack of knowing when to approach you so are not overwhelming or aloof. Quality of food was excellent with breakfast being fabulous. Its our second time there as location for the Albert Hall is perfect, and we will always look to return. Well done to all at the Kensington for making our stay great.",5,2016,06,06
113,Visit to London,"My mother and I had a brief and pleasant stay in London in April.  It was her first time visiting and I wanted to be located in a quiet, safe, pretty neighborhood and close to restaurants and transportation. The Kensington Hotel was perfect for my requisites. We were always welcomed with a smile from Guido. George is the go to person, friendly and willing to assist in any way. Michael at the concierge desk was also outstanding, he accommodated all our requests graciously and in a timely manner. These 3 staff members made our stay at the Kensington memorable. We were greeted by name upon entering the hotel.  At the front desk, we were offered a warm towel and macaroon - the most delicious one I have ever tasted. Our room was available immediately. As others have said, we also did find the room to be too small in size for the cost. The cons: once you entered the room you practically had to sit on the bed, there was no room to walk, although there was a table there was only one chair, and the tiny fridge was full with items to purchase but no room to store anything.  The coffee machine although made terrific coffee, was inside the closet - how odd, therefore we did not hang up any of our clothes in the closet! There was also glass shelves in the bathroom but way too small, basically we could only fit our toothbrush and tooth paste.The pros: the marble bathroom was beautiful, it had heated floors, sizable shower and not a huge tub which are difficult to get into. Great water pressure and rain shower head. The gel/cream provided were high end. There was free wi-fi. The decor of the hotel was elegant and in English style. There were several lounge areas on the main floor offering options by the window, in front of fireplace - cozy, table setting for tea as well as the bar and restaurant.   We had a few minor issues with the cleaning staff, leaving our window open every day (room was freezing) and sometimes not providing towels but overall we had a nice stay at the Kensington.  If we return to London, we would definitely reserve a larger room. As for the location it was ideal, walking distance to tube/buses, several restaurants - try Rocco for Italian and Beirut Express for middle eastern, a bakery literally less than 100 ft away with delicious croissants/brioche breads, a mini supermarket, wine bar, and so much more. And a couple of museums also close by.",4,2016,06,05
113,High Tea is Exceptional,"All 10 of us were treated to an excellent afternoon which we will not forget and happily repeat with other friends and family.

I had contacted the hotel staff in advance as some of us have food intolerances and some of us were vegetarian.
Not only were they able to provide excellent vegetarian and GF options they also handled other food intolerances very well.

Service was second to none and the staff were only too happy to help.
5 star service, 5 star food, 5 star setting.  I cannot wait to go back there again.

113,"Sunday Lunch - no customers, so great experience!","Sunday lunch with a friend - great experience, wonderful choose your own starter buffet [eat as much as you like] and the mains and puddings were above expectations.
Not cheap, ¬£29 set price Sunday Lunch. But what a secret it must be we were the only diners!? The service and general visit experience was out standing. 
A Great place for a superb Sunday Lunch.",4,2016,06,04
113,It's a Gem,"We had a wonderful stay in London. This hotel is very nice, a good change to the stressful Central London. It has a lot of delicious restaurants and cute luxury shops around it, also the way to central London‚Äôs west end is short distance about 20 minutes. The hotel is very well maintained, clean and relaxing. Wonderful atmosphere because of the staff, we even met other interesting people from all over the world. Concierge Michael is such a lovely Person! For example: our flight back home needed to be confirmed, tickets to the theatre, and any general inquiries really was no problem and gave us the best advice possible. We needed a late checkout and we left our luggages in the hotel with George the gracious bellboy. All in all, we love that location; service and we hope to come back again!",5,2016,06,01
113,Excellent location,"This hotel is right beside the metro, some great cafes and grocery stores. It's in the heart of South Kensington. The rooms are some of the biggest i've seen in London and they're all pretty quirky and artistic. I would stay here again.",5,2016,05,31
113,Wonderful last night in England,"We wanted a quiet, relaxing evening for our last night in the UK and the Kensington delivered. Close to the tube, museums and Harrods, it's in a nice neighborhood. And, a good rate for an upscale London hotel. Booking direct yielded a ¬£20 credit towards breakfast. Would stay here again.",5,2016,05,31
113,Lovely hotel in London!,"We stayed here while on a tour and loved the hotel!  Very comfortable room and bed.  Heated floor in the bathroom was a plus!  Very quiet as well.  Great service from the front desk and staff.  We had a high tea as part of our package and it was superb!   Also good breakfast buffet each morning and friendly, accommodating staff in the restaurant.   We loved the art and decor throughout the hotel.  Close to many museums and shopping plus very easy and safe to hop on the tube to go anywhere else you want (there's a great free app to give you the tube routes.). Can't go wrong at this hotel!",5,2016,05,30
113,Very expensive cell,"Staff were very pleasant and helpful, but the room was way too small for the cost, once in the room it was dull with no pictures only the obligatory TV!  We left before our stay was over! Very expensive prison cell",3,2016,05,30
113,Stay with family,"We stayed here for several days while vacationing in London, and the experience was fantastic. Location was perfect, and staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. The bar was also outstanding. The food was good as well, breakfast in particular was delicious. ",5,2016,05,30
113,wonderful though brief stay,"Room was very comfortable. The coffee machine in the room made delicious coffee/expresso, they provided bottled water and delicious shortbread cookies, too. Bathroom was spotless and the lotions, etc were high end. Nice place. The staff were friendly and very helpful.  A great stay.",5,2016,05,28
113,A lovely hotel,"We arrived at the hotel only few minutes and got the room ready and there was no problem at all in staying there. The hotel was tidy and cozy. The concierge prepared manual and was very helpful, letting us know everything about the hotel. Free WIFI and signal was good. The room was small as described but fine with us‚Ä¶ Staff sent us fruits and cookies and always available to check if we're fine with our stay, so nice for their concern that we felt like renting the whole hotel not just one room, Special mentions to George, Anna ,Ben and many other who looked after us.   The location was great, just few minutes to cafe and bus stop, also very near south Kensington Station to the left and Gloucester road and high street Kensington station to your right, plenty of shops and restaurants. Really recommend if you plan to visit London",5,2016,05,28
113,Good choice,"Great location with restaurants/bars/cafes nearby and only a 5 minute walk to the S Kensington tube station.  Large bedroom (executive) but very small bathroom. There's just enough room under the sink to store a cosmetic bag on each side.  Some traffic noise at night may affect light sleepers. The restaurant and bar are a little stuffy but the blueberry pie is highly recommended.  No fridge, only a packed mini bar (for purchase). Tube to Heathrow airport was easy and convenient.",4,2016,05,28
113,Great stay in South Kensington,"The Kensington has a lot going for it, but location and excellent customer service are its best features.  (The concierge Martyn was especially friendly and helpful.)  It is located within easy walking distance of numerous very nice restaurants and only a block away from the Tube (Underground).  The free breakfast included in our package was also very good.

Our room was not ready when we arrived, so management compensated with a significant upgrade to a very nice room.  My only issue was the very tall bathtub.  Even though I am a tall woman, I had to stand on an ottoman in order to climb into it, almost falling on several occasions.

All in all, we enjoyed our stay very much and would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2016,05,27
113,A wonderful stay,We booked a two night stay as an anniversary/birthday break. I would recommend The Kensington as a wonderful place to stay. Staff were friendly and helpful. We had one evening meal and breakfast - the food was delicious. Our room was immaculate - we had a lovely corner room with a very comfortable bed and excellent facilities. Overall a wonderful treat. ,5,2016,05,26
113,Superb short break,"I can't praise the Kensington highly enough. The staff were friendly and helpful; the room was wonderful; the food was fantastic. Add in a location that is perfect for exploring London museums, Knightsbridge and Chelsea, and you have everything you need for a fantastic break. Highly recommended. ",5,2016,05,26
113,Charming hotel,"It‚Äôs a fabulously appointed hotel and in the most gorgeous and safest area! Concierge Vincent helped us a lot with planning our itinerary! 
Staff was very accommodating given our late arrival into the city. There was easily accessible at all times. The hotel‚Äôs very cozy, chic and located in the best part of town. The studio was impeccably clean and stocked with necessary toiletries; there was even a nespresso machine stocked with pod capsules and all. Overall, we felt very comfortable with the place and with the facilities,amenities and quality of service and hospitality. Special mentions to George the porter who was very generous and We‚Äôll definitely be returning to this nice home away charming hotel in the near future.",5,2016,05,26
113,Beautiful hotel property in one of the best London neighborhoods,"I found this hotel after searching the Internet for a boutique type hotel to stay in while visiting London.  The property, staff, amenities and neighborhood (Kensington) did not disappoint.  Just 2 blocks to the South Kensington underground station, with a variety of coffee shops and cafes and convenience shops all around, this was our favorite property of the trip that included the Empire Hotel in NYC and Custom House in Boston, and they were great properties too, for their own reasons.  But The Kensington was The Best!",5,2016,05,25
113,Great hotel with a great location and staff,"The hotel and room were great, I did get a small room but it was not an inconvenience since I only used to to sleep. The overall condition of the hotel was awesome, very classy and upscale, clean and trendy. The location was also great, close to two tube stations, shops, restaurants, bars and parks. I did have two downsides to the hotel, while I understand the mini bar is not included it would be appreciated if you offers regular drinking water instead of mineral, since I don't drink soda and one night I woke up around 3 AM very thirsty and was not able to find anything to satisfy my thirst, The second inconvenience was the bathroom, I understand the room was small, but the entrance to the shower was very very small, I am by no means a small guy, neither large, but I found it very difficult to enter and exit the shower, maybe rearranging the toilet and faucet could help with that. Other that these two things everything was great, I really enjoyed the extra pillows, which were very comfortable, and also to the doormen (sorry if that not their correct tittle) everything they saw us leaving or arriving the always started a friendly conversation with tips and suggestions. I would like to thank you for the great experience your hotel gave me. I will definitely stay again.
",5,2016,05,25
113,A Warm Welcome,"My wife and myself recently enjoyed a short break at the Kensington Hotel and don‚Äôt normally write reviews but we‚Äôve decided to make an exception in this case.
I‚Äôve never stayed at a place where the staff were so welcoming. Nothing was too much trouble for any of them - we felt so at home during our stay.
We didn‚Äôt like the outlook of the first room that we were given so I asked Elisa and Nicole at reception if we could be moved. This was no trouble at all (Elisa showed us a couple of other rooms and let us decide the best one).
The lobby/sitting rooms/restaurant areas of this hotel are probably the nicest I‚Äôve ever come across- lots of open fires, comfortable surroundings and a really nice ‚Äònook‚Äô under the stairs that we could have sat all night in. 
I didn‚Äôt catch the name of every member of staff but here are the ones that I did:
Elisa and Nicole: Really welcoming on reception, rounded off by giving my wife a birthday card and 2 free cocktails - nice touch.
George (Concierge I think): a really nice guy, very helpful and gave great recommendations for places to go in the area.
Cillian (restaurant), another really nice guy and a tremendous host for whom nothing was too much trouble.
Those are the names that have stuck but every member of staff was a pleasure to deal with. Thanks guys for a really nice stay- I‚Äôd gladly recommend the Kensington to anyone I know and we‚Äôll certainly return. 
",5,2016,05,24
113,Loved it,"We had a lovely stay here and It is a really nice hotel on a very good location. There are many shops and restaurants, supermarkets, etc. just around the corner or a few minutes walk away. The subway is also very close (10 min walk), with two stations to choose from. The hotel itself is cosy, with everything you need. The photos on their website show exactly what the hotel looks like. The street where the apartment is located is very quiet. good receptionist like Elisa and Concierge to welcome you at the hotel.",5,2016,05,24
113,A Most Excellent Hotel,"The Kensington has many wonderful attributes, the most appreciated of which is the fabulous staff.  As with most organizations that succeed in providing excellent service, The Kensington's staff is a reflection of it's leadership.  General Manager Simon is right out front making sure that every guest is taken care of.  When issues arise, he is quick to solve any problem.  I have met many GMs in my time, and Simon is at the very top of that list.  Other staff that I must acknowledge are, Martin, our ever helpful concierge, and the ever-smiling George, who will help you whenever and wherever he can.   Now, let's go over some of the hotel's attributes:
* Great location in an upscale neighborhood.  Two tube stations are but a few minutes walk.  Bus stops are even closer.  Many good restaurants, bakeries, pubs close by.  Great little grocery across the street where you can get an inexpensive bottle of wine or beer.
*  Well decorated and comfortable lobby.  This is important, because as many reviewers have stated, the rooms are on the smaller side.  If you want to come back to the hotel just to sit and relax for awhile, the lobby works very well.
*  Very good  housekeeping.  The rooms are spotless.  Nice touches include robes, slippers and a Nespresso machine.  Turn down service is very well-done.
*  Very comfortable bed.
*  Very good restaurant.  Although we had most of our meals out, the food we had at the hotel restaurant was very good.

Now, for the ""cons"".  There really aren't any, other than the ""Superior"" room having a very narrow bathroom and not much space in the room itself.  However, if you are ""out and about"" and not spending much time in the room, it shouldn't be a problem.

Bottom Line:  I highly recommend The Kensington...it is my hotel of choice in London.",5,2016,05,23
113,Luxe in a superb location,"What a gem of a hotel. Located 3 mins walk from South Ken tube and within minutes of Kensington High Street this is a seriously smart hotel that not many people even know exists. 

Hotel decor is luxurious throughput - staff are attentive but not stiff - and if you've been to the Marylebone hotel you wont be surprised to know that its part of the same family owners. My room was typically smallish but very clever in terms of design and offering. The bathroom was glorious with an excellent separate walk in shower. In room wifi was excellent - as it is through out the hotel. ( I've noted this isnt always the case in London - still ). I recall we paid circa 330¬£ a night so I guess for this price you would want it to perfect. 

We ate quite a bit in the hotel and whilst the quality is good ( and quite hip )  its definitely expensive - even by kensington standards. Drinks are very expensive - Gin & Tonics were as expensive as say Claridges - So be prepared to have little change from 20¬£ per drink. Also someone could really teach the bar manager how to pour a pint of Guinness - in an irish owned hotel a straight pour ( no settle ) pint is shambolic. Also whilst I'm ranting - serving a Guinness in a hipster type non tulip glass ( that is actually a 3/4 pint glass ) is to be honest rather embarrassing. 

There is no doubt this is a pricey hotel but given its location & overall service quality its worth it.",5,2016,05,23
113,Still going strong,I have been a regular guest at The Kensington over the last few years. The service is impeccable and personnel  is friendly and professional. The rooms are well equiped. Restaurant services are excellent with a special mention for breakfast.,5,2016,05,23
113,Sunday Lunch,"The hotel has started a Sunday lunch service and visited today. It is great value at ¬£29 for three courses with a Crustacia bar to start, lovely roast beef and slow braised shoulder of lamb for main course and a dessert board to finish. Friendly warm service from the staff, it was a lovely place to relax and take in Kensington. Even saw a couple of celebs that I had no idea who they were but told they were very in by my daughter.",5,2016,05,22
113,Lovely stay.....,"i had been to this hotel years ago and decided to give it another try recently and it has had a complete facelift - amazing job combining tradition with modern, and all very tastefully finished.  Service and staff great too - always friendly and helpful  Location is bang on, close to amenities, walking distance from high Street Ken, and Kensington Gardens, and Chelsea and Knighsbridge in the other directions.  Well worth a try......",5,2016,05,21
113,Work Evening Event,"Great food and service in a lovely venue, perfect for our work evening event where we entertained colleagues from around the world. All had a wonderful evening and would recommend The Kensington for future parties/ evening drinks.",4,2016,05,20
113,Fanatastic experience!,"Visited The Kensington for a private dining experience with our business partners and couldn't have been more pleased with our evening. The quality of the service was outstanding with attentive staff who ensured our requirements were fulfilled throughout the evening. The menu had a great choice across the 3 courses and the food was both delicious and presented beautifully. The decor is stylish and the overall atmosphere was perfect for our evening, while the private dining room with it's own entrance was sophisticated and perfect for hosting our business dinner. Would highly recommend.",5,2016,05,20
113,Private dining experience,"Had a fantastic private dining experience at the hotel this week with 18 colleagues.  Cant fault the food, the venue or the staff, who went out of their way to ensure all members of the party had a great meal.   

Would highly recommend the hotel bar & restaurant and will definitely be returning again in the future",5,2016,05,19
113,So beautiful!,"I can not speak more highly of The Kensington! The decor is absolutely beautiful, the staff so attentive and the food delicious. It has a sophisticated yet fresh vibe. The perfect place for a romantic drink or a work dinner. Completely impressed; a difficult thing with such ample choice in London.",5,2016,05,19
113,Private Dining,"Our visit in May was second to none, the team at The Kensington really couldn't do enough for us, both in the lead up to the event and on the night itself. Attention to detail was outstanding, from ensuring that we had space reserved in the bar for pre-dining drinks to branding the menus with our corporate logo. The service staff were attentive throughout the course of the evening and food itself was of highest standard both in presentation and taste!  The private entrance to the dining room was a lovely touch. The ambience of the hotel is stylish and intimate without being overdone. Full marks for this amazing venue, we shall be back.  ",5,2016,05,19
113,Fabulous,"Really friendly staff, excellent service . Had afternoon tea which was really good. Loved the fact they had different lounges with comfy chairs and fires. Nothing seemed too much trouble. Bedroom was small but comfortable. Breakfast was amazing.",5,2016,05,18
113,Gem of Hotel,"Stayed for 2 nights.  Lovely service, beautiful place and great location.  Easy from Kings Road and Harrods.  Shame the dining room was closed.  Very quiet at night which is a bonus in central London.  Doorman was a delight, found us very amusing on Boris bikes which are opposite the hotel entrance.  Hotel took charge of parking the car in nearby car park which was fabulous.  Will definately go back ",5,2016,05,18
113,Wonderful hotel for business or leisure,"I stayed at the hotel recently and wanted to let people know what a wonderful place this is to stay in London.  The staff are the most courteous I have ever come across and the Manager Simon is often seen walking around the hotel ensuring everyone is happy.  We have clients over from the USA staying also and they have all praised the comfort and convenience of the hotel.  The food and rooms are very good and the beds are very comfortable.  We held an event there which was very successful, so also a great place for business meetings and events.  I very much look forward to visiting the hotel again very soon.",5,2016,05,18
113,The best,"Excelente choice, near Kensington park, you can walkman to the museums, the Natural museums Aldo its free. Its a wonderfull experience. The Nextel museums its the pr√≠ncipe Albert. The two museums are very diferentes. Your next stop must be at  Harrods. Near the hotel you will find a subway station And Manny   amenities, a shopping mall si the the most deligtfull atore with org√°nic food, gro Reyes And food. You can Aldo find many restaurants near the area italian, morocan And pizza",5,2016,05,18
113,Mrs,"I loved the location, the entrance , the hospitality and the lounge but the standard room is way too small ! There is a space for one person to pass between the dresser and the bed, I even could not find a space to pray , when I kneel I hit the table behind me . A very tight room .",3,2016,05,17
113,Five Star,A visit with a group of friends to this wonderful hotel and restaurant. Dined in Town Rooms. This restaurant has a discreet seating arrangement. Tables grouped in private areas. Menu exclusive. Fine dining excellent. Superb menu. Service of highest standard. Staff excellent. Everything was just top rate. ,5,2016,05,17
113,Amazing cocktail bar,"Spent three early evening cocktail sessions with my Son-in-Law (who was staying the the hotel with my daughter and Grandson)....What can I say! The bar staff and chief bartender were superb. They do have an excellent cocktail menu but are more than happy to make whatever you like. Classic Martinis, Manhattans and Negronis went down well. They also have a great selection of Whisky and Gin. Do talk to the staff about what you like. We also made use of the beautiful lobby and sitting areas and were made so welcome by all the front of house staff. Highly recommended. ",5,2016,05,17
113,The Kensington was truly fantastic.,"My wife and I stayed at The Kensington this past week (May 2016) for 3 days and the experience was wonderful.  The hotel is beautiful, cool & chic, the neighborhood was fantastic (the hotel's location is truly phenomenal), the staff was friendly and went out of their way to make us feel welcomed and answer questions we had about the neighborhood, restaurants, etc.  The publlic spaces in the hotel were very good- and we were made to feel totally welcome there whether we were ordering a drink, having breakfast, or just sitting and reading.  Our room was nice and very comfortable.  In short, The Kensington was awesome.

Both my wife and I would highly recommend The Kensington.  Consider checking out The Blue Bird for breakfast or lunch, about a 10 minute walk from the hotel.  It is a chic and fun spot & was a highlight of the neighborhood for us.  The walk there was stunning- you pass by several beautifully maintained private parks.",5,2016,05,15
113,"Warmly welcomed our three grandchildren, and contributed greatly to their excellent London adventure.","Arranged two adjoining rooms with a common hallway entrance, and had an Indian Teepee up in the kids' room!  Special treats and souvenir London books completed the welcome package, setting the stage for a glorious weekend.  Martyn, the fabulous concierge, recommended a great Indian restaurant within walking distance.  Elegant setting and amenities; engaging and helpful staff at every turn.  An intimate, friendly and comfortable atmosphere.",5,2016,05,15
113,Perfect spot in London,"This was a charming find in London, and we were so thankful we could stay here.  The staff was extremely kind, and helpful with arrangements and recommendations.  The hotel was beautiful with clean and updated amenities throughout.  We were also grateful for the A/C, as we were there during the unusual and unexpected heatwave last summer!  Would absolutely recommend a say here, and we will be visiting again next time in London.",5,2016,05,15
113,One to treasure,"This hotel is one of the very few who can honestly say they remain independently and absolutely focused on service. Whether it be at the, reception, the breakfast table, or the bar in the evening, you can be sure to be received with a smile, a welcome, and an honest desire to serve. 

I have been lucky enough to stay at a plethora of boutique and 5* properties, and am used to the usual welcome and the usual efficiency, but was pleasantly surprised by the staff who made the stay that much more comfortable. My toddler child was endlessly entertained and welcomed by all... Including a tent put up in the room for him to play in. 

Whilst it is probably fair to say that the majority of the guests were business guests, we did not feel out of place and can honestly say that this property serves equally well to business, leisure and family guests. 

Do make the choice to stay. It will not disappoint. ",5,2016,05,13
113,"The hotel never disappoints , it just getsbetter","This was our 14th stay at the Kensington, and as always we had a fantastic time. We always have a 4 poster suite and this one 501 was lovely. Would always recommend the hotel Staff, accommodation , service and food all great. We look forward to staying again in November",5,2016,05,12
113,"lovely hotel, wonderful staff","spent 7 nights at this friendly, elegant hotel. The rooms were lovely, the amenities were nice,  and the hotel staff were friendly and helpful. It is located in a beautiful neighborhood, close to Tube station, museums, restaurants and parks. Had a wonderful stay and will stay there again if in the area.",5,2016,05,12
113,Posh life,"We went in Mid March and got an amazing deal for the quality of this place. Nice big room, upper floor with views of S Kensington - not bad for our first few days of a 2 week UK tour. Got on the tube at Heathrow and straight to the station a block away from the hotel, couldnt be easier! Great location near the park and great restaurants steps away (Roca, Star of India). Beautiful neighborhood and would buy a place if I had a spare 4-8M Pounds laying around. Tip: unless you are just grabbing a croissant and coffee, eat in the hotel as all the breakfast places we went to nearby were crap and packed. Hotel breakfast is not cheap, but actually a good value due to the wonderful food, service and ambience. Staff was super friendly and enthusiastically greeted us every trip in and out and were very helpful. Really set a great tone for our trip.",5,2016,05,11
113,Not enough room to swing a cat,"Really disappointed - it was a special weekend and we paid a lot of money to stay here. Basically the room looked like a cell - no pictures, no decor, no room. Cross with myself for being duped by the photos on the hotel website.

As in the previous review the concierges were brilliant, however I was told that this was to make up for the lack of space in the rooms! 

Location perfect - I was able to sit outside the hotel with a glass of wine, but alas, not only did I have to pay for the wine (expected), I also had to pay for them to bring the wine all the way to the front of the hotel (not expected).",3,2016,05,10
113,"Amazing hotel, best staff, great restaurant!","My wife and I had an amazing experience. What made it the best is the people and the comfortable environment. I forget everyones name, but trust me its everyone. George, Michael, Raphael, the amazing cool bartenders, front desk staff always helping, and OUR regular waiter/sommelier and the MAN from Romania Ighor! He always recommended some great wine like Jouney's End! We loved coming back from a long day or show and just hang out to end the evening.

The food was fantastic and felt like we were at home. We ate in the open living room area by a fireplace, by a sunny window, the epic lounge, and the restaurant part. Just so cool. You sat wherever you wanted.

Room was a superior room and very nice and plenty big. Elegant, comfortable, and cool. Always fresh bottled water and fresh peaches were left! Perfect!

On top of everything they saved us when are our condo for the balance of our stay was not what we expected. I called them and they had the welcome wagon ready for us upon our return for 4 more great nights! They saved the week and London for us!  

We'll be back in the fall hopefully!

Peter and Diane",5,2016,05,10
113,Lovely Hotel But Lacking,"We largely enjoyed our time at the Kensington. The hotel is situated in a great area for walking to various sights, a great bakery and fun restaurants. Our room was spacious and check in was friendly. We especially appreciated the doormen (all of whom were just brilliant) and concierge who were all amazing. George was particularly helpful, and it was a joy being greeted by his demeanor and smile every day. We enjoyed wine and a small snack on the day of arrival in the hotel bar. However, the next morning, the experience we had when getting breakfast was  less than ideal. Overall, the breakfast room was just ""uncomfortable."" The hostess staff were not the friendliest which is fine as they were busy when we went down. But when seated, we literally had to wait over a half hour just to have someone wait on us. Overall, it seemed the waiters were not told we were waiting to be served. We initially thought this was because it was busy. But then we observed other guests receiving far more prompt service. This was unfortunate. It was not until we complained (after waiting 40 mins) that a waiter finally came to take our order and he was nice enough to apologize. We are from Seattle so do not dress up for breakfast, which it seemed a lot of the guests were doing. But all guests should receive similar service period. Or if the hotel wishes to mandate a dress code for breakfast, they are more than welcome to do that, but quite honestly, it was not as though we had on shorts or something (we were both wearing jeans and long sleeved shirts. After the less than positive experience, it would have been great if a manager or at least the hostess would have come over to apologize in person. But that never happened.  Overall, the Kensington was a good choice and our experience there was positive with all of the staff outside of this incident. But we did not utilize the restaurant again for breakfast and if you do, perhaps you should try wearing a tuxedo just to make sure your experience is more positive than ours.",4,2016,05,09
113,Marvellous jem,"As a regular traveller, I stay in all kind of hotels. When staying at the Kensington, I was more than positively surprised. This hotel is extremely service minded towards its customers and the level of friendliness of all their staff is beyond compare. I think these two qualities are becoming a rarity rather than a given in the hotel industry. 
When I lost an item during my stay, the staff immediately went the extra mile and within half an hour the problem got solved. They kept me informed every step of the way. 
Next to that, the hotel's design and decoration is warm, welcoming and very beautiful. In the future when staying in London, this hotel will always have my preference over any other hotel.",5,2016,05,09
113,Awesome hotel,"This hotel was amazing! The staff were so nice and always there to help you with anything! I would definitely stay there again in London. Room was nice, clean, and modern. The concierge was available 24/7 and helped me arrange a ride at 0330 in the morning to the airport. The neighborhood felt really safe. There were a bunch of places you could walk to and eat. Japanese, Italian, and even a polish restaurant. Thanks for a great stay!  ",5,2016,05,09
113,Attending graduation at Imperial college.,"Excellent hotel experience altogether. The location is outstanding, right at the corner of Old Brompton road with a 3 minute walk to South Kensington tube station, access to multiple outstanding restaurants. Beautiful design of the lobby and the common seating areas and restaurants. Room is nice, bed comfortable, bathroom though is a bit too tight. Overall the Kensington is a superb hotel, and I would stay in it again every time I visit London.",5,2016,05,08
113,Classic style...,"Located in porches area.... its easy to walk around close to national museum and other touristic sites .

Also lots of eat outs....

Recommended to walk or take bicycle to reach the main Buckingham Palace from this hotel.",5,2016,05,07
113,One night,"What a beautiful hotel. From the moment you walk in you are put at ease, not just by the fantastically polite and friendly staff but also by the beautiful aromas that greet you as soon as you take your first breath in. Before checking in I had a coffee in the most beautiful lounge where I was superbly looked after and once checked I headed straight to my room. The quality of furniture, surroundings and bedding was first class and the bathroom was huge. After settling down I had a few cocktails in the newly decorated bar and the service was absolutely spot on. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and will most certainly be going back.",5,2016,05,06
113,Only gets better! Home from Home,"To find a beautiful hotel with special rooms, a super smart bar, great Irish Art and super food and lastly the obligatory professional friendly staff. If you want to walk to the unmissable Natural History Museum, V&A or even to walk to Harrods for an oyster lunch, this is the place for you!",5,2016,05,05
113,World Class,"Boy, what a classy place to stay in London. I try a different hotel every time I visit London (been 20 times at least since 1995) but this is the first hotel that I would instantly return to. My three night stay was perfect in every way, the highlight being the friendly helpful staff. People have complained about the room sizes being too small but then obviously they havent been to London much - the city is famous for small(ish) rooms so people have to just get over it. Yes the rooms are not Ballroom size but perfectly fine with great beds and a great mini-bar, the rooms are also QUIET (something very important for me). It also gets top marks for location (I love this part of London), Decor (classic English contemporary), Food (English breakfasts cooked perfectly), and a cool cocktail bar (the bartender knows how to make a killer Bloody Mary! :) 
One comment that I would like to make however, PARENTS: if you bring your kids here, please tell them to respect the hotels property, and act accordingly!! There were half a dozen 10 year olds running around the place like they were in their own basement!",5,2016,05,05
113,Gorgeous Hotel,"Absolutely enjoyed our stay, lovely hotel rooms, staff were very friendly especially George our waiter at breakfast. He even organised a special breakfast for my birthday. Great location as well. Would definitely recommend staying here!",5,2016,05,03
113,Luxury and Great Service,"I stayed at the Kensington with my wife and two young kids last week. We had a family room which was well apportioned and comfortable. The hotel is centrally located within walking distances of museums, Chelsea FC and S Kensington Tube. We had a slight issue on arrival but when we explained this to management it was dealt with speedily and generously. The GM Simon Maguire introduced himself to us on a number of occasion and was keen to know if he or his team could make our stay more comfortable. This is an unusual but very welcome practice and in keeping with the general high standards at The Kensington. We will be back again.",5,2016,05,03
113,very small room and very small bathroom,"Room small and bathroom small, though we did take an offer price online with travel site - door to the bathroom actually hit the toilet on opening as it was so small! Only a shower in there too - would have liked a bath, but the main Hotel lovely.",4,2016,05,03
113,"Unbeatable hospitality courtesy of George, Michael and Simon","The hotel is just like in the pictures: cozy, modern and clean. We found the hotel to be very neat/clean and perfectly accommodating for two people

 Staff has been a great asset because they was very attentive, gracious and efficient. No request was too big or too small. Special mentions to George and Michael at the concierge,as well as Simon the general manager.

My husband and I visited London for our anniversary and at the suggestion of some friends we chose to stay in this particular area.The location in south kensington could not be more convenient and idyllic.The area is great and we were able to walk many places, taking public transit for the rest of our stay

Our room was an incredibly special and lovely place to stay. It is not only elegant, well furnished, and pristinely maintained but the bed was very comfortable too. Perfect distance to tube and trains, best farmers markets, luscious shops and superb cafes.We loved being able to walk to so many wonderful restaurants and cosy spots for an evening cocktail. 

Thank you for your accommodation, patience and general warmth, any guest of yours is very blessed and Can't say enough good things about the wonderful hospitality we received here",5,2016,05,02
113,Birthday weekend at The Kensington,"This beautiful hotel truly is a gem! 
My boyfriend and I celebrated my birthday here for 3 nights, and we couldn't have asked for more. 
When we first came to check in our room wasn't ready yet, so they put us in a double room on the first floor. The room was gorgeous but we felt that it was unnecessary for the two of us to have two beds, and we asked if we could wait until our first room was ready. Of course, this wasn't a problem, we were told to leave our belongings in the double room and that they would move our things as soon as the room was ready. Meanwhile, we were strolling the nearby surroundings, Hyde Park is really near and perfect for a nice walk!
When we came back we got a big apology for the room switch, which I thought was unnecessary since we were the ones that asked to change rooms in the first place, but the staff is very polite and service minded, so I wasn't surprised at all. To make up for this, they put us in a junior suit at the top floor (!). The room was lovely, just the perfect size for a romantic weekend. The bathroom had both a shower and a tub, which was perfect for relaxing after a long day of sightseeing. I couldn't have asked for anything more, I almost felt ashamed for making the staff feel like they did anything wrong when they absolutely didn't do anything wrong at all! This was the friendliest and most service minded staff I've ever met.
If your looking for somewhere to eat or have a drink, the Town House restaurant is a really excellent choice! I had the most amazing duck there, it was a wonderful evening and we even got champagne at the end of our dinner because they found out about my birthday, and that was really sweet of them! 
The K bar has a really good selection of drinks, and the staff is really nice there as well. 
The only weird thing happening to us was at check out, and they wanted to charge us for a room service breakfast that we never had. It all came to a clear when they realized that this was because of the room switch, and we were cleared from that bill. 

This is the most perfect hotel at a really good location in London, I would recommend everyone to stay here at some point, we'll be back for sure!",5,2016,05,01
113,Lovely stay,"I really enjoyed my stay here. The hotel was so clean very hygienic. Food was beautiful great staff always there to help. Welcome you from the moment you walk through the door. Room was a decent size I was very pleased with this hotel and I will defiantly be returning soon. 
",5,2016,05,01
113,Excellent Excellent Excellent,"We really enjoyed our time in London and felt very comfortable here. our room was cosy, the hotel is clean and decorated with love and more importantly: staff is really great. We appreciate the tips they gave us (the big ben, Tower hill is our favourite) and their effort for making our stay perfect. They took good care of us, although we rarely stayed indoors during our short stay as we were discovering the city most of the day. Nevertheless, they made sure that we were fine and checked a couple of times if there was anything they could do to make our stay even more comfortable. Thanks for looking after us stay at your hotel. We will definitely come back one day!",5,2016,05,01
113,Great Stay in South Ken,"I've been staying at this hotel for the past several years when in London. The location is very good with many great pubs, restaurants and other attractions in the area. This is a high end hotel with service that shows precision and attention to detail at a price that is very reasonable by London standards. The staff are friendly and do whatever they can to make your stay enjoyable. ",5,2016,05,01
113,fantastic,"The hotel was great and the amenities were also fantastic, This is a nice stay purely because of the location from the musuems of south kensington : The victorian and albert museum, the science museum, and my personal favorite was the natural history museum which were all very close, on our second day we went to the royal Albert hall and afterwards took a very nice walk through the Hyde park and we loved the water pond with swan birds gathering around it was absolutely spectacular. The hotel was also close to nearby traditional Italian restaurant with pizza made traditionally from the stone baked oven and very nice atmosphere all round. there were also a few shops on old brompton which we like to visit for a great wine and selection of meats too. The inside was very glamorous and my personal favorite was the cocktail bar which opens to anyone and was very live during all nights that we stayed here . My fiance and myself had a great time here and we were treated very well by all members of the staff and won't hesitate to recommend anyone coming to London. we hope to stay here again in the near future.",5,2016,05,01
113,Wonderful hotel and wonderful staff!,"I had a wonderful weekend at the Kensington celebrating my daughter's birthday. The hotel was in excellent order, clean and with excellent design and interiors without being ""stiff"". Very friendly and helpful staff. Great location as well. Will return!",5,2016,04,28
113,London Marathon Weekend,"Stayed as husband was competing in London Marathon. Hotel is situated five minute walk from South Kensington tube station along road lined with lots of places to eat and The Hummingbird Bakery. We ate at Byron, a burger restaurant, food good and staff friendly. We arrived at hotel late afternoon Friday. There was a problem with issuing room keys, but receptionist Nicole was excellent, very friendly and welcoming, took us to bar for a complimentary drink while keys were sorted out fairly quickly. Room was very nice, spotlessly clean and bed comfortable. Turndown service is a nice touch and Jellybabies and personal note to my husband competing in marathon was very thoughtful. Great choice for breakfast. Waiting staff very nice. Although on first morning nobody took our order for hot food and toast for some time until we asked for it. Also coffee was not good. Asked for it stronger the next morning and was fine. On checking out staff member George was helpful storing bags for later. He and Guido on the door were great wishing us a safe journey and congratulating my husband on his run. Would stay again. ",4,2016,04,27
113,Very good ,"Checked into this hotel for 2 nights last weekend. I normally stay in sister hotel the Bloomsbury on business mid week so decided to try this for a change. My friend also stayed at the same hotel. We were both disappointed with our rooms which were very small and plain for a hotel of this rating. Other than that we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, the rest of the hotel was very nice and the service was excellent, particularly George the Concierge who was a pleasure to deal with. I would recommend the hotel for location and service with the caveat around the bedrooms. ",4,2016,04,25
113,Wonderful hotel,"Lovely atmosphere and staff were very welcoming. Bar and restaurant very inviting. Bedroom very comfortable with great facilities.Really enjoyed the continental breakfast, great selection. Would visit again And would recommend highly. ",5,2016,04,25
113,Short break,Very welcoming front of house staff. Rooms very clean and well equipped. Room size was adequate. Quick internet . Good location. Did not use gym facilities or restaurant.  Would choose to stay here again.,4,2016,04,25
113,Welcoming and superb service,"Stayed here for my birthday and was thoroughly spoilt by the lovely staff . Had a lovely cake and champagne free of charge in our room waiting for me as my husband mentioned when checking in that it was my birthday . Location good as in great area of London . Tube station not far away and Harrods ,Natural History museum very close to walk to easily . Would recommend this Hotel and would love to stay again , breakfast and evening meal excellent .",5,2016,04,24
113,Fabulous find! ,"So thankful we expanded our search beyond the main touristy area and found this beautiful hotel!  It's in a lovely area and just a quick couple minutes walk from the tube. The walk has several eateries we enjoyed throughout the stay.  We stayed for 6 nights in the smallest room and it didn't feel cramped at all. Beautiful, well appointed, clean, and quiet. We appreciated the special touches of the nightly chocolates, sparkling water, and slippers by the bed.  The Nespresso machine was also a treat.  We will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and book again if we ever get back to London.  ",5,2016,04,24
113,Great Luxury Hotel in a wonderful location,"I have now twice enjoyed this property.  If you are looking for an upscale location which is focused on attention to detail and service, then this is the place for you.  First a word on the location... a quiet street in South Kensington...with superb dining options and a short walk to a tube station that will give you access to all of London.  The hotel is also walking distance to museums and both Hyde and Kensington Parks.  The rooms are well appointed.  On one stay I had a very large, front facing room, and on my second, a smaller but still well appointed room on the rear of the property.  Rooms have all the luxury amenities you could imagine.  My rate on both stays included free continental breakfast in their comfortable, library-like dining room.  The selections at the buffet were 1st class.  There is also a full service menu as well.  Quite a few people enjoyed the afternoon tea and cakes in the two large drawing rooms off the lobby.  In summary- fabulous location in a great neighborhood.  I highly recommend.",5,2016,04,21
113,Good hotel- lovely place to stay in,"Always a good place to spend a few days in London. The staff are superb particularly at reception and the front of the house.The Concierge is nature's gentleman and so helpful.One would like to have the Man Friday's available all the time.
Lovely atmosphere in the bar,dining room and sitting areas.
Reasonably priced hotel that delivers a good quality service.",5,2016,04,21
113,Pure charm and class,"Wonderfully refined and cosy hotel. If you've travelled far, this is the London 'home' you want to experience. If you're on business, the choice is convenient, comfortable, with a elegant sense of community and class. All Londoners or big city dwellers know a city like this is short of space, so if you're after football field size rooms I'd go elsewhere where they usually compromise on character. Can't recommend enough to those in search of the true London stay.",5,2016,04,20
113,Gorgeous hotel and wonderful stay,"We stayed as a couple for Valentines weekend (just the one night) this year.  From arrival to leaving, everyone was so friendly, courteous and happy to help. When we arrived, we were upgraded which was a wonderful surprise. Our room was ready so we could go straight up (arrived about 1pm) and we were also given complimentary tickets to an exhibit at the V&A which we had mentioned we wanted to go to. Great location to be in - easy access to the sights of London. We ate in the restaurant in the evening which was great food (also had a snack earlier in the bar which was a great place, and again, great staff). Bedroom/bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was a good size with a fantastic shower. Breakfast (continental for us) was ample and filling.  We weren't returning home until the afternoon so the hotel kept our bags for us whilst we visited the parks nearby.  Overall, really lovely stay and I really do hope to go back at some point. If I do ever stay in London again, it will definitely be The Kensington.",5,2016,04,20
113,Hotel Kensigton,"I spent a few days and was very pleased. The concierge was very friendly. The reception was excellent. Cosy rooms, friendly service. Thank you all who made me feel good. Conveniently located near the park, the museums. The breakfast was delicious. ",4,2016,04,20
113,Always a wonderful stay,"I've stayed here 3 times now, and each time is a delight. Apples in the lobby, biscuits in the room. Staff all poised and friendly at all times. I got the impression that it's as pleasant to work there as to stay there as a guest. 

As location goes, I found it reasonably well connected by bus to the transit system, and the walk to the V&A and Natural History Museum is just long enough to be stimulating.",5,2016,04,19
113,VERY PLEASANT STAY,We were booked in for one night only.  It was a very pleasant stay.  The staff were exceptionally pleasant. We ate a light lunch with a bottle of wine and prices were totally acceptable. The only slight criticism was the size of the room.  We paid ¬£170 but the room was definitely on the small side with room for lnly one person in the bathroom at a time.,4,2016,04,19
113,Simply The Best,The service at The Kensington is second to none and the clenliness and comfort of the rooms is of the highest standard. The decor of the hotel is very tasteful and of the highest quality. Location is ideal for business and pleasure in the west end of the city with excellent restaurants and museums within walking distance. I always try to stay at The Kensington when I visit the city.,5,2016,04,19
113,Customer Service Excellence! ,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at The Kensington and the experience was second to none. The hotel itself is beautiful with character and charm in abundance. A stunning building and in my opinion, the perfect and for me, the only choice when looking for somewhere elegant and comfortable to stay in London. 

Whether it's breakfast, dinner or cocktails at the bar...everything is prepared and served to the highest possible standard. The warm and personable team really set this hotel apart from others I have stayed at. From the Management to Waiting staff, this team really know how to deliver customer service excellence with ease! They make you feel welcome and special from the moment you arrive - very genuine and understated. I was particularly bowled over with the attention to detail and eagerness by everyone to ensure I had the best possible experience during my stay....which I did and then some! 

The Kensington gets 10 out of 10 and I will be highly recommending this first class experience to everyone I know! 

Impressive! Faultless! All the stars! *****
",5,2016,04,18
113,Great experience for the value,"Everyone at the hotel demonstrated a strong will to make your stay comfortable and memorable.  Very hospitable staff.  While there were a few missteps during my stay, all were excusable given the staff's apologetic response and genuine desire to meet my needs.  ",5,2016,04,18
113,A little Palace of Versailles of its own...,"Amazing hotel, so beautiful it was hard to leave the hotel and explore the area around it ! 
Beautiful d√©cor, our suite was impressive (we felt like royalties), very friendly and professional staff, dinner and breakfast were very good as well. Nothing to say except we will definitely come back !!

Thank you",5,2016,04,18
113,We actually felt like Royalty. Above and beyond!,"I decided to book the hotel for a night to celebrate my wife's birthday and to get an evening away from the children. The hotel was recommended to me by a friend and it did not disappoint. We were greeted as we got out of our taxi, my day/night bag and my wife's extra large suitcase kindly taken from us. I was already starting to relax having just endured a 90 minute delayed train journey. We were checked in within seconds and escorted to our room, awaiting us was champagne on ice and a room do die for. The room was warm, clean, and spacious, it had character and charm. 
10 minutes later a knock at the door and a dessert surprise with the message 'Happy Birthday' written in chocolate, delightful. The weather turned so rather then venture out we decided to stay for afternoon tea (again recommended to me). It was sublime! The tea was hot and refreshing, the champagne and food were heavenly. The tearoom was again, comfortable, elegant and perfect as my wife and I enjoyed our first 2 hours in 2 years together without the kids. The general manager, Simon Maguire came over to wish us an enjoyable stay and to wish my wife a happy birthday. Not sure of what to do he recommended visiting the V & A museum, a 5 minute walkaway, another kind gesture as he provided me with 2 exhibition tickets to see the wonderful work of Botticelli. 
We decided to stay out for dinner before returning to the The Kensington for a famous cocktail and a beer in the bar. We picked a lovely little corner by the warm fire and enjoyed a wonderful evening together. Exhausted, we retired to our room to find the lights had been dimmed, slippers by the bed and a chocolate on the pillow. It's these wonderful little gestures that were the icing on the cake for us. One of the few nights in London where I have slept right through without any outdoor disturbance. We enjoyed a wonderful breakfast in the morning with a variety of options. The Eggs benedict was excellent! We checked out, headed home and now back to reality. The experience now just feels like a dream! The same feeling you get after being on holiday for 2 weeks! The staff were friendly and attentive, the food and drinks were tasteful and fresh, the room was comfortable and clean. I cannot fault this place.",5,2016,04,17
113,Charming luxury hotel,"This was our second stay and although it is at the expensive end of the scale we would definitely return for the great service and attention to detail. It is in a handy location, very close to South Kensington tube station and with interesting shops and restaurants nearby. Our room had a king size bed and although the bathroom was the usual small size typical of London hotels it was functional. ",5,2016,04,17
113,PERSONAL SERVICE + ELEGANT SURROUNDINGS,"I certainly agree with all the five star reviews.  I was surprised no one has mentioned the multitude of colorful pillows downstairs in the lounges and the diningroom in that, in a way, they epitomize the friendly, warm atmosphere of the hotel.  The service is great, but the smiles that come with it are what made our stay so special.  I admit that sometimes we ask concierges too many questions, but the last answers given (after 8 days!) were as gracious as the first.   The hotel, as noted, may be a bit away from the some of the well known sites, but there are many restaurants and pubs within walking distance - nice for an evening meal.",5,2016,04,16
113,Great service and lovely hotel,"Outstanding service, as always from the Doyle Collection. Incredibly helpful staff, lovely hotel and surroundings. A wonderful breakfast to round off a great stay - wish we'd stayed longer. Location is a little out of town which was perfect for us but with good tube links. Will be returning and continuing to stay in the Doyle Hotels",5,2016,04,13
113,Superb!,"Amazing place! Fantastic restaurant and fast service!Bar was expensive but what you expect in place like South Kensington! Room was spotless and bed was very comfortable. Few bus stops away from Harrods shopping moll which is very convenience. 
If budget will allow ,I will definitely stay again !",5,2016,04,08
113,Excellent hotel and service,"Have stayed at this hotel 6/8 April from checking in to checking out this hotel cannot be faulted. The staff are extremely courteous, the room and facilities spotless and the breakfast was excellent. Would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2016,04,08
113,Love this hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for six nights and thoroughly enjoyed our experience. It was our request to have a quiet room, not an easy task in London. Yes, our room faced an interior courtyard and allowed us to sleep soundly. The room was not especially large, but the bed was comfortable and the bathroom well appointed. The maid service was attentive and efficient. Our breakfasts were outstanding..lovely dining area with excellent quality choices.  The wait staff tried hard to accommodate our needs. The consierge staff were always helpful with giving directions and suggesting restaurants. We would definitely stay at the Kensington the next time we travel to London. ",5,2016,04,06
113,Just fantastic!,"My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at the Kensington this weekend and enjoyed a fantastic time.  From the moment we entered through the front door we found ourselves in a bubble of relaxation and attentiveness, a far cry from the hustle and bustle of the city around us.

The concierge and front desk team give you a warm welcome or farewell each time you enter or leave the hotel, the bar team headed up by Ben were superb, attentive and very knowledgeable and the Breakfast was fantastic value either for continental or cooked.  I would also like to thank Alexandrou for his attention during our stay.

We were in London to celebrate my Wife's birthday.  I didn't recall mentioning this during the booking process but we were delighted to find a card and Birthday plate in our beautiful bedroom on arrival.  Thank you!!

The hotel is located very close to South Kensington station and walking distance to the museums, Portobello Road, Kensington /Hyde Parks and the West End.",5,2016,04,06
113,We were completely wowed!,"We totally loved this hotel.  The rooms were great, the public spaces and restaurant and bar were utterly charming, the hotel staff couldn't have been more responsive and friendly, and the exercise facilities were completely first class.  We chose this initially because it was a little less costly than a few other choices, but it ended up far exceeding our expectations and we wanted for nothing!",5,2016,04,05
113,Best experience ever!,"Had a flawless experience ever by visiting one of the best London hotel with my wife. Outstanding service, cleanest rooms, delicious food and great concierge support. The K Bar is just a fabulous place we've enjoyed to stay every evening. Would  recommend everyone to meet Max, the bartender. This well-spoken and extremely intelligent young guy been doing an absolutely fantastic show for us both every evening in the bar, doing great cocktails, giving an amazing piece of knowledge and experience. Will miss him a lot. Also special thanks to Simon and every part of hotel in particular creating an amazing journey for me and my wife.",5,2016,04,05
113,"Excellent Hotel in very convenient location, yet quiet.","Great hotel with very friendly staff. Room was excellent, very clean & with all expected facilities. Location great - 5 min walk from tube, yet quiet which is a plus for London. Will definitely stay there again & will recommend to friends & family.",5,2016,04,05
113,A very nice hotel in a great location,"It a great hotel and its common areas are really nice and comfortable.The breakfast is also great and the staff very kind. Just to mention that one day we were back to the hotel at 5pm (we left at 9am) and the room was not still clean up, but the management solved it quickly. In general, it is a nice option to stay in London!",4,2016,04,04
113,Lovely Staff,Had a wonderful weekend stay at the Kensington - very classy and comfortable boutique hotel with a very charming atmosphere. Had a lovely surprise knock on the door with a plate of wonderful  treats for my fianc√© on the morning of his birthday,5,2016,04,03
113,Revisit,"Another wonderful time at The Kensington Hotel
Excellent service all round from well trained attentive quality staff members who appear to thoroughly enjoy their roll at the hotel and this rubs off on visitors.
Quality room again and first class food in the Town House restaurant again with very attentive quality staff.
We look forward to returning on our next visit to The Royal Albert Hall.  ",5,2016,04,01
113,Felt like a Queen,Finding this gem of a hotel was as easy as taking the Tube from the airport and getting off at S. Kensington station.  A few minutes later we were at this absolutely lovely hotel.  Thank goodness our room was ready.  Our bed was extraordinarily comfortable with a large bathroom with shower.  Plenty of shelves for necessities. A Nespresso coffee maker was the best!  The location was perfect with shops and restaurants galore!  Staff couldn't have been more helpful. Breakfast included an huge assortment of food and the oatmeal on the a la carte menu was my choice every day!  Would stay here again in a heartbeat!,5,2016,03,30
113,"A comfortable,  refined few-days spending in London"," The service was very good,the staff are friendliness and attentiveness,check-in/check out without problem.

113,Kensington Hotel Review,"My wife and I stayed at the hotel for five nights.  The location was convenient to the underground, the staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room was comfortable and the in room Nespresso machine was a godsend for my wife. We would stay here again if returning to London. Our only issue in the room was the people next door who had their TV volume up too high.  However, when we mentioned it to the front desk, it was taken care of immediately. ",5,2016,03,28
113,Stunning service - feels more like an exclusive club than a hotel!,"I have only just got back home from my first stay at The Kensington, and am fighting through the jetlag to post a review as quickly as I can to tell the entire internet about this amazing little hotel!

I was in town for only a couple of nights, on business, and having heard about The Kensington from some of my workmates, I was looking forward to see if the service could match the reputation.

I was not disappointed!

From the juice and hot towels on arrival, to the supremely comfortable king-sized bed, to the turn-down service, to the complimentary water and wifi - this was an amazing stay.  My colleagues and I worked from one of the beautiful, comfortable lounges on the ground floor for most of one of the days and had the staff serving us the entire time and making us feel welcome.  

The hotel manager, Simon, and his team should be immensely proud of the level of service they provide!  Simon leads by example, taking a personal interest in making sure every guest was having the best possible time in this home away from home, and the staff we dealt with were polite, efficient and professional.  

Talking to some of the other guests over our stay, most seemed to be repeat visitors - and it is easy to see why!  I could go on and on about the little things that made my stay at The Kensington memorable, but this review is already too long...so I'll just finish with this: I struggle to see how I will ever want to stay anywhere else when I travel to London.",5,2016,03,26
113,Best value hotel I have experienced in London,"I stay in London from time to time on business, and generally find that you have to pay a lot of money to get better than mediocre.  However, I have now stayed twice at the Kensington, and it really is a lovely place to stay without having to pay silly prices.  It has a natural elegance and charm as well as comfort, and I couldn't fault it.
Brilliant freshly cooked breakfast - far better than the usual self-serve.
Both times the room was slightly tight on space, but what can you expect in that price bracket?
I also stupidly left something behind, but they efficiently posted it on for me.
I will make this my default choice from now on whenever in London.",5,2016,03,24
113,"Day trip only, but based at hotel for a visit to ""Botticceli Re-imagined"" exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum","Tickets sourced by Hotel, with V&A Museum 10 minutes walk away, this was an excellent outing.
First class snack lunch taken in hotel lounge after viewing the exhibition, with attentive staff and good choice menu. Soup, club sandwiches and coffee were high quality and reasonably priced.",5,2016,03,24
113,My favorite Hotel,"This is my best boutique hotel experience in London so far. The lobby is very cozy, and very nicely furnished by mixing authentic English furniture with Persian rugs, oriental table funky art and music. The bar is very warm and welcoming, not to mention the great drinks and cocktails. the rooms are VERY clean and comfortable. the staff were professional from my first visit and they became even better in my later visits. I'm always look forward to staying in the Kensington Hotel everytime i visit London.",5,2016,03,23
113,Excellent stay ,"What an amazing gem in London. Amazing staff, amazing general manager (Simon) and the cocktails are a must. A wonderful stay with the most attentive staff. Highly recommend it.

The room was lovely and the breakfast was relaxed and excellent.",5,2016,03,22
113,Fantastic property. Great location.,"The Kensington is situated in  a lovely area of London. The underground is quite close (less than 4  minutes walk), making it a great place to stay with easy access  to the rest of London. The staff at the hotel are very kind and go out  of their way to make you  feel welcome. The lobby bar is very relaxing. Rooms are a nice size and have great amenities.",5,2016,03,21
113,Lovely birthday stay!,"My partner and I stayed for one night as a surprise for his birthday. The staff were excellent, we were greeted warmly and the receptionist made every effort to check us in quickly (I did this whilst my partner was in the bar) and discreetly to avoid ruining the surprise that we were staying. We sampled a few of the superb cocktails in the decadent K Bar before heading to our room.
The room, though small, was clean and comfortable with nice toiletries, and a birthday message and sweet treat was left on the coffee table! We didn't spend too much time in the hotel as we went out for dinner with friends, but they have a lovely turndown service and when we returned to the room there was a pot of rose tea and a hot flask of water waiting for us, which I felt was a really thoughtful touch.
Breakfast was delicious (Traditional Full English for me, Eggs Royale for my partner) and all of the staff were very accommodating and friendly throughout our stay.
All in all a really pleasant stay and I would definitely recommend to others!",4,2016,03,20
113,Great Hotel!!! Highly recommend!,"The Kensington is an excellent hotel property. The comfortable, quiet elegance is so welcoming at the end of a long day of sightseeing. We especially appreciated the helpful concierge and staff. As first time visitors to London we had lots of questions. I would definitely stay here again! ",5,2016,03,20
113,Great Hotel.  Fantastic Location.,"A fantastic 'home base' for your trip to London.  Located in posh South Kensington, the hotel has great public areas and a nice workout facility.  The rooms are nice but small (pretty standard for London).  I upgraded to a King room and had a surprising amount of space compared to my traveling companions in Queen rooms.  The location is superb.  A short walk to the South Kensington tube station in one direction or a slightly longer walk to Gloucester Road tube station in the other direction.  Lots of great restaurants and pubs nearby.  Plenty of places for coffee, breakfast, lunch, dinner and late night dining.  2 grocery stores and a drugstore nearby.  The Kensington will almost certainly be my new home away from home in London.",5,2016,03,18
113,Beautiful hotel in an excellent location,"To hotel exceeded all of our expectations. The staff were welcoming knowledgable and professional. The hotl itself was beautiful and in a lovely area. It is convenient to the underground and many things to do are I in walking distance. 
It was a truly excellent experience. ",5,2016,03,17
113,Lovely experience!,"Nice location! Superb style in The rooms and in the lobby.
Pampered every night with a special amenity (great infusions and chocolate!).
A very warm welcome was given by George each and every time we passed by the entrance. Always ready to help, smiling in a very spontaneous way.
Breakfast experience is marvellous, thanks to a very Good team.",5,2016,03,15
113,Lovely Gem in London . Home away from home,"This is one of my favorite hotels in London and I have stayed in many , including the top 5 star hotels. I keep coming back. Lovely location. It feels like  home away from home and the staff is lovely. ",5,2016,03,15
113,Mrs Ljunggren ,"A very nice hotel with  staff that were very service minded. We will definitely return. 
Our room was slightly small but comfortable, soundproofed against street but quite responsive in hotel. Breakfast  was great. The location is good and there are lots of restaurangs in the hoods. ",4,2016,03,13
113,Worth every Penny,"I had a wonderful birthday and I am glad I stayed at this place. This is a one of a kind London hotel that is great for even large groups. I never met staff who are very nice and helpful over our stay, Check in was flexible and easy thanks to Mariam & Special mention to George who went above and beyond to make sure we were always happy and he even knew all our names which was a Big plus. My friends had dinner over at the townhouse restaurant and later we hung out by the bar counter and watched the bartenders swirl the cocktails all night long. It was a very relaxing, homely night. The design is very unique so all my friends loved talking about and taking photos of it. The hotel is also near all my favorite restaurants with cuisines ranging from italian to japanese, There were a few traditional english style pubs within a short walking distance so that was a perk, this will be an amazing if we manage to visit London again. I would recommend this for a group of young people and for someone looking for a homely stay in south kensington London.",5,2016,03,12
113,"Great neighborhood, beautiful hotel","We stayed in a junior suite which was very comfortable and roomy. The king bed was just firm enough. My only complaint was the bathroom had very little counter space to store our toiletries. We stayed in two different rooms on either end of a trip to Italy. My daughter who was studying abroad was staying almost next door so that is why we chose the location. We found it very easy to walk or take the convenient tube anywhere we wanted to go. The Consigneur was very helpful assisting us to get to various places and also choose restaurants. The breakfast, although unfortunately not included in the cost of the room, was very varied and delicious.",4,2016,03,12
113,Made really welcome,"Without doubt a first class hotel, could not fault anything about my stay.
On arrival we were offered juice and a warm hand towel, and offered a upgrade at no extra cost !!!.
All the staff were helpful and very friendly,it was a real pleasure to stay, 
",5,2016,03,11
113,Wonderful stay,"The location is great, museums are very close by and there are tons of great restaurants in the area. 
The people in this hotel are so nice, they go the extra mile to make you feel at home and they cater to your every whim. Breakfast is absolutely delicious and the decor of the lobby and restaurant is beautiful.
We had a beautiful room and everything was clean and comfortable.
I wouldn't stay anywhere else in London!!!!",5,2016,03,08
113,enjoyed the hospitality,Fantastic experience staying here and the amenities were great. The gym is one of the best that I have seen in a London hotel. There is a cocktail bar that serves drinks till late and the bar staff were all amazing. Our room had a nice view and big enough for London and overall it was a great stay.,5,2016,03,08
113,Excellent service in a privilieged location at a reasonable cost,"I stayed at the Kensington several years ago, but this time it was different....the renovated Kensington and the staff have made a real impact on this trip to London.

Righr from the check-in to the departure, every staff memeber in all the services have been helpful, knowledgeable and prompt in their interventions.

Outstanding valur for money considering London prices and prime location at the heart of South Kensington, with transportation alternatives at the doorstep.
",4,2016,03,08
113,it's was my new found treasure in London,"We loved the kensington hotel and the surrounding south kensington area because of all the lovely things that you could see while stating here. the tube tube station was very close just a few minutes whenever we needed to explore the greater London. our room was nice overlooking the old brompton street , the room was clean , shower had plenty of water to flow, clean bathtub and very comfortable space. we explored the museums around and most evenings we ate around the nice restaurants or had a glass of wine at the Vini Italiani wine shop just a few steps on old brompton road. All staff were amazing with special mentions to Michael  and George. We highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,03,08
113,Romantic and excellence,"The hotel was everything that we had expected. The location was perfect for what we wanted, within walking distance to the major areas we wanted to visit in our limited time in London. The hotel was clean, and had everything we needed in it. The bed was comfortable and the air conditioning was perfect for the hot summer nights in London.They also had the mini bar well stocked with drinks and snacks,  (Kensington is full of great bars and restaurants) and concierge was really helpful, offering useful information for first timers like us‚Ä¶ Definitely exceeded my expectations!  my new wife loved staying here for all the days of our honeymoon. Firstly we thought  service was great, staff was a fantastic, extremely flexible and helpful at all times, they provided us with ample information and greeted us at the hotel with huge welcome. I would highly recommend this place for people looking for a nice classy hotel in a great location.",5,2016,03,08
113,Genuine warm and friendly staff,"From the moment you arrive at the front door this stylish and relaxed hotel makes you feel welcome and valued. The staff are all so genuine, warm, friendly and helpful.  We visited as a family group to celebrate a special birthday and chose the hotel because of its proximity to the Royal Albert Hall. Can't fault it, will definitely be returning! ",5,2016,03,07
113,Disappointed ,"Clean room and friendly staff, average continental breakfast.
Tiny room for the price, rock hard bed and the heater didn't work in the bathroom which made showering in the morning very unpleasant!! As I was only staying for a night I didn't complain, if I'd have booked in for the week it would have been a different story!!",3,2016,03,07
113,Great London Base,"Comfortable slightly formal hotel in a very attractive part of London.  Friendly and efficient staff, large and nicely furnished public rooms - and cosy bar!  Our bedroom was small but very well equipped.",4,2016,03,07
113,Excellent stay on our wedding night,"We stayed at The Kensington on our wedding day. The hotel accommodated our request to check in early so we could prepare for the ceremony and they also surprised us with a nice bottle of bubbly and chocolate strawberries.

Our room was excellent and we did get a free upgrade for the occasion. We really enjoyed the lounge and the bar and service was great throughout.

We would strongly recommend the hotel.",5,2016,03,07
113,Extraordinary staff,"I think the standard(superior?) room even if is very cozy, is too tiny, the door's room hits the bed when you open it, and so the bathroom was too small. I think The breakfast buffet wasn't  a 5 stars hotel breakfast, even if you can order some things on the menu. Anyway the staff is so friendly and kind that at the end you don't mind about the food.",5,2016,03,07
113,London Splendour,"This hotel is spectacular! I cannot recommend it highly enough. Everything about it is wonderful. From the moment we arrived and were warmly greeted by the concierge, management and front desk staff we knew we were in for a treat. Rubina on front desk was particularly wonderful, exuding warmth, happiness and helpfulness each and every time we interacted with her.

The hotel is beautifully and sympathetically decorated with sumptuous furnishings and beautiful interiors. The food in the restaurant was spectacular and the cocktails are just heavenly. If you are staying in London for a few nights, as we were, I would strongly recommend this hotel, situated in one of the most accessible and beautiful parts of the city.",5,2016,03,06
113,Living like Carrie Bradshaw Abroad,"I was super pleased with my recent stay here. I came for a long weekend with a friend. Because we weren't a couple I requested double beds and they delivered. Like any place it has it's pros and cons but here's the skinny....

Room - We ordered a deluxe room.  I was impressed with the size of the room and bathroom. It was perfect for two girls. Only disappointment  was we were told we were upgraded when clearly we were not. 

Service- We arrived early so they stored our bags and helped transport them to and from our room. Also, while speaking with the concierge I pricked my finger on a loose nail in the chair. They handled first aid perfectly.

Restaurant and Bar - I love the decor and ambiance. We had drinks and dessert. I wasn't a fan of the food but I did love the space itself. They also apparently have tea.

Concierge- Made our dinner reservations and reccomend places to go that were spot on! Very helpful.

Overall I was pleased with this location and would return! Way to go!",5,2016,03,05
113,Friendly and comfortable,The best service ever and the staff was just great! The Concierge Martyn Cope was really helpful and service minded. The whole staff in the reception was just great and was helpful with some issues that I had. ,5,2016,03,03
113,A great place to stay if you're visiting the Royal Albert Hall,The staff are wonderfully attentive and accommodating.  The d√©cor is lovely - a Georgian feel but also manages to feel contemporary and chic. I can wholeheartedly recommend afternoon tea in the lounge and a relaxing drink in the gorgeous bar at the end of the evening. We shall definitely be going back!,5,2016,03,02
113,"Wonderful stay, as always!","This was our second time staying in this hotel and it did not disappoint. It's location, friendliness of staff and breakfast ensured a return visit.  In fact, the breakfast was amazing and both my partner and I agreed that it was the best 5 star hotel breakfast we have had! 
Reception staff were more helpful and both recommended and booked evening meals for us in fabulous restaurants. 
We have stayed in a number of Doyle Collection hotels before and it's good to see that the standard and service is maintained throughout them all. 
I would strongly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a good location in London, as Kensington itself is it's own little hub with plenty of top quality bars and restaurants to choose from as well as a ""Country Market"" at weekends!
We shall be returning in the future. ",5,2016,03,02
113,Lovely to be back ,"Well I haven't stayed at the hotel for a few months but it was a warm, friendly welcome back from George, Martin and Vincent at Concierge.  A fabulous team. 

The new decor provides a relaxing comfortable feel in the public areas.  Breakfast always tasty and relaxing. 

Can't wait to visit again with my clients in March I know they will feel comfortable and relaxed during their busy schedule in London. 

Thanks to the New General Manager Simon for taking the time to meet with me - customer relations are very important. 

See you all soon - great job team Kensington!! ",5,2016,02,28
113,The Kensington an excellent place to stay,"We have just returned from a short London break staying at this hotel, it was very well placed for our visit with many interesting places to visit close by, and Theatre land a short  tube ride away.

113,brilliante,"Simply accommodating and a special location in the heart of kensington!staff was  kind and was able to take care of my needs: arriving late, changing reservations, and most especially making me feel welcome to the hotel! The location has great bars, restaurant, and the vibe is safe and eclectic. Looking forward to staying here again soon.",5,2016,02,26
113,The best London can offer,It was my first time to stay at this lovely home away from home in a big city like London. The comfort was there and very well presented. My room was big enough by London standards and there was plenty of amenities and attractions. The staff were incredible without fuss with special mentions to George who helped us with our luggage when we checked in and Carolina at the breakfast area. We highly recommend.,5,2016,02,26
113,Fabulous venue for a meeting,"Our Executives from the Royal Albert Hall have visited this hotel on two occasions recently and could not fault the service received. The meeting room was great, light and plenty of room with good facilities.  Lunch was fantastic, there was plenty on offer and it was all very nice.  The lounge is very cosy and ideal for leisurely drinks.  The staff paid good attention to detail and were helpful, welcoming and tendered to our needs.  We look forward to returning.",5,2016,02,24
113,Wonderful,"We have absolutely been taken back and thrilled really, everything was great. We were immediately greeted warmly with fresh made juice from their juicery menu on arrival. Our room was very clean and tidy, we got fresh towels twice in just a few days and the bathroom was very clean. In addition, water was offered to take with us, which we were able to drink outside every day, The neighbourhood is safe and secure and this is one of the very expensive places in London. Martyn, Amedeo, and George -doorman were very helpful about things to see and and quick bites around. we will definitely come back here again as always.",5,2016,02,24
113,Beautiful Boutique Hotel,"My husband and I love this hotel. We always stay here when in London. It has the facilities in the public area to have guests and family with an ambience that feels like home.

The staff are wonderful and service impeccable. All in all a quintessential London experience",5,2016,02,24
113,Weekend of caring service in a charming hotel,"Lovely hotel but whenever and whoever refurbished he hotel were very short sighted.
The room was very mean on space to say the least....constantly having to stand to one side to let the other pass was tiring to say the least.  There was only two spaces in which you could do this passing. Sadly for the cost per night you would expect a bath & shower not either or. If the refurb had been thought out better their would have been at least another 2 or 3 feet per room an no silly dog legs of space which was only fit to store your luggage in. Yes two or three bedrooms may have been lost per floor to achieve a more comfortable time. The hotel was busy it was not full the weekend we stayed this added space would have made for a much more pleasurable stay. The walls were not soundproofed well enough it was a bit off putting hearing some clearing there throat next door! Very tight with the supply of coffee and UHT milk, I would have expected real milk in a hotel of this calibre. Bathroom door stuck terribly, kettle in the 'wardrobe' didn't switch off so you risked a steam burn trying to unplug it. Not keen on the relaxed chairs to eat breakfast let alone a three course dinner. The staff are lovely, attentive, caring, a little treat in the room was really appreciated. The turning down of the bed and changing of towels were luxurious treat but the mean space of the room did marr the weekend....shame.",4,2016,02,22
113,Sublime Service in South Kensington Splendor,"The title says it all.  By far my favourite hotel in London. 

Experience the difference, with a warmth of welcome, in this resplendent, recherch√©, regency town house.  Meticulous attention to detail, delectable breakfast, opulent drawing room facilities (complete with Neom organic candle-scent) and, my favourite, the wood-panelled, subtle lit, K Bar.

Circa 15 minutes will bring you to Paddington, Victoria links to Heathrow, Gatwick respectively or to the West End, either by taxi or underground.
",5,2016,02,22
113,Great hotel,"Located in excellent pulp South Kensington station, the surrounding area have good restaurants.

113,top class,"stayed in the hotel for one night on a brief trip to London for pleasure purposes. no criticism of any aspect. My much travelled wife said it was the best hotel she has ever stayed in. Great location, everything was a treat but it was all very relaxing",5,2016,02,21
113,Business trip,"It was my first stay in London, I spent 2 nights there. It was a very good hotel, in a classy zone. The room was very nice but not spacious, the bed was so comfortable and the breakfast was normal not so many varieties but tasty. The hotel also had a very good WiFi connection. The only thing is the location of the hotel wasn't nearby any of the sightseeing, so u have to go a long way to reach any of the remarkable sights.",4,2016,02,21
113,Like a lovely elegant club,Such a nice hotel. Sometimes the rooms can hit and miss in terms of size but if you score then it's all good. The real glory of this hotel is its public rooms which are elegant intimate and just lovely with equally lovely staff. I was here before and liked the public rooms but had a small bedroom and so ranked it lower. But I love it now,5,2016,02,21
113,Simply Superb,"This is truly a great hotel with excellent service that leaves your feeling valued at all times. It starts Simon, Hotel Manager, who knows his guests by name and ensures that every detail is catered for. Michael and the concierge team are well informed, efficient and have contacts where you need them. Ben and the bar team made for a fun evening  after a long day. And finally nothing was too hard for people like Said in the restaurant / lounge. The rooms are well appointed and very clean. The gym was perfect with high quality equipment, water, towels and fruit. Overall this was a fantastic place to stay 10 days when on business in London. And at only 2mins walk to South Kensington tube station, a great location. Thanks team see you again soon.",5,2016,02,19
113,The Kensington Hotel,"The Kensington Hotel was outstanding in every way. The lovely facility is in excellent repair, the staff is exceptionally courteous and helpful, the bed was very comfortable, and the price made it a great value.

I would recommend this hotel highly to London visitors and I certainly plan to use it again on future visits.",5,2016,02,18
113,My new favorite hotel in London ,"We stayed here for a week and have absolutely loved our stay. The hotel is beautiful and located in the South Kensington neighborhood within walking distance of local restaurants, coffee shops and a Little Waitrose grocery store. It's about a block away from the south Kensington tube station. 

We reserved a larger family room for our stay and had the hotel put up a small teepee tent for the kids. Room was quiet, spacious and very clean. Everyone on staff was incredibly friendly and we also took advantage of the nanny service available through the hotel. 

V&A Museum and Natural History Museum are a 5 minute walk away. Harrods is about a 15 minute walk. 

We will definitely be staying here again in the future! Highly recommend this hotel as a homebase for your next London adventure. ",5,2016,02,18
113,Great Location and Hotel,"My mum and I were in London shopping for my Wedding dress and we stayed here for the few days. The staff were so lovely and the hotel is gorgeous. It's such a cosy, warm and friendly place to walk in to.

Location is great also....a very short walk to the South Kensington tube station or a nice stroll to the Knightsbridge area. We will defo be back.",5,2016,02,18
113,Brillant!,"We had an amazing Mother-Daughter week in London and staying at the Kensington was a perfect choice.  The hotel is charming, the staff is excellent, the rooms are clean and quaint, and the location could not be better for dining, sightseeing, and experiencing all London has to offer.  We will be back!",5,2016,02,17
113,The best choice for London,"Great hotel, great location and amazing staff. From the first moment of your staying to the end, you will feel at home, and you will find a polite, smiling and very helpful staff members, ready to fullfill all your requests. The location, in south kensington is stunnig, the tube station is five minutes walking, (south kensington), and the room are cozy and clean. Very good internet system and complimentary water and coffee, refurbished every day. At the end a great location where to stay in a wonderful city.",5,2016,02,17
113,Loved it!,I only spent one night at The Kensington on a stopover from a very long trip.  I had a day in London to see friends.  The hotel was perfect in giving my rest and service I needed for such a quick visit.  I wish I could've stayed longer.,5,2016,02,16
113,fantastic,"We all had a fantastic time staying at the kensington  for my sister's birthday weekend., we were all very comfortable and slept well. The location was perfect for us- in walking distance to everywhere and so close to the tube. The hotel  itself has been tastefully decorated with good use of space and a well equipped gym. Overall a great place to stay do not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone. I can‚Äôt wait to get back to London and will definitely stay here again when I do.",5,2016,02,16
113,Delightful hotel in a fantastic location with amazing staff that do all the details right...,"If anyone asked me where to stay in London I would have three words for them: ""The Kensington Hotel"".  It's beautiful with an amazing location just 5 minutes walk from the South Kensington underground station on the Piccadilly Line coming in from Heathrow.  The staff are great... you're made to feel like part of a family.  They are always helpful, always smiling and friendly and they take care of the details with no fuss.  Dinner in the Town dining room is a must and drinks in their bar (amazing bartender who my wife thinks looks like a young DiCaprio) are excellent.  I really can't think of staying anywhere else on my visit to London.  Well done!  So nice to experience this while traveling on business or pleasure.",5,2016,02,16
113,A fantastic romantic stay at the perfect hotel,"We had a beautiful hotel, from the moment we arrived the staff were welcoming and friendly. We enquired when we could check in and even though it was only 11am our room was ready and we were able to check in. 

The hotel is a London gem, with its perfect location in Queen's Gate, efficient and friendly staff in all areas of the hotel (so rare today) and the air that staff are genuinely happy in their roles was refreshing.

The roaring fires across the hotel, the first class interior design, cleanliness of rooms  and wonderful food and drinks service made this a wonderfully romantic and relaxing stay. Thank you",5,2016,02,15
113,Lovely experience!,"We had a fabulous long weekend in London in part because of the lovely atmosphere and amazing staff at The Kensington!  Kudos to George, Rafael, Teodora, and both Anna's for just the right amount of care and attention.  We saw them maneuver a few busy and demanding situations with agility, grace, and thoughtful professionalism.  Congrats to the management for scoring such good employees!  Additionally, the bar and lounge areas are very comfortable.  While our room was a tad small, hence 4 stars instead of 5, the design and quality of appointments and bath provided conditions for optimal rest and relaxation.  We would not hesitate to return!",4,2016,02,14
113,Excellent overnight stay,"We enjoyed an excellent 1 night stay here, the welcome was warm yet professional, our room was divine, I took ideas for rooms at home, it was comfortable, elegant and quiet.  We enjoyed our trip immensly, with everyone in the hotel being courteous and kind, they could not have been more helpful.  It was just so lovely sitting in the elegant drawing room enjoying a drink reading the papers.  We would definitely recommend and go back.",5,2016,02,14
113,Small but perfectly formed,"Booked via Hotel.com (thanks to Tripadvisor) and paid ¬£160 for room only on a superior double rate (Cant believe I got it so cheap!). Hotel was only a short distance from the South Kensington tube stop and a 10 minute walk to The Royal Albert Hall and Natural History Museum (at a good pace). 
The welcome we received was first rate, during check in we were offered hot towels to refresh ourselves with and check in was friendly, quick and easy. I was surprised how small our room was (our bathroom door hit the toilet when you opened the door) however it was perfect in every other way. Nespresso coffee machine, well stocked mini bar, aromatherapy shampoo, conditioner, shower gels and body cream and then to top it all off the comfiest bed and pillows I have ever slept on!! OMG!!!!! great range of channels on the flat screen TV. 
After seeing a show at The Royal Albert Hall we walked back to the hotel and ordered room service (Club sandwich - YUM!!!). Didn't think the price was too bad at ¬£14 but when I checked out found there was another ¬£6 or so added to the bill for bringing it up to the room and a surcharge if ¬£2  (???) I didn't mind, but I had tipped them well already. It hasn't put me off though, I would totally stay here again.",5,2016,02,14
113,Absolutely the best in Kensington,"This hotel is perfect for families, couples travelling together or 2 friends travelling (and looking for some privacy and a quiet place to retire at the end of the day). The hotel was centrally located in a great neighbourhood very close to transit. We purchased Oyster Cards and took buses, the tube & overground trains throughout London. The Pub on the corner (bumpkin) was a nice amenity with great food and good beer close by. hyde park (10 minute walk from the front door) offered a great place to have a coffee, read the paper and people watch in the morning, The fresh baked pastries down the old brompton street are very good. staff was incredible and could not have been more accommodating. concierge left us with great recommendations and advice for the immediate and greater London area.he took his time and carefully showed us every feature within the neighbourhood to ensure make our time at ease. The hotel was modern and extremely clean. The beds are super comfortable and the bathrooms are a welcome luxury for a stay in London. I would",5,2016,02,14
113,Visit with Mom,"Couldn't have asked for a better experience with my mother for the weekend. The staff here is exceptional, the breakfasts delicious (recommend the omelet), the neighborhood is quaint and filled with exceptional museums, and the rooms are cozy, clean, and comfortable. Likewise, the decor and atmosphere is lovely. My mother and I became good friends with the bellman, George--who loves a good high five and catch-up session when you walk in the door. If you are looking for a 5 star hotel void of the inflated prices, stay at The Kensington. ",5,2016,02,13
113,A local favorite!,"We had such a great time!   The Kensington is in a great, quiet neighborhood.  The bar was lovely.  We loved the atmosphere and the service was fantastic.   George was amazing, he made our comings and goings so much fun!  The rooms may be a bit under-sized but the rest of the hotel, staff and charm more than make up for it!  Thank you! ",5,2016,02,12
113,Amazing stay! ,"I travel a lot due to the nature of my business and I am fortunate to always stay in luxury hotels. 
The Kensington is by far one of the best hotels I stayed in. I don't like to write reviews but I felt this hotel deserved one. 
The location is great, close to South Kensington station and a 15 min walk to Chelsea or Knightsbridge. 
The hotel lounges and bedroom are very chic and you can see a great deal of thought went into the style and decoration of the hotel.
The staff are what makes this place amazing. All off them friendly and helpful. They all smile and greet you by name. They make you feel at home and nothing is too much trouble. 
I had breakfast and it was superb and also tried their newly opened bar and again wonderful. Delicious cocktails and atmosphere. 
All in all amazing! I will definitely come back next time I'm in London. ",5,2016,02,12
113,"Perfect London location, would go back in a heartbeat","My one night stay at the Kensington began with a very warm welcome from the instant we arrived at the door.  All of the staff were charming and very helpful. Our room was a great size and absolutely gorgeous. We did not eat in the hotel, however had a drink by the fire after getting caught in a shower and it was just perfect. The atmosphere around the hotel was very calm and professional. We were treated like royalty by all of the team. Lillian Hurley made us feel so at home from the moment we arrived right up until the moment we left. The location is perfect: being very close to the tube station and no more than a ten minute ride from everywhere we wanted to go. I would highly recommend the Kensington hotel and  would go back in a heartbeat!",5,2016,02,11
113,Business and pleasure - great hotel!,"The staff was very nice and helpful. Changing my room from a queen size bed to a king size bedroom was done in an instant.
Lovely areas with open fire to sit down and have a drink after being out a long day.
Nice food, both breakfast and lunch.
Delicate and quite rooms, even when facing the main road.
Nice location in South Kensington.
Great museums right around the corner. Nice cafes and restaurants.
Love the place!",5,2016,02,09
113,"Great Hotel , great location !!!!","I booked this Hotel break as a Christmas present for my Husband - he had not been to London before so wanted a special treat. We were not disappointed , lovely Hotel , luxurious feel and really helpful staff. The cocktails were amazing and service excellent. Location is brilliant , a short walk to the shops and vibrant Knightsbridge with its cafe culture dinning. So if you want a weekend break then you can't go wrong with The Kensington......spoil yourself !!",5,2016,02,09
113,Great value for money,"You get a lot for what you pay for ‚Äì very good value for money. Area is quite good. Rooms are OK ‚Äì much better than average for London. Bar is very nice. Staff is quite friendly. I would say this is more a four star hotel than a five star hotel but the price is more of a four star hotel. The only downside is the breakfast ‚Äì poor and tasteless. Even though, I will be back.",4,2016,02,08
113,excellent at all times,"The staff were incredibly nice in the lead up to the weekend, they were always on hand to deal with any questions and queries during the weekend, The hotel itself was really cosy, well decorated and there was nothing more we felt was needed throughout our time there. Location was fantastic, 2 min walk to the tube, 15-20 min to the knightsbridge shopping center and the main center of town another couple of minutes away. Couldn't have been more conveniently located to be honest. Overall, we had a good time in London and that was in part kensington‚Äôs lovely place. Much appreciated",5,2016,02,08
113,"Great location, Fantastic Service. But Room Category Matters a lot!","My elementary school aged daughter and I stayed here during her Spring Break a couple of years ago. We had to work to get a decent room. We booked through Tablet Hotels. The first room they showed us was dark and drab. The second room was fine, but not great, and definitely not the luxurious 4-poster bed and clawfoot bathtub we'd seen on the website.We stayed in the room one night, and when we got into bed, the duvet weighed A TON. It was very uncomfortable and made for a miserable night's sleep on top of the fact that it was our first night there (having traveled from the US) and sleep was elusive to begin with. The next morning, I looked inside the duvet cover and it appeared to have a rug, or some inappropriate decorative covering in there, not a proper duvet filler. On our way out later that day, I explained this to the front desk manager, and she didn't believe me, therefore I invited her to our room to take a look. When she saw it, she was horrified and offered to make it right. I explained that we were disappointed in the room overall, even if it was the category we'd booked. She offered to upgrade us to one of the suites on the front side of the hotel. She said they'd even pack us up and move us and to go out and enjoy our day. When we returned, we were in a lovely suite with a 4 poster bed and a huge luxurious bathroom with a clawfoot tub. The Nespresso Machine in this room never did work properly therefore they brought us room service coffee each morning as a courtesy. This is what I liked most about this hotel. Problems did come up, but they resolved them to our satisfaction. Tea in the lobby is perfect and the doormen were always helpful with directions and tourist tips. I hope we can stay here again soon!",5,2016,02,07

113,Laid back Chic,"I love this hotel; it is a boutique hotel in converted large town houses, it has a unique ambience, emanating from the combination of style and the friendliness and charm of the staff. The rooms are not large, and the bathrooms are compact, but as we spend minimal time in them that is a minor point, what is important is that they are very nicely furnished, well appointed and in good condition. Public areas including the restaurant, bar and sitting rooms have an elegant charm. The restaurant is also extremely good for dinner, offering a French bistro influenced menu. Whenever I travel to London on business I use this hotel and would not hesitate to recommend it to others.",4,2016,02,03
113,Stylish elegance in a fabulous location,"This is beautiful hotel in a wonderful location . Discreet and stylish with staff who really seem to care. The new GM Simon Maguire is constantly on hand and around to make sure that everything works like clockwork and his team seem as dedicated and committed as him. This was our first visit with a booking of 4 rooms for a local meeting and all of our clients gave the hotel rave reviews. If you need to be this side of London then this is a sure bet. The shower was one of the best ever! 
Great stay and we have already booked for our next function up here.",5,2016,02,03
113,Informal business meeting,"I have used this hotel a few times to meet with clients and The Kensington is the perfect venue for an informal business meeting. The staff are excellent, the food is superb and plenty of areas to sit depending on what you need. The hotel itself is a beautiful building which has been finished to the highest standards which is great for impressing people. I will certainly be using this venue again.",5,2016,02,02
113,Staff was excellent. ,"The hotel was above expectations.   Service was excellent, food was quality and the room was well appointed.  One stand was George the doorman.  He always greater us by name, looked for ways to be helpful without being intrusive.  George always made our return to the hotel pleasant with his genuine smile.  ",5,2016,02,01
113,Highly recommended,"Cannot sing the praises of the Kensington enough, beautiful surroundings, excellent staff, room 123 was just perfect, and if you get opportunity take dinner in the restaurant, food excellent. Certainly it will become a favourite for the future",5,2016,01,31
113,A wonderful find in the centre of London,"Finding the right hotel in London always presents a number of difficulties. If price is no problem the choice is unlimited. However for most of us, the high end hotels are just not an option for longer stays. London is the world's leader in hotel dross with plenty of grubby, pokey properties staffed by uninterested employees or young eastern Europeans using the opportunity to lean English. Even in good established properties, space is at a premium and it is difficult to find value for money. As a result I have taken to staying in a wonderful B & B in Bloomsbury but on the recent family trip this was not an option.

The Kensington was recommended by a friend and for that i will be eternally grateful. Located in trendy South Kensington, the hotel is all you would want or need for a stay in London. It is elegant and sophisticated yet small enough to be personal and inviting. 

The deluxe room was large enough to accommodate three without feeling we were living on top of each other. 

The English breakfasts were of such large portions that it was difficult to finish! 

After a long day's sightseeing it was wonderful to come back and sit in the warm and inviting lounge by the fire for afternoon tea. A lot of effort has gone into the interior design and it shows especially in the public areas.

The corridors are narrow as would be expected in a hotel located in a row of Victorian terraces and on occasions you can hear noise inside the room but overall there is a very high level of comfort. 

This property suited all our needs, from cycling around Hyde Park in the unusually mild winter to eating at the numerous nearby restaurants. In a word, delightful.",4,2016,01,29
113,A wonderful date night!,"The Kensington Hotel has come a long way in the last six months or so, not least, The Town House restaurant. Very good service, excellent food and great value. Lots of space means not dining in others' pockets and privacy to talk without worrying about being overheard. Would highly recommend for dinner or a stay - they're doing something right at The Kensington.",5,2016,01,28
113,Wov,Normally a bit over my company's price range. However a last minute deal via hotels.com made it possible although in London for business. Extremely friendly and effective front staff. The whole hotel breaths well maintained and cleanliness. Very comfortable rooms with very comfortable beds. Highly recommended.  ,5,2016,01,26
113,Kensington Hotel London,"For a quality stay in London The Kensington is quite simply wonderful. From the moment you arrive the staff make you feel you're somewhere special. For sure the hotel is not the cheapest around if you are on a budget but if you can push the boat out a little it is so worth it. We just felt totally relaxed for our stay, the rooms are spacious, clean and to a very high standard. Cannot fault any of the staff who are always available for information and tips for London. Food too is excellent, presentation and quality were superb. ",5,2016,01,26
113,Fab night out ,"Went to the new look bar on Friday night. What can I say. Cocktail were fantastic, servise was excellent. Can't recommend enough.  Bar has a real good feel to it we ended up staying there the entire evening. 
The hotel has gone through a lavish renovation and they have done a really good job of keeping some of the old and bring new ideas. ",5,2016,01,25
113,Great Location/Gorgeous Place,"We just got back from our first visit to London and stayed at The Kensignton. The location is perfect, great coffee shops and restaurants and wonderful neighborhood.  The staff was wonderful and the room was perfect.  We couldn't of asked for a better place. We can't wait to go back!",5,2016,01,24
113,Fabulous hotel in London,"It was an absolute joy from the start to finish staff were always prompt and friendly and this continued from the time we checked-in to check-out. The hotel itself is just fantastic, colorful and sophisticated but also incredibly well kitted out with lots of little touches like the fireplaces, portraits and books in the lounging and dining rooms. Cleanliness wise the hotel was spotless, and everyone commented on how nice the beds were. In fact everyone commented how personal and charming the place was, it was such a great hotel for all of us to spend time and enjoy ourselves. Location wise it's perfect for walking from the tube station, and has so many things close by from the vini italiani,christie's gallery,Lamborghini show rooms,and my personal favorite french bakery Aux Merveilleux de Fred. The hotel staff provided us with a map which was easy  to understand and pointed out the directions to the museums,boutiques and nice restaurants and was a great help. So thank you so much, it was a real pleasure!",5,2016,01,24
113,Lovely hotel!,"Me and my girlfriend stayed here for a couple of days, lovely staff and a lovely hotel. I would recommend it, and we are quiet picky when in comes to venues. The restaurant is also good and the bar makes excellent drinks. We had set our mind on the London Edition Hotel but choose this instead because it's more relaxing. ",4,2016,01,22
113,The Kesington Hotel,"My works requires me to use hotel lounges for business meetings and I always find the Kensington Hotel an excellent place to meet contacts and clients. The staff are attentive, the food and drink of a very good quality and the service excellent. The property is a luxury hotel that has recently had a refurbishment of the public areas that takes it to the next level.",5,2016,01,22
113,Perfect as always,I have never been disappointed with the Kensington Hotel. The staff has always been friendly and helpful. The location is perfect as in a quiet area but walking distance to tub stations and museums. Love it!,5,2016,01,21
113,Midweek break,"The Kensington is a wonderfully chic and elegant hotel in one of London's more up market neighbourhoods. We stayed there to celebrate a birthday and meet friends in London and our bespoke requirements were attended to by the front of house staff with no question and no fuss. All waiting staff were impeccable and the doorman too was professional but also personable. There is a good bar selection at the Kensington serving a variety of standard and speciality cocktails and again service is first class. The corridors to the guest rooms at first glance do appear narrow, and clearly caused another guest some trouble leaving his room judging by the noise he made, but I felt that this added to the charm (the corridors, not the noise) of staying in a building with character in London. South Kensington tube station is a 3 minute walk away but there are a number of other attractions close to the hotel itself. We would happily return to The Kensington.",4,2016,01,20
113,A Perfect Home Away from Home,"I've have written for National Geographic and author of their best seller, The 10 Best of Everything. I'm also former Director of TIME World News Service. Out of the million of miles I've logged on assignments, and accommodations all over the world, The Kensington at Queens Gate is exceptional coupled by a courteous and efficient staff, pristine clean and enchanting rooms, and a quiet address, one of the best in London. ",5,2016,01,20
113,Lovely hotel in lovely city of london,"What an amazing experience in London, The kensington hotel has restored a beautiful townhouse with impeccable taste. Minimal where necessary, expansive where appropriate. Wonderful staff. If you stay, you must try and have dinner at least once. It's a very reasonably priced restaurant and the chef whipped up some finger licking british cuisine and it was one of the most delicious food in my trips to London.The hotel is in a quiet neighborhood, away from the hustle and for us it added to the charm. There was free fast wifi and a few minutes walk is the south kensington station and along the way is knightsbridge area - beauchamp street has great shops,cafes, and brands and we walked back to harrods department store, one hyde park and took a stroll over hyde park which was lovely especially around the pond.  All Staff were perfect,friendly and an asset to this fine establishment; Martyn likes to share his knowledge about all London has to offer ; Said and George were alway available to assist in the morning plus many others whom we met. We had a wonderful time enjoying your hospitality.highly recommend",5,2016,01,19
113,excellent hotel,"The hotel is absolutely amazing, wish we had more time to appreciate its london‚Äôs beauty. The neighborhood was very nice and Everything was easily accessed  ,local farmers market and designer boutiques are a short walk away near hyde park. We are definitely planning on staying here again next time.",5,2016,01,19
113,"Amazing stay. Perfect location, rooms, food and staff!","The hotel is an impressive building with luxurious rooms and a really good selection of food and wines. The rooms are large and tastefully decorated, the staff were friendly, helpful and ensured everything about our stay was perfect. This was a lovely romantic get away and we look forward to coming back.",5,2016,01,18
113,Great!,"This hotel is absolutely lovely. In the sense of ""My Fair Lady"". Beautifully decorated lounges, open fireplaces and cute, small rooms. A real gem. We asked for early arrival - and this was not a problem. Room was ready at 10AM.",5,2016,01,18
113,"Location, luxury, and superb service.","Having just returned from another stay at The Kensington I remain as delighted, and as relaxed as always. The unbeatable location speaks for itself, but what elevates The Kensington above other luxury hotels in London is the quality of it's public spaces combined with the wonderfully trained & attentive staff. The bar & lounges are superbly finished, a pleasure to be in after a long day, and the scale of the hotel makes you truly feel like a valued guest rather than just another anonymous visitor. Some of the rooms are smaller than other so always worth checking on booking, & in some the noise at weekends from the nightclub nearby can be intrusive. That said the staff are always willing to help & advise & I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel. ",5,2016,01,14
113,Superb and Classy...This one's a hidden jewel! You will want to linger at this place!,"From the moment we entered, the entire staff was warm and welcoming. What we would expect from a long tiring journey was to just relax in our room, however it wasn't ready so we had to linger. This is the kind of place that you don't mind lingering at all....it's such a comforting yet elegant drawing room that makes it cozy yet super classy. Olivier even offered some coffee/tea to warm us up. We went during Xmas/New Years so it was beautifully decorated, minimalist yet elegant and the afternoons had lovely mulled wine with mince pies. The service is impeccable and we loved how personable everybody was. Onto the room, fifth floor and a studio suite, worth every bit. Spacious over looking queen's gate with a huge bathroom and very English wallpaper. There is turn down service and it's just lovely to come back to and relax after a day of sightseeing. This is a very minor observation but if you are  a light sleeper note that the staff is working hard and so you will hear a lot of foot traffic in the hallway (keep that in mind if you are a light sleeper especially in the morning). Onto breakfast (we had included an english full though you can have a continental one as well). It was splendid, again impeccable service by Anna, James and all the other wonderful staff members we thoroughly enjoyed conversing with each day :) Breakfast had the usual eggs, toast, pancakes, with a variety of cheeses,meats, eggs, juices, tea/coffee. The setting is also lovely as the restaurant is named townhouse so you feel really cozy and not wanting to leave...again enjoy this beautiful hotel, its worth lingering. Onto the bar, wow and wow, like you're back in the 20s of a lovely vintage bar with amazing cocktails, wines, beers and the ambiance will make you want to have many chats, read a book, or take it all in and just feel absolutely on cloud 9!  Finally, the area surrounding the hotel is wonderful- about a 5-7 min walk to the South Kensington Tube (very easy to get around the city), lovely restaurants and bakeries, even a convenient supermarket! We cannot say enough and we know we've missed some names of the staff (so this is a shout out to all of them)....Thank you SO much for making our vacation truly a memorable one that we look forward to enjoying and lingering longer at your hotel in the future. Hats off Hotel Kensington, you define the standards of fantastic service and beautiful ambiance, a rare gem!",5,2016,01,13
113,Christmas dinner...tasty and festive!,"I didn't to stay at the Kensington Hotel but enjoyed a wonderful dinner Christmas night. A set menu offered a number of choices from traditional to inventive. It went for the smoked salmon, bronze turkey and plum pudding for dessert and the staff was kind enough to serve our post-prandial coffee and mini-mince tarts in their hotel's lounge. The public room of this hotel are simple and stunning. So even if you're not staying here, do pop in for drinks or a meal. It is just beautiful!",4,2016,01,13
113,One of the best things about London!,"Ok, that's kind of ridiculous, but my wife and I went during December, when it was rainy and cold, and coming back to this beautiful hotel, with the warm fireplace, large lobby, swanky lounge, and awesome rooms was a great highlight.

The morning breakfast was amazing.  Super fresh buffet with fish, meats, fruits, eggs, and a variety of menu dishes (thanks Anna, James, Barbara and Carolina for taking care of us!).

The concierge staff was also really helpful.  George and his friendly face was a welcoming sight, and Michael, who was so nice to recommend some local brews and even made sure to give suggestions on his favorite hangouts.  Finally, Elisa was amazing the first day, helping us check in early because both my wife and I were under the weather.

The rooms are clean, big, and the bathrooms were regal in appearance.  The hotel is situated in a convenient location that's close to the Underground, and to be honest I really would not stay anywhere else when I come back to London.

Thanks so much guys, and apologies if I missed anyone.",5,2016,01,13
113,Nice location and friendly staff,"This hotel is very comfortable, and in a nice location. The staff are very friendly and super helpful, from the time you arrive to the time you leave. Raphael at the door gave us a very warm welcome. He was very helpful and friendly with me and my family.

I would stay again",5,2016,01,13
113,I LOVE this hotel,"I stayed here for a one night weekend break with a girlfriend. I cannot fault this hotel. It is a beautiful hotel with real charm and from the moment you walk in you can smell the Neom candles they use to fragrance the place, stunning. All the staff are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are small but the bedding is so luxurious and the beds are really comfy. 

We had a problem with our television and they came up within what felt like seconds to fix it. 

It is perfectly located for Chelsea are and easy access to the tube.

I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. It's my favourite London hotel so far.",5,2016,01,12
113,"Very Nice Hotel, Good Location","We stayed here for 8 nights over Christmas & New Year's. We had two rooms. The hotel is very pretty, and the location is good. There are many restaurants within walking distance, and the tube is a 5 minute walk away. The rooms and beds were comfortable, although the bathrooms were very tiny (no bathtub). We had breakfast there every morning, and the food was good. The bar area is very nice. The service was pretty good, although I can't say that it was as spectacular as other reviewers report. For example, someone in our party was very ill while we were there. Housekeeping came for turndown service, and the sick person asked for a bucket of ice. The housekeeper said she couldn't do that, because it ""was a totally different department"", and that the sick person would need to call room service and ask for the ice. But, a few minor service hiccups notwithstanding, the hotel was very nice and we would stay there again. ",4,2016,01,11
113,Great Weekend,"My family and I have just come back from a 2 day stay at the amazing and lovely Kensington Hotel. I enjoyed the staff's' company, they were so friendly, Ram was very nice he was ever so kind when ever we went to eat. When I first walked through the door to our room I was so surprised to see a teepee in the corner of the room had been put up for us! My sister used this as a hideout and camp for her teddies that she brought with her and some from the Natural History Museum that is very nearby and we went to twice and the Science museum as well!  The view from the window reminded me of Paris looking out at all the rooftops and I spent many times finding myself staring out of them. My sister and I were so sad to leave and because the car was parked outside Mummy and Daddy said that we could come back for afternoon tea. The waiters were very kind and even got my little sister and I books from the library when we were having high tea because Mummy and Daddy were still chatting!",5,2016,01,10
113,Excellent service ,"Really excellent service not over the top but really friendly and always helpful. Room was nice and little small but I guess that's London for you. Bar area and lounge were beautifully furnished and decorated, nice for breakfast and drink or a coffee and scone.  Definitely go back.",5,2016,01,10
113,Great location. Beautiful building.,"I love the Kensington. Firstly, the location is brilliant. So much nearby to stroll to, and very close to the tube. The room decor is original and a lot of thought has gone into it. 
A very cozy place to stay. Really homey feel in this luxurious boutique feeling hotel.",4,2016,01,09
113,The Kensington for luxury with the personal touch,"My daughter and I have just returned from a three day stay at the luxurious and elegant Kensington hotel.  The hotel is a delight and the location is perfect for sightseeing, shopping and theatre. What sets this hotel apart from other top hotels is it's staff. They made us feel special.  We were greeted with warmth and genuine friendliness which we felt throughout our stay.  They could not do enough for us. Our room was pure luxury with a beautiful bathroom and a large balcony overlooking Queen's Gate and with reliable fast wifi. The extensive breakfast menu (with plenty of healthy options) set us up well for the day and we had the best afternoon tea I have ever enjoyed.  We will be back. Thank you Simon, Lillian, James and George.",5,2016,01,08
113,Superb stay!,"Thoroughly enjoyed the warm hospitality and enviting atmosphere of this excellent boutique hotel. Location beside first rate shopping and dining was perfect. Easily accessible to Tube station and museums. 
",5,2016,01,08
113,"Perfection in every way, location, staff and gorgeous hotel!!","I can't say enough about this beautiful hotel and the amazing staff but The Kensington is more perfect than we ever could have anticipated. From the moment you arrive to your departure the entire staff is so respectful and happy to meet your every need. The service is stellar and the lobby, bar, reception area is gorgeous, cozy and brilliantly appointed. The location is perfect with so many fabulous restaurants and shopping in walking distance. We walked to Harrods and discovered wonderful museums and delightful areas for shopping and dining. Normally we are happy to return home but I can honestly say after leaving the Kensington we miss it and the wonderful people that made our stay incredible. The concierges Vincent and Michael were wonderful ang got us fourth row seats at the Novella to see Mama Mia, Anna at the bar who delivered our cocktails in the evening to us on the patio always with a smile. Every question was answered and every request attended to. Lovely staff, lovely setting, lovely hotel!",5,2016,01,08
113,Just as I thought,"The Kensington hotel does deserve all its stars. I had the opportunity to visit the hotel again and did not regret one minute. As I mentioned in another review, the location and value of the hotel is perfect. This time around, I stayed longer and really got to enjoy the quality service. It's also a great family hotel without that dreaded family hotel feeling. I'm looking forward to the next visit.",5,2016,01,07
113,Amazing Stay,"Stayed at Kensington Hotel over Christmas and loved every minute of it.  All of the staff was friendly and welcoming. Shout out to George for his hospitality and being a welcoming face after our daily adventures into central London. 

Hotel is a short walk to South Kensington station and a few stops from all of London's main attraction.  There are a number of restaurants just around the corner.  I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to everyone. ",5,2016,01,06
113,LOVE IT HERE!,"This was my second visit to this property over Christmas and IT IS FABULOUS!  The service is incredible, the gym is incredible and the food and value are also incredible.  It's a 5 star experience for a bargain price.  GREAT location, too.  Want to go back next year!",5,2016,01,05
113,Wonderful New Year's Stay!,"My boyfriend and I booked this hotel for our New Year's trip to London and we had a fantastic experience. The hotel itself is in a gorgeous area of Kensington that is steps away from the tube and two museums. The hotel's lobby is absolutely lovely and has three cozy fires to sit by and have a drink or a meal - and the holiday decorations were perfectly done! The lobby always had a pastry, clementine or mulled wine to take as you come and go. 
The staff was extremely attentive and kind. During our stay we were asked to switch rooms due to a plumbing issue. We received a handwritten note informing us of the issue and then were moved to a nicer room and received a bottle of champagne. We were also offered 15% off a meal at the restaurant in the hotel (which was unrelated to our room switch). All of our requests were handled with care and in a very timely fashion. It was hard to leave!",5,2016,01,04
113,"Classic, friendly hotel.","We stayed here for one night following a late dinner party. The staff were lovely, the room classic, but clean. Everything you could want in a hotel. We enjoyed the room service and the bar downstairs was also friendly and welcoming. ",5,2016,01,04

113,Attention to detail,"We stayed for one night as a treat just before the new year and we were very impressed by the warmth and friendliness of the staff, and the great attention to detail throughout the hotel. Our room wasn't ready on arrival, so we were given complimentary drinks in the lovely lounge whilst we waited ten minutes or so - very welcome after our journey. Our room was quite small but very well appointed, and I had the best night's sleep in weeks. The bar is fabulous and we had great cocktails. The breakfast room is very comfortable and relaxed with a good selection of delicious food and excellent service, and we're looking forward to our next stay in February üòÄ",5,2016,01,03
113,Elegant lobby area and comfortable rooms,"The customer service in this relatively recently remodeled hotel was excellent.  The public rooms are spacious with elegant traditional furnishing.  In the holiday season they offered homemade minced pies and mulled wine - all complimentary.  The rooms were good size for London and they accommodated my early check-in without a problem.  Good location- close to the South Kensington tube station and small local restaurants are within easy walking distance.
",5,2016,01,02
113,"Elegant Hotel, excellent location, very friendly service","I have previously stayed here by myself for work but on this occasion the whole family (2 adults, 2 children) came along.

I love this location for visiting London. The hotel is near South Kensington underground station, which is on 3 lines. Very easy access to central London sites, West End, Tower of London and Westminster, London Eye, Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Square etc. However, not so busy as Westminster or Victoria with tourists everywhere. The hotel is Walking distance to museums, Kensington Gardens and palace and great shopping in Kings Road Chelsea through to Sloane Square, Sloane Street and Knightsbridge.. Large variety of restaurants from family dining to more upmarket nearby. The food in the hotel bar area adjacent to the small lobby is excellent and reasonably inexpensive for this level hotel. The hotel main restaurant, The Town House is very good but a little more pricey.

Staff are very friendly and helpful, George on the door must be the most friendly doorman we have ever met, my daughters loved him. Laundry service excellent as was maid service. Concierge could not have done more for us, thank you Vincent and Martyn.

We stayed in a family room which is about the size of a family room in NY or San Francisco. The deluxe rooms are small but this is typical for this area of London.

This is my favourite hotel in London. .

113,Charming hotel with excellent customer service!,"I stayed in the Kensington Hotel for one night, on December 5th. I wasn't even a real guest - some family friends had a room there for the week, and I was passing through London, so I stayed in their room. The staff knew this, but still treated me as though I were one of their most prized customers. I was offered bottles of water for the road and mulled wine in the evening, and the employees at the desk and in the lobby were always cheerful and helpful. On top of that, the hotel decor is gorgeous and the nearest tube station is only a few blocks away. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat!",5,2015,12,31
113,Nice and good hotel,"Nice and good hotel, very well located in a historic building, in South Kensington. Very nice individually decorated rooms and very kind staff. Located in a beautiful neighborhood to walk by; you can find almost anything in the surroundings. I would highly recommend it.",5,2015,12,29
113,Pricy but nice hotel,"This hotel is based in South Kensington which is obviously one of London's finest neighborhood. However, it is quite pricy (as any hotel in London) and if you have a room on the wrong side of the building then you might really think it is pricy. Overall I enjoyed my weekend stay there, the staff is very nice and helpful and I would definitely go back there again. ",4,2015,12,29
113,"Lovely hotel, Amazing Staff","I stayed for 2 nights in a suite, the room was lovely, it didn't have a nice view just some buildings. The bathroom made the suite, it was amazing, as the bedroom part was small. We ordered rooms service one night which came quickly and was lovely. 

The staff couldn't of been more helpful from arriving, to extra special touches such as leave a pot of amazing rose tea in our room with a flask hot water. The hotel itself has a lovely atmosphere with amazing d√©cor and is lovely to sit and have a drink. 

The South Kensington tube station was only a couple of minutes walk so easy access to everywhere around London. 

The only negative thing was the corridor was really noisy and could hear everything people did or said, from within the room.",4,2015,12,28
113,Great hotel with excellent service,"We spent three nights on the hotel in november.
When we checked in we were given a very nice newly renovated room, but with a tiny bed. I could tell the standard room came with 3 different sizes of bed so I called the front desk right away to ask if something could be done. The hotel was pretty book, but the very helpfull staff had us moved to a different room within 30 minutes. The rooms was older but still nice and it was huge. I was a little worried since it was facing the street but there was no noise at all.
Overall the hotel was very nice and the staff so nice and helpfull.
We LOVE the area of the hotel, loads of dining options and very close to the tube.",5,2015,12,28
113,A lovely stay!,"I thoroughly enjoyed my six nights in the hotel.  I was unhappy with my first room as I felt it was not the ""superior"" room I had reserved.  I was moved the next day to a room where I was extremely happy.  The price was reduced for that first night.  The hotel looked charming with Christmas lights, etc.  The reception rooms and bar are very attractive.  The staff were very welcoming and helpful. Excellent location for getting around London, sightseeing or shopping.",5,2015,12,26
113,Superb hotel! ,We had an amazing time.   We could not have asked for a better place to stay in London.   The service and atmosphere does not compare.   We will definitely be coming back to this place.  Thanks for such a great time!         Have a drink in the bar. The bartenders are so nice.  ,5,2015,12,26
113,Amazing new menu,"My friend and I had lunch in the restaurant. I'd been before but not since they they had a refit and redone their menu. The new decor was beautiful and food was AMAZING! We enjoyed every bite. Sandor our server was great, polite and friendly. He throughly knew the menu even though it was new. All the staff in the hotel were so lovely and welcoming. I would have no hesitation to recommend to anyone. You have to try it out",5,2015,12,24
113,"Relaxing, understated & elegant","Our stay at the Kensington was the highlight of our recent holiday in London. We were expecting fine service and a relaxed atmosphere, and were certainly not disappointed. But what makes the Kensington stand out, and has now made it among our all-time favorites, is an atmosphere that is elegant yet also cozy and utterly unpretentious. You're made to feel at home the moment you walk in, but in manner that is genuine, not forced or grating. You may never make it to your smart rooms though, because the ground floor area with plush sofas, fireplace, a browsing library and tea, is difficult to leave behind. We dined each morning at the Kensington and spent far too much time enjoying our meal. Can't recall the last time we had a 90 minute full breakfast. And oh what a breakfast it was - the full English breakfast which most Americans thought was a thing of the past is certainly quite alive and well here. And a final word - the concierge must have a magic wand hidden somewhere, as he was able to arrange entire days for us on short notice. We'll be back...",5,2015,12,24
113,A beautiful hidden gem with a 'knock-out' bar!,"My boyfriend and I stayed just one night at The Kensington on a little trip up from Brighton and have already booked it for a special family get together in March we were so impressed. The hotel interior is beautiful, luxurious and relaxing. No expense has been spared on this place. Its not your usual Met, Hilton style of big is better more quality and luxury. 

The staff were all very refreshingly helpful! It felt personal and VIP rather than one of the masses. 

You are just a short walk to so many amazing london sights, museums and shops and on our return from doing the annual look around Harrods the best answere was what I think was probably the best G&T I have ever had! It was only a G&T it was fantastic. The cocktails in the 'knock-out beautiful' bar later were just to amazing to discribe.

Our room was incredibly comfortable and unbelievably quiet. Everything you needed was there for you. The extra touches of the rose tea in a flask left in our room for our return from a night out was just that little wonderful extra that really made our stay so great.

I wont lie I am a fuss pot! I will be the first on the phone, email etc to kick up a fuss when service is bad or you are not getting what you pay for. Sometimes I am disgusted by the lack of quality and manners around in the service industry and hence why I feel it neccessary when you come across somewhere like The Kensington Hotel. Its refreshing and it makes me very happy!

I will leave it there and say next time you need a hotel in London give this 'hidden gem' a try as you will love it... as I did... and yes I will be back... on mass with all the family and friends in March!",5,2015,12,23
113,Knockout Stay at The Kensington,"From the moment we walked over the threshold, we knew we were somewhere very special. For me, the staff can make or break a hotel and at The Kensington, they make it. Everyone we encountered during our stay was friendly and ready to help. There are lovely little touches such as hot towels on arrival to refresh you after your journey; bottles of water to take with you when you leave; and as we were there during the festive period, there were mince pies and mulled wine available too. The perfect welcome just before Christmas!
The room. Wow! This was our second stay at The Kensington and we have been delighted by our accommodation on both occasions. The rooms are very thoughtfully designed. The furnishings are of a high standard. The bed is one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in! One of the issues I have in hotels is the noise. I am a light sleeper and am easily disturbed by other guests on their way to and from their rooms. At The Kensington, I can honestly say, I did not hear a peep during the night and slept extremely well. Bliss!
Unfortunately, we did not have the opportunity to eat in the restaurant, as we had other plans, however, we did have a drink in the gorgeous bar. It's rather glamorous, extremely comfortable and a great place to unwind with one (or two!) of their excellent cocktails created by Bar Manager, Ben.
Did I mention the fabulous location too?! The hotel is just 5 minutes walk from South Kensington tube station and a great choice for a cultural; foodie or shopping trip in Central London. There are plenty of options in walking distance and the rest are just a short tube ride away.
All in all, we love this hotel and would highly recommend it if you're planning a trip to our capital city.",5,2015,12,22
113,Fantastic Hotel & Bar,"I visited The Kensington Hotel this Christmas with a group of friends looking to have some cocktails in a wonderful setting. Safe to say we got what we were hoping for from The Kensington Hotel, the cocktails were fantastic, and the service was impeccable. This before even mentioning the fantastic setting of the timeless art deco bar, inside the gorgeous hotel itself. We had a great time, and I have already been back.",5,2015,12,22
113,Lovely ambiance,"We enjoyed a couple of days in The Kensington with our family the weekend before Christmas. This hotel did not disappoint us. All the staff were committed to giving us the best possible experience. The food, reception rooms and bar were impeccable. The rooms pleasant and clean (we took the more reasonably priced ones which were relatively small but fine for our purposes) and the beds were very comfortable. ",5,2015,12,21
113,Not a good hotel,"Poor lighting in a dark room with dark wallpaper, I had to use my phone torch to see what was in my case. The shower looks great, but is too narrow to use, toiletries provided on day on, but not after unless you like shower caps, I ended up with five if those but no soap. Every morning I was asked at least three times for my room number, but was never asked if I would like some coffee or to order some breakfast. Not good, won't be going back.",1,2015,12,19
113,Best kept secret in London,"I love this hotel. I cannot tell you what an unexpected surprise it was to stay at this gem of a hotel. So much so that I have chosen it to be my home away from home. I commute to London weekly and the staff treats me like a dear, old friend. I feel as if I am coming into their living room and kitchen. The staff are excellent. From Olivier the breakfast manager, Anna the great italian hostess, Emmanuel at the door, Adam at the bar and Simon the General Manager they are gratuitous, helpful, professional, pleasant, efficient and all around pleasure. The location in South Kensington is perfect as closer to airport but excellent cute neighborhood and in one stop you are in Knightsbridge or a few more Piccadilly. Perfect.",5,2015,12,18
113,surpassed our expectations,"Well, what can we say to do justice to this amazing establishment ? After reading previous reviews we hoped we were in for a treat however the reality actually far exceeded our high expectations . We arrived early to be welcomed by staff, and an offer of bag drop to our room by the charming bellman George. The hotel is stunning and beautifully decorated with superb room  accommodation on top floor plus an added bonus of a drawing room on ground floor which we were told to make full use of anytime of day or night. I can honestly say the hotel has the best decor and the great service  that surpassed my expectations  ‚Ä¶ In conclusion it was a fantastic stay.",5,2015,12,18
113,Kensington Welcome,"This hotel was recommended by a friend who had stayed there often.  We were warmly welcomed.  The bellman delivered our luggage, promptly, learned our names and welcomed us each time he saw us by name.  We found all staff anxious to serve and make our stay as comfortable as possible.  The room was very adequate in size and was well furnished. Bed was comfortable.  We ate formally and informally and both experiences were great.  This hotel is first rate at a reasonable price.",5,2015,12,17
113,Excellent hotel!,Very clean and beautiful rooms. The breakfast was really good! The staff were extremely helpful and pleasant. Excellent facilities and a delicious tea! It was probably one of the best hotels in London.,5,2015,12,14
113,A lovely experience!,"This review is long overdue but I have to share with everyone how lovely and amazing my experience was. I stayed in the hotel almost a year ago and although it's been a while since then, I had to comment on how much my family & I enjoyed our stay because of the hotel staff and the reception they have shown us! The warmth of Kensington hotel staff was exceptional and will make a guest feel most special because they go out of their way to help & make you feel comfortable. The hotel room is wonderful complete with amenities, dining options will not disappoint. Located in a decent, upscale and beautiful neighborhood, it gives you a sense of safety walking around the area at anytime of the day. A short bus ride away from Harrods, & shopping area,  minutes walk to convenience stores, interesting restaurants, church & the Victoria & Albert Museum, the location is ideal for 1st timers as well as frequent travellers in London. I will definitely return to stay the next time I'm back in London. 
The VILAR family",5,2015,12,14
113,Luxury Hotel,"This is an amazing hotel wth a very kind staff and great confort and location. The room is luxrurious but very elegant, with all the modern facilities. They present me with a warm candies dishes (it was my birthday) and a very nice personalized handwritted card.",5,2015,12,14
113,"Great location, clean and very helpful staff","My wife and I stayed at The Kensington Hotel when visiting London for a 10 day vacation in December. The hotel was located in the beautiful area of South Kensington and only a few minutes walk from the South Kensington station which is very useful as it runs the District, Circle and Piccadilly underground lines (pretty much giving you access across all of central London. The area itself is home to some great food joints, like JIA and KC crepes! The hotel was very clean and cosey, with the daily mince pies and mulled wine courtesy in the lobby that bring warmth to your day during winter. One of the staff at the Hotel, George, was extremely cheerful and very helpful when it came to planning our days. We really enjoyed our stay and highly recommend this hotel to those visiting London.",5,2015,12,14
113,A Lovely Stay,"Had the pleasure of staying at The Kensington Hotel for four days in October, 2015.  Not only was I treated cordially and with respect, but had a great night's sleep in a comfy bed with lots of pillows.  Every fireplace was ablaze and welcoming, and their continental breakfast spread was plentiful and delicious.  Hotel location was excellent and within walking distance of Victoria & Albert Museum, Royal Albert Hall, Kensington Palace, great restaurants, and Kensington tube station.  I know that I will choose this hotel again and will recommend it to others.",5,2015,12,13
113,Very nice hotel,"We stayed here over the weekend and we loved the hotel and the facilities available, Free and fast wifi, Nespresso machines and much more. The hotel staff are also very kind, polite and professional especially at the concierge desk Martyn, George and many others were a great asset to the team. We highly recommend and hope to return soon.",5,2015,12,13
113,Huge welcome,"Our first experience of on this hotel and what a great one. it was a beautiful hotel with a capital 'H'! The welcome was warm and our room was a real treat, with an amazing view and many luxurious touches. The hotel was so interesting, as were our lovely conversations with my partner over afternoon tea at the lobby on our arrival and throughout our stay. Breakfast was magnificent, in fact everything was just 'Top Notch'. We would highly recommend this place and look forward to another visit in the Spring. Our thanks to all staff and especially Ronnie and George , you really made us feel at home",5,2015,12,11
113,What an amazing hotel!,We recently had our first stay at the Kensington Hotel and felt very welcome from the moment we arrived.  The staff were so polite and helpful.  We had our two young children with us and stayed in one of their family rooms which was huge.  Perfect location for shopping and museums.  No shortage of restaurants within walking distance.  Had the buffet continental breakfast included in our rate and there was plenty of choice.  I can also recommend the pancakes from the breakfast menu.  Thank you Simon and team for making us feel so welcome.  We will definitely be returning soon.,5,2015,12,11
113,Beyond all expectations,"We have stayed at the Kensington Hotel in London a couple of times before and have always had a wonderful experience however our most recent stay was the best yet. Having just spent a week at the hotel, it was hard to leave. The Hotel is situated perfectly only a short walk to South Ken station and so many amazing restaurants around the corner and only 5 mins from The Kings Road.  As I arrived at the hotel, I was warmly greeted by the doorman and then the concierge and that was before we even got to our room.  We stayed in the Luxury Studio Suite which is probably the most beautiful room I have stayed in for quite some time and we travel extensively.  The room was large, sunny with a gorgeous outlook and the bathroom was to die for !  We had breakfast each morning which was such a welcome change to other hotels offering fine quality produce over mountains of food you often find at a buffet.  I also highly recommend the cooked breakfast which was a treat most mornings.  Simon, the General Manager was often seen walking around in the mornings greeting his guests and acted as the perfect host making my husband and I feel like we were the only ones in the hotel.  All in all the customer service at the Kensington Hotel is well beyond any expectations and genuine - they are really there to assist with anything.  Each morning we would be greeted by the doorman or the concierge who always remembered our names and gave us a mini weather report.  At every single level from front desk, cleaners and wait staff, the service was 6 star !  We look forward to our next visit to the Kensington and cannot thank Simon and his team enough for a most memorable and enjoyable stay.",5,2015,12,10
113,Excellent Hotel,This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed. The personnel are all very polite and keen to assist in anything you might need. The lobby/restaurant/common use areas are beautiful (and all very nicely decorated for the xmas season) with jazz music in the background. Breakfast was perfect with fresh fruit and a buffet with high quality food. And of course the location is excellent with bars/restaurants and museums in walking distance and in a very safe area. I highly recommend this hotel to everyone travelling to London.,5,2015,12,10
113,What a welcome!,Recently stayed here for the first time but we were made to feel like regular customers from our first entrance.  Cannot fault the service provided - plentiful and friendly but not intrusive.  Will definitely make it a first port of call for future stays in the capital. ,5,2015,12,09
113,Our home in London,"Each November we travel to  London and always stay at the Kensington Hotel.  It is situated in a perfect location.  When the taxi arrives at the entrance we are greeted by a most welcoming doorman who smiles, gives us a warm greeting and takes our baggage inside.  The front desk folks are ready for us and make us feel special.  The main floor is like an old English club with guests having drinks, doing computer work, reading newspapers and conversing.  The rooms are very nice with a welcoming note on the bed.  The breakfast room is served by the nicest staff from all parts of the EU who are attentive to one's needs like another cappuccino just when you are ready for it.  The bar has friendly, interesting folks to meet and speak with and the martinis are super.  We had the opportunity to have dinner in their restaurant one evening and it was so delicious and the service was so superior that we will surely dine there more than once on our next trip.

The concierge know his business and can be relied on to make a good recommendation for whatever restaurant or event or mode of transport that you need.

It is our home away from home in London.",5,2015,12,08
113,Excellent Wedding,"We recent had our wedding at The Kensington Hotel. We could not praise the staff enough. From start to finish our guests and ourselves received nothing but the best and warmest of service. 

On the day itself the hotel and restaurant looked so beautiful. The decoration and atmosphere was, to be honest, magical. We wanted a Christmas themed wedding and we certainly got that. All of our wishes that we had discussed with your team where fulfilled to perfection, and beyond. The meal was as beautiful as our tasting menu, despite the large number of guests. 

Over the weekend the food was gorgeous and our guests had nothing but praise for the hotel and the staff, friendly, professional and helpful at all times.

We were very impressed and grateful for our special day and weekend to go so well. 

Myself and my wife would recommend this hotel highly to anyone who are planning a wedding. 
",5,2015,12,08
113,Fantastiv,Spent two days in November fantastic from start to finish I can honestly say I have never met such helpful and happy staff nothing is two much trouble our room was spotless tea and even nespresso coffee machine turn down service at night and every thing replenished on arrival a little plate of chocolates left in room lovely touch loved the cocktails and can't wait to go back hats off to the staff and management you certainly have a amazing hotel      ,5,2015,12,08
113,Excellent hotel with THE best Concierge - Michael Buckingham and team!,"Fantastic stay with a very warm reception and lobby, bar, lounge area. Well appointed rooms (I couldn't swing my cat but very few London hotels allow for that) and fantastic location, staff and service. I will be staying again next time.",4,2015,12,07
113,Fabulous!,"This truly is a superb hotel. I stayed here with my husband for one night (wish it had been more) and we will definitely be returning. The staff were extremely friendly and went above and beyond to make our stay special. Our room had everything we could wish for and was beautifully presented. Whilst we didn't have dinner in the hotel, the breakfast was delicious, whether you're on a diet or wanting the full monty! The mince pies and mulled wine upon arrival were a really nice touch!!",5,2015,12,07
113,Excellent ,"I spent the weekend at the Kensington Hotel and we had a fantastic time. Perfect for a girls weekend! The rooms are spacious and luxurious, the hotel is beautifully decorated, the beds are comfortable and breakfast is delicious. Would certainly recommend. The bar service wasn't great, nor were the cakes in the afternoon tea. However we had a lovely time. Special mention goes to George, a v friendly and helpful porter who made the effort to learn our names.",5,2015,12,07
113,The Kensington welcome,"We received a warm and friendly welcome from Staff on our arrival and were immediately made to feel at ease. The hotel's property is a delightful Georgian townhouse. The area is very pleasant with a large number of nice French cafes, bars and restaurants within a walking distance and it's an easy 10 minute walk into Chelsea and Knightsbridge areas. Our room was situated on the top floor and was delightful and decorated with impeccable taste. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was a generous size with a shower that provided ample hot water. The location is extremely quiet and we enjoyed a very good night‚Äôs rest. Breakfast was laid out in the dining room with a wonderful spread of fresh fruits, quality meats and unique ingredients and was a lovely way to start our day. We wholeheartedly recommend staying and hope to return when we visit London again.",5,2015,12,07
113,Gorgeous hotel in a great location,"I booked the Kensington for a romantic weekend Christmas shopping. The rooms are lovely. We had a corner room which was very quiet. The bar, lounge and breakfast room are beautiful with lovely soft furnishings. We wanted to have drinks in the bar but unfortunately there was a wedding reception so we could not go in. Breakfast was delicious - cold buffet followed by full English. All in all, the perfect stay.",5,2015,12,07
113,Fabulous location and wonderful staff,"Thanks for looking after us. Beautiful hotel in a great location close to two tube stations and the beautiful heart of Chelsea. Our room was compact but comfortable, bed linen was gorgeous. Best shower I've ever had and aromatherapy associates toiletries smelt gorgeous!!! 
",5,2015,12,05
113,The search for the perfect London hotel is now complete.,"Just returned home after a great 2 days and nights  in London with my wife.
We spent Wednesday in a very decent hotel in central London, the property is part of a chain of about 12 hotels, it's a 5 star London hotel and it was ""nice"" but it was,faceless corporate, impersonal, busy and if you were on your own I'd imagine,lonely. 

We spent Thursday night at the hotel described in the subject line above, The KENSINGTON on Queens Gate. 

The moment we arrived and were greeted in the most genuine fashion by George (superstar), our luggage was taken care of and in our room by the time we got to it (room 511) after a speedy check in. From that moment we knew we were at a hotel that cared about their guests.

About the hotel.

The communal areas are very comfortable and welcoming with an array of very comfortable lounge seating, we enjoyed several coffees whilst enjoying the peaceful yet bustling ambiance, an ambiance created in my opinion by staff who enjoy being there.

Breakfast was excellent. Genuinely freshly squeezed orange juice, genuinely fresh croissant, and I must admit to enjoying an irresistible full English,which was devine and made using very high quality bacon, sausages and I don't know for sure as I didn't ask ! but probably free range eggs. It was made fresh as opposed to buffet style.

The room we enjoyed(511) was very spacious, the beds are very high quality and the carpet is luxurious.

I was in London for work reasons but whilst at The Kensington I felt like I was on vacation. 

A genuine 5 star London hotel with old school values and staff who are a credit to the owners. 

Wonderful. 

",5,2015,12,04
113,Outstanding Stay at the Kensington,"Just came home from a four night stay at The Kensington; loved it. We have been to London a number of times, this was our first stay at the Kensington; it is now our new hotel to stay when in London.
Beautifully decorated for Christmas, the lobby would be a pleasure to relax in anytime of the year.
The staff was so wonderfully helpful and so friendly. The location is perfect; so classically London. 
The rooms are immaculate and prepared twice a day. The linen is some of the most plush we have experienced in any hotel.
We would, and will, be back.",5,2015,12,03
113,A truly wonderful Hotel,"I highly recommend this hotel for so many reasons, it is a little gem in London.
The hotel itself has a wonderful feel about the place, luxurious and contemporary with the most amazing, friendly staff.
We had a drink in the bar when we arrived and did not want to leave. We were then shown to our room that was so spacious and comfortable with special touches throughout.
Breakfast was very relaxing and offers a wonderful choice from the breakfast menu and buffet.
The staff and management make this hotel so special, nothing is too much trouble for them and it is clear they are all very well trained.
Will definitely return, can't wait for our next visit.
Thank you for a wonderful stay!",5,2015,12,03
113,Amazing,"Beautiful hotel with outstanding service, we were greeted warmly upon arrival and during check in we were informed we had been upgraded which we were thrilled about. Our room was beautifully furnished and that also ran throughout the hotel. The room and hotel were very clean and the bed so comfy. Lovely extras such as canap√© deserts bought to our room upon arrival and a herbal rose tea left for us on our first evening. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and were sad to leave. Doorman and porter George made our stay, very funny and a lovely people person.",5,2015,12,02
113,Perfect location and ambience!,"I LOVED the design, decor and the price point. This property was so classic with  a modern flair. The location of the hotel was amazing and the room was very tasteful, although a tad small but done well with the space.  The room was exceptionally cleaned and prepared twice a day which was lovely to come home too. The staff was exceptionally friendly and inviting.  I would like to return to this property for all the reasons listed above.  ",4,2015,12,02
113,Great hotel,"This hotel is in a great location, about 10-15min walk from Knightsbridge.
The hotel itself is great, and the staff are attentive and provide a great service. The bar is good and breakfast lovely. 
We came with friends for pre Christmas shopping and would definitely come back again. ",5,2015,11,30
113,5 star experience,"The hotel was clean and convenient, It was my first stay here and the level of standard and service was beyond my expectation. Our room was on the fourth floor and was well ventilated with a very nice view of the street below, plenty of bath products and the hotel's wifi was free and fast. In conclusion it was a nice stay and I would stay here again in the future.",5,2015,11,28
113,Home away from Home,"I will gladly stay here again should I ever travel to London, It was so nice to be in a home based setting.I ate at the bumpkins, a lovely British pub just around the corner and there are plenty other cuisines on old Brompton road. Staff were all wonderful and gracious, Really made you feel warm and welcomed at all times with special mentions to Vincent, Martyn, George, and Said at the restaurant. It was one of the best hotels that I have stayed in London and I highly recommend here.",5,2015,11,28
113,Great Surprise!!,"This was a last minute choice and what a great surprise! Super charming, beautiful decoration, heavenly smell of clean, great service and location! Plus, a fair price. Rooms and bathrooms are small but I surely didn't need more space than that for a 5 day visit. Sheets smell like heaven! The hotel bar is top as well as the juicery they have inside.
Only 2 blocks away from the Museum of Natural History and V and A Museum. Right around the corner from the hotel we found a pharmacy, a great Japanese restaurant, a super famous pizzeria the kids loved, a delicious burger place and 2 amazing bakeries! First time staying in the Kensington area, I would say don't stay here only if you really only like staying close to Picadilly or Mayfair etc.",5,2015,11,27
113,A great place to stay in London!,"Good location, great interior design and friendly staff. Beautiful and cozy decoration let us feel strong Christmas atmosphere everywhere in the hotel. George's bright smile and all staff's great effort, warmed us up in this kind of chilly weather. We had a great stay in the Kensington hotel and will come back again for sure. ",5,2015,11,27
113,Comfortable. Accommodating. Easy.,"I love London but normally dread visiting. Hotels are normally tiny, cold and miserable like the weather. The Kensington was a great change. Location is great. Whilst the room wasn't ridiculously large, it was cosy, comfortable and clean. Friendly service from all the staff with them going out of their way to make our stay just a little bit easier and more pleasant. George in particular was always a friendly face to see. Will definitely be back.",5,2015,11,27
113,Checking Into The Kensington,"This is the second time I have stayed at The Kensington, and from experience, I can say it is worth the extra money to book a suite. The first time we booked a standard room, which was very cramped for two people ‚Äì at least by American standards. This time we booked a suite, which looked very nice but we quickly learned being in a room near the elevator in an old hotel is going to mean creaking and lots of noise. After a terrible night‚Äôs sleep, we requested to be moved to a quieter room. The staff, who are all very polite and helpful, graciously accommodated us and found us another suite towards the back of the hotel that faces a side street and has high ceilings and more room, which proved to be much quieter.

The best part about staying at The Kensington is the amazing location on the corner of Queen‚Äôs Gate, just a short walk to Gaucester RD tube station and South Kensington station. I love this area! There are tons of great restaurants and shops on Gloucester RD, Old Brompton RD and all around South Ken. If you stroll up Queen‚Äôs Gate just a couple blocks you will be at the Natural History Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum. And if you walk a few blocks more, you will be at my favorite place in all of London, Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens.

The Kensington Hotel offers 126 guest rooms and 24 suites that are all individually decorated with furnishings that complement the historic building‚Äôs classic Victorian townhouse architecture. Upon entering the hotel you will find two spacious lounge areas that provide the perfect relaxing atmosphere to have tea, lunch or drinks with friends, or a nice place to spend the afternoon reading or doing work on your computer. (The WI-FI at this hotel is free and very fast, which is a huge plus!) The opulently decorated bar serves delicious cocktails (though not on their drink menu, they make killer margaritas!) and the TOWN HOUSE restaurant offers seasonal, locally-sourced modern English cuisine with a focus on fresh, healthy options, including freshly made juices and gluten-free afternoon tea.

113,Awesome stay at the kensington,"We stayed here with my lovely patner and we were thrilled by the warm hospitality and friendliness of all the staff particularly Martyn and George at the comcierge desk. The hotel is well situated near the south kensington tube line and an easy stroll to hyde park, to the museums ( Victoria and albert, Natural history and science). When we came back we treated ourselves to a high tea at the hotel's restaurant. We highly recommend the hotel.",5,2015,11,27
113,Really thrilled with this hotel.,"My daughter and I stayed here for 4 nights and experienced excellent service from the bellman, concierge, reception, cleaning staff, and waiter. They were highly professional and friendly. Our spotless 4th floor room (deluxe) was large with a king bed converted to 2 very comfortable single beds for us, with high quality linens. The bathroom was luxurious. The windows could be open slightly for fresh air. The quiet neighborhood allowed us to keep windows open overnight. The wi-fi worked well and the Nespresso machine made excellent coffee. Shopping, restaurants and the S. Kensington tube station were all nearby. It is a very safe area to walk around in. We easily walked to V&A, Kensington Palace and Harrods. Cost to take the Piccadilly Line to Heathrow was 6 pounds, taking about 45 minutes. A taxi would have cost about 60-75 pounds! So it was great to be near the tube stop which didn't require a change in lines. The dining room was elegant, our dinners were delicious and reasonably priced. The lounges on the ground floor were beautiful, comfortable, and welcoming. I will definitely stay here again the next time we visit from America.",5,2015,11,24
113,great again,"We return to The Kensington because it never lets us down. From the friendliness of the staff, the spotlessly clean rooms, and just the pure quality of the hotel. It is not one of the cheapest in London, but to us, it's certainly the best. You get what you pay for in this life, and value for money, it cannot be beaten. We have revisited hotels in the past, only to find that levels have slipped, but The Kensington never lets us down. ",5,2015,11,24
113,Luxurious,"As this is my first review, I would like to say thank you to all staff members of the kensington hotel who looked after us. The hotel was great and the facilities were state of the art like the imacs computers at their business centre, the nespresso machines, the gym etc. I look forward to visit here again next year.",5,2015,11,23
113,Brilliant,"We had  lovely time staying at this hotel. I couldn't fault the staff at all - they were all so polite and helpful. Brilliant atmosphere, especially the lounge area with fire and comfy sofas. Great location - although not central, walking distance to South Kensington Hotel which has Central, District and Piccadilly lines. But really, the highlight was the friendly staff and top notch service.",5,2015,11,22
113,A fine hotel with exceptional service,"You will not be disappointed with a stay at this elegant, well appointed hotel. We booked two rooms for one night and from the moment of arrival we were overwhelmed by the attentiveness of the friendly staff - everyone we encountered, from the door staff to reception to waiting staff could not have done more to help. The hotel is a stunning building with interior d√©cor to rival any of its competitors. Rooms were extremely clean and comfortable. We did not dine but the breakfast was superb.

Highly recommended and we will be returning.",5,2015,11,22
113,Over the top service,"Warm and welcoming staff, felt comfortable and at home immediately on arrival. In every direction, ""can I get you anything, sir?"", ""may I help you, sir?""

Vincent and the concierge staff are patient and will explain how to travel around town by whatever mode. And Vincent's dinner recommendations were all spot on. They even satisfied our request to find Argentine milongas!

Great location and neighborhood got walking, hi end shopping, and walkable good restaurants. 

Friendly bar, had port and sambuca for us and at breakfast the best waffles I've tasted, more pastry and cake-like and irresistible. 

Tea time a delightful peaceful oasis with a memorable tower of small sandwiches and pastries. 

Stay at this hotel. My wife and I will be back.

113,Lovely hotel with very traditional British style,"The Kensington Hotel was a perfect reflection of the Kensington area - distinguished, classy and friendly in a reserved British style. We had a standard room which was well equipped and good quality but quite small which is common for London hotels. The lounge areas and bar were great with lovely open fires and a formal library type feel. The restaurant was excellent for dinner and breakfast was also superb. Overall the Kensington Hotel provided an outstanding location for our last night in Europe.",5,2015,11,20
113,"Perfect location, good value although small room","We stayed in 315 which, although clean and well decorated, was pretty tiny. The bathroom took 'small' to another level as well. None the less though, everything was modern and clean. The bed was comfortable and the traffic noise was not an issue. The communal areas in the hotel are beautifully decorated and we enjoyed a final cocktail before bed. One thing I found annoying in the bedroom was the lack of a plug near a mirror. Very hard to style your hair without being able to see yourself.
All round though, no complains and would definitely stay again.",5,2015,11,20
113,Room size tiny ,"Myself and wife stayed at this hotel as we had a white tie banquet to attend at the Natural History museum, just up the road. I thought paying ¬£278 for a room with continental breakfast would get me a nice room. How very wrong I was, the room was a ""superior"" I'm trying to work out what the room was superior to, because if there were smaller rooms you would suffocate. 

We really struggled to get ready, there are no drawers just hangers. I gestimate the whole room including bathroom to be about 12ft x 9ft. I work for the Royal family and have stayed in countless hotels in central London, this was the smallest room I've ever stayed in. We contacted the front desk to change rooms and were advised that they could not help. 

When we returned at midnight the staff were in a basement courtyard area having loud party relax time as I guess they were off duty. This is fine but not at the side of the guests entrance do it at the back of the hotel.

A real shame because the rest of the hotel was very pleasant. 

I'm British but if you are American forget it you will be disappointed, the rooms are about the same size as your walk in wardrobes.

",2,2015,11,20
113,Excellent Hotel,"Have stayed here several times and this place has proven to be a great option for London if you enjoy the South Kensington area.  The rooms do vary and they can be quite small, but if not staying in the smallest room it is a great experience.  The overall feeling of the hotel is 100% London.  But what really makes it, is the lobby and the fireplaces.  Its great to have meetings by the fireplace and see all the guests roaming around.  In any case was happy with the hotel overall.",5,2015,11,20
113,"Charming, Elegant, and Chic Up-Scale Hotel","Stayed in this beautiful hotel for an extended business/leisure trip. The hotel service started before I got to the hotel - literally. Arriving around rush hour, I took the Tube to get from Euston Station to the hotel. As I came around the corner about a block from the hotel entrance, a bellman walked towards me quickly and took my bags - how he knew I was staying at the hotel was beyond me, but it was a really nice touch! We had a beautiful junior suite room with a fully updated modern bathroom. The heated floors, large mirrors, double sinks, and large soaking tub were amazing - no detail was missed. Turn down service was great, leaving both still and sparkling water as well as chocolates on our pillows.

I love hotels with a great lobby scene, and this hotel was no exception. The table service for tea, coffee, drinks, and snacks available at all of the lobby seating areas was great. 

We ate one night in the restaurant - I'd give it an OK - service was great, food was good, decor was nice - it was more the menu selection I felt was lacking. The dinner special during weeknights is well worth it though - if you order an entree you get a free glass of wine, and if you order two entrees I believe you get a free bottle. We received a note from the restaurant detail the offer upon check-in. If you're tired and don't feel like going out to find another option for a meal, the restaurant is a solid option.

One of our favorite parts of the hotel was the bar/lounge area. The wood-paneled walls and beautiful chandeliers created an intimate upscale space. The bartenders were very friendly and willing to make any cocktail you wanted, even if it wasn't on their list. We ordered Pimms Cups and had some fun with the bartender as he tried to make them exactly the way we liked them (a mix of gin, ginger ale, and Pimms), then he made his own twist using Fever Tree Sparkling Lemonade instead of ginger ale. It's a great place to relax and enjoy a few cocktails - the service is top notch as is every other detail in the lounge (glassware, presentation, bar snacks, etc).

The location is very convenient to the Tube and we found it easy both for work and leisure trips.

Highly recommended - we will stay here again!",5,2015,11,20
113,Be Prepared! Welcome to your closet.,"Attractive property with well maintained and charming common areas. But be prepared for closet size rooms. If you are lucky you might be placed in one of the nicer rooms. Until i had a higher status via their loyalty program i received attentive treatment and upgraded rooms. As soon as my status returned to a lower level, the attentive service was replaced with cordial but a more common approach and my rooms begun to become smaller and smaller. I am currently in a room so small that i can barely walk from one side of the bed to the other side. Having 3 suitcases, they are all on the floor and further prevent movement in the room. The closest is so small that barely two suit jackets can fit - very problematic for business travelers. The bathroom is so small that the door leans against the sink and limits movement around the sink. The room feels like a poor attempt at decorating a closet and calling it a superior room. Currently Very disenchanted with the property.  As a side note, great service of staff at the bar/restaurant as well as doormen.",3,2015,11,19
113,Definitely worth every penny,My boyfriend and I were taking a short four day trip to London to experience all there is in the beautiful city. I had booked this hotel back in September just so I had it secured and ready to go. The minute the taxi pulled up to the hotel we were greeted by a very friendly bellman who took our bags for us and brought them inside. The staff here was so friendly and accommodating it made us feel so incredibly welcome and comfortable. The housekeeping staff came and cleaned the room up for us during the days while we were out sightseeing and the staff in the lobby were extremely helpful with any questions we had. Overall the Kensington made our stay in London that much better and we would come back to London again just to stay there!  ,5,2015,11,17
113,Fantastic break,"Have just returned from a fabulous couple of days at The Kensington Hotel, from the moment we arrived until the time we departed everything was perfect.  The room was spotlessly clean, great touches on the turndown service with water at the side of the bed, slippers at the ready and a different pot of tea each night on your return.  Breakfast is superb, the choice on the continental buffet is outstanding, the potted smoked salmon is a delight.  Finally, must mention the staff, throughout the hotel all staff are very friendly, polite and attentative couldn't ask for more!  Can't wait to return.",5,2015,11,17
113,Superb afternoon tea!,"What a nice venue for an afternoon tea between friends! We had a very good spot near the window and were welcomed by Georges, the waiter in charge that day. The service was very friendly and personalized, we really appreciated it! Food and tea were delicious. Will definitely come back there next time I am in London. ",4,2015,11,16
113,Christmas excitement at The Kensington Hotel..,"Great weekend spent at The Kensington Hotel... Fabulous location ... near the tube station , Kensington is a beautiful and quiet area of London, near the famous Kensington Palace and it's beautiful gardens.. lovey to take a walk here on a crisp wintery day.. or take the tube to Harrods for a treat, shopping at it's best.. in fact the tube will bring you anywhere you should want to go and then return to the safe , relaxing surroundings of your hotel ... rooms high standard... staff helpful and friendly .. lovely high end cake shop near by... we loved taking some treats back in the evening to have with a coffee in our room ...",5,2015,11,16
113,AMAZING STAFF,"My RECENT STAY FOR ONE NIGHT AT THE HOTEL WAS AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE ! from the minute I arrived I was impressed with the lovely clean smell of the reception and the concierge was very attentive .
The bar was very relaxed with nice classy people in it ! and the cocktails well they speak for themselves .
The rooms are very cosy and the bed linen was 5 star as you would expect in Kensington . 
however the part I enjoyed was the amazing cooked breakfast in front of the lovely warm fire , a fab way to start your day whatever you may be doing in London .
I have stayed in hotels all over the world and this one is right up there for professionalism and amazing staff .! 
don't hesitate just book it ! ",5,2015,11,16
113,The Best!!!,"This is a wonderful hotel.  I can't say enough good things about the hotel and the staff.  The rooms are lovely, decorated nicely, a good size, quite and clean.  The room was cared for very nicely daily.  Turn down service was provided each evening.   The beds are very comfortable and bathroom towels soft and fluffy.  Robes and slippers are provided.  The room has a coffee maker and electric tea kettle with an assortment of teas and coffee.  There was not a desk or dresser in the room and the closet had moderate hanging space so we just kept half of our clothes in the suitcase.  We had a deluxe room with a queen size bed so not sure if that makes a difference. The climate control in the room worked very well.
Our hotel package included breakfast which was very good and had many selections.  They have a continental breakfast as well as freshly prepared items. We were able to go to their ""French"" tea which was wonderful.  I would go to this if you stay here, it was very good and a fun experience.  The space in which the tea is served is very comfortable and relaxing and was a nice place to have an after dinner drink as well.  The room is cozy with a lovely fireplace.
The hotel is located very close to Kensington Gardens,  Kensington Palace, Harrods and several museums.  The South Kensington  Underground Station was within a few blocks so an easy walk from the hotel.
The BEST thing about this hotel is the SERVICE!  Everyone is so nice and very helpful.  We were always greeted with a smile and hello, and asked how we could be helped.  Everyone we encountered at the reception desk, the concierge desk, in the dining room and lounge was great!  Doorman and housekeeping as well.  They all made you feel very welcome.  We were here for four days and the service was wonderful every day.  You really felt pampered.  We wished we could have stayed longer and can't wait to go back.  We would stay here again.",5,2015,11,15
113,Wonderful!,"Had a wonderful stay at The Kensington Hotel on Queensgate in the Kensington area.  Within walking distance of  Victoria and Albert Museum, Kensington Gardens and Palace, tube station, and Hyde Park.  Also close to wonderful restaurants.
My entire stay at The Kensington Hotel could not have nicer.  Beautiful rooms, wonderful continental breakfast, and was treated with extreme respect and kindness.  I would recommend it to everyone.",5,2015,11,15
113,The nicest hotel in London,"I have stayed here a few times and I have never had a problem. This is the first time staying with my wife and she echoes my opinion of this superb hotel. A lovely,lovely place to stay. Cannot praise  it enough. Do try and enjoy the London Bike scheme outside the front door.",5,2015,11,13
113,Great service!,"This hotel is always my favourite choice. It has great location. This place makes me feel relaxed and give me peace of mind. People there offers you excellent service and they are so friendly. 
Service is very good in general.
I love this place and recommend it to everyone either visiting London or living in!!!

113,Lovely experience,"I arrived in London early and didn't expect my room to be ready.  The staff not only went out of their way to make me feel comfortable, but was able to have my room available well before normal check-in hour.  When you're coming from abroad after a long trip, this is especially appreciated.  The entire stay was met with exceptional service and attention to my needs.  I spent my birthday in London and was delighted to receive a special treat upon returning to my room that day!  It made the visit very special.  George and other restaurant staff were always pleasant and available.  Olivier Secret was especially attentive to making any dining experience comfortable, relaxing, and inviting.  The only drawback of such a wonderful hotel is wanting to spend time in one of their lovely sitting rooms rather than enjoying my favorite city!  The atmosphere was always abuzz with folks enjoying themselves in such comfort and luxury.  I'm already planning another trip back and The Kensington Hotel is at the top of my list for places to stay.  See you soon!  Tracey",5,2015,11,09
113,Clean and loved the location,We had two rooms one for us and the other for our two daughters.  Clean and very well located.  Just a short walk to the tube.  We enjoyed our stay and we were there for a week and I would definitely stay there again and would recommend to anyone visiting London.,5,2015,11,08
113,Lovely hotel but room very small,"We had a warm welcome at this hotel on a rainy afternoon in London. The hotel is very well located with museums, galleries, shops, eateries and the park all short walking distances away. The hotel is beautifully decorated. Our room was clean and the bed very comfortable but it was very small - we had to squeeze past the bed to get to the other side of the room. This was OK for one night but would not have been for more than one. Similarly the bathroom was small - no room for any toiletries of our own. The cooked breakfast was a highlight - best breakfast I've had in a very long time.",4,2015,11,08
113,Stay,"We have been to this hotel few times. We've always been extremely impressed with both the service, George (who we've been lucky to have seen a few times) is a fantastic waiter, and the exceptional and unusual English afternoon tea. 
The Kensington hotel is a haven of tranquillity and excellence after a hectic trip to the shopping district of Knightsbridge. On one occasion we even decided to stay the night after a particular tiring trip to Westfield. I could go on but to finish, it truly is an oasis that we are thrilled to have discovered!",5,2015,11,08
113,The Kensington.,"The location of this hotel is in this elegant neighbourhood, close to the museums, Horrods and numerous good restaurants. I loved most of all the elegant lounge and of course the grand  bar which has been refurbished . The room was comfortable with a huge window . the service at breakfast was slow and at some point they did not deliver a good service.",4,2015,11,08
113,An outstanding place to stay!,"We have just returned from the most wonderful stay at this sublime hotel.  From the original booking telephone call, to the moment we left, the staff at The Kensington Hotel offered a faultless level of service.  With special thanks to the gentleman who assisted us with the storing of our luggage (and kindly arranged for us to dine early), the gentleman who served us during our evening meal and also to Steffi for the wonderful birthday surprise that was left for my husband.  Not a single request was too much trouble. The room was absolutely superb, quiet and peaceful, the linen was fresh and beautifully perfumed, everything, even down to the lighting in the room was exceptionally well thought out and it was a real pleasure to stay here.  Our evening meal was delicious and the cocktail I had was wonderful.  We simply cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and cannot wait to return.  The one regret I have is that I omitted to take the names of the aforementioned gentlemen who so kindly helped us, in order that I could thank them on this site. You have helped to make two people very happy indeed! Thank you!",5,2015,11,07
113,Wonderful Experience,"I was in London alone to visit my niece who was working in London for a year. What a great excuse! I was very, very happy and pleased with my stay at ""The Kensington"". I plan on staying here again when I am in London and would surely recommend it to anyone. The staff were friendly, courteous and helpful. I think the housekeepers had ESP  because they managed to gage my absence from the room without the need of the service tag. In and out of the room with stealth. I enjoyed the comfort of the common areas, ""the withdrawing rooms"",  so to speak as well as the comfortable and lovely bar.  The dining room was very pleasant and the food was good. Perfect for my needs. I was happy with the location too. A short walk from South Kensington tube station and really a very short walk to several museums and the fabulous shops (Harrods) of Knightsbridge. There was a Waitrose across the street so I could purchase food, large waters, wine and snacks for my room. Very convenient when I was too tired from sight seeing to do anything but put my feet up and ""crash"".  My room was comfortable and clean. I loved he Nespresso machine. Any glitches I had were quickly resolved. Kudos!",5,2015,11,06
113,"Location, location, location!","Since I was travelling with my kids (4 and 12), what I liked most about this hotel, apart from the friendly service, was the location -- walking distance from the museums, excellent access to the Tube. Our package included breakfast but we didn't make it in time most days. Could've been more variety in the breakfast menu --  not bad by any means, but the same thing everyday. Room service options were limited but we were close enough to a bunch of restaurants that delivered anyway. 
The room had no view whatsoever -- the wall of the building overlooking it -- but we didn't care very much. We stayed about five days, and all in all, it was very pleasant. I'd definitely recommend it for the reasons I've listed.",4,2015,11,05
113,High tea with George,"After a long day of walking and biking around the city, George took splendid care of us! The food was delicious. It was definitely a highlight of our trip and we will be recommending all our friends add this to their itineraries when visiting London. ",5,2015,11,01
113,Brilliant Hotel in South Kensington,"5 stars and two thumbs up all round. From the check in to, the cleaning staff, to the food (and team, Olivier gets a special mention) at the Aubrey Restaurant in this fine property, this is hospitality as it should be. Two thumbs up.",5,2015,11,01
113,"This would never happen in U.S.!,,","Shockingly happy experience: I arrived exhausted after a flight from
Shanghai.  I was shown to my room, and unpacked. As I was preparing for early bed I got a call from  Steffi Ziegler, Manager of Guest Relations, who asked if everything was alright. I said  yes ,but the room was consiferably smaller than the three I had stayed in in China. She immediately offered the possibility of an upgrade without charge! I was speechless. My room was small but perfectly adequate. This morning she called as planned and executed a seamless move to a bigger room. I am still speechless and would rank Ms Ziegler's performance 100 on a 10 scale.",5,2015,10,29
113,A fancy stay,"I loved staying in The Kensington, the hotel is classic and chic, even though the rooms are small you dont feel claustrophobic of uncomfortable; well designed for comfort. The location is very strategic its close to everything; restaurants, underground that takes you to anywhere in london basically, and museums. ",5,2015,10,26
113,Excellent Stay,"A first class hotel with exceptional staff and service in the leafy suburb of Kensington, walking distance to The Royal Albert Hall which was our main reason for being in that part of London.
Its like being in someone's town house with exceptional staff and service.
We will return.  ",5,2015,10,22
113,Everything was perfect!,"The Kensington Hotel is within walking distance of the Natural History Museum, the V & A, the Science Museum and the Royal Albert Hall (and lots more but there is a limit to how much one can see and do in a day!).  The staff are friendly and helpful.  They will park your car locally and return it when needed! What a bonus! The lounges are comfortable and stylish with fresh flowers and cheerful fires.  This hotel was recommended to us and we readily recommend it to others!",5,2015,10,22
113,Average Luxury Hotel,"We stayed here during our honeymoon and loved the place.  The breakfast was up to par and the hotel bar had some great innovative cocktails.  I wanted to absolutely love this hotel but there were a few funky things we ran into.  We supposedly got an ""upgrade"" to a King Size Bed but it was actually just two double beds pushed together to make one large bed and a King Size top sheet.  Funky.  Then upon checkout, the gentlemen was incredibly rude.  He charged us for breakfast each morning but we had already paid for that.  When we asked him to refund us the money he did, but with quite the attitude and practically threw our new receipt at us. 

I will say it is a beautiful hotel and a lot of great restaurants are around there but I would think twice before I stayed there again. Tea, on the other hand, I would definitely do here again!",3,2015,10,19
113,"Great hotel, decent location - horrible wifi","Very nice hotel, great staff and located 5-8 min walk from subway. The only letdown was the wifi which was very bad. If i opened the door and sat halfway in the hall i could just barely connect. it is a shame cause otherwise it is a very good hotel.",4,2015,10,19
113,A South Kensington treasure!,"My husband and I visited London in mid-August and stayed at The Kensington Hotel for four nights. It was a truly superb stay! We experienced great hospitality and the amenities of a beautiful, charming and elegant hotel. The lobby is gorgeous ‚Äì feels like you‚Äôre visiting someone‚Äôs stylish and sophisticated living room. The full breakfast was amazing with so many delectable options to choose. As for location, this hotel is right in the middle of a lovely London neighborhood that‚Äôs not too touristy ‚Äì chock full of nice restaurants & local supermarkets, plus a close walk to the train station and Kensington Gardens. I have just one thing I‚Äôd like to mention to anyone who stays here. There is a bottle of water on each night table ‚Äì compliments of the hotel. We did not know that the night we arrived and called down to room service for water since we were dehydrated from our long flight. A waiter brought up two bottles of still water that totaled $18. It would have been nice if we were told the bottles in the room were complimentary. That is my only criticism. Other than that, we highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2015,10,18
113,Hair straighter missing ???,"I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights with my 2 children. I have a double buggy - the halls are very narrow and I struggled to push my buggy through the halls and then there were stairs also! Very annoying and very on my own with 2 children. 
After checking out and then checking into my next hotel / I remembered I accidentally left my ""hair straightener"" in the bathroom of 202 on the trolley in the bathroom. After phoning the hotel and explaining to them I left it in my room - only 3 hours after checking out, they said they would call me back.....no call back!!! Followed it up the next day and they checked again with housekeeping and surprise surprise ""no Bianca, there was nothing left in your room. Very very disappointing from such a hotel that received raving reviews when I know very well I left it there by mistake. Never will i return to this hotel ",1,2015,10,17
113,A well placed gem!,"Fabulous property, well located.
Lots to chose from in London, but if you want a ""boutiquish""  hotel that is well run, with great food, service, outstanding staff....this is it. Close to Chelsea, right around the corner from South Kensington Tube, Harrod's.....neighbourhood with a cool vibe, wide choice of restaurants.
We booked a double but were given a ""family room"", with two huge doubles. Well appointed.
We'd book this one again!!",5,2015,10,17
113,A great find!,"Although we only stayed for one night prior to our flight home we undoubtedly will visit again. The staff were exceptionally friendly and the quality of the furnishings made it feel very up market and luxurious. The water given to us upon check out was appreciated and the location was great with an easy walk to the Underground and shops. The only downside was the noisy floor boards that creaked in the corridor when early risers walked by our room, but the building is old after all. Thank you!",5,2015,10,13
113,"Historic hotel, great location, excellent service","We arrived in London for a couples trip and this was our first hotel. The staff were professional and accomodating. Our room was small but  clean and quiet. Common areas were very nice, breakfast was super.",5,2015,10,13
113,WOW!,"What a great hotel. The decor, the food and the lovely staff - thank you!  We stayed here for three days and had a great time here. When going to London again we will definately stay here - maybe George will be the manager then....see you all.",5,2015,10,13
113,Afternoon Tea,We had a delightul afternoon tea at the Kensington Hotel last week.  The tea was delicious and the service very good.  We were looked after by George who took every care over us whilst we were there.  I would highly recommend.,5,2015,10,13
113,"Clean, quiet, excellent service, relaxing","We've stayed here before for a weekend away - following a West End show.  Our room was immaculate, spacious and quiet, the bed beautifully comfortable and the bathroom was lovely.  The location is ideal for the parks and South Ken. station.  The staff were very professional and overwhelmingly helpful and accommodating: at the door, the front desk, the bar, at breakfast.  It's a peaceful, tasteful hotel; I felt relaxed all the time and I didn't want to leave!",5,2015,10,12
113,Convenient and Comfortable,"We have just returned from seven days in London staying at The Kensington Hotel. The hotel's location in South Kensington is excellent, near two underground stations with direct access to Heathrow and the central city and tourist sites. The area offers many varied pubs and restaurants and is a good deal quieter than some of London's other prime neighborhoods. Hotel staff were gracious and very helpful, with special mention of Lillian and Olivier. The public rooms, including the bar and the dining room at the hotel's ""Town House"" restaurant,  were comfortable and inviting (one of the main salons is under total renovation to be completed shortly), and breakfast at the restaurant was extensive and excellent. Our room was typically ""London small"" but nicely furnished, with up-scale linens ( note - the Superior Queen rooms include only one chair; we asked for a second and it was promptly delivered). Our only issue was getting used to a HVAC system under central control that sometimes over heated or over cooled the room, a typical problem in the early fall when outside temps fluctuate (ask the front desk to set the room to a specific temperature that you usually find comfortable).

Overall, an excellent choice. The Kensington Hotel will be on the top of our list when we next return to London.",4,2015,10,10
113,Lovely,George added to the elegance and delightful service that epitomizes the Kensington Hotel. Afternoon tea with scones in the library is a must. Bike stands for rent are just outside so pedal away in Hyde Park nearby. Looking forward to our return. ,5,2015,10,10
113,Our favorite place to stay! ,"Love the Kensington Hotel! The decor is warm and inviting and the service is excellent. It's the perfect place for business and family alike. I always look forward to breakfast with George. He's always cheerful and there to help! Very accommodating space and staff, highly recommended. ",5,2015,10,10
113,Best Hotel in London,"The staff makes this the best hotel in London.  Location is perfect to access public transit system, some renovations but don't be put off.  Stayed there earlier in the year and would be first choice of hotels in London.",5,2015,10,08
113,Afternoon tea served by George!,"We had the most wonderful experience at the hotel, the tea was served by the friendly and efficient, George! He was entertaining and helpful and we were all extremely satisfied! The mood was relaxing and the treats delicious! Even though the hotel was suffering from a power shortage, they made sure we were accommodated for! A lovely selection of teas, affordable and delicious!",5,2015,10,07
113,Our London Trip,"Having never been to London before, my husband and I took the advice of our travel agent to stay at The Kensington Hotel.  So glad we did!!
This hotel was located in a very nice part of London, a short walk to Harrod's.
The hotel was very British in feel, so this added to our London experience! Our room was very large, and decorated beautifully, with a queen size bed.
Our hotel stay included the full breakfast in their restaurant, and we enjoyed a lovely breakfast everyday of our stay, and the waitstaff were so friendly and professional. We would definitely stay at the Kenstington Hotel, again, and will recommend it to anyone visiting London!",5,2015,10,06
113,Very beautiful hotel with wonderful staff,I spent one night at the Kensington hotel and it was lovely. It's true the rooms are small but they are still very nice. I enjoyed the staff. George was a wonderful staff member and her helped me out a lot. Elena was great and very understanding about my turn down service. The food was delicious. I even got afternoon tea sent to my room. It was an overall great experience. ,5,2015,10,04
113,Very Pleasant Afternoon Tea,"My mother and I enjoyed a lovely afternoon tea at The Kensington Hotel. The atmosphere was very sophisticated and exactly what we were looking for. The food and tea were delicious and we served by George, who was very polite and accommodating. Overall it was a very pleasant experience!",5,2015,10,02
113,Perfect Stay,"Service was perfect and kind, the location is great, alot of supermarkets, restaurants and shops around there, rooms and hotel was perfect, the setting area in the ground floor is so calm and relaxing,  i will be there any time i visit London !! ",5,2015,09,30
113,Fawlty Towers Experience,"We stayed for 4 nights in Room 327. There was a water pump in the bathroom ceiling adjacent to the bedroom air conditioning vent which went off randomly any time of the day or night and made a loud noise. Hotel staff said they were trying to get the company to replace the pump with a whisper quiet one, but were still waiting....seriously.... still waiting... just replace it and quibble later!! Electrical point was broken and ejected from it's socket with exposed wiring. Room was not vacuumed, and biscuits etc not replaced, toilet not cleaned each day. Breakfast was hilarious. Soup spoon for a cereal spoon?!! Had to order and then wait 20 minutes for bacon and eggs on toast. Then no toast just the bacon and eggs!! Many other things, eg no salt in the salt shaker on the room service tray, safe wouldn't open one day and had to wait 20 minutes for someone to come and open it. Another guest found a dried prawn on her room floor. The staff seem to try hard and dress appropriately but for this room rate this was a 3 star experience. I wouldn't go back, and would have checked out, like another couple did, if we hadn't prepaid! Makes Fawlty Towers look good.",1,2015,09,30
113,Well worth a stay,"Read some negative reviews, prior to visiting. Ignore them. Staff are lovely and helpful. Rooms are on the small side, but are very nice. Yes, the lift is small, but why are you wanting to have a party in a lift? I will definitely return as it is good value for money plus it is actually very nice.",4,2015,09,27
113,Ms,Great afternoon tea with proffesional waiters. George made our visit very pleacent. We got great information about the different cakes served and renewal of tea when needed. The champagne tasted delicious with the savoury part of the afternoon tea. Thanks George! We'll be back!,5,2015,09,26
113,Enjoyed afternoon Tea,"Had a enjoyable afternoon with afternoon tea served by a Supernice waiter, George. Sweet and savery with lovely Tea and a glass of Moet. The environment is really cosy with floffy couches and comfortable chairs. 
A bit pricey but well worth it. 
Made our day ",5,2015,09,26
113,Marvelous Hotel and Neighborhood,"We had a wonderful stay at this charmingly decorated hotel.  Our room had two king sized beds in ti, which was surprising, and made the room really large.  The service from the staff was friendly and very helpful.  When we needed anything we could call the concierge to assist.  The neighborhood is quaint and centrally located; close to South Kensington Underground line, buses and cabs.",5,2015,09,25
113,Afternoon tea and stay at the hotel ,"Arrived to the hotel in the late afternoon and decided to have the afternoon tea. This month was a French menu which was delicious and the server George was gracious, attentive and friendly. Hotel is lovely - clean, nice decor and in a good area. Would come back again. ",5,2015,09,25
113,Great location and downstairs decor,"This hotel is in an ideal location in London. It is reasonably priced. The bedrooms are basic but acceptable.
The Bar staff are a comedy of errors!
Don't ask for a drip mat as you will be told they do not have them-
indeed never heard of same!
Prices in the bar are high with limited availability of beers.
Overall- not a bad place.

",3,2015,09,25
113,Business Trip and Birthday Stay,"As usual the Kensington delivered on fantastic and friendly service. It's always such a pleasure to return to this hotel and see the same faces, usually hotels can have a high turnover of staff so The Kensington must be doing something right by their staff.
Cocktails and service in the bar from Alexandro and the team were again impeccable.
A special thanks for the hospitality team and the lovely surprise I received in my room for my birthday.
The breakfast and dining area is now lovey bright and airy, very pleasant place to eat and relax.",5,2015,09,24
113,Birthday Weekend,Stayed for just the one night. The hotel is beautiful and decor exquisite. The staff are friendly and cocktails great. Only negative about this hotel was the actual rooms for guests are very small and although of a high spec made me feel a little claustrophobic. ,4,2015,09,23
113,Very nice hotel,"We visited this hotel in September 2015.
Very professional, clean and cozy hotel.
We arrived around 4 PM and we were greeted with very friendly reception staff that offered hot towels upon arrival.
Check in was fast and besides the basic info we were also provided with maps and some hints regarding where to get eat in the area.
Our room was on second floor close to elevator and facing Queens Gate street.
Room was clean  and relatively spacious for London hotels. 
Bed was nice and comfy. We kept the windows open during our stay and beside some noise from Ferraris or Lamborghinis (or some other exotics cars) passing by we did not have any problem with noise .
Bathroom was clean and equipped with all necessary items but it was a little cramped. One thing I found strange was the bathtub. Even for someone who is over 180 (6 feet) getting in and out was a challenge...try to imagine how difficult it was for my short wife :).
A nice touch in the room-built in all plug types so even if you forgot your adapter for your North American or European equipment you will be able to charge them. Also you  will find a Nesspreso machine in room so getting your espresso in room was quite cool. There was also a safety deposit box, iron and bathrobes and slippers which they delivered with an apology after the first day because we didn't find them in our room when we entered.
Only thing that I will consider changing is the carpet in rooms, looked dated. Otherwise, the room was clean and nicely decorated.
The customer service at this hotel is exceptional. The concierge will help you with all your questions and all staff are very pleasant. 
Hotel is close to major museums and a short walk to tube (which we did not use...like to walk). The area around the hotel, has all kind of restaurants from fast food to very posh. We had pizza at Franco Manca at Old Brampton Road,(5 min from hotel) always busy but very, very good. A few nice restaurants also at Exhibition Rd (Le Pain Quotidian for breakfast)
I would recommend this hotel to friends and family and I will stay here next time without any hesitation.
Big thanks to all staff",4,2015,09,20
113,"Great location, average hotel","I booked a number of rooms in the Kensignton when my parents came to visit in London. This was their first time in the city so I wanted something luxurious and comfortable and was happy to spend a bit extra for a great location and a really nice experience. The hotel itself was very nice and in the perfect location, however I was quite disappointed by the rooms and some aspects of the service. 

We stayed in a total of four different rooms during our stay at the Kensington and all of them were very small and did not have a particularly luxurious or boutique feel that I was expecting. The decor generally felt a bit lackluster and tired. 

One evening we were given a room which was already occupied (!!) and one of our bookings was cancelled in error when we tried to check in. In the end both issues were sorted but I thought the service could have been much better and there wasn't an attention to detail that you would expect. 

Overall it was a nice hotel, but at this price point there are many other London hotels that I would choose next time.",3,2015,09,20
113,"Great customer service, I will be back.","I was a guest at the Kensington the last week in August. The room I had was small (by American standards) but clean and well-appointed, afternoon tea was lovely and everyone I encountered on their staff was helpful, kind and friendly. I'd like to especially note that Loris, George, Ronnie and Emanuel all took very good care of me, going above and beyond in regards to customer service.",5,2015,09,19
113,Great London hotel,"Great hotel!!! Would recommend for anyone. South Ken location is great. 

Lovely warm, luxe design in main areas. Subtle scents all around which is such a nice touch.  

Rooms very nice and practical. Nespresso machines in room. Mine was small but absolutely fine for London standards. Pretty quiet considering room faced Queens Gate (4th floor). 

Excellent service all around. 

24 hour fitness center with pretty good equipment (though only one sketchy elliptical). Strong wifi. ",5,2015,09,19
113,Elegent and good value,"We tend to stay in the Knightsbridge or So. Ken neighborhoods and this was first time at the Kensington. Elegent property, very nice rooms. A little further out for walks to Harvey Nichols and the shops on Cromwell Road but atmosphere is quiet and there are lots of decent restaurants in the area.",4,2015,09,18
113,"Second time around, just as great as the first time!","Stayed here on our last trip and loved it, so we decided to stay here again on our recent trip.  It didn't disappoint.  It really does feel like home away from home and the staff is so accommodating and welcoming.  Especially the concierge, Vincent, who is the nicest guy and can't do enough for you.  The food was a little different but even a touch better, except for the tea which was a disappointment....it was a ""french"" style tea and just wasn't as good as the one we had during our last stay.  I think in England, most visitors who order an afternoon tea are really looking for a typical English one.   It's also in a great location, you can walk to so many sights.  We just love it!",5,2015,09,18
113,This hotel is amazing!,"My boyfriend and I were just there and we are still enchanted! What a place! We refuse now to stay anywhere else when in London; our standards have gone now way up because of the Kensington. 
Great location, great restaurants, a couple of blocks from the tube station. 
Very friendly staff, very nice and modern room, amazing breakfast... What can I say? We fell in love with London and The Kensington has a lot to do with it!
We will definitely be back! ;-)",5,2015,09,15
113,Top class hotel!!!,"me and my daughter stayed for one night only,when we arrived, our room was not ready but the kind gentleman took our number and said he would ring as soon as it would be ready, half an hour later it was ready.excellent hotel, from decor to staff, hope to stay again for a few more nights next time, i loved all the little touches of the hot flannel on arrival. breakfast is lovely with everything you could wish for. location is ideal for underground and central for everything.",5,2015,09,15
113,English Comfort,"We split our stay in England with 5 then 2 nights at The Kensington. Our first room was a bit larger than the second one. A very comfortable turned down bed greeted us each night. With only one luggage stand and no dresser unpacking was an issue. There is a need for more hangers in the closet to accommodate 2 guests. Breakfast was delicious and plentiful. The entire team were courteous, attentive and friendly. The location was excellent. A five minute walk to the Tube. Restaurants, caf√©s and many Museums were within walking distance. A great choice when visiting the wonderful city of.....London.",5,2015,09,14
113,Brilliant!!,"Great place to stay. Staff are very helpful, room is of a good size extremely well located, CLEAN, comfortable and modern room with a great bed. As a note, most rooms in London are small. 
Close to subway and there is a fantastic pub called the Cumberland Arms just up the road.",5,2015,09,14
113,Pleasant stay in South Kensington,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights on our honeymoon. We requested and were given a room on the higher floors. We stayed in a lovely spacious (by London standards) room on the top floor 5, in the corner of the building. We arrived at 10am having travelled for 27 hours and the kind lady on reception checked us in early so we could freshen up.

The room was cleaned well every day whilst we were out. The bathroom supplies were replenished 2/3 days. We had to request an iron one night which was delivered within 10 mins to our room. Hotel staff were professional and helpful, only one night we were going to try having a drink in the bar but the bar staff were more interested in chatting to themselves then taking our order so we left.

The hotel is very close to public transport, tourist attractions and cafes/restaurants, and in a safe area of London. Would highly recommend staying here if it's within your budget.",4,2015,09,11
113,Top class hotel,"We have stayed here about 4 or 5 times and have loved it every time, the staff are super friendly the rooms amazing and the food excellent, we have even stayed in the penthouse suit which was one of the most amazing rooms I have ever stayed in, sadly this was about 9 years ago but the memory will live long, I would jump at the chance to stay here again, the location is spot on, you really do get what you pay for",5,2015,09,10
113,3.5 stars,"I was super excited to be staying here but we booked late so we were given one of the small rooms and based on that I would not recommend this hotel. It was hard for the two of us to get around each other and there was only one luggage rack so the other suitcase had to go on the floor. We couldn't really get settled and feel good in the room. The bathroom had a nice shower but it was hard to even get into the bathroom to close the door. Also, the hotel and our room had an extreme perfumey smell and my ipad cover still reeks of it. On the plus side, we did enjoy the location, the front desk staff was nice (they tried really hard to find me a different room but to no avail), there was a Nespresso machine in the room, and the restaurant was very nice for breakfast. If we would have had the chance to pay more for a bigger room, I'm sure I would give this a much better review but I don't feel our room was worth the price we paid.  It's a very charming hotel but be willing to pay a little more for a better experience.",4,2015,09,10
113,Modern and Luxurious Hotel in South Kensington,This is a great boutique hotel located near Hyde Park. It is very classy with a gorgeous lobby and dining area - we enjoyed a late dinner and the food was also very good. We had a suite and the room was clean and spacious with a gorgeous freestanding bathtub. What made our stay so amazing was that the hotel staff went out of their way to give us a special night after we told them we had just gotten married by putting rose petals throughout the room. Really a special detail that made all the difference for us.,5,2015,09,10
113,Beautiful and Friendly hotel!,Best bed ever!  AND the shower was amazing! The guy that greeted us at the door was wearing a freakin bowler cap.  OMG so precious!  The breakfast was excellent and the wait staff were so great and proper!  Loved everything about this place.  I would definitely come back.  Although the room size does need to be just a bit bigger.  ,5,2015,09,10
113,Wonderful Stay,"The location was wonderful, near public transportation and in a very sophisticated area. We were able to walk home from Harrods on a lovely evening. The staff was extremely friendly, and the room comfortable. It exceeded my expectations!",5,2015,09,09
113,Kensington Hotel,"The Kensington Hotel is a jewel in a great location near Hyde Park and Westminster Gardens.   Also within walking distance is Harrods.   The staff are fabulous.   The rooms, though on the small side are very well equipped and even have Nespresso Machines.  The restaurant is lovely and the food delicious.   The Kensington is in a quiet area and is a wonderful place to rest your weary head and enjoy some delicious food after a long day of touring the city.   Thank you for a wonderful stay.",5,2015,09,09
113,Loved the Kensington,"Our first stay at The Kensington for 2 nights and loved it. Ok the rooms are compact but its London - same in New York and many other cities I guess. No big deal - lovely
room with great shower room. Great breakfast  with super choice of food, can't fault it.
Couldn't fault dinner either - beautiful dining room with great clubby feel, attentive staff,
perfect. Will be back.",5,2015,09,08
113,Exceeded my expectations ,"The Kessington Hotel. Elegant, welcoming & a high quality hotel. I surprised my girlfriend by bringing her to the Kessington. I believe her and I can both say we had a grand stay. Staff where welcoming and the quality of the hotel was just how I like it. 

When booking the hotel I did ask for a pleasant view, although unfortunately we did not get one. Hopefully the next time we stay we shall get one.

Nevertheless thank you for the pleasant stay. 

",5,2015,09,07
113,A Great choice for London,"Stylish hotel in a great location. Public rooms were very traditional British with a contemporary twist. Room was tiny, bathroom with unusual rectangular shower would be a challenge for anyone with a waist larger than 24"" ( as it was with the writer). However this is London, and you get what you pay for. This is a charming hotel, with attentive staff, in a wonderful location surrounded by pubs and restaurants ( tube is 5 min walk way).",4,2015,09,06
113,"Great location, nice hotel","Stayed three nights. Very close to train station, clean neighborhood, and great staffs. 
I was very impressed with their gym compared to the size of the hotel. Gym was equipped with more than necessary weight train equipments. Self service water and towels included in the gym. 
Only complaint is the size of the room (much less than regular hotel rooms you would get in the states) but luckily, management changed room for us and we got a little bigger room with a bigger window. ",5,2015,09,06
113,Home from home,"fabulous place to stay, home from home, staff fantaastic, amenities brilliant, surroundings spotlessly clean, everything anyone could ever want. The food was restaurant standard and plentiful. will return in future",5,2015,09,06
113,My new favourite place to stay in London,"Our weekend break in London was made very special by the attentive and caring staff of The Kensington Hotel. My partner and I felt very special as we were taken care of in this beautiful hotel. 

The high spot of the weekend stay were the helpful and caring staff, who made our stay such a delight. Our room was large, clean and beautifully decorated. 

I can't wait until my next stay!",5,2015,09,05
113,Excellent stay! ,"I just checked out of The Kensington now, after spending a week with my mother and we were both extremely pleased. The room they gave us at first was really small, but like many other people on here mentioned that is extremely common by London standards. The staff was extremely quick to change our room and give us a bigger one, and it was lovely. Same goes for the general aesthetic of the hotel which is very clear in the photos here on TA. 

Before choosing this hotel, we read the reviews very carefully, and one thing that I noticed everyone comments on is how professional and helpful the staff is. That simply couldn't be any more true. They are all very nice and helpful and they're willing to do anything they can to make your stay more comfortable and that's probably my favorite part. 

The location is good. There is a tube and bus station that is a 7 minute walk from the hotel, and a (limited access) bus station across the street. Lots of local eateries nearby as well. While the location is good, if I HAD to pick a downside (and in comparison to the excellent quality of the hotel) that would be it though ‚Äî the location is still really good, but if I had to be picky that would be it. 

An incident that was exemplary of the professionalism and helpfulness of the staff is one that occurred the night before our check out. A very small jewelry item of mine that was of sentimental value to me had gone missing. At the time, it seemed impossible to me that Id ever see it again. But thanks to the staff, I got it back the next day. They found it in the vacuum bag, and I'm really appreciative that they took the time to look for it, and that it was found. 

All in all, it really was a lovely stay and I do strongly recommend the hotel.",4,2015,09,04
113,Great hotel with must improve restaurant staff,"Stayed 5 nights. Location is nice, reception is excellent, great decor and nice room, but small bath. Windows in the room very dirty, should be cleaned. 

Restaurant staff is in regular chaos - in the afternoon asking for drinks you should wait for hours, ask again and again, staff is running with no result. 

In the morning, everyone is sleepy, with 0 smiles, if you ask for baby chair, you get it in 15 minutes, every morning the same. 

Breakfast is OK, but breakfast room is FABULOUS. One of nicest and most english rooms.  

Overall nice hotel with must improve restaurant staff.",4,2015,09,04
113,Afternoon-tea,"Beautiful hotel and fantastic choice for afternoon tea. George our server was so friendly, a lovely person and went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable . All the staff we saw were very helpful and friendly . We loved our afternoon tea experience and thank you .

113,A stylish and comfortable hotel.,"Small rooms, but a nice hotel close to South Kensington tube station and museum attractions. Friendly and service minded personell. Good breakfest and comfortable lounges. A hotel that absolutely can be recommended. Look forward to our next stay.",4,2015,09,02
113,Best Hotel in South Kensington,"Great location, short stroll down from South Kensington Metro Station, which is on the rail line from Heathrow Airport.
Very clean and modern, some rooms are on the small size but ours was roomy enough. It is quiet but some floors are a bit of a rabbit warren and you will need to climb stairs with luggage (eg floor 1/2).
Staff are friendly and helpful.
Not cheap but would certainly stay here again in preference to other hotels we have previously stayed at in South Kensington.",4,2015,09,02
113,overnight stay,"Location perfect - 300 yards from South Ken tube. Reception and Lounge area
very stylish which continued into the bedroom.
Cocktail bar undergoing some renovation but were seated in the lounge for drinks. Breakfast was fantastic in what appeared to be newly decorated/furnished dining room. Service was top notch - well done !",5,2015,09,01
113,"Awful Cleaning Service, Excellent Otherwise","My family (2 adults, 3 young children) stayed at The Kensington Hotel for about 7 days in 2014.  Everything about the hotel was top notch ... location, concierge, front desk, afternoon tea, etc.  There was a lot of attention to detail, such as the late night staff delivering milk to our room every night for the children.  The front desk and concierge was top notch.

The reason for the 3 stars is because the room cleaning service was absolutely pathetic.  On three days, we left the hotel at 8:30 AM and returned at 4:00 PM, and the room was not cleaned.  On two days, we ended up having just a 1/2 roll of toilet paper as they did not leave any extra toilet paper in the bath room.  On two days, they did not replace the sugar for the coffee and we had to call to get them to send sugar.  We complained in a gentle and polite manner in the the middle of our stay, but the situation was not fixed.  Finally, the day before we left, we really got annoyed.  They profusely apologized and left us a note with some fruit basket in the room.  It was a nice gesture, but we would have preferred well cleaned rooms instead!!",3,2015,08,30
113,Gracious and Accommodating,My daughter and had great stay here. I called the Kensington Hotel in a panic when my other accommodations fell through. The woman on the phone was creative and clearly wanted to help. She immediately put me at ease. This high level of service continued through out our stay. Our room was perfect. It was clean and quiet. I would go out of my way to stay here again on my next visit to London.,5,2015,08,28
113,Luxurious comfort,"My husband and I brought our two young boys (6 and 4) on their first trip to London, where we stayed at the Kensington Hotel - a very nice hotel in a beautiful part of London.
Our family room was perfect for our stay, plenty of space and great comfort, with a touch of luxury. The breakfast was delicious with plenty of choice for everyone. The location was also brilliant, given it's close proximity to the museums (LaunchPad at the Science Museum required two trips!). 
On these family getaways, you ideally want the hotel to add value to the break, and the Kensington more than delivered on this. Each day we all looked forward to our return to the hotel in the early evening, as much as we had the excursions themselves. In the words of our 6 year old - a really beautiful and fancy hotel!",5,2015,08,26
113,First Class,"First class hotel in the heart of fashionable South Kensington.  Convenient to parks, museums, restaurants, shopping, and the Underground.  Friendly staff, professional concierge service, comfortable rooms, nice lobby and bar.",5,2015,08,25
113,So Disappointed,"I had previously stayed at the Kensington, and wrote a glowing review.  It was well deserved.  
Unfortunately my latest stay (7 nights) did not live up to the past.  My stay was let down, in a big way, by housekeeping.  I gave feedback to the staff, daily.  The problem was not resolved until my last night, when they switched staff (the new person was phenomenal).  I won't go into detail regarding the housekeeping issues here, as I was provided assurances that the issues would be addressed.  I believe that to be the case.  The Manager, a lovely man,  also gave me a fruit plate.  A mea culpa if you will.  It was a nice gesture.  In fairness, I believed this to be a training issue, so somewhat isolated.  They also tried to make it right.
I will mention that I am coming back to London, and was still hoping (yes, after the housekeeping issues) to stay at the Kensington (I love the area).  I checked rates directly with the hotel. The rates they provided to me were higher than the marketplace!  When I pointed this out, they said that ""they would do their best to match the rate"" for me.  Really?  I need to point out that your rates are higher before you say that you will do your best (no assurances) to match?  In any event, after the housekeeping issues and the rate debacle, I will be staying elsewhere.",3,2015,08,24
113,Perfect Luxury London Hotel for a family break,"The Kensington Hotel is a lovely charming hotel, very well located in South Kensington, within walking distance from Kensington Park, Museums and even Harrods. Cosy decor mixing tradition and contemporary design. Very pleasant lobby lounge with fireplace. Beautiful restaurant. Warm welcome from the staff.

Studio Rooms are spacious and I was able to stay share my room with two kids, high ceiling, great bathrooms with foot tub bath and separated showers.

My kids and I really enjoyed our stay, the facilities and the Kids Concierge program.",5,2015,08,24
113,Mother-daughter trip,"Stayed here with my daughter as part of a package.  My only complaint was the size (teensy) of the rooms. The gym was lovely, the staff helpful, and the downstairs was truly elegant. Oh..we did get some misinformation about a TUBE stop as well:)  Great location and chic-- but accommodated my 12 yr old well.
",4,2015,08,23
113,"Great stay, clean, quiet and great location","Family of 4 (2 adults and 2 teens) stayed for 4 nights in August in room 511.  For me it is important that hotel rooms are quiet and have good air conditioning.  I was originally concerned when the room was immediately in front of the elevators, but the room has two doors - one door to get into the room - with closets and minibar - then another heavy door that leads into the main room and bathroom.  As a result of the two doors, we never heard any noise from the hallway.

The room was outstanding - large, clean, great air conditioning and extremely quiet.  Two king-sized double beds.  We never heard a single noise from within the hotel or from the street.  The view is not great as it looks over the back of the buildings on the street, but I would happily trade a view for the quiet room.

I did not use the restaurant for either breakfast or dinner as there are many restaurants right down the street and a little Waitrose around the corner where we bought fruit and pastries for breakfast.  

A great location - a 5 minute walk to the closest subway station and a 10 or 15 minute walk to Hyde Park.

Overall an outstanding hotel and worth the price.  It made our stay in London very enjoyable.  Will definitely stay here again.",5,2015,08,21
113,"perfect location, great hotel","After researching London neighborhoods to base ourselves in,  my husband and I chose South Kensington and the Kensington Hotel. We are glad we made the choice.  It is a quieter more residential area.  Very close to a tube station as well as neighborhood restaurants.  The staff members at the hotel were friendly and helpful.  Having read many reviews, I was prepared for a tiny room.  We were fortunate to have been upgraded to a good sized room (409) with a large bathroom.  We couldn't have been happier. There's a nespresso machine, shortbread cookies & bottled water in the room. We were quite comfortable.",4,2015,08,21
113,Beautiful and clean hotel,"We stayed here for three nights mid   August 2015 and it was very nice.  The room and bathroom were very clean and all the staff we can in contact with were helpful and friendly.  Location is great as well, close to the tube station with restaurants pubs closeby.  We were woken up one night by the room next door; they were having a screaming argument at 3:30 am. The other nights were no problem so I think their situation was more of an exception.",5,2015,08,20
113,Comfort,"Stayed here over a weekend. Overall good stay. Rooms are clean and spacious. Hotel is central enough too, Easy access to other amenities. Little pricey but good comfortable stay. Staff was helpful throughout our stay.",4,2015,08,20
113,Great family stay,"I had the pleasure of spending a weekend at The Kensington Hotel together with my wife and 2 year old daughter. The stay exceeded our expectations mainly due to an attentive and service minded staff across the hotel and restaurant. They were attentive to the needs of a family traveling with a toddler and made all effort to make the stay enjoyable for all of us. As for our room, it was of a great standard and good size. No view, which wAs fine, as this meant no noise. We will be back, hope that their bar area has been refurbished by then!",5,2015,08,19
113,Goodwood and good weather,"Having just returned to London from the Festival of Speed we decided to take in London from our base of the Kensington Hotel.

The concierge team were absolutely fantastic. Our car was looked after all week and when we got delayed they kept a close eye on the parking meter to ensure no surprises from the Ticket Inspector awaited us.

Our rooms were fabulous and considering the extreme heat in London during our stay the efficient air conditioning was a massive help in keeping cool.

We ate every morning in the hotel and the breakfast spread and setting was superb.

Unfortunately we never found time to dine in the hotel but did enjoy cocktails and nibbles many a night. 

A must stay for anyone travelling to London. Close enough to the action without the noise and heavy traffic that you can get a mere two miles down the road.",5,2015,08,18
113,Porters and front desk staff make this hotel worth staying at..,"Rooms are all very noisy and at during busy periods even the Front Desk Manager will tell you that she can not really look after your need for quiet. So yes- if you need a quiet nights sleep- and don't want to fork out on a triple upgrade to studio suite that is set back from the corridor- then better find another hotel. I thought staying 42 nights in 3 months would get me the Black GHA (Global Hotel Alliance) card but GHA told me only 39 nights counted since 3 nights that I booked with the hotel did not count. So make sure you book via a 3rd party so they can't quibble with the nights you earn.  And note that earning Black will not get you ANY benefits. I did not receive anything as a result of making Gold or Platinum or Black. This is why I take 2 stars away- because GHA is actually meaningless here and this hotel should not be part of it OR they should tell customers that you can earn with us but you can't make use of any benefits.

However the Front Desk Staff were all doing their very best to accommodate my requests for a quiet room and almost every night in the first week I changed rooms because of the creaky corridors and foot traffic right outside my door.  The old townhouses are built that way- creaky but they are incredibly charming.

The rooms are furnished nicely and the Housekeeping at this hotel is just amazing- it made a very big difference to my stay- and thank you for the chocolates on my pillow every evening :)

The room service was timely but the food quality really poor I am sorry to say- it didn't make much of a difference to me since there are so many dining choices/ cafes on the doorstep of the hotel but for one example- it was the only room service that served a chicken caesar salad without using chicken breast! 

The basement gym is lovely- you can open windows for air- it must be one of the nicest gyms I have used in such a hotel and was often quiet and also constantly maintained to a high standard by the wonderful housekeeping staff. Life fitness equipment and well equipped for a good workout.

The Porters - each and every one were so warm and helpful and gentlemanly making every person feel very welcome. That together with the elegance of the tea room and bar on the ground floor with their beautiful fireplaces created the feeling of being at an English country hotel rather than in the middle of bustling London.

I would recommend this hotel unless you are light sleeper or sensitive to sound at night in which case I strongly suggest booking a Studio Suite.",3,2015,08,15
113,Luxury 5* Hotel,The Kensington hotel know what excellent service means.  This is the most amazing hotel I've ever stayed in.   My partner and I celebrated our anniversary at The Kensington and were treated like royalty.  Being upgraded to a suite was a wonderful surprise.  The room was fabulous.   The location is perfect.  The staff want you to enjoy your stay. They truly care.  Just book it - treat yourself - it's perfect!!,5,2015,08,14
113,I loved this hotel.,"This is a very charming hotel with a lovely restaurant and bar and a well-equipped gym.  The concierge couldn't have been more helpful, and all the hotel staff members with whom I interacted were terrific.

The location can't be beat - it's close to the tube, about a 10 minute walk from Hyde Park and in a fabulous neighborhood.  I would stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat.",5,2015,08,13
113,"Great hotel, great location",We stayed in July for our Anniversary and the hotel was lovely. The little touches from staff were fab.. we had a card and macarons waiting in the room on a plate saying 'Happy Anniversary'. Staff were very friendly and helpful. They were renovating the restaurant and so full breakfast menu was not available but the selection of the buffet was great and so we didn't mind.  Will definitely stay again.,5,2015,08,13
113,"Well located nice building , simple","Maybe I was expecting higher quality rooms and service but.....overall I was traveling with a good sense of humor and I had a good experience. The price was right and worth to pay for the best rooms, promise . I'll be back",4,2015,08,12
113,Charming hotel in great neighborhood,"Spent a few nights at Kensington Hotel in July for Wimbledon. Very much enjoyed the location as we were keen to be outside central London and typical tourist hubbub. 
 * Great access to tube and short walk into Kensington Gardens
 * Rooms are small and washrooms equally as tight
 * Found the staff to be very friendly speedy with assistance 
 * Lobby/reception/bar is well appointed and suited well for reading a book, chatting with friends, or enjoying a cocktail",4,2015,08,12
113,"A classy, calm hotel in a very busy city.","My husband and I chose the Kensington based on many Trip Advisor reviews and we were definitely not disappointed.  We had originally considered a hotel that was closer to the major London attractions, since this was our first trip to the city and we did not have much time to explore but we were so glad we chose the quieter neighborhood and the classic charm of the Kensington.  It is located about 3 short blocks from the Tube station so it was still easy to get around the city and the neighborhood is filled with wonderful, reasonable restaurants that we enjoyed every night. The Victoria & Albert Museum and Harrods are also within walking distance.

Everyone of the staff members that we met were extremely friendly and helpful with directions, tips on bus and tube routes and excellent dining suggestions. We were always greeted when we returned and asked about our travels that day.

The lobby, bar and restaurant areas are decorated with antiques and Victorian-style furniture and art that makes you feel like you are in a very old British home.  The rooms are more contemporary with all of the modern conveniences - Nespresso coffee maker, mini bar with a wonderful selection of British treats, flat screen TV, dimmable lights in the main room and reading lights on each side of the bed.  I suspect that many of the rooms have a different configuration, based on the angles of the building and ours had the bathroom up 3 stairs from the main bedroom.  We thought the bathroom was quite large, compared to what we have seen in other city hotels, but perhaps that was because it was on a separate level.  There was plenty of hot water with a ""rainfall"" shower, large, fluffy towels, a huge mirror, lots of good lighting and wonderful bath amenities by Aromatherapy.  The only negative comment we would make about our room was that we were on a lower floor (room 234) that faced the side street and the trash collection was very noisy in the morning.  We probably should have asked for a higher floor but it was convenient to use the staircase (which was decorated with very unique old portraits) instead of waiting for the elevator.

We only had breakfast at the Kensington one morning (it is a bit pricey but definitely delicious).  The service was superb and everything on the buffet was fresh and tasty - especially the pastries and fresh-squeezed juices.

We definitely will recommend the Kensington to anyone we know who is visiting London and we hope that we will be able to go back to this charming property very soon!",5,2015,08,10
113,Below average experience,"Stayed at this hotel for a 3 night break with my daughter.  Upon arrival at this hotel well after 2.00 pm our first impression was that the lady on the desk was somewhat aloft and not terribly friendly as you would expect.  Our room was not ready and she offered to store our lugage but did not offer us any hot towels as other guests were clearly being offered.  After we used the bathroom to wash our hands we went back to the desk and were advised our room was now ready.  We proceeded to ask the girl if we could have a room with twin beds as our booking initially indicated that this was possible. The manager quickly arrived and after a few minutes she was able to deal with our request.  Unfortunately the room which we were allocated was dark, small and dingy with a view of the entire hotel extractor fans outside our window.  The window if you could call it that was obscured so that you couldnt see through it.  Also on occasion we opened the windoiw and had to close it again as the smell of the cooking from the kitchen below was whafting through our window.  The bathroom was tiny, barely room to dry of when you steped out of the shower and no bath.   Also the room in my opion was not a twin room, they simply pulled the existing bed apart by about 3 inches.  On the plus side lovely comfortable bedding, towels bathrobes slippers etc.  The pictures on trip advisor and on the hotel website of the bedrooms are nothing like the room we were allocated.  The worst part of our stay was breakfast.  Were do I start,  staff didnt seem to have any system.  The tables were never set correctly, missing several items from knives to the wrong spoons, no milk and no hot food menus.  When we were seated on the first day we had not idea that a hot breakfast was available and had to ask someone if it was possibe to check this.  It was a huge issue getting toast.  Very slow and no clear person serving at table.  The second day was worse I asked for a hard boild egg with toast after twenty minutes I asked a waiter if he could check to see if it was comming.  He came back and asked me who took my initial order!!!! When the eggs finally arrived they were soft and toast arrived cut into soldiers, at this point I was so fed up I give up and left the dining room.  The third day service was very patchy, same thing, worong tea served couldnt even drink it as it was loose tea in a teapot of some sort, no strainer although I did manage to get hard boiled eggs.  I must give a special mention to George what an assett to this Hotel he seemed to be the only waiter who was switched on, in comparrison the young lady whose only job seemed to be ticking names off on a sheet, I asked her for a spoon and she had absolutely no idea what I was referring to even when I pointed to the one my daughter was eating with.   Whilst we were checking out the couple to our right were also complaining loudly about breakfast and service.   
The hotel is situated in a nice area and is convenience to tube, busses, restaurants etc.
To sum up very disappointing, I hope the hotel will address thee issues.  ",3,2015,08,10
113,"Charming hotel, good service, but...","We spend a good amount of time in London.  Last year we stayed at the Four Season Park Lane which was great in every conceivable way, but the size of the rooms which were small.  This time around, we spent a week in London at the beginning of our trip and stayed at the Sofitel St. James which was absolutely lovely in an amazing location.  On our way out, we had one short afternoon here so decided to try something new and booked the Kensington.  Unfortunately, the Kensington doesn't hold a candle to the Sofitel or the Four Seasons.  

The Kensington is as charming as it could be.  The common areas are beautifully appointed, lovely decor and very cozy and lovely.  The service is by and large very good.  The people in the restaurant and the concierge and doorman are absolutely lovely.  You can tell they are well trained and really aim to please.  The ladies at check in can be a bit surly but not too bad. Maybe they were having an off day or something (as I stood there to checkin, they offered two different families in front of me wet towels to clean their hands, when it got to me and my son, they completely ignored it and made a stilted attempt at conversation that the lady didn't bother carrying on-you can tell they've been told to talk to the guests but some of them just don't have the ability and so it becomes a bit bizarre). But that's neither here nor there. 

The big issue with the hotel is sleep quality.  Because it is an older building, there is a big noise issue or maybe there was a big noise issue in the room they gave us.  We were right next to the fire door (a door cutting the hotel in half that everyone walking past must open and close) and so the door slammed shut maybe 30 times until about midnight.  My neighbors also kept coming and going into their room and every time they opened and closed their door, it would slam and wake me up.  The floorboards right over us were creaky so we heard every single step the people staying over us took.  At midnight, when it's supposed to be quiet, that's highly problematic. The noise level was simply unacceptable for a hotel of this caliber. 

Another big problem is what they use to wash their sheets. It is highly perfumed.  On top of that, they spray a perfume over the sheets after they make your bed.  The result is an enormous headache!  I know they're trying to make it smell good but it's exactly like walking by that guy who emptied the bottle of eau de cologne on himself.  Subtly would go a long way in this situation.   

Also, the rooms are quite small.  They're beautiful, but very small.

Finally, I am baffled by all the reviews saying the location is great.  Great for what?  If your aim in London is to see the Natural History Museum, then yes, the location is great.  Anything else, and the location is very inconvenient.  A 20 minute walk to shopping in Knightsbridge, 15-20 minute walk to Hyde Park.  About an hour walk to Piccadilly, etc. So the location was a bust for us too. 

Overall, we would never stay here again.  So far, the Sofitel St. James is the place I would return to next year on our next trip.",3,2015,08,06
113,Outstanding Hotel,"Perfectly located, convenient to great pubs and restaurants, the tube, and London's great sights. Comfortable and well maintained rooms, delicious breakfasts, and a pleasant lounge to relax and unwind. Attentive and friendly service, with special mention to Jimmy who was always ready to greet us with a smile and a friendly chat. Would most definitely recommend. ",5,2015,08,04
113,It could have been better,"First of all, the location of the hotel is not bad, and we've had a wonderful concierge and valet service. 
This hotel has possibilities of becoming one of the best of its category in town, but it still has to improve some things. One of them is the quality of the rooms, we had booked a superior room and the one we had wasn't even close to that! It was small, the TV didn't work, and the matress was awful!! We complained about that and the manager was very friendly and got us a new one, but the bed was still not a queen / king size bed.
In any other hotel we would expect some kind of refund or detail, such as refunding some consumition from the bar, but all we got were apologies... and I think my time and rest are worth more than that. We all can apologise, but that doesn't change the situation and it doesn't make the customer feel better when they have paid for a service they didn't get. I feel that it's not worth the money.",3,2015,08,04
113,"Lovely hotel, wonderful staff, and great location","I had a great experience at the Kensington and have already booked my next stay.

The staff and services are fantastic. Every staff member I came across was friendly, welcoming, and helpful. The additional service touches - complementary in-room Nespresso machine, bottled water, and high-speed WiFi; touches like complementary browsing & printing from the hotel desktops - also really make a difference.

The hotel itself is lovely. The basic room is expectedly small but still good. The bed was comfortable (and normal-sized, unlike several alternatives that have single beds in their standard room category) and the furnishings nice. My room overlooked a side street, so was quiet and had a pretty view. The bathroom is also expectedly small, but the marble finishes and rain shower (I requested shower only, no tub) made it feel indulgent all the same. The common spaces of the hotel are also well-appointed.

The location is great - a few minutes walk from the South Kensington stop on the Piccadilly line (perfect for getting to & from Heathrow - also good for linking into central London).

",5,2015,08,04
113,Great service and location!,"Perfect location near tube, restaurants, and a grocery store.  Very nice neighborhood for walking.  The best feature of this hotel was the incredible staff- very kind/helpful/provided top-notch service!  We hope to return and stay there again!",5,2015,08,02
113,Kensington for family of 5,"LOVED this hotel and location -- very quiet, many good little restaurants including coffee shops and wonderful bakeries, convenient to tube station and museums and concierge was super helpful and friendly. We had two rooms joined by a short private hallway which was perfect for parents and three middle school aged kids. Will definitely stay here again.",5,2015,08,02
113,"Gorgeous stay, excellent service, great location","I recently stayed a week at this wonderful hotel and we were treated so well.  Our room was lovely - they are a bit tight, but they're well-appointed.  The bathroom was nice, with marble walls and great products.  The bed was luxurious - amazingly comfortable!  The huge tv in the room provided needed entertainment when my jetlagged brain needed a little late-night viewing.  The housekeeping staff were on the ball.  I loved the coffee and tea set-up in the room's pantry, each room has a Nespresso machine so you can have a nice espresso in the morning before you hit the streets.  The location is pretty cool, South Kensington is close to a lot of great things, and the metro stop is just about 3 or 4 minutes walk away.  Check-in and check-out were handled efficiently and well by the desk staff.  All in all, a gorgeous stay.",5,2015,07,31
113,"Great location, staff and accommodations.","While the rooms are small for a 5-star hotel and the hallways narrow, I could not find any other fault with this hotel. Great staff, food, WiFi, toiletries and bedding. The location in Kensington is perfect, being really close to the Tube and the park. Would highly recommend and stay here again.",5,2015,07,30
113,Excellent stay,"Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough, took my mother for a surprise trip for her birthday.    Staff made such a fuss of her, room upgrade and birthday card and cake - totally unexpected and it absolutely made her day.   Gorgeous rooms, great location and excellent staff.  I wouldn't stay anywhere else in London now I've found this fantastic hotel.",5,2015,07,30
113,Comfortable stay at charming and elegant hotel,"My wife and I stayed five nights in The Kensington Hotel in July 2015. We enjoyed the comfortable and elegant traditional surroundings and the plush ambience of this establishment, reminiscent of an English Club. The service from the staff was excellent. We particularly want to commend Oto who was extremely helpful and attentive. Our room was relatively small but comfortable and well appointed, with perhaps one slight drawback that you had to climb up five steps to get to the bathroom. The location of the hotel is excellent, with only a five minute walk to South Kensington underground station, and another few minutes walk to the Victoria and Albert Museum. This establishment is of superior quality, and, while the tariff is not cheap, the hotel offers value for money.",5,2015,07,29
113,Memorable - Great Location,"Stayed at The Kensington last week - it is a fine establishment with great service and a lovely ambience.  It is not cheap, but what is in London? - we think it was worth the cost for the connivence of the location.  It is well located with terrific pubs and restaurants very close by.  The rooms are small but the bedding is comfortable.  The Hotel also accommodated an early check in at 11am which was terrific.  The rooms are quiet and have reasonable wifi available. ",4,2015,07,29
113,Absolute lack of security...,"One afternoon, when coming back to the Hotel, we found that the door that give to a hall  connecting our two rooms was wide open! The door of one of the rooms was open two. You can imagine our stress.

Besides, the roomes were dusty and a broken bottle (from a former guest, I guess) stood in one closet for five nights. But that is nothing compared to the lack of security mencionated before.

Neither a conclusion  or  apollogie was issued by the staff. No security officer appeared, no police notified. Simply scary.",1,2015,07,29
113,An oasis of relaxiation. A beautiful hotel with such lovely staff.,"My friend and I arranged an overnight reunion in London and when I was researching hotels I stumbled upon The Kensington Hotel.  We secured an excellent deal on GetARoom.  

I have nothing but praise for the hotel - From the attentive doorman who brought the bags from the taxi to the room.  The nice young man who brought us up extra coffee pods & milk.  The friendly bar staff who made sure that everything was just perfect without being intrusive, and special thanks to Blainad who was super friendly and really took care of me.

The hotel inside is charming & stylish.  We are still in awe of the room, with beds and pillows which left you feeling like you had slept on a cloud.  The towels were super large & fluffy and the bathrobes & slippers a lovely touch.  We really enjoyed the Nespresso machine and the regal super soft velvet chairs & poof, where we sat catching up all afternoon.  The turn down service was a lovely finishing touch. 

Our room (104) was large (for London) and bright & in the bathroom the shower over the bath was great.  I really cannot rate this hotel highly enough and I will be back soon!",5,2015,07,29
113,Wow.. It's worth while reading on.. ,"We come from Edinburgh, Scotland. We stayed for 4 very comfortable nights. Rooms were very spacious, clean and luxurious, great coffee machine and excellent shower. 

Unfortunately the restaurant was being refurbished during our stay, so we didn't experience the dinner menu or ""a la carte"" breakfast menu... HOWEVER, the breakfast buffet was on offer for ¬£16 per head. My family and I only required a very light breakfast, and the staff were very open to altering the price depending on how much food we had. 

Afternoon tea was fantastic, very relaxing but quirky music in the lounge with a delicious selection of sweet and savoury goods, the sandwiches were to die for! 

The best part of this hotel is the staff. From our arrival to our departure, every single member was welcoming, eager to help and polite. Very professional yet equally friendly! 

I must make a special mention to the lovely George (pictured with my family and I) who looked after us as if we were long lost friends. He catered to our every need with enthusiasm and understanding, and his energy had us smiling for hours after breakfast time. An excellent staff member, who is positively one of the main reasons that we will definitely return to the Kensington Hotel on our next trip to London. 

All in all.. Undiscovered perfection! ",5,2015,07,29
113,Fabulous Hotel!,"We visited London for the weekend and stayed at The Kensington Hotel. Our room was spacious and well appointed. The hotel is beautiful. The dining rooms were under renovation while we were there, so meals were served in the lounge and library. Breakfast was included with our reservation. It was a very nice buffet of both hot and cold selections. We ate in the library which was very cozy. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The location was great for us, just blocks away from the National History and Science museums. It is also a short walk to Queens Park. Next time we are in London, we definitely will stay there again.",5,2015,07,28
113,Can you keep a secret? Let's not share this amazing find with everyone else!,"Birthday treat with my husband was made very special by the excellent staff - warm, real friendliness and little surprises like glasses of champagne, a hand-written birthday card, rose petals and chocolates on the beautiful four poster bed.  The room was delightful; the bathroom luxurious with TV, marble tiling and his and hers washbasins; great central location but our room was quiet with little street noise.  We ate dinner out but enjoyed breakfast and mid morning coffee with homemade biscuits in the lounge. We will definitely stay here again and know we will get a warm welcome when we arrive.",5,2015,07,24
113,"Great location, beautiful decor, yet average room.","The location is perfect and the hotel decor is beautiful. Sleep quality was not so great; combine jet lag with unforeseen hotel construction... not amazing. There was construction that was audible in our room and the hotel bar 2 floors below us for the majority of the days. Overall glad we booked it, but there are many others in the same neighborhood that we'd be likely to stay next time.",4,2015,07,22
113,Do yourself a favour,"What a wonderful hotel. From the minute we arrived the staff were brilliant. From Martin and Vincent on the concierge desk to Eros in the dinning room. They all made our trip memorable. It was close to the underground, shops, public transport and restaurants.
Ideal spot to do all those sight seeing trips around London. Do yourself a favour and stay at the Kensington whilst in London. The only down side was that both the shower and the room were a little on the small side.",5,2015,07,21
113,A superb hotel,I stayed in this hotel twice in as many weeks in May.  The first room I had was quite small but still impeccable.  The second visit I asked for a bath and (given that nothing is too much trouble) I was allocated a beautiful room that was more like a suite and had the bath I'd asked for.  The attentiveness of the staff makes you feel valued as a guest yet is not over bearing.  The breakfast is also top notch and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in London.,5,2015,07,19
113,Good value,"I love the location of this hotel. Set just off old Brompton road it is a lovely neighbourhood and very close to south Ken station.
The hotel has good facilities and I do like the size of it.
Rooms were nice with coffee machines but bathroom very small.
Good value for money.",4,2015,07,16
113,A magical experience,"We booked the Romantic Package at the hotel as a treat to celebrate both my birthday and our Wedding Anniversary. Champagne and breakfast served in the room came with the deal but what made for such a memorable stay were little pastries delivered to the room on a platter inscribed in white chocolate and on returning after a night at the Theatre to find the bed and the bath decorated in petals. All the staff in the bars are charming, friendly and polite - not to be understated in this day and age ! The dining room and lounge areas are fabulous and you feel at home immediately. We also had lunch and dinner and the food was great. The room as part of the package was large considering this is central London with a spacious bathroom. Bed was really comfortable. Large flatscreen TV with satellite & wifi all included. Not cheap but very good.",5,2015,07,16
113,Overnight stay,"We stayed overnight at this hotel while traveling, and greatly enjoyed our stay.  The staff was VERY kind and helpful, from checking in to assisting us with directions and restaurants.

We highly recommend this hotel for all, and it's walking distance from Chelsea stadium, Harrods, Hyde Park, and other fun areas. 

We hope to be back in the future. The room stayed as cold as we wanted, the bathroom was very nice, and though the room was slightly small it was very comfortable! ",5,2015,07,15
113,Tea Room,"Today we had a wonderful experience in the tea room with our waiter George. He greeted our big party of college students,from UCLA, with a huge smile and utter sophistication. He sought to each of our needs and made us feel as if we had been friends for years. He even graciously took photos for everyone. George also found a way to accommodate one of our gluten free allergy students, which must be hard for tea time. George made our experience of high tea time one of the best times yet in London. Thank you George, we appreciate the amazing service! Don't forget to ask for George next time you dine in.",5,2015,07,14
113,Wonderful way to cap off our Eurotrip.,"This hotel was amazing. We had a hiccup with check in so they upgraded us to a corner room. The room was great. My favorite thing were the heated tile floors in the bathroom. We were a big fan of the Town House restaurant's modern, upscale decor as it felt as if you were walking into the home of your rich uncle. We are still confused as to how they knew we wanted some ice in our room. Next thing we know, somebody showed up with a bucket of ice for drinking. I know the city has CCTV everywhere, but surely they aren't in the rooms as well? 

Highly recommended if you're looking for a place to stay in London.",5,2015,07,14
113,Perfect luxurious stay,"My husband booked this hotel as a suprise for our anniversary. This hotel is sheer luxury from the moment you walk into reception. The staff are so helpful.  When we arrived in our room we had a bottle of champagne, strawberries, chocolates and a card wishing us a pleasant stay. Everything about the bedrooms here are indulgent. When we came back to our room after dinner and drinks our room had been turned down for the evening, roses petals and chocolates awaited us,lights dimmed and curtains drawn. it really did make my husband and I feel special. We went for dinner in the restaurant which was very nice.  We had a few cocktails in the bar, I asked for espresso martini, although not on the menu this was no trouble to make.  The lounge areas are welcoming with different seating areas. Next time we visit we are certainly having afternoon tea.  The breakfast was wonderful as you would expect all made to order and plenty of pastries, cereals, fruit , cheeses/meats on offer also. 

On check out the receptionist greeted us by our name and gave us bottle of water for our journey home. The location of this hotel is fabulous, few minutes from the tube, few bars and restaurants nearby also.  If you are looking for a hotel with luxury then you must stay here.  Perfect, thank you we will be returning.",5,2015,07,13
113,A Very English Experience,"On a recent trip to London while traveling with my father we stayed at The Kensington.  First, let me say that the entire hotel smells of roses - the lobby, the hallways, and even the guest rooms.  It made for a pleasant welcome each time we returned.

The room, like many European hotels, was small compared to American standards.  However, I did not find the space to be cramped or difficult to maneuver.  Upon arrival, we were met with refreshing warm towels, easy check-in, water and macaroons awaiting us in our room.  Turndown service included chocolates and more bottled water, and near bedtime, an herbal tea service was delivered to my room each night - a lovely unexpected touch.

The room was clean, but lacked any storage other than a small closet.  I typically like to unpack if I am staying more than one or two nights, and was unable to do this because there was no place to put my things away.  Just as an aside, because I was traveling with my father, we had requested two beds.  What we were given was two twin beds, but pushed together into the center of the room.  While we each had our own set of sheets, we shared a top coverlet and blanket.  A little strange, but we dealt with it after a really good chuckle.  

The bathroom was ample sized, included a soaking tub as well as a shower.  However, the shower was TINY!  It felt like I had to shower using ""T-Rex arms"" because there was very little room to move around in it at all.  I would guess dimensions to be about 18"" x 30"".  A better layout in the bathroom would have been an easy resolution to the shower size, as there was plenty of space in the bathroom.

The service was fine.  I had different experiences with different people.  The concierge was helpful and the bellman greeted me by name upon each arrival into the hotel.  The front desk staff was kind, and seemed to want to meet all of my needs.  The restaurant staff was dreadful.  When we arrived for breakfast on our first morning, we were seated, reseated, and then moved to a third table tucked away into the bar rather than the dining area - they clearly did not know how to keep which tables were in use during the buffet-style breakfast.  Service for coffee and side orders from the menu were slow, if you could even get the attention of the staff at all.  

My biggest service issue came one evening, my father was very ill with a stomach virus and I just needed some crackers and water for him.  The concierge suggested I get these from the bar.  The bartender, whose English was very rough, told me there were no crackers available.  He offered some bread, which I accepted, but they were delivered to my room with a room service charge.  I was furious, as this was clearly an emergency situation.  I did not need ""food, but just some easy crackers for him.  I signed for the 10p two slices of toast.  Later that evening, we needed some water.  Mind you, housekeeping had been generous about bottled water during our entire stay, leaving at least 6 bottles in the room during the day.  I again went to the bar, asked for an ice bucket and two bottles of water, and he again wanted to charge me for the water, saying that he didn't have access to the bottles that housekeeping stocked our room with.  So, once again, I signed for the water, but headed straight to the front desk (feeling completely livid at this point - there is nothing worse than being sick abroad, having no access to familiar medical care, and not even knowing what options are available - and then to have a hotel be completely unhelpful had just about pushed me over the edge at this point).  I explained my frustration to the attendant who immediately told me not to worry about the charges, offered to call a doctor, told me the location of the closest drugstore, and asked if there was anything else I needed.  No sooner did I get back into my room did I receive a phone call from the manager offering any sort of help as well.  This made a tough situation so much more bearable!

Basically, my review is this:
Great hotel - clean, quaint, very ""English""
Beautiful location
Close to many museums, restaurants, landmarks (walking distance)
Spotty service
Just OK breakfast
Bartender leaves much to be desired
Housekeeping extras are really nice
Small shower, but big bathroom (makes no sense??)
Comfortable beds
No place to unpack

I would stay here again, and would recommend it to others.",4,2015,07,13
113,Wonderful stay!,Very chic boutique hotel with incredible service!! We stayed here during our honeymoon and everyone really made our visit unforgettable. George from the restaurant is the BEST! He definitely took service to the next level and made us feel very special on the last day of our honeymoon!  I would highly recommend having afternoon tea with him.

113,Oasis,"I loved my stay here. It seemed none of the staff spoke English as a first language but the service was excellent - including quickly replacing a TV after checking in. 
The location is great - not far to Hyde Park, Victoria and Albert Museum and a good subway line. 
The hotel is unobtrusive and calming. And it seemed full of wealthy Russians. Room wasn't large but very comfortable. 
I ate in the hotel a few times and service and food were excellent. 
I stayed here through a cheap deal on Expedia and it was worth every penny. ",5,2015,07,11
113,the best hotel for home away from home feeling,"A warm welcome and the room were all arranged very neatly and beautifully inside this Stunning hotel. This is the place to stay in London. Lovely walls and curtains, Views on queens gate are to die for. All modern facilities and staff were very professional and personal too. One last thing this hotel interior design is one of the great architectural modern pieces of engineering in this that I‚Äôve seen in hotels. Harvey Nichols Harrods and all the shops were also nearby.",5,2015,07,11
113,Afternooon Tea,"My friend I were guests for English afternoon tea at this charmingly English hotel, we arrived about 2pm after a long morning taking pictures at the beautiful hyde park gardens and all the museums near the hotel. We sat at the lobby next to the fireplace and opposite the golden glass door that led to the bar. The tea was delicious and very well presented. I had the rooibos and my friend had the roship hibiscus, excellent service from George who looked after us throughout the whole time. We were really happy with everything and did not managed to finish the cakes, we highly recommend it.",5,2015,07,11
113,lovely stay,"Stayed for 2 nights and we really enjoyed our stay.Our first room was very loud so we asked for a quieter room and it was quiet. Both rooms were clean, comfortable and pleasant. When we walked in to the room it smelt so lovely too. All staff from reception to restaurant to door were very friendly and helpful. Very convenient location too. Train station about 10 mins walk.Breakfast was included in our package and it was yum. If you want to eat out there are variety of restaurants + Royal Albert hall close by. Only negative was no hotel parking. I would stay there again if I can afford to :)",5,2015,07,10
113,Superb!,"We were lucky enough to be staying in one of the suites at the hotel, and oh my word. Luxury personified, and more gadgets than you can shake a stick at! All the staff were really friendly and efficient, and our son (just 2 at the time) was made a real fuss of. We were not paying the bill, so its hard to get a grasp on value for money, but if money was no object then here is the place to stay. (Our room was ¬£1675.00 per night) Very conveniently located for all the popular museums, and 5 mins walk from South Kensington tube.",5,2015,07,10
113,Beautiful birthday breakfast,I arranged a champagne breakfast for myself and a couple of friends at the hotel.  The food was lovely but what made the trip even more enjoyable was the staff. They made us feel very special and welcomed even though we were not staying at the hotel. The building itself was beautiful and very clean.,5,2015,07,10
113,Wonderful stay at The Kensington,I spent a week with my family at The Kensington. We couldn't have picked a better place in London. Location was great and the hotel was extremely comfortable. The downstairs has great sitting areas making you feel like you're in your own dining room. Highly recommend this lovely hotel. ,5,2015,07,09
113,Nice boutique hotel,"We stayed here two nights prior to a vacation tour that left from St Pancras.  Rcommended by our TA.  We loved it!  I have always wanted to stay in area with all the white townhomes.  Kensington was perfect.  Nicely renovated.  Our room included breakfast which was a nice selection of hot and cold items.  Good location.  Walking distance to museums, underground station, pubs, restaurants.  Friendly staff, doorman and concierge.  Would easily stay here again.",5,2015,07,08
113,"Great hotel, tiny showers. ","The Kensington Hotel, a lovely and elegant boutique hotel in south Kensington has an excellent location, very friendly and accommodating staff, large comfortable rooms on the main floor for relaxing, reading, meeting people.  However my only criticism beyond the small rooms, typical for London, was the ridiculously narrow showers. The depth is fine. If they had had made them even six of 8 inches wider, that would've sufficed. They are very narrow! (This is an observation from normal sized people). Beyond this design floor, great spot. ",4,2015,07,07
113,Great Stay at the Kensington Hotel,"On a recent trip with my husband and parents, we decided to stay at the Kensington Hotel after months of researching online. The hotel was gorgeous, clean and very cozy. We particularly enjoyed drinks in the lounge before and after dinner. The rooms and the service of the staff were perfect! We will definitely return in the future! ",5,2015,07,06
113,Great Location,"We first stayed in the hotel when is opened and then used it for some years due to its excellent location.  This was our first visit in some years and while the staff were excellent and really did go out of their way to make us feel welcome we felt that there were many aspects of the hotel which were now looking very tired and need attention. Given this is London the room was small, but the bathroom was in desperate need of renovation and the room fan really did struggle, however on the plus side the hotel has great friendly ~ helpful staff ~ and an excellent location.",3,2015,07,06
113,enjoyed,"This was our first experience of London and staff went out of their way to assist us settle in. A map of the local area was made available with suggestions, plus listing places to eat at and other helpful information. 
The hotel was perfectly located, central to all major tourist venues as well as public transport. We felt at home and couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better stay- the hotel is extremely comfortable, had everything we could have ever needed and is in such a great location!",5,2015,07,05
113,Best Hotel London,"We stayed in London for a few nights as a surprise birthday present for my boyfriend this June and the hotel was fantastic! We had an easy commute from the airport and to the south ken train station when we left which I would highly recommend for a seamless and stress free travel. The room itself is beautiful and fully equipped with everything you could need, There is a nespresso machine and as well as a big TV. The hotel is in a great location - we easily walked to the Victoria and Albert museum, Harrods, whole foods and Hyde Park and lots of beautiful places as well as being located right next to the Kensington palace. Old Brompton road is full of amazing restaurants and bars. Thank you so much for a truly fantastic English experience - we sincerely hope to return ‚ù§ x",5,2015,07,03
113,Small rooms disappoint ,"Firstly I have to say that there is little you can do about the size of a room and I appreciate London Hotels have small rooms, but given the standard of hotel, this was small! Maybe the hotel could have warned us the room was tiny! 

Gripe over....the Hotel is a fantastic location, staff very polite and courteous, very warm welcome.

Room was very well appointed, comfortable and the Town House is lovely, fabulous decor. 

The low-ish rating is purely on room size not experience of visit. In hindsight calling and checking would have helped! ",3,2015,07,02
113,The fantastic kensington,"We had a fantastic break in this hotel that felt like home away from home, It's a perfect hotel when you need to tour all the musuems ( V & A , scinece musuem, natural history musuem) were very accessible via this hotel. Our room was fantastic with a great view f queensgate street . All in all this is a wonderful place for holiday.",5,2015,07,01
113,top notch & friendly,"It was really great to stay at the kensington hotel, the staff were the best that I have ever encountered plus the atoisphere was really laid back and relaxing. bravo to everyone and I'll be back right here for my next  england visit.",5,2015,07,01
113,So charming,The Kensington hotel was perfect for our family trip.  The room was very good size (this could be because we needed something that fit a family of 4).  Very comfortable beds. The staff was very helpful and lots of little extras that made our stay very pleasant. Good location. A little pricey but I think that is location and the fact that we needed 4 person room.,5,2015,07,01
113,Fabulous,"A truly fabulous, and consistent, service and experience.  The staff are extremely helpful and friendly, and the hotel itself is clean and fresh.  Superb location and a relaxing setting.  Same every time.  Thanks!

113,"Lovely hotel, dreadful room","This is a beautiful hotel in the heart of Kensington, within walking distance of the tube station, Harrods and lots of fantastic eateries.The staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast superb.Our bed was extremely comfortable with great pillows but unfortunately sleep eluded us for the two nights we stayed there, due to the noisy air-conditioning, underfloor heating (it was in 25/26 degrees outside), and on opening the window we were blasted with noise from the hotel exterior air-con fans! Be very careful when booking that you are on the front of the building as the fans appear to be at the back. We landed back in Dublin exhausted from two sleepless nights.",4,2015,06,29
113,A gem in Kensington,"I booked to stay here as I was attending a concert in Hyde Park and, as I work in Kensington, I know this is a great hotel. 
Whilst you can find cheaper, you get what you pay for here. Fantastic service, brilliant food, great atmosphere and a lovely room. Top it off with an excellent location for travel all around central London and it is a winning mix.
I would have no hesitation in staying again and would easily recommend this to anyone looking to make a stay in London that bit more special.",5,2015,06,29
113,The great Kensington hotel,"Thanks to everyone at the kensington hotel it was  exactly like in your website description. it was Very nice, welcoming and comfortable hotel.

113,truly homely hotel,"The hotel was very nice,clean and luxurious and was really close to the tube station as mention by other reviewers We didn't get to use the room as much as we would have liked, but it was an amazing space overlooking queensgate. The hotel was well located just a few blocks off from the main museums and shopping centres. The neighborhood was great, and we enjoyed a number of the local establishments. Overall, it was a great stay, and we would definitely return again.",5,2015,06,29

Room very clean, well appointed, small (but typical for London), very little street noise. Nice to have the N'espresso machine. Extremely helpful concierge. I really enjoyed staying in such a comfortable hotel away from the hyper-bustle of London.",4,2015,06,26
113,"Great Location, excellent breakfast .","Bedrooms vary greatly, first nights room was the smallest double room I have ever stayed in . However a call to front desk resulted in us being moved the following day to a perfectly acceptable room for the following 2 nights. If traveling by car I suggest you do some research as it proved very expensive. Bar service was very slow however staff were at all times very professional and welcoming.",4,2015,06,23
113,Fabulous service,"Lovely hotel in a good location to the royal albert hall.
Not the biggest room but fine for London - we were only in the standard room (but a large standard)

A wonderfull experience.

113,Best city hotel,"This hotel is absolutely the best choice of a city hotel as It was really comfortable and felt like home the second I walked in, and  staff couldn't have been a nicer. This hotel is accessible to all of London kensington and chelsea borough residents so we managed to have a chat in the lobby with a few locals. It is just a little walk on old brompton street to the south kensington tube station. if you don't feel like leaving this trendy neighborhood has everything you need! Often I didn't even want to leave! The restaurants in the neighborhood are amazing- if you like like japanese,Italian,french cuisine it‚Äôs all here. I had the best hamburger I have ever eaten at the townhouse restaurant for a lunch meeting  with my friends,other accessible thing you may need like open late night  pharmacy, fish and chips, lebanese coffee shops, and pubs, all in all my stay in London far exceeded my expectations! 
Highly recommend this hotel!",5,2015,06,21
113,Fist time round and I love it,"It was perfect for our needs: clean, quiet, bright rooms. The hallways are traditional English and there are lights all over. Pictures and description are completely accurate. This was my first time in this hotel around Chelsea and I loved it. I would definitely seek out this hotel the next time I'm back. Altogether, it was a great experience.",5,2015,06,21
113,Quaint hotel in lovely part of London,"A classic british hotel in a great location. Room and bathroom were a bit on the small side but the great location and level of service more than made up for this. Walking distance from Kings Road, Harrods, Knightsbridge etc  and a 2 minute walk from South Kensington tube station.",4,2015,06,19
113,I can't say enough nice things about The Kensington,"Our stay at The Kensington was exceptional, superb, and exceeded all our expectations.  I have been convincing my family and friends to stay at the Kensington since our return home.  
The locations is perfect.  We were able to walk to many major attractions.  The building, breakfast room, common areas and our room itself was luxurious and comfortable.  My husband enjoyed the gym and said it was very well appointed.
The staff were always professional and friendly.
It was always a joy to come back to our wonderful hotel after an exhausting day of sight seeing.

A special Thank You to Mr. Frits Potgieter for going the extra mile to make our stay memorable.  I hope the Doyle Collection realizes how lucky they are to have such a gem as part of the Doyle team.",5,2015,06,19
113,"Wonderful hotel, great location ",We stayed for 5 nights. The staff is wonderful. Always very pleasant and asking how they can help. The concierge was very helpful with local restaurant ideas. There are a lot to choose from within walking distance. A short 5 minute walk to the tube (South Kensington). The lobby is beautiful. The breakfast in the morning was nice. We had the full American breakfast as part of our package. Make sure you leave yourself time to enjoy the breakfast. It takes awhile for the food to come out from the kitchen. The room worked out well for us. They offered to pull apart one of the beds to make two twins for our daughters. No view from the window but who visits London to sit in their room. Afternoon tea is wonderful. One platter is enough for two to split. We will definitely stay here again. ,5,2015,06,19

Included breakfast was fine and cooked to order. We paid ¬£200 for the one night. Staff very pleasant.",4,2015,06,18
113,Quiet luxury hotel in Kensington,"A great location in walking distance from restaurants, transportation and Hyde Park in a quiet, tree-lined street in Kensington.  Helpful staff can get tickets for plays and Royal Albert Hall is in walking distance.  We had a very elegant high tea which is always fun to do in London.",4,2015,06,15
113,"Service great, rooms tiny","The Kensington is very charming and conveniently situated to he many sights of London. The staff is attentive and friendly and it's a great place to come back to after a busy day around the city. However the bathroom is a little dated, the view into the brick backyards and a tall wall feels quite suffocating and the room itself is very small and narrow.",4,2015,06,15
113,Wonderful afternoon tea.,"Thank you to the staff at the Kensington for a most memorable and beautiful afternoon tea. My family and I travelled to London from Ireland to see the savage beauty exhibition in the V&A , we decided we would treat ourselves to the Alexander Mc Queen inspired afternoon tea. It was a delight, from the golden quail egg, to the chocolate butterfly, and those scones... wow. I'd like to give a special mention to a wonderful staff member, Thank You to George, who went above and beyond to make our afternoon tea one of the highlights of our trip to London!!! 

Lisa, Catherine and Trish",5,2015,06,15
113,never disappointed,Each time I come to London I stay at the Kensington Hotel and I am planning on continuing as I am never disappointed. The staff is very friendly and will always try to find a solution if you have a concern. The rooms are all different with some larger than other but they are all comfy. And the location is simply ideal.,5,2015,06,14
113,Amazing,"This is a spectacular hotel from my ""last minute surprise weekend"" stay for me. The renovated rooms and plethora of dazzling amenities (my favorite being the tea in the room-the English do know it best) make it very comfortable. There are so many restaurants and boutiques near by it gives new meaning to the real estate saying ""LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION""! The staff was friendly and helpful. I simply cannot wait to return! Cheers!",5,2015,06,13
113,Perfect Stay in London,"The Kensington Hotel is a wonderful hotel in South Kensington. The staff are welcoming and friendly and the rooms and lobby are perfect. Service is great and they think of the little things, like leaving a forecast for the next day on your pillow after the turndown. The location is great... It's only a short walk to the South Kensington tube station, and really only a slightly longer walk to many of the museums (V&A, Natural History) and Kensington Palace/Gardens.  We were there for a week, and during that time everything was perfect. You couldn't ask for a better stay, and we will be back again next year.",5,2015,06,13
113,First time in London could not be more perfect!,"This hotel is so beautiful, amalgam of charming English style with some bold fashion details 
Hotel rooms are gorgeous, all are renovated, free WiFi, complimentary coffee and tea in the room, good size closet and 24 h room service!
Location is tremendous few minutes walk to a shopping area including Harrods mall, there are many restaurants and cafes near by as well, from fancy 5 star French to little local bars, all are great!

113,"Simply, wonderful!","This was a surprise booking for my wife's birthday. The hotel is unlike your chain. The personal touches, were fabulous throughout. 

We were made to feel welcome throughout. The little touches, such as the concierge calling for a cab, the big bowl of apples at reception. When my wife ordered bacon which was just at a little bit under done (to her taste!) They attentive staff cooked extra rashers at their insistence! Breakfast was fabulous!Not forgetting, the birthday card and cake dish. I like my Nespresso strong. There was none, but they went out and purchased my favourite capsules!

Upon checking out, which was a smooth experience. We were asked, as it was warm outside to whether we required bottles of water to take with us!

I was so impressed. We have stayed at many hotels around theWorld. I would have no hesitation in recommending nor coming back.

Many thanks guys, you area credit to the hotel industry- the epitome of first class service, well done!!",5,2015,06,08
113,Early birthday treat,"Beautiful hotel, immaculately decoratated with extremely helpful staff!

113,"Great staff, great hotel","I've stayed at this hotel on several occasions and quite frankly the service levels just keep getting better. On two occasions when I stayed previously I had ""issues""' and the staff went out of their way to go the extra mile. From my perspective, they made it home from home and would highly recommend it",5,2015,06,08
113,Trip to London,"We had the most amazing stay at the Kensington! The rooms were immaculate and the service impeccable. Make sure to have breakfast there and order the eggs Benedict and Devonshire crab--and ask for George to be your server. He was pleasant, polite, and efficient. He gave us a wonderful start to our day!",5,2015,06,07
113,Amazing breakfast - thanks George,"This is the third time we came back to this place for breakfast. The food itself is delicious, but the difference maker is George. One of the best people ever met, he really makes every breakfast an amazing occasion thanks to its energizing smile and kindness. My girlfriend and I had eggs benedict, eggs royale and pancakes. Everything was great, and a special mention goes to the jams. Definitely worth the visit (fair prices as well).

Thanks again George, we'll see you soon!!!",5,2015,06,06
113,Service at the Kensington is Outstanding.,"This hotel is a gem, with extraordinary service.  George is a force multiplier in the service area at breakfast-- a rock star, if you're old enough to recall rock music, or maybe you just heard about it from your parents.  

Breakfast itself was as good as it gets too-- fresh eggs, real meats, perfectly executed coffees... all good (apparently we finally found the guy or gal who knows the right amount of vinegar to use on Eggs Benedict!  Also, word to the wise for you geezers, some of the chairs in the breakfast area are deep, so do your downward dogs before you head down for breakfast, you might need it.  Some of the rooms are small, so be careful in there. 

The neighborhood has great food selections too, lots of visual interest, opens spaces make it a great walking 'hood-- but also not far from the places you may like to see... from the world's greatest museums, to the worlds silliest (Wax) ones. ",5,2015,06,04
113,Really nice stay!,"My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights. The hotel is very clean and modern. It is located right off High Street. The staff was very attentive and courteous. The restaurant  was very good! We really enjoyed our breakfast. - really tasty and a very good selection of food, nice presentation!  So close to stores , restaurants, the Tube and Kensington Palace!  Walking out of the hotel - just keep walking forward make a right and you will find the Tube.  The bar area is nice and comfortable. Again, can' t say enough on how courteous the staff is- made us feel so welcome!! The only thing that we did not like was the bathroom - little small but then again  European hotels are smaller.  Would definitely  stay there again. Thank you Kensington üé©",5,2015,06,03
113,Stay at Kensington Hotel,"We went to London for a few days at the end of May 2015. The Kensington Hotel was perfect for us.
1) It's a wonderful quiet location near the South Kensington station (Piccadilly line) with many nice restaurants nearby. It's walking distance to several museums, hyde park and we walked to Kensington Palace easily.
2) The room was lovely and very clean.
3) The concierges were incredibly helpful and knowledgeable. They made our stay very easy.  
4) The Alexander McQueen afternoon tea is lovely and artistic. Not to be missed. 
5) The sitting rooms are very comfortable.
6) The breakfast is wonderful.
We really enjoyed our stay and would stay again.
Of note, I had my 7 year old daughter with me and she loved it also.",5,2015,06,03
113,Never disappoints,"I, along with group of family and friends, stayed at the Kensington Hotel to celebrate my sister's birthday. The staff could not have made us feel more welcome. The rooms were spotless. My sister and brother-in-law were upgraded to a much larger room and given a number of birthday treats. This is a really special place; very comfortable and stylish but not at all stuffy. It is more of a home-from-home and one is made to feel welcome from start to finish. I've stayed here before and I can't think of anywhere else I'd rather stay in London. This hotel never disappoints and, to top it off, it is very reasonably priced when compared with other luxury hotels in the area. Trying out one of their Irish hotels next week. ",5,2015,06,03
113,Fabulous London Gem!,"My husband and I stayed at this lovely hotel during our recent trip to London. We stayed 5 nights and were very comfortable and well taken care of. My husband had an ankle injury a few months ago and due to his injury, walking for long periods causes him pain and swelling. Each afternoon when we would come back to the hotel after our sightseeing of the day, we would be greeted by Ronnie and my husband would ask if he could arrange for a bucket of ice to be brought up to the room and within minutes, the ice was at our door! The staff got to know our names very quickly and when we needed advice or assistance, they were on it. The restaurant served excellent food and the breakfasts, in particular were wonderful. Our room was very comfortable and spacious. I can't say enough wonderful things about this hotel and would definitely recommend it highly to everyone who plans on a trip to London whether business or personal!",5,2015,06,02
113,4 Lovely May Nights In London!,"My wife and I just got back from our first trip to Europe.  We started off by traveling from Denver to London (via Icelandair, which was easy and painless).  After researching hotels in London extensively we chose The Kensington Hotel, and we chose right!  The hotel is close to the South Kensington tube stop, and is in the wonderful South Kensington neighborhood.  As we walked up to the hotel with our luggage a friendly doorman greeted us and took our bags.  We checked into our room, which was on the 3rd floor around the side of the hotel.  The room faced out to Old Brompton Road, with a view of a nice tree lined street.

The room was very nice.  We had a king bed (superior room).  It's a fairly normal room for London (which means small compared to American hotels), but didn't feel too small for us.  The bathroom was very nice and the shower was a rain-type, amazing!

We had an evening drink before turning in the first night, and met George, who served our drinks to us.  He was everything we've read about in other reviews and more!  He was very engaging, friendly, and even wrote down some suggestions for us to do in London and delivered them to us.  One day we had afternoon tea, which was amazing!  Maybe it's because it was our first tea experience, but we thought the food and atmosphere was fantastic!  There was a LOT of food, and we couldn't finish it all.  We finished up and headed to the Chelsea Flower Show that afternoon.  It was awesome.

Overall, I highly recommend the Kensington Hotel.  Book early to get the best rates and room selection, and try the afternoon tea!",5,2015,05,31
113,Excellent choice!,"Stayed here a few nights with our 3 adult children.  We had 2 rooms, we all had plenty of space.  The furnishings are well-chosen and stylish while retaining a classic feel.  Luxurious bathrooms although on the small side.  Turndown service is always a lovely touch. 
The neighborhood is very convenient and we walked to all sights.   Ate breakfast each morning in hotel, sumptuous choices and beautifully presented.  Staff throughout the hotel were professional, kind  and courteous.  Each of them were helpful with various questions we had about sights, the neighborhood, etc.  We felt very well taken care of and look forward to sending friends to this hotel!  ",5,2015,05,31
113,Very good experience and service,"Hotel is very good, excellent service and nice rooms. Staff very proffesional and helpfull, always there when you think you could need them. No additional charges for exrtras like UK elect. adapter. Very expensive as well but price matches service.",4,2015,05,31
113,"The Kensington Hotel - great location, disappointing rooms","I have stayed in a number of 'boutique' hotels in the South Kensington area. The Kensington, like the nearby Pelham and Gore, has that quirky, creaky floor charm similar to the others. 
Last year, at the height of the spring/summer season, the rates at the Kensington were relatively high compared to the other hotels in same room category. 
This year it's even more expensive. 
I stayed in a Deluxe King this time (end of May). The room had nice modern touches, but too small and lacked a writing desk. 
 The decor is so-so - bland. My deluxe room at the back of the hotel was painted battle ship grey. The bed sheets were surprisingly scratchy due to its low thread count. I felt I was staying in the inferior guest room at a friend's house. It could use some colorful splashes in the rooms.  
Over all the Kensington lacks a luxurious feel. 
At other hotels area, for $100 less, I can get a much larger room with a king bed, writing desk, floor to ceiling windows with fancy drapes, a huge bathroom, cheerful decor, and creamy smooth sheets. 
On the upside, the Kensington has large yet cosy comfy user-friendly sitting and dining area, where you can sip tea while glued to your laptop.
The food is consistently good, the staff cheerful and accommodating. 
The bar is the hotel's best asset: low lit, sleek, hip atmosphere, cool music. The decor is a quirky fusion of art deco and classic. 
The hotel is on the tree-lined Queen's Gate road, an area with a residential feel, and close to excellent restaurants and museums. It's an easy walk to Knightsbridge and Harrod's. 
At the end of the day, however, for me, the rooms at the Kensington were not great value for the high prices they're asking-especially during high season.",4,2015,05,30
113,Beautiful Hotel. Amazing Service. ,"This hotel is a four or five star hotel.  It is simply beautiful.  We were greeted at the front door by the doorman who welcomed us to the hotel each and every time we entered and exited the hotel.  

Our check in took two minutes tops.  Our room was not ready when we arrived around 12 but they stowed our luggage while we explored the city. 

The concierge helped us look up restaurants in the area and suggested his favorites.  

The room is not the most spacious in the world but the furniture is very old English style and charming.  It even comes with an umbrella to use as you will more than likely need it. 

It was about a block or two away from the south Kensington stop for the underground and near a lot of restaurants.  It is in a beautiful neighborhood. 

The only issue I had was that I requested a power adapter with a North American power plug and it took them a few times to actually respond.  There ended up being a  plug located near the mirror near the bed and another American outlet, a little less obvious, in the bathroom. 

We received turndown service as well, which was nice. 

Overall, it was an amazing experience.

113,Great Stay,"My wife and I stayed at the Kensington Hotel for a week. The Hotel was fantastic. We felt right at home from the moment of arrival. We enjoyed the neighborhood immensely. There are plenty of good restaurants in all directions (Brompton Road, Fulham Road, etc). We walked the area on many occasions and found it very nice and safe. We walked to the Chelsea FC game as well. The Hotel is very convenient to the Gloucester and South Kensington underground stations (three lines at Kensington), which makes it just a few minutes from all of London. The Staff was very courteous and happy to assist. Did not have that large Hotel brand feel, much more personable. We had a King Superior room and found it perfect. The heated bathroom floor was a plus. Most all European hotel rooms are smaller than US standards, but that is more than okay as this one makes up with quality. We found this room big enough. We hope to come back to London with our entire family in a year or so and I know this Hotel will be highly considered.",5,2015,05,28
113,Our stay at The Kensington,This hotel is a 150 room boutique hotel centrally located to museums and other attractions.  We stayed four nights and the service was excellent.  Our room was upgraded from a queen to a king and it was really nice.  The staff were all very considerate and helpful.  The restaurant in the hotel provided a very nice breakfast every day and an excellent selection of gourmet fare for dinner.  I would definitely stay here again and would hope people read this and do the same.,5,2015,05,28
113,"Beautiful hotel, great location","Nothing but positive things to say about our experience with this hotel. Lovely staff, well appointed rooms, thoroughly walkable location. 
Our room was quite spacious- we may have gotten an upgrade from the standard room due to the precious toddler traveling with us. The queen sized bed was cozy and provided a wonderful sleep. And coming from drought stricken California, the walk-in rain shower was quite luxurious!
Although we did not partake (due to aforementioned toddler), the Afternoon Tea looked scrumptious, and the restaurant and bar looked like a nice spot for romantic dinner/drinks.
The staff are very oriented toward guest comfort and satisfaction, and we felt very taken care of during our stay. My toddler also thanks you for her Kensington Hotel teddy bear!
We would definitely stay here again given the opportunity.",5,2015,05,27
113,An enjoyable holiday at The Kensington Hotel!,"We stayed at The Kensington Hotel in the middle of May for 7 nights and enjoyed it immensely! The hotel was, at most, a 15 minute walk from Royal Albert Hall, where we attended one of the Eric Clapton concerts, and a little less than that from the V&A Museum. The South Kensington underground station was an easy 5 minute walk away, and there are several (mostly Italian) restaurants and a pub between the hotel and the station, which is extremely convenient (we ate at Bella Italia, the Zetland Arms and Marion's Kitchen...all were fantastic!). There is also a small Tesco and Waitrose along the route where we picked up some fruit to have in our room. Up the road a bit, not far from Royal Albert Hall but on the opposite side of Queen's Gate, is another great pub called the Queen's Arms...the staff there was so friendly! And...when walking south along Queen's Gate from Hyde Park, look for the sign at No. 2 Queen's Gate...it's where the late great comedian Benny Hill used to live. 

We had booked a Superior Double room, but we're pretty sure the bed was queen-size rather than the expected double (yay!). The room itself was bright, spotless, and beautifully furnished but very small, even for European standards, but we made it work by utilizing every drawer and the three baskets in the closet, and we could squeeze our two 30"" suitcases against the wall so we didn't trip on anything. The bathroom amenities were among the best we've had in a hotel...very high quality...and the towels were amazingly thick! The oversized rainshower faucet head was wonderful, with plenty of pressure and hot water. The thick terry robes and slippers in the room were also very appreciated! Our room was on the second floor and faced into the centre courtyard, so our view consisted of the HVAC system. The lower part of the window had an opaque covering on it, though, so we really only could see the HVAC setup when we opened the window. While a pretty view is always a plus, we did appreciate that there was virtually no street noise since we faced inward, and the HVAC system was silent! The room had a kettle, a tea pot and a coffee maker, with supplies for both tea and coffee generously replenished daily. There was also a well-stocked bar fridge (but there was no room in the fridge to store any of our own items). 

This is a charming old building, which is evident from the creaking floors both in our room and in the halls (the hallway floor even sloped a tiny bit!). This was a bit of a problem for me because as a light sleeper, I seemed to wake up when people in the neighbouring rooms started moving around...our floor creaked and groaned as they walked in their rooms! It woke me every time! Having said that, no other noise ever transferred between the rooms...we never heard others' voices, TVs, etc. Just creaking floors!! A pair of foam earplugs would have helped to block it out...must remember for next time. 

Probably the best feature of the hotel is its impeccable service. The doormen and concierge are extremely helpful and pleasant; nothing is ever too much bother for them. The front desk attendants were equally lovely. When our room wasn't quite ready at the stated time, the hotel invited us to have a drink at its expense while we waited (it was a short wait!). We booked Afternoon Tea one day and it was a truly marvelous experience...the service, surroundings, and food were outstanding! The Alexander McQueen-inspired desserts were too beautiful to eat (but we did anyway)! 

There is a lot to really love about The Kensington Hotel and we highly recommend it to anyone wanting a classy but understated first-rate facility in a lovely and convenient part of London. We can't wait to visit a second time, hopefully soon!",5,2015,05,26
113,Great hotel in South Kensington Area,"This hotel was sublime right from the beginning with the doorman.  So polite and we felt so welcome.  Beautiful warm inviting lobby.  Beautiful staff that helped without making it seem like they just wanted a tip.  The best in English hospitality.
Our room, nice surprise.  Not spacious as it is downtown London, but again very inviting. The bedding was sublime and made sleeping a breeze.  Beautiful renovated rooms and bathrooms in a beautiful old hotel.  Restaurant, Bar and Lounge were beautiful and relaxing.
Loved everything right down to the toiletries that reminded me of a high end spa.
The hotel is walking distance to Victoria & Albert Museum, Harrods and many other shops, cafe's, pubs and restaurants.  Awesome location.  Bonus, free WiFi.  Only complaint was the spoons which were not replaced daily from the mini bar when we used them.",5,2015,05,26
113,"Small room, but perfectly beautiful.","The hotel is stunning, breakfast is excellent - whether you do the continental or order eggs. They don't rush you of course and it's just a beautiful experience. The room is small, but it's really so comfortable and well appointed that you don't mind at all.  I highly recommend The Kensington Hotel.",4,2015,05,26
113,London Visit,"We stayed 5 nights at The Kensington Hotel and loved it immensely.
This is  very luxurious hotel and very welcoming by all the staff.  We picked the location as it was very close to the Chelsea Flower show, but we got so much more with the local area i.e. shops, restaurants and pubs.
Happy to go back and stay there if we ever go back to London

113,Great afternoon tea!,"I was in London for the weekend prior to a work trip and decided to try the Kensington Hotels afternoon tea. I went in solo, and absolutely loved the experience. The food was amazing, and consisted of sandwiches, scones, and several deserts. I got the English breakfast tea, and it was amazing.

Looks wise, the setting was clean, colorful, and very pretty. Exactly what you would expect from an afternoon tea. Finally, the staff was wonderful. My waiter, George, was extremely friendly and helpful. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is looking for somewhere to spend their afternoon :)",5,2015,05,24
113,Afternoon tea was fantastic,"Afternoon tea in this hotel is fantastic, The atmosphere, decor is really stylish dating back to the victorian era.

Would be happy to come back again in the future.",5,2015,05,24

The hotel is lovely, very homely, with lots and lots of books, knick knacks and cosy furniture. The beds were so comfortable, lovely linens, plenty of clean towels. The mini bar was well stocked. We could have had anything with choices that were available that is a nice plus. The neighbourhood is terrific. Good British food right at the end of the street, many very good restaurants in the area.

113,Superb stay in a very well appointed hotel,"Close to museums and within easy walking distance of the Royal Albert Hall, we stayed here for one night as we going to a concert.  This hotel is in an affluent area of London and close to the tube station so getting around the city to other areas of interest was easy.  The hotel was everything we expected it to be from other reviews.  The rooms are well appointed and the bed was terrific - best nights sleep ever in a hotel.  Breakfast was superb with everything you could wish for and food of excellent quality.  The staff were amazing and very customer focused.  I would strongly recommend this delightful hotel; you won't be disappointed.  Thank you Kensington for a wonderful stay!",5,2015,05,22
113,Amazing!,"My stay at the Kensington hotel was perfect. The area of Kensington is beautiful, and the hotel couldn't be more lovely. It is quintessentially English. The staff went out of their way to ensure that my stay was what I envisioned for my holiday. I had requested bubble bath, which they did not have.  They purchased some, and had it waiting in my room.   A relatively small thing, but it was appreciated nonetheless.  This is service that you would expect from a five-star hotel, but don't always get.  If you're searching for a hotel in London, look no further. You will not be disappointed.",5,2015,05,21
113,The Lounge,"I have had the best experience here. If you have the time to spare, go sit in the lounge for a drink and try and get George as your server. He is so enjoyable and nailed my Atlanta, GA accent. Enjoy the afternoon tea and the wonderful Kensington area. I hope to soon come back. ",5,2015,05,21
113,Marvellous hotel,"My son and I recently stayed for 11 nights at The Kensington. 
What a fabulous hotel!
The public areas are elegant, all the staff professional, friendly and courteous. 
The hotel has charm and character and each afternoon or evening when we returned, it felt like we were coming home. 

We arrived for check in very early at about 10am thinking we would leave our luggage and come back later. 
Andrea checked us in immediately but not only that, she offered to show us a variety of different rooms to choose from and went out of her way to find us the better room. 

South Kensington, of course, is just the best location to stay in. Convenient to all that you could want, while at the same time you are living in a neighbourhood. 

George who sometimes served us in the lounge area was charming. A lovely man who went out of his way to provide excellent service. On our last afternoon we ordered a pot of tea and he surprised us with scones and cream as his treat to us!

Overall the service provided by all the staff was superb. During this stay I went and had drinks with friends who were staying at The Ritz. 
The staff at The Kensington Hotel beat The Ritz hands down. 

We can't wait to come back to London and it goes with out saying that we will be staying at The Kensington!

It's totally charming, my room was great, the staff could not have been more wonderful, and the location is fantastic. Oh, and the price is terrific. Though I was traveling alone for pleasure, it would be great for business trips, too. I almost hate to write this review because I don't want the whole world to know. There's so much more to say, too. The scones are homemade and to die for. The amenities are great. I just can't say enough.",5,2015,05,20
113,Great location and helpful staff,This was our first time in London and the Kensington was the perfect location.  Close to a tube station and within walking distance to many of the most popular sites. The staff was very accommodating.

113,Fantastic stay,"Had an extremely good stay from start to finish. All staff made us feel extremely welcome and answered all the questions we had throughout our stay and everything we needed was provided to a great standard.

If you have an Oyster card then there's High Street Kensington Station just around the corner and there are plenty of shops and restaurants in the immediate vicinity making this a great location with so many options for things to do, sights to see and places to eat. We made sure to take advantage of the great location and packed our days full of exploring the city.

During our stay we booked an evening meal in the hotel's restaurant and were extremely pleased with how the restaurant had been transformed from the well lit bustling buffet it had been at breakfast to a great setting for a romantic candle-lit dinner with fantastic food to match, making it an incredibly enjoyable night and overall stay for myself and my partner.",5,2015,05,19

The room (superior, number 108) was very comfortable and nicely decorated but small with NO natural light. The window glass was opaque and hidden behind shutters. This was fine for us because we just wanted to sleep but we would not have wanted to spend time in daytime in this room and it was not good value for money.",4,2015,05,15

The hotel is one of the fanciest we have stayed in truly 5 star. Very nicely decorated and comfortable.
We were given a free upgrade to a slightly larger room which was a really nice touch. The room was spacious, very clean and very nicely decorated. We had  a good nights sleep on the comfortalble bed.
The staff here are very friendly and welcoming and helped us out with whatever we needed.
The breakfast we had included had all of the usual pastries and cold cuts you would need and filled us each morning. We dined in the restaurant one night and had the best meal in our entire stay in london and reasonably priced for london standards.

It is a well known neighborhood that is a very short walk to grocery stores, shopping, coffee shops as well as a number of restaurants and cafes. South Ken and gloucester road tube stations are also reasonably close and taxis are easy to flag down on old brompton Road. We walked everywhere, to Kensington Palace, Royal Albert Hall, the Natural History Museum, and Harrods, among others. We were a family group, so space is at a premium, but we were out most of the time and mainly used the hotel for sleeping. Overall, this hotel suited our needs perfectly.",5,2015,05,13

Food in the lobby lounge is pretty limited if you're a late night arrival.  Lobby is nice, atmosphere in the lounge is rather 'old world' stale, but it does the trick if you're there for a quick overnight.

113,Gorgeous Boutique Hotel,"Our stay at The Kensington Hotel was part of a surprise 60th birthday celebration for my mother and we had a fantastic visit. The staff were so friendly and smiley that you were instantly made to feel welcome and at ease from the moment we arrived till the end of our stay. We were led up to our Superior rooms on the 4th floor which were stylishly decorated and comfortable with all of the amenities you would expect and could wish for. The beds were plush and it was so lovely to sink into the soft feather pillows for a little rest before the start of our evening festivities. 

We were attended to so well in the warm and sumptuous lobby for a pre-dinner drink before setting off to my Mother's favourite Italian restaurant Sale e Pepe for her birthday dinner, one of the many up-scale restaurants to be in striking distance of the hotel. The breakfast the next morning was probably one of the best we have ever had, set within the cosy library-style restaurant with freshly squeezed juices, a varied selection of continental offerings and a truly delicious cooked English breakfast with bacon and sausages to die for. The bubble and squeak was a lovely touch and we were very well looked after by the busy and friendly staff including the charming George.

All in all a fantastic experience. Perfect location, beautiful surroundings and service with a smile. What more could you wish for!",5,2015,05,04

113,Another satisfied visit,"We like to visit this hotel whenever we are in London, 4 or 5 times annually. Superb in every way. The highest recommendation for this beautiful townhouse is their newly refurbished restaurant. While I would consider us regulars I love the service here, always being welcomed back by everyone. Excellent service, great ambiance & of course the food,We have never been disappointed . We also like occasionally to sit by the bar with a nice window seat so we can watch the World go by while enjoying a nice glass of Champagne or one of their signature cocktails, Gluten free afternoon tea for my patner was spot on. Thanks once again",5,2015,05,03
113,highly recommend,"Had a very nice stay at this hotel. The location is terrific, particularly if you prefer Kensington as I do. It is very close many eateries, pubs, and shops off of either High Street or Gloucester, and within reasonable walking distance of many more in South Ken, Knightsbridge, Earl's Court, etc.The hotel itself has a terrific layout. It is on a quiet and very nice street, it‚Äôs very nicely appointed.Basically, I would stay here again and would recommend it to friends.",5,2015,05,03

Imagine a receptionist,concierges(Martin and waiters - George )  that are so gracious and kind and charming you rather wish they were your relatives--this is here at the beautiful kensington hotel.

He went the extra mile by noting it was my birthday and at breakfast brought me a muffin with a candle which made my day.  Thank you George.,4,2015,04,30
113,Lovely Area,"the kensington hotel  is superbly located in a beautiful quiet area of Kensington. Museums, parks, attractions, shops and underground all in short walking distance. The hotel was very modern, clean, quiet and had everything we could possibly need.It has been nicely renovated and we were quite comfortable there for a week. The area and the location is great, good shopping very close along with coffee shops and restaurants. The Gloucester Rd tube station is an easy walk. While t, the neighborhood is lovely.

Our room had nicely appointed art, furniture, and linens. Just all around an elegant and lovely hotel. We were ecstatic with the entire set up and experience.
The location of this hotel could not be better for the Tube, bus lines, grocery stories, night life, as well as cultural attractions. The V & A is under a 5-minute walk, the Natural History & Science Museums extremely close, as well as beautiful parks and lovely gardens everywhere.
staff was extremely easy to talk with and I would just rate this a 5-star experience PLUS. Highly, highly recommend this for people looking for a fantastic London hotel. You will be charmed by the whole experience!",5,2015,04,29

The hotel is very quiet, but also very close to the busy old brompton street and south kensington tube station which makes getting about very easy. My daughter took over the room and I found the bed extremely comfortable, there was plenty of space for both of us. Linens are abundant and the great supply of amenities made us feel like we were at a palace Nicest touches were the milk, coffee pods and and a welcome treat that awaited us after an overnight plane trip that made us feel right at home. Staff were also polite and answered all my queries about attractions and theatres, concierge got us a taxi which made getting back  to Heathrow quite easy. I would stay there again in a minute!",5,2015,04,28
113,"A perfect hotel, in a great neighborhood!","If someone tries to convince you that Kensington is not a ""happening"" place in London, don't believe them! A stay here at this marvelous hotel will be the perfect home for your London explorations. The location, in my estimation, is ideal and just 5 minutes walk from the convenient South Kensington station, which gives you access to everywhere in London. Also, bus lines are convenient. The neighborhood is a blend of residential, arts and restaurants, with the iconic Victoria and Albert museums, Royal Albert Hall, Natural History museums, Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park all easy and pleasant strolls away. 
This hotel has it all, with an historic atmosphere tempered with a sophisticated contemporary, but not edgy, style. A perfect blend. Rooms are comfortable, spacious, and graced with luxurious touches - robes and slippers, nightly turndown, and upgraded electronics and lighting. Public salons flow into each other and provide cozy spots to relax during the day or evening. The restaurant was delightful and a bar onsite apparently serves up unique, custom blended cocktails - I didn't try this, but if it is on par with the rest of the amenities, I'm sure it is memorable. 
To top this all off, the staff were some of the best in the industry - helpful,friendly, knowledgeable, kind and gracious. They are of the quality that one would expect in a 5 star property, without the attitude!
If you join the Doyle Collection club, you get treated even more royally.
I would recommend this hotel highly!",5,2015,04,28
113,Fabulous Alessandro & George,"It's in a great location, very close to travel links but not overrun by tourists. The interior is beautiful and very welcoming. I took my partner here for her birthday but it would suit all kinds of occasions and party sizes from two up to an easy six.
The service was outstanding...Alessandro was a perfect manager and our waiter George was polite, chatty and had exceptional product knowledge. There was a few things I wasn't sure about on the menu but he was happy to explain what things were and suggested drinks that he thought would suit my tastes.
The afternoon tea was delicious and sanda wiches were prepared exactly how I wanted. I won't go into details on this because words wouldn't do it justice, you just need to taste it for yourselves!
I'd definitely go back, I feel like I'll never go anywhere else for an afternoon tea again!""",5,2015,04,27
113,Luxury hotel,"Great stay with the kensington! they looked after us and made sure we had everything we needed throughout 5 nights stay, Great location for us with only a short (5min) walk to south kensington Underground and Gloucester Road Underground out the other side.Rooms were big enough for London and a nice new bathroom.

George's customer service was exquisite and he made sure we had everything we needed at all times :)

Afternoon tea at the hotel was delicious and beautifully presented in a venue fit for royalty, would definitely return.",5,2015,04,25
113,Fashion Forward Tea,"Amazing service by George during our Fashion forward tea, nothing was too much trouble. An employee who went above and beyond his call of duty, a great reflection of a great experience. George should be recognised for his hard work and excellent customer service.",5,2015,04,25
113,one word - fabulous,"Staff made us feel extremely welcome from the moment we arrived at the hotel which is one of the most stunning hotels that i have ever seen located just at the mouth of queensgate . The space, the views, the attention to detail in furnishings are superb. The kensington hotel is unique in every sense and you really get a feeling of staying somewhere very special and i would strongly recommend it. Thank you All for a great experience!",5,2015,04,24
113,One of the best hotel's we have stayed in!!!!!!!,"WOW!!!! thats the one word I would use to describe this hotel, me and my wife stayed for one night on the 17/04/2015 for our 1st wedding anniversary, I went for the Romantic getaway package on their website, which included a superior room, a bottle of champagne in the room, a romantic turn down treat, breakfast in bed, and a late check out. From the get go we were treated amazingly, from start to finish, we even got a free room upgrade which was very kind, and at least four staff wished us a happy anniversary, we also got a hand written anniversary card off lilian which was a very kind gesture. All staff we encountered were very polite and courteous, and the breakfast in bed was amazing.
We only come to london twice a year to catch a show, so we normally budget and stay in a travel lodge or budget hotel, but this hotel has totally won us over, whenever we do make the trip I am more than willing to pay a bit more and stay here, they really have won us both over.......to the hotel hotel manager I would like to congratulate you on your amazing staff and fantastic service, which made my wife very happy, we hope to see you again sometime in the near future.",5,2015,04,24
113,Superb,"This is a really remarkable place. Service is impeccable, friendly, yet unobtrusive. Love the fresh fruit and flowers ... the happy hour ambiance ... even the restaurant. Our accommodations included continental breakfast ... it was fresh, beautifully presented, with a wide variety of foods and [again] wonderful service. The neighborhood is residential, but within a few blocks are wonderful restaurants, Christie's, the tube, and some of London's best museums. I've stayed several places in London ... this is the first I'd really want to return to.",5,2015,04,23
113,Amazing Hotel,"From the minute you walk in until you leave, you are treated with amazing service.  The lounges are amazing and the morning breakfast is very tasty.  The rooms are small but nice and clean. This is also a great location to the South Kensington tube stop which you can take about everywhere.  The area also has many restaurants , pubs, and cafes within minutes of the hotel, plus their lounge is open all night.  This is  definitely a 5-star hotel.",5,2015,04,23
113,Wonderful hotel in Kensington,"We had a wonderful stay at this hotel in Kensington. The location is perfect, very quiet, leafy street but within walking distance to many attractions, restaurants and bars. The hotel was lovely, clean and practical, yet very inviting and comfortable. The room was a joy to sit in - so much natural light and a wonderfully calming view over the street. Staff was very efficient and accommodating and couldn‚Äôt have been nicer, We hope to stay here again soon.",5,2015,04,23
113,"as soon as I landed, they were accommodating!","I will stay at this hotel for every trip to London that I make. The morning I arrived after an overnight flight, they were quick to accommodate my requests to make my room more comfortable for the week long stay. I even ordered room service way past the breakfast hours and the chef prepared a breakfast for me , to my hearts desire. The staff was beyond friendly and accommodating throughout my entire stay. This is now my ""go to"" spot in London.",5,2015,04,21
113,"Very nice hotel, Great Location, Great Price","The Kensington Hotel offers a great location, especially if you are coming from the airport.  It is on the same underground line that comes/goes straight to Heathrow.  This is really nice because its a little uncomfortable to change trains if you have much luggage.

The hotel is maybe a 5 minute walk from the South Kensington tube station.

The hotel is very pretty and upscale, nice helpful doorman, very nice sitting areas and restaurant.

Our room was a bit small, but the price was actually excellent for the quality of the hotel and the location, so I was satisfied with the size.  The hotel probably has larger rooms, ours was likely smaller due to the price.

I would love to stay here again if I was in London again.",5,2015,04,21
113,Excellent location with friendly and helpful staff,"Kensington Hotel is located in an area where you can experience residential life but still being very close to well known places of interest. 
Staff is very helpful and friendly and the lounges and dining areas are of very generous size and decorated to make you feel welcomed and pampered.",5,2015,04,21
113,"High Expectations, Exceeded","We agree with all of the positive comments about the staff, ambiance, location, breakfast, room amenities....  This is an intimate, beautiful, friendly, professionally run hotel.  Small touches make a difference:  the Nespresso machine in the room after a long day walking, the nightly chocolates, the heated bathroom floor, exceptionally comfortable bed, fast free WiFi, and comfortable sitting areas. The location is so great and was an unexpected benefit; easy to the S. Kensington Tube which has great access to West End via Piccadilly line, but we loved walking the streets of Chelsea and the river.  
Final shout out to Caroline and the breakfast staff.  
This is a great little hotel, and we will look forward to our next stay.  Also, will look for other Doyle Collection properties based on our experience.",5,2015,04,20
113,Pampered like royalty,"From start to finish in our week at the Kensington, my daughters and I were treated to such a wonderful experience at this delightful hotel.

We love the location and the neighborhood. I/we will return!",5,2015,04,20
113,Amazing,"I am sadly on the train on my way home from this amazing hotel where I have spent my birthday weekend. I have stayed in some wonderful places in the last 10 years, a lot being diamond rated...I put this hotel up there with them.
From the 2nd you are greeted at the door to the minute you leave you have a fabulous time.  The aroma in there is to die for, it hits you and an immediate sense of relaxation pours over you, the whole hotel just says.....relax, chill out, calm, just what you need after busy days seeing the city.
The room... well we were very lucky to be upgraded to a king room and it was fabulous,  the bed was so comfy you didn't want to get up, but you must get up to go down for an amazing breakfast, the food and choice was delicious. 
The bathroom was modern with underfloor heating which was a lovely touch and the shower was great, as for the toiletries,  again to die for, I will be sourcing them when I get home and purchasing as the smell was divine, and it stuck with you all day. 
The staff were all very pleasant and polite however as we were out lots we didn't see many other than the doormen and dining staff. However the final touch on checking out was the offering of bottled water for our journey home! As we had not run anything up on our account so had no bill to settle as breakfast was included they could've just let us leave, but no the gave us water which I thought was a lovely touch. 
Would I recommend .... absolutely. ...would I return... Most definitely.  ",5,2015,04,20
113,Happy couples,"The hotel was just what we expected: a room with a location that can‚Äôt be beat!For the two of us, this was the perfect place to stay.  We walked to 80 percent of what we wanted to see, and the Metro was only five minutes away for when we wanted to travel further. The wifi was outstanding! It was fast enough for us to watch videos and use multiple devices without slowdown. Staff like Isadora and George were the best, They welcomed us personally and even gave us a surprise gift on our birthday trip off in style. 

The hotel‚Äôs best feature is being located in the heart of kensington.

Overall, we could not have had a better experience and we look forward to returning again.",5,2015,04,20
113,Bliss for two weary travellers,"We had been travelling for several days when we arrived at the Kensington. A warm welcome would have been nice, but this was better than warm, I'd say it was toasty!

The staff were attentive without being intrusive. We have stayed before and were given a lovely room - the same one we stayed in last time.  It's room 118 which features wonderful furnishings and has a glorious bathroom.

I'd misplayed my iPhone charger. I mentioned it to the Concierge and quick as a flash, and with no fuss, a charger appeared - with a message to hold on to it for as long as we needed.

The Kensington is very well placed for museums, Brompton Road shops and trendy Chelsea is just down the road.  

We had a very comfortable night's sleep (and an enjoyable nightcap in the bar). Breakfast is a real treat; lots of choice, great food and a friendly team who are eager to serve.

On departure we received a cheery goodbye and an invitation to come and visit soon.  

Our only criticism was the stay wasn't long enough. We will be back and we will be back soon. Thank you.",5,2015,04,19
113,Beautiful hotel with excellent service,"Beautiful hotel, very good service. The rooms were very small but nicely appointed and the lobby and other facilities were perfect.

113,Keep your bathrobe on. Unless...,"The location, a short walk from South Kensington tube station, is great. Gourmet Burger, with their delicious burgers, is right across from the hotel. My room was tiny. The decor is nice, the wifi decent, andthe staff friendly. Except that on three occasions during my four-day stay the cleaning staff barged into my room with little more than a perfunctory knock on the door. The  first time I cried out in shock and covered the crown jewels. The exhibitionists among us might feel at home here; for the rest of us, keep the bathrobe, or at least a towel, near.",3,2015,04,18

113,"Excellent hotel and breakfast, tiny room","A very nice hotel in an excellent location. The lounges are very nice, and even if the hotel is quite big, it gives a boutique hotel feel. The  Continental breakfast is among the best we have ever seen, so for once no real reason to order the full English. When visiting in April it was very good price as well, making this a very nice stay. Only minus was that the room was very tiny, and almost had to climb over the bed to get from one side of the room to the other.",5,2015,04,14
113,Lovely Hotel,"I really enjoyed the Kensington.  I chose it for the location- quiet neighborhood yet close to the tube so I could be almost anywhere in 10 minutes.

113,"A great choice, highly recommended","Stayed at The Kensington for just 1 night on the Family Easter package which included an extra bed in the room, gifts for our daughter and a la carte breakfast which worked out to be good value. The hotel is located very near to both the tube station and museums and a good base to explore London. We found all staff to be meticulously polite and very welcoming which made us feel valued as clients. Our room was clean and comfortable with a compact but stylish shower room en suite supplied with a lovely range of aromatherapy toiletries.  Breakfast was delicious with a hugely varied cold buffet and choice of hot dishes from the menu. Wish we'd been able to stay longer and would definitely return.

It is a very glamorous and beautifully decorated hotel.
My dad had been upgraded to a deluxe room and then later in the day he returned to his fabulous room only to discover the hotel had provided him with a beautiful chocolate cake, champagne and other little treats!   We could not believe this fantastic gesture!
Each member of staff was so attentive and we felt they all took an interest in us as individuals.
Our breakfast was another delight, so many choices, again staff so attentive!
It was an amazing stay in the Kensington and we we would love to return in the future!",5,2015,04,06

We chose the Kensington Hotel mainly for practical reasons, ie the location, but did our homework, as we love to try out a new address each time we head back to London.
The Kensington Hotel is definitly on our top list so far.
The building is beautifully maintained, the interior tasteful in an authentic and high quality way. The staff are all highly professional and forthcoming and all go the extra mile to make you feel welcome.",4,2015,04,05
113,A perfect location,"My son and I spent 4 days at The Kensington in London at the end of march 2015.
We were made to feel welcome from the first moment. The location is perfect, only a few hundred meters from the underground-station South Kensington and with a number of excellent restaurants in the nearest area of the hotel. Our room (superior) was very comfortable, well configured and the service was really excellent.
The hotel itself and the area around the hotel is an oasis of calm to relax from a day in the city of London.Great and fast WIFI.",5,2015,04,05
113,Excellent service,"Everyone who works in this hotel was attentive, friendly and seemed genuinely interested in making sure we had a nice stay.

We stayed with our 20 month old over Easter and they even gave him a teddy bear and Easter egg. They also had a cot set up for him on arrival without needing to ask.

The breakfast is really nice and the hot food was all cooked to order which I found much nicer than hot buffet.

Will stay here again next time we are in London as it was close to the south Kensington underground and there were nice restaurants nearby.",5,2015,04,05
113,1st Class,The staff do a wonderful job of making you feel welcome. They're very warm and friendly.  I loved my room and the food quality was superb.  The location was ideal for my purposes and the sauna was very relaxing.,5,2015,04,01
113,Excellent Location,"We recently spent four days at The Kensington Hotel in London.  The location is very good and there are a number of excellent restaurants in the area.
When we reserved our room we reserved a superior room.  The room we received was elf sized even by London standards cramped and cheaply furnished.  The bathroom also was tiny but functional.  In short the room a let down, uncomfortable and did not feel or appear to be of the quality we had reserved.  But apparently it was as the person at the front desk indicated that the next level of room down was ""especially cozy"". That said our stay was made enjoyable by the staff primarily the concierge.
The common areas are quite nice and the breakfast was excellent three of the four days we were there.  We tried lunch at the hotel one day and were disappointed.  An evening sandwich was fair . 
All in all the stay was satisfactory but one can probably do better.  The saving grace is the neighborhood and the excellent restaurants (particularly Indian such as Thalia) in the area.",3,2015,04,01
113,A wonderful Saturday,"My wife and I attended the same family event as reviewed by Carol G. We found the hotel to be something of a 'haven of tranquillity' at what was a very busy time for us. From the greeting at the door, by the porter, to the farewell from reception as we checked out we were made to feel welcome. The room was very well equipped with the latest technical gadgetry and was very comfortable. Room service was very obliging with fresh milk and extra sugar, although perhaps more sugar, in the first place, would have been appreciated. Service at both our family dinner and breakfast the following morning was exemplary. The general areas are well appointed so, for a longer stay, there is lots of pleasant space to sit and relax perhaps after visiting the nearby museums in the heart of Kensington.",5,2015,03,31
113,Wonderful venue,We used the hotel for a special family event and so had a room set aside in the restaurant for a group party.  The organisation was impeccable and everything worked brilliantly.  The staff were attentive but not intrusive and nothing was too much trouble for them.  Food was excellent.  Those of us lucky enough to stay overnight enjoyed the well equipped and comfortable rooms.,5,2015,03,30
113,Fantastic for everything,"Had a fabulous 2 night stay, room perfect, breakfast delicious, staff excellent, Especially Agnes. It has a perfect location, the business room had everything. Used the pool, steam room and sauna which were immaculate.",5,2015,03,27
113,Great Hotel,"We stayed at the hotel on a recent visit to the Albert Hall. It is perfectly located for all the facilities in Kensington and Knightsbridge. We had a lovely first floor room overlooking the street, but very quiet at the same time. Staff were all very friendly and obliging.Weould definitely stay there again.",5,2015,03,26
113,Wonderful Honeymoon Hotel!!,"This is a great hotel in a excellent location. It is walking distance to the tube, museums, and hyde park.  But what sets this hotel apart from others is their wonderful staff.  Every staff member goes out of their way to make your stay special.  It was our honeymoon and they surprised us with champaign and rose petals on our bed. Every staff member knew our name and greeted us with a smile.  If we needed anything they went out of their way to help us and did it with a smile.",4,2015,03,25
113,A Wonderful Experience,"My wife and I stayed at The Kensington Hotel while visiting our daughter, who is studying abroad for the semester.  The staff are extremely friendly and helpful.  Our room (a King Deluxe), though a bit small by U.S. standards, was immaculate, very comfortable and well appointed.  The hotel is located in the heart of South Kensington and is walking distance to the Underground (Piccadilly Line), numerous shops and restaurants.  We enjoyed our stay very much and would recommend this hotel to anyone.  If you're there over a weekend, you should try the Sunday brunch by the fireplace.  Very nice indeed.",5,2015,03,23
113,Great Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the hotel on 21st March as we were going to a performance at the RoyalAlbert Hall. The hotels is conveniently situated for all the major attractions,museum,shops and restaurants. On arrival we were met by an extremely friendly receptionist who was very helpful. Although we arrived early we were allowed to leave our cases whilst we went out.On our return we were given the keys to em 102 which was lovely and comfortabl. The lounge had two log fires burning and was very cos in the evening. The breakfast was also very good. The hotel is complimented by the staff who are all. Very friendly and service is excellent We will definitely return soon..",5,2015,03,23
113,An absolutely perfect hotel in South Kensington,"We stayed at the Kensington just last week, with a son and daughter in law and their two young girls. When my husband and I arrived in the early am, the desk clerk offered us a room ""to rest"" because our own wasn't yet ready. How nice was that! I can't say enough good things about this lovely place. The staff was delightful, the desk pesonnel, the doormen, the waiters and bartender, the concierge - just warm and friendly and helpful with any little thing. The rooms were elegant, plenty roomy. We had one meal in the dining room which actually offered us the best fish and chips we had anywhere, the breakfast is plentiful, and the Afternoon Tea is not to be missed. Part of the charm of the hotel is the public rooms (including the dining areas) which are on the ground floor and hence  very bright and - when we were there anyway - sunny. There is a French patisserie around the corner, restaurants, a grocery, Boots chemist, anything you might need, and it's a very short walk to Kensington Gardens. Also to the Victoria and Albert Museum, and teh Natural History Museum. The area is busy but not frantic, like in the middle of town. And the South Kensington tube is a couple of blocks away, very convenient.
Everything about the Kensington is warm and pleasant and welcoming, and I wish I were there right this minute, instead of in NJ, where it is - yet again - snowing.
Stay at the Kensington if you possibly can.
PS great free wi fi.",5,2015,03,20
113,They need to try harder for the price,"We all know hotels are costly beyond reason in London .... this one is no different. I was wondering if the rooms actually were ""legal "" in size. Is there a minimum size a room or bathroom need to be to sell at the price they charge ?. There is no space for anything , no place for a suitcase , two people to pass . The bathroom had one unique feature in that you could use the toilet, brush your teeth and wash your hair all at the same time ....now how handy is that ? The bed was comfy though the decor pleasant , but it was unreasonably tight . In fact what this establishment should have done when it refurbished was make two rooms into one and then feel ok about charging about 300 euros a night for a cupboard and breakfast. I would be very embarrassed if I worked the reception in this hotel.",3,2015,03,20
113,An Oasis of Calm,"From the moment you put your foot on the first step you receive a great welcome and it continues when you get to inside, it even smells fab! Our room was great  and the bed was really comfy. I loved the under floor heating in the bathroom too. It is only a few minutile walk  to them tube, which is on the circle, district and Piccadilly lines, which means you anget to most place really easily. Plenty of places to eat and drinks nearby troops.",5,2015,03,18
113,Townhouse Treat,"Staff offered us a lovely seating  table looking directly on to the queensgate avenue .Lovely choice of everything, replenished all the time., it's the easy-going charm of the lounge staff George who really make the hotel a beautiful gem with his outstanding persona. A brilliant day all round.
It was nice to have been offered a choice of where to seat...the little things that make a quintessentially English experience such a lovely treat. Overall a very extraordinary experience.",5,2015,03,18
113,Good location,"We stayed at this nice hotel at a very good location near the Albert and Victoria Museum, the Natural History Museum, Royal Albert Hall and Kensington Gardens. Nice rooms and delicious breakfast; the only caveat being that there was no formal ""dining room"" and we had to eat our breakfast on sofas with small tables.. somewhat uncomfortable. 
A public bicycle rent station is just in front of the hotel.
When we stayed there, we had some problems with the telephone in our room, but this was fixed by the staff.",4,2015,03,18
113,Birthday treat,"Having dined in the hotel several times my wife expressed a desire to stay overnight so for her birthday I booked it. Everything about this hotel exudes luxury. The only slight detraction compared with previous dining experiences was the rather strident and loud music which, at times, made conversation difficult. Everything else was just perfect.
",5,2015,03,17
113,Fantastic hotel,"The Kensington Hotel is a very nice hotel. I stayed there for 2 nights with my 14 year old daugther. We both loved it! The staff at the Kensington Hotel is very helpfull, the breakfast is fantastic and the rooms are beautifull. The area √≠s perfect for dining. Just around the corner from the hotel you can eat Italien, Japanese, Indian and so much more. With only 5 min. to the Tube (South Kensington) you can reach the best shopping in the World within 10 minuts. ",5,2015,03,16
113,warm and welcoming but...,"We spent 1 night here after a rather full day of sight seeing. We were greeted by tasteful decor, a scented lobby and welcoming staff. Our room was on the 3rd floor. it was compact and cosy and looked out onto the street. Not far from South Kensington tube with local shops nearby. Harrods is also walkable from here. Struggled a bit with the constant squeaky floorboards from the room above but thankfully it didn't disturb our sleep. We thought we had booked a full breakfast but this wasn't offered the next morning, so ended using the continental option, this was a bit disappointing but not enough to ruin out stay. It would have been useful if the staff could've explained how breakfast was served beforehand.",4,2015,03,16
113,In this hotel I had the feeling to be at home,"The location is perfect, at a walk from Albert and Victoria Museum, It is a human warm luxury 5 star hotel, with different room designed from classic 5 stars one to very modern design. What I like is the feeling to be at home, very free to take as you want your breakfast, and the very attentive and friendly staff. The owners of this hotel add a personal touch with modern art and interesting antics collected from their travel around the world.

My room quite large with a lage Louis XVI desk very impressive, top quality bed and a marvellous bathroom, not so common : a old style bath (""sabot"") with pleinty of Aromatherapy products, a separate italian shower and separate toilet. Really Nice.

The breakfast is cosy, you can take a quick one (coffee and croissant) or to enjoy a small top quality buffet with an elegant services in the main salon. You feel at home without protocol but elegance.

The night the arty design bar is quite busy, with really nice cocktails.",5,2015,03,15
113,What a lovely hotel in London,"The Kensington Hotel is a fantastic place to stay in London. We selected it based on trip advisor rating and the fct that it's used by Abercrombie & Kent. We were not disappointed!

The staff was more than helpful: service couldn't have been better. We even were helped to a different room to better accommodate our infant. The manager was so great and considered our needs very well. 

Located near great restaurant and a quick walk to the Underground, I would absolutely stay here again!

Cheers!",5,2015,03,14
113,Good London Hotel,"Rooms are not spacious, but generally comfortable and quiet. Friendly staff and a rather relaxed atmosphere for a London-hotel. Internet works well, and there is a good gym and a nice reception / dining area. Pleasant neighborhood with good resturants and cafes.",4,2015,03,13
113,Beautiful refined hotel.,"Lovely elegant hotel, very helpful staff.
When we arrived our room was very small, but after telling them, we were moved to a much bigger one, without any fuss.
The afternoon tea was divine, so overall a lovely experience.",5,2015,03,11
113,Child friendly and great location,"I chose this hotel because they allow a family of 5 (3 young children) to stay in one room. It went well beyond my expectations. The room was plenty large enough, clean and very comfortable. We ate breakfast and dinner in the restaurant, the food was delicious and had a great choice for adults and children. The staff were welcoming and friendly with nothing being too much trouble. This is a perfect location for visiting the museums or parks in the immediate area and is only a 10 minute tube ride from central London. We will definitely be back and I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2015,03,09
113,Loved it ,"Friendly staff, very helpful. Beautiful building, great location, near tube station, comfortable beds, gorgeous room, wish I could afford to stay more often! Didn't use bar or restaurant, maybe next time... ",5,2015,03,08
113,Fabulous Property - Excellent Customer Service,"Location/Price:  I booked this hotel as part of my GHA Discovery membership.  London is one of the most expensive cities in the world - so, yes, it is on the expensive side.  But it is on par with similar class of hotels.  The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea is an upper class neighborhood (comparable to New York's upper East side) near museums and shopping.  It is a 5 minute walk to the South Kensington Tube station which takes you to LHR on the Picadilly Line.

Customer Service:  Outstanding customer service from start to finish.  Fast replies to emails, etc.  I want to give a special shout out to Michael Buckingham, Assistant Head Concierge, who arranged a last minute driver/car service booking for me from LHR.  Everything went off without a hitch, the driver was waiting for me when I cleared customs.  A really nice indulgence after being delayed over 12 hours stateside.  The front desk staff was also top notch, offering to let me change my room if I found it too noisy (I didn't) because I was on the 1st floor.

Room:  I booked a ""Superior"" Room with 1 Queen bed.  The room was above average size for a European single, with a table and chair.  Slippers and turn down service was provided.  Bed was comfortable and I slept great.  The decor was tasteful and updated.  Entire room was very clean.  The bathroom was outstanding!  A luxurious rain-head shower and temperature controlled hot water.  The bathroom was also LARGE, with plenty of counter space and a make-up mirror.  As a GHA Discovery member I received complimentary bottles of still and sparkling water waiting for me in my room as well as newspaper delivery in the morning.

Lounge/Bar:  After my late arrival I had a dinner and wine in one of the LOVELY lounges on the ground floor off of the bar area.  The service was prompt and courteous and the food was excellent.  I enjoyed the fire places and quiet atmosphere. 

Room Service:  I ordered a coffee service with toast brought to my room in the morning so I could leisurely enjoy the room until close to check out (which is at noon).  Service was prompt.

Overall:  I highly recommend this hotel.  I would definitely stay here again.  I regret that I only had 1 night before transferring to another hotel as part of a group booking.",5,2015,03,05
113,Outstanding,"We stayed with our 2 children over a weekend in February. The Staff were outstanding at all times, the room was really great - everything at hand. The location in London is perfect - close to ALL modes of transport and central to nightlife, shopping etc.,
Will be back and will tell all my friends about it too. Breakfast was really great and they make the BEST Martini's in the bar at night!",5,2015,03,02
113,Mixed sensations,"The good: The hotel is very well located (near the tube and bus stops) and a short walk to the museums located in South Kensington. The decoration is really nice and makes you feel welcome. The staff at the bar and at the restaurant were exceptional (quick and kind).

The bad:
Booked a superior room with a queen bed ad was given a tiny room with a twin bed. I called reception to enquire about this issue and they were quick dispatching me, making me feel a bit stupid.

I'm not sure if I will come back to the hotel. Although it is well decorated, the rooms are really small and let you down a bit.",3,2015,02,26
113,Okay stay but won't be in a hurry to return.  ,First impressions of this hotel were nice. Staff were pleasant and the room was clean. However glad we took advantage of a special offer for the largest room type as we would have been very disappointed had we paid full price. Room was still small for the price and the air conditioning unit made a loud hum all night. Okay stay but won't be in a hurry to return. ,3,2015,02,25
113,superb stay wish we had booked for longer,"We've spent just a couple of days in this hotel but we definitely should have stayed longer. The hotel is well equipped with modern facilities and extremely cosy. It's really close to Chelsea football stadium but in a quiet neighbourhood. The bikes worked well for a quick trip down the road and over to Hyde park for a lovely cycling. The staff are all amazing here to mention a few like Ronnie, George and many others . We highly recommend this charming hotel.",5,2015,02,25
113,great staff,"We had great stay of 2 nights at the kensington The hotel is exactly as described and is in an ideal location in a quiet residential street yet with most of London attractions easily accessible (natural history museum,royal albert hall, harrods, and hyde park etc . it was relaxing, quiet, spacious, and had everything we needed. thanks to everyone and special mention to George, Valentina and alessandro.",5,2015,02,24
113,Very happy about this booking,"We have chosen to spend our 5th anniversary w-e at Kensington hotel - as regulars in London we knew we loved the area but was our first time in this hotel. We were very happy about our one night stay. Everybody was very friendly and made our stay special. We had a nice room with a lot of light. The concierge managed to book us in for dinner at Hakasan (which is quite a feat for a last minute booking). We also were delighted by some pastries and macaroons as a surprise for our anniversary with some drinks offered at the bar of the hotel ( a great place to relax next to the open fire - sitting in a nice piece of furniture).
We also had breakfast the next morning and our waiter Georges made everything possible to make us feel good and welcome (try the selection of fresh juices!)
Our stay was very special and the staff really did a great job on it ! We recommend the place and will definitely be back",5,2015,02,23
113,home away from home,"Stayed here and it was absolutely amazing!!! The hotel looks exactly as you see in the pictures. It's stylish and cozy at the same time. Comfy queen size bed, huge TV, mini bar fridge etc. Everything you need!! All staff were genuine, funny and nice. I loved to chat with everyone and moreover they made sure you had everything you need and always available to help you. At my arrival, they helped me with my huge suitcase which was so thoughtful!!
I could write pages and pages about this place, but in short, I am sure you cannot find another hotel as cozy, spacious and with the friendliest staff that I have ever encountered. I was so lucky to find my new home away from home and it will surely be my choice every time I go to London",5,2015,02,23
113,home sweet hotel,"It was a really nice stay me and my boyfriend stayed here and it was actually like being at home and, to start off The location made this stay feel like a hidden gem or best kept secret and it‚Äôs really close to the center and the bus or metro stop just near the hotel. The staff superb, friendly, informative and very welcoming. The hotel was beautiful and the location ideal.. the cafe's, bakery and shops on the brompton street were fab, The description was completely accurate. The neighborhood was so interesting and convenient. We will definitely return and wouldn't hesitate to recommend to friends Really great experience all round. I would like to heartily recommend this hotel",5,2015,02,23
113,Another satisfied stay,"I can highly recommend the kensington hotel. The hotel is full of character, small but perfect. Everything was available for our comfort including a large supply of towels and excellent central heating. The location can't be faulted being sited in a charming shopping and signature restaurant precinct close to transport. Staff were wonderful , polite,generous and couldn't do enough for us; they were waiting to meet us and show us around the hotel. I would definitely stay at the kensington if I travel to london again.",5,2015,02,23
113,no place like my kensington hotel home,"it was really nice staying here , me and my boyfriend had a wonderful time and it felt like we were at home with our closest friends as the staff here are super friendly. it's located really close to the metro and there were bikes if you fancy a ride though the city in style. Special mention to Alessandro & George who were really pleasant to chat with. what a spectacular and exhilarating experience and we would be honoured to come back in the near future.",5,2015,02,22
113,Wonderful Stay,"Stayed at this wonderful little hotel for a couple of nights while visiting family in London.  The common areas and restaurant are quite nice.  Roaring fireplaces juxtaposed with a modern vibe.  Think swank fused with old English charm.  The rooms are small, but remember where you are.  I strongly recommend a room facing back in order to avoid some considerable street noise in the front.  But what really sets this hotel apart is the exceptional staff.  To a person polite and willing to help.  Walking distance to the museums as well.",4,2015,02,22
113,Amazing and memorable stay! Would never stay elsewhere,"My husband and I planned to stay in London one night before heading back to Florida on our honeymoon. My only complaint is that we didn't stay longer!! The hotel is absolutely amazing, excellent service, wonderful location and spacious. The staff especially really rolled out the red carpet. Michael at concierge is truly amazing and really made us feel so special. He went so out of his way to make us feel so special and I will never forget this stay!! Michael is amazing and you should stay here! ",5,2015,02,21
113,Absolutely Awesome,"Staff were very pleasant and helpful especiallly  George who thought the best interests of  us. We really appreciate all his help . The hotel is spaceous and in good locations, rooms are very neat and clean. The neighborhood is perfect, shops, cafe¬¥s, bus stop very close to the hotel  and underground few minutes of walkingThere is everything you need for a comfortable stay! I would recommend this hotel to everyone!",5,2015,02,21
113,I'm reticent,"...to write a review lest I have trouble booking a room. This is  home away from home when I'm in London for business, the regular rooms are small but extremely well appointed, the staff are great, and the location is just a few steps from two tube stations and dozens of dining options.",5,2015,02,20
113,Little bit...,"The Kensington has a good staff. Everyone was nice and professional, the kitchen and the breakfast appropriate for the Hotel. We had a room on the 4th floor, too small for the price however. Few particular attention should be take on the doors profiles of the rooms, full of old dust.
Nothing else.",3,2015,02,20
113,perfect afternoon tea in stunning Kensington :),"over valentines weekend my partner and I booked afternoon tea at the Kensington.  The tea was perfect, food was delicious and there was lots of choice too!!  The staff at the hotel were very friendly and very interested in taking time to chat with us about our weekend,  where we were staying and what we had planned.  The room in which we had tea was decorated beautifully and we felt very spoiled throughout our visit.  Thank you all so much, we will be recommending you to others and will hopefully return again soon :)",5,2015,02,18
113,Brilliant Service In a Great Part of London,"Stayed three nights in The Kensington. The area is wonderful and easily commutable to London sights.
The hotel is excellent as the rooms are spacious and clean. The bar is great but the service I think is exceptional from the bar to the front desk. Second time here and will not be our last. The main down side I think is the cost of the breakfast which when your spending a few hundred a night on a room, is a bit tight for a continental at ¬£16 per head. We went up the main road towards Harrods and got a much better breakfast and deal on the high street.

Highly recommend The Kensington",5,2015,02,18
113,Excellent!,"My boyfriend made me the happiest girl by taking me to this hotel! We were treated like royalty. The room looked fabulous and had everything you could imagine. It also had a spa with a swimming pool, jacuzzi, steam rooms and sauna's and it was not over-crowded. I would highly recommend this hotel! ‚ù§Ô∏è",5,2015,02,16
113,Happy with the kensington,"After spending my weekend here together with my patner, I must say the staff went above and beyond like George in the morning whenever we had breakfast. The room was well ventilated and cosy and we had a fabulous stay. I highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2015,02,15
113,tea with friends,"I Went to this hotel one week ago and I think it is the best afternoon tea I have had in London. The servers Said & George were professionally attentive while anticpating our  needs The sandwiches were delicious with variety of flavours,and I appreciated the fact that we could chose the gluten free afternoon tea as I‚Äôm not really keen on bread,  the raising scones,cakes,pastries very pretty too.
Overall I was impressed and with the standards of service mostly and the hotel offers more value for money.",5,2015,02,15
113,Exceptionally friendly staff!,"If it could be possible to give more than five stars, I definitely would! Great location, lovely hotel! We were amazed by the fantastic service and all the friendliness we received during our stay. My husband had his 30th birthday during our visit and the hotel arranged small surprises for us which was very lovely!

The room was amazing and spacious (we were at the top floor) and the common areas are really nicely decorated. And, I cannot stress this enough, the staff is amazing! You'll feel very welcome and they will do anything to make your stay even more pleasurable.

We will definitely be back!",5,2015,02,13
113,Excellent service and common areas / tiny rooms,"The service at the Kensington is fantastic: they do everything they can to make sure you have a great stay. They'll remember your name, what you like to drink, and will help with any questions or needs you might have. The common areas are really nice and the food in the restaurant is excellent (especially the scallops stater and the crab/asparagus starter). It is also in a very convenient area that is easy to get to with nice pubs and restaurants around (and very near to museums). The only down side is the rooms themselves. My room was so small that I didn't even have a place to eat breakfast the one morning I did room service. There were no drawers to unpack your clothes in and I had to stand at a strange angle to fit in the tiny shower stall. Despite that, I look forward to my next stay.",4,2015,02,12
113,A True Gem!,"If there's anything to be said about consistency it's The Kensington! A hotel that truly understands the concept of hospitality. This property is indeed a gem, and what truly makes it shine is the staff and service delivery. I could write a novel, but will keep it short and sweet by saying a huge thanks to Frits the GM and the team for creating the most pleasurable stays for my trips to London and you are highly recommended! 

Best regards,

Kelly Kawonza(Fahrenheit Hospitality, Lagos, Nigeria)",5,2015,02,12
113,Still charming,"There is a really lovely ambience to this hotel. It is understated but the feel of it is lovely. THe rooms at the bottom end of the price range are small but certainly adequate, the bathrooms tiny but well appointed and the public spaces are beautifully laid out and designed. The staff are friendly and helpful and the breakfast is very good indeed. Negatives include the absence of a bath which did not affect me at all but if you want / need a bath make sure to get a bigger room. I will stay here again simply because I like it, it feels friendly and warm and I have yet to find a hotel in London which makes me feel this welcome.",5,2015,02,11
113,Absolutely Fabulous,"We stayed in the Kensington Hotel on the 7th Feb 2015 and I have to say we both loved this hotel and we intend to return. We live just outside London so this was just a romantic little break for us. Its ideally located a few minutes walk from South Kensington station and this area has a lovely feel to it. The hotel itself is very nice , modern bar, very comfortable reception areas and a lovely spacious bedroom, with fabulous touches including chocolates , water and fruit. We were also given a complimenary glass of Moet which was a lovely extra touch. The service in the kensington Hotel  is outstanding .The staff are so friendly and hospitable at all times and that includes the Porters, Receptionist, and the bar and restuarant staff. I feel maybe as its Irish owned there is that extra bit of warmth to the hotel that you don't get in too many hotels in London. We intend to return very soon. Highly Recommended",5,2015,02,10
113,pleased with service,"it was our first experience with a luxury hotel in kensington london, and overall we are satisfied.. We spent a pleasant weekend at this hotel. It is well situated in a quiet residential area only a few steps away Small boutique shops and two supermarkets are within walking distance, as is harrods,harvey nichols, serpents, natural history museum,hyde park plus other attractions. we met George at the restaurant and he suggested us that we should try the famous cream tea with crumbling scones,  ‚Äì thank you! On check out Otabek took our luggage in the hotel backroom for a few hours, which was a convenience enormously.",5,2015,02,09
113,Wonderful location,"We spent five nights at the Kensington Hotel. We loved the location. It only takes a few minutes to walk to the South Kensington underground station. Also, we were very close to the museums.The hotel is in a very safe location and there are many restaurants and shops nearby. The property is lovely, well appointed and maintained,  and the staff very accommodating. Martyn was especially helpful and friendly. We did not eat in the restaurant but did have food in the lobby bar and it was excellent. Now to the negatives of this hotel. Our superior room was very small. The only drawer space for clothing was the drawers in the bedside tables. There was really no place to stash luggage and there was only about 18 inches of space for hanging clothes. The bathroom was not small; it was tiny. I mean TINY. There is no soundproofing, so there was alot of noise from adjacent rooms and from the hall. Wi-Fi is poor. If you need it for business, you will probably be disappointed. I was only checking websites for restaurants, etc. and email from home, but it still frustrated me. All in all, though, I think we would stay there again because of the location and the staff, but I'd be open to other properties in the area before booking again.",4,2015,02,05
113,one classy hotel,"The hotel had a private mansion choice of design after unpacking and shower before heading out for our first day. we chose to have the have the buffet breakfast in the hotel and also every morning before stepping out; melting in the mouth croissants,freshly made green juice & delicious hot chocolates,meats etc
 
Having the hot drinks and lots of pastries available when we got back from our day out was a treat. We would come back, have an afternoon tea or a glass of champagne and unwind from the day before going up to the room. It was a very nice touch. Breakfast was everything you could need and/or want to get your day started.
 The staff here can‚Äôt be  be outmatched for me as far as my experience goes with london hotels which is why I also had to write this review
. We also never heard the traffic Mind you the hotel is near two streets and we preferred the wallpaper of the room all around for a london hotel room it was large, a big plus inside was the closet we had nice drawers,nespresso machines, mini bar  The room was fine and had everything you needed and the space to put everything we needed, every day there was another treat in the room after a long day of walking around ,
 
I highly recommend the place to all.",5,2015,02,05
113,Just superb all round,"Stayed for 7 nights and didn't want to leave! Rooms were luxurious and quiet, hotel very relaxed but sophisticated at the same time. A real gem in South Kensington. Wifi was excellent and the chocolates on the pillow each night even better!",5,2015,02,04
113,Stunning hotel...,"I stayed at The Kensington hotel on Saturday night as part of a birthday celebration  and this hotel made my weekend.

Not only is it a beautiful hotel in a great location but the hotel staff were so friendly  and attentive.

The suite we stayed in was outstanding and if you are looking for somewhere to stay within London, then I'd wholly  recommend spending  that little extra to stay here in one of their suites.

I also have to say a special thank you to their Manager Fritz for making my weekend with my fiance so special.",5,2015,02,04
113,Heaven on Earth!,"To be brief, The Kensington Hotel is amazing!! I have never felt so at home before and I grew up in ‚ÄúThe South‚Äù y‚Äôall, where hospitality and graciousness is a way of life. Our entire experience from the moment we set foot in the door was was excellent and we love the neighborhood. I highly recommend anyone visiting London to stay at The Kensington Hotel. It is a real treat.",5,2015,01,29
113,Best kept secret,"Stayed in this delightful and charming hotel for a couple of nights, whilst on a visit to london to see other friends. The whole experience was great from start to end. Reception  was well decorated with red velvet feel and there were free apples for anyone staying inside the hotel and while I was there the staff were pleasant and friendly at all times.Special mentions to Amy, George and Vincent. It was also easy to find; it was very clean and just what I had expected from the website.",5,2015,01,29
113,An elegant hotel with a personal touch,"The Kensington Hotel is elegant yet homely and unlike other luxury hotels in London remains small enough to provide a personalised service. Initially booked a standard room which was quite small but what you would expect from a central London hotel. Upgraded to a deluxe room which was spacious, tastefully presented with a roomy modern bathroom. As a single traveller, the public lounges were inviting and cosy.
 
This was the last leg of an arduous business trip having travelled to London via the US, via Australia. Having literally dropped my bags at reception when I arrived and headed to the office, special thanks to George who assisted me in changing rooms and Otabek who was always on hand to help. I did not encounter a staff member who did not go over and above to make my stay as comfortable as is possible.
 
I hope to be back in London in the next few months and without question will be saying at the Kensington.",5,2015,01,28
113,Hotel superbe,"Considered that we are in London (so very expensive prices for very small rooms) everything was perfect! Personnel very kind, room very clean and very well equipped, fitness room well equipped too! Location was not ideal for me, but it's Kensington!",5,2015,01,28
113,Charming Hotel,"The Kensington Hotel is a charming and beautiful hotel in heart of South Kensington, a 2 minute stroll from the Underground station. We arrived after 24 hours of travel to find we had been upgraded to two connected rooms (original booking was Family room) which was fantastic given we had two teenage children. Also our room was ready on arrival at 9am which allowed us to relax and freshen up before heading out for the day. All the staff on arrival and during our stay, were very helpful and friendly and nothing was too much to ask. Concierge provided great directions and suggestions for our needs and were always friendly on our return to the hotel. Being our first trip to London I couldn't have been happier with the Kensington Hotel, the rooms were well furnished and beds were large and comfy. We didn't eat in the Hotel, as there was many restaurants conveniently located nearby. Great location, great service, great Hotel and I would definitely stay there again when in London. If staying in Kensington definitely consider this hotel !",5,2015,01,28
113,Great location and full of English charm,"I had stayed at this hotel a few years ago, but was pleasantly surprised by how much it had changed for the better. 
Friendly staff, quality furnishings and sophisticated decor. Comfy beds, great location, great food in the restaurant, I could go on and on....

Highly recommended!",5,2015,01,27
113,Elegant hotel ,"An elegant hotel in a wonderful neighbourhood. The museums are just 10 minutes away and the underground is easily accessible. The entire hotel is a typical town house with artefacts and fire places in the restaurant. The staff were very welcoming, and efficient . The rooms were comfortable and overall we had a great stay. We will be back in future? ",5,2015,01,27
113,Poor comfort - very disappointed,"Two nights stay with husband and 2 years old kids booked a superior room. Cot option was ticked at website reservation plus I called the hotel to reconfirm the cot, but it was not in the reservation at check-in time; however it had been set up very quickly after checking in.
Room 116 was a disaster. the room is not isolated at all, so our stay in January was at 15 degrees Celsius or less in the room. I had to keeep my pullover for sleeping and our young boy had to stay between us in the queen size bed for not being cold. At midnight I was awaken by the loud music downstairs. Couldn't sleep with cold and noise. I complained at 1am and we had been moved to another room, thanks to Sultan who has been very helpful.
Room 233 was much better but much smaller. on the next day we had been asked if we wanted to move to a bigger room, but I was tired of moving my staff from one room to an other so we stayed in 233.
Breakfast service on sat was fine but on sunday morning we had been very badly served and I got angry again. Overall: bad experience for a week-end in London.
One thing that I found good was the service in response to problems. And many thanks to Sultan for his kindness and efficiency.",2,2015,01,26
113,Delightful,"we arrived on Boxing Day after the overnight flight from the USA and arrived via the underground as the Heathrow express was out of service for the weekend.  Fortunately the hotel is right on the Piccadilly line a few short blocks from the station.  The hotel staff was welcoming and helpful and made us feel at home. Our room on the top floor, while small was well appointed and the bath -had a marvelous soaking tub-as well as heated floors!! Quite a treat on a wintry morning!
The hotel is well situated for shopping and sightseeing and the lobby bar offers wonderful drinks by the fire!  The Kensington is quite a treat!!",5,2015,01,25
113,Best stay,"Our London holiday was an amazing one, we caught the train to south kensington tube station to fantastic Kensington hotel and Location was excellent easy to catch buses, trains and the local area has many interesting shops particularly luxury shoe stores and. This hotel provides a comfortable oasis to rest, recuperate and contemplate. Michael welcomed us and was available to help us with his  experience and knowledge of the area. 
 It is as charming as in the photos and perfect for couples and well furnished lounge with books and free newspapers in various languages, also special mention to George who was delightful and served us coffee,in house made fresh juices and snacks. We had just been to chelsea and other famous gastropub walking and the neighbourhood is really pleasant. Overall very happy with the stay",5,2015,01,24
113,Brilliant kensington,"The hotel is beautiful, situated right up against queensgate street, all staff were gracious and awesome especially George he was fantastic! Our room was comfortable with nespresso machine, extra amenities and everything that we needed was provided for. We would be so happy to stay here again. ",5,2015,01,24
113,"Lovely Hotel, Great Location, Friendly Staff","Stayed over the Christmas Holidays and had a wonderful time.  The staff is so kind, attentive and pleasant.  The location is wonderful, the V&A, Harrods, Chelsea, Museum of Natural History and Kensignton Park  and the South Ken tube are all walking distance!  It's also a great value. The concierge Michael is so helpful!  ",5,2015,01,23
113,wonderful,"Great hotel in a perfect location! 5 min walking distance from south kensington tube station 
George and his colleagues were very helpful and everyone was great at their jobs & every time we needed anything... no request was too big or too small.
 The area is nice and you are connected to every part of London easily by tube it‚Äôs near Hyde Park and very close to Notting Hill for portobello market and westfield shopping mall 
I would definitely recommend this hotel fully.",5,2015,01,23
113,"""THE"" Kensington Hotel","Where do I start?! This hotel is really excellent.  It has everything from brilliant location in one of London's most prestigious addresses to the Albert and Victoria museum just around the corner to a tube station 5 minutes from reception, to sheer elegance.  Visiting London can be tiring, in a good way that is as there is so much to see and do, so at the end of a long day of shopping or visiting the many tourist attractions what you need is to relax.  The atmosphere in the Kensington Hotel is very comforting and relaxing.  There is a quiet professionalism about the staff that makes you feel welcome and very special.  The rooms are elegantly decorated (if a bit small) and the beds are very comfortable. We had a small hiccup in our room which was dealt with quickly and quietly and Amy was very helpful in that regard. We found this hotel to be one of the best we have stayed in and would put it up there with Fitzpatricks on Lexington in New York.  It is pricey but we felt that every penny of what we spent was well worth it.  If you are ""doing"" London and want to do it in style then pay the extra and stay at the best hotel in Kensington, THE Kensington!",5,2015,01,22
113,Supreme comfort,"Exceptional customer service, amazing room, very comfortable lounge area. Sitting between the relaxing fireplace and the beautifully arranged Christmas tree made my Christmas even more special. I definitely recommend this hotel and I will surely visit again.",5,2015,01,22
113,Perfect,"Hotel is in a fantastic area of kensington Close to many subway stops and some great eating establishments. The hotel is compact and beautifully fit out. And certainly warm and cozy! Staff a great and attended to any requests we had, usually at it‚Äôs latest the following day depending on the request. Would love to come back! Many thanks to Alessandro, George, Elisa(Reception) and everyone.",5,2015,01,21
113,Perfection,"The Kensington is a truly unique  boutique hotel perfect for both a work or pleasure related stay. It has an excellent family run atmosphere, tastefully decorated and architectured. Whether is business or a romantic break you require it ticks all the boxes in a special way. The restaurant is fabulous and stands up in its own right as a dining venue whether as a guest or visitor. It is absolutely worth visiting in its own right",5,2015,01,21
113,Kensington Hotel,"What a lovely and perfect hotel in a classic, West London neighborhood. The location is perfect. The rooms are fantastic in British aesthetic, wonderful food and lounge area for meet and greets, and an overall elegant, urban and sophisticated feel. Each room is unique and distinct in style, a breath of fresh air from many modern hotels. The staff is very friendly. The gym is extensive and immaculate. And, you wake up in London. I will absolutely be staying here again.",5,2015,01,20
113,"The Kensington Hotel, our favourite London Hotel","We have visited The Kensington 7 or 8 times, in last 2 year's. On every occasion it has excelled our expectations. The hotel is tasteful, the staff are friendly and customer service excellent! The Aubrey Bar and Restaurant provides wonderful food, with great surroundings! We will return ASAP. ",5,2015,01,19
113,Above and beyond service...,"I arrived in London with my Mum. Her first time to Europe and we had just come from an overnight in Dubai where we had to share a bed due to the hotel having given away our twin room (never stay at Movenpick ever again!).

The staff at the Kensington moved heaven and earth despite having no twin rooms- mix up with our travel agent- gave me a room of my own at no additional charge to ensure we were comfortable, then moved us to the twin room that we had booked the next day. 

The rooms were fabulous- breakfast was complimentary and we were also issued with cards for complimentary champagne.

Could not have had a better experience and Ill be trying to get back to London to stay there again ASAP! :)",5,2015,01,19
113,exquisite stay in south kensington,"Wonderful hotel and location. Many train lines in the area - the closest was less than a min walk from the hotel, Plenty of places to go out and shop. Staff were always available and attentive and really stretched to make the stay comfortable and smooth. This was very valuable and appreciated Most hotels in london are not so guest savvy having an attentive staff is something I recommend checking when choosing a place to stay.",5,2015,01,18
113,Best cocktails in London,"I am never normally one to write a review but after a lovely evening spent in the hotel bar I thought I would leave a quick note to the staff of the hotel to say thank you for a wonderful evening. Friendly staff who make great cocktails, I will certainly be back. Very impressed - well done The Kensington.

113,Beautiful,"This was a surprise booked by my partner for my birthday, felt like a princess. greeted at the car. bags were taken from us, hot towels given to us on entry. checked in and the room was absolutely beautiful. ate at the restaurant too. over all an amazing experience and thank you for your hospitality.",5,2015,01,16
113,Fabulous Hotel,"I truly enjoyed my stay at The Kensington! I come to London often for business, and decided to make a trip for fun after the holidays. The hotel was wonderful, from check-in to check-out. The front desk staff was very helpful at check-in. I am terrible at names, but kudos to the overnight agent who worked on Saturday, January 3rd. He deserves a big thank you from me! I had left my phone in a taxi, and he saved the day by assisting me in getting it back. George in the restaurant was great as well. The rest of the staff was so accommodating and helpful, with everything from baggage assistance to choosing which restaurants to go. The housekeeping staff did great in keeping my lovely room clean. The hotel has a great bar and the food is also delicious. The location can't be beat, as you can walk to everything you need or take the tube. I will be back here on my next trip to London!",5,2015,01,15
113,Christmas in London,My fiancee and I visited London for our firs Christmas together. The hotel was amazing and the lobby... perfect for drinking glass of wine next to the chimney and the most beautiful Christmas tree. The room was very comfortable.,5,2015,01,15
113,Such an amazing place!,"My husband and I visited London for our honeymoon. There were so many hotels to choose form when booking but I read the great reviews about the Kensington Hotel and we decided to go with it. The hotel is AMAZING! When you walk in you are greeting by the most amazing aroma. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. The daily tea, shortbread, turn-down service is the perfect touch. 
The free Wifi was great because we could still keep in touch with our family in the states. It's in a spectacular location, only a few blocks away from the underground and pubs/restaurants close by. I highly recommend visiting Aux Merveilleux de Fred, a little french bakery right around the corner. They have the best brioche! We stayed at the Kensington Hotel for 6 nights and I was very upset to leave. We will be planning our return soon!",5,2015,01,14
113,Afternoon Tea,This was by far the most pleasant afternoon tea I have had.  The food quality was excellent and the waiting staff were perfectly balanced between being very attentive but not overbearing.  The room had a lovely atmosphere with real fires. We enjoyed a bottle of pink bubbly too.,5,2015,01,14
113,Great couples retreat!,"Where can I start?! My partner and I had a beautiful anniversary stay here. We were overwhelmed by the location and all of the staff made our stay feel extra special- especially Martyn (great name) the door man.

The rooms aren't huge but it's what you can expect from an exclusive area in london. The beds on the other hand are wonderful! Very big and comfy.
We also ordered a Kensington cheese burger at around 11.45 on room service and it was beautiful.

Overall we loved our stay and would highly recommend!!",5,2015,01,12
113,"superior rooms, great location and 5 star service","Staying here was wonderful! If visiting London isn't already a great experience then here staying will be, it is such a big bonus. The hotel is absolutely amazing, the most comfortable place I've ever been, and they even have late night cocktail bar, to keep you company when you don‚Äôt feel tired to go to sleep. They even go above and beyond to make you comfortable: the room is beautiful, has a lot of light, and you have your own nespresso coffee machine. Also they have some books about London which were really helpful. They let us have complete use of the gym  :) Getting from their bar. The hotel is really easy and fast, just take the direct  trains to South kensington from heathrow airport and cruise along.special mentions to Martin,George and Vincent and everyone else... Thank you so much for your hospitality, I hope I see you again soon.",5,2015,01,11
113,loved every second of it,"The kensington hotel  is  fantastic and staff  is very welcoming and thoughtful especially George at the Lounge and and we felt very much at home. The breakfast and snacks provided were plentiful and we appreciated the variety from day to day. The concept is great - we could wake up when we wished and the breakfast table was only a few steps away!
The bed was very comfortable and was very spacious and immaculately clean. We were very impressed by the thoughtful additions and amenities supplied",5,2015,01,11
113,Old Dame with great charm,"We have stayed here the last few years on our trips. The lounge area is great and takes you back to an era slower than today. Good breakfast, excellent service and friendly staff. Great location with good local restaurants, pubs and short stroll to Queens Gate entrance to Kensington gardens. Downside are the room sizes, we have had to ask for a larger room on our last two stays. Staff were helpful but time to seek better accomodation, shame. ",4,2015,01,11
113,Small rooms in a very nice hotel,"I like this hotel very much, despite the ridiculously small rooms and bathroom. The beds are really comfortable and the service is perfect. The bath amenities are of top quality, and location is perfect. Try to go for a larger room if you can afford it.",4,2015,01,10
113,second time Again another great experience,"Staff are always the kindest and friendliest ever. Always ready to help and answer our questions, they made us feel welcome and comfortable inside the hotel. It was pleasant t to chat with them about anything and everything -We spent a lovely evening together with gorgeous appetisers prepared by the kitchen and some lovely wine, then after my friend had a lovely cocktail ! The bar, is a quiet, friendly, and absolutely adorable place, We really enjoyed having him around. kensington hotel is in a quiet and nice area just a few minutes' train ride from london. After a busy day in the city, you will definitely appreciate the peaceful neighbourhood.  I hope we'll have the chance to meet the generous staff again some time soon!",5,2015,01,10
113,nice hotel and good value,"the kensington hotel is professionally run with friendly staff around like the few mentions like Said, Alessandro and George  It‚Äôs very clean and smelled great. It's well laid out and in a great location convenient to harrods ,hyde park etc most tube lines connect within 5 minutes walking distance. We had a fantastic time while staying here and the hotel was just as described and pictured small rooms but well equipped and pleasant. For such an affordable place in this location, it more than delivers. I always want to stay here when visiting london in the future for history, culture, amazing food and drink, boutique shopping, and a general feeling that you're in the centre of the city's real life. On the upside it further suppresses street noise while keeping you cool! I strongly recommend booking the hotel- a first class host offering outstanding value in london‚Äôs greatest neighbourhood.",5,2015,01,09
113,Classic British Hotel in a Perfect Location,"I stayed in this hotel for 12 days over the Christmas holidays and it was absolutely perfect!   It is a classic British Hotel with a traditional lobby area for having afternoon tea and sitting by the fire place.  The service is absolutely amazing.  The concierge staff and the wait staff are professional and friendly -- and they make you feel at home.   In particular, George, the morning waiter always knew what Iwanted and he always made helpful suggestions for what to do.  He made me feel welcome and special.  Just what I needed!",5,2015,01,08
113,None,"Have stayed a number of times at The Kensington in a neighbourhood with an abundance of eateries, nearby museums, conventient South Ken tube (direct line to Heathrow) and a most attentive staff. The room size is OK for London, a city renowned for parsimony in its hostelry real estate.",5,2015,01,08
113,A lovely London Hotel & Great central Location,"The Kensington Rooms Hotel is fantastically located in the heart of London on Cromwell Road, a few steps from Gloucester Road Station. Professional, courteous, knowledgeable and caring sums up the Staff; home from home for us. Outstanding customer service. 

I don't really know what expectations I had here but as I said, it was outstanding and really is on the level of some of London's  good hotels. 

Thank you all, see you again in July.",5,2015,01,08
113,Fantastic stay,Stayed here for part of my honeymoon and could not fault anything. Good location. The staff where very friendly and helpful. Could not fault the cleanliness. Will def be returning again and I would def recommend.  ,5,2015,01,07
113,Excellent Hotel and Great Location,This is a very nice hotel in a great location. Very nice overall feel and ambiance. The room was nice and the food was also good. A bit expensive but everything in London is expensive. A good place to stay while on business or holidays. I would recommend this hotel.,5,2015,01,06
113,Not the best experience,"I have wrestled with writing this review for some time, since overall I am a very positive person and tend to the optimistic. Going to try to keep this as factual as possible. 

What I liked: 
Great lobby library...spent quite a bit of time here reading and drinking cocktails. The library lobby is the best thing about this hotel
Pretty decent food and bar service 

What I didn't like:
The room I booked was at my corporate rate since my company is located at Kensington Village. The room booked at the company rate was super tiny - there was no room for anything in the room except for a full sized bed and two night tables. I had a passage way of about 3 feet between the wall and the end of the bed. There was no real free space to unpack and organize. 

The bathroom was so tiny, it made me laugh. The shower door only opened 2-3 feet between the toilet and sink to squeeze in and step up, and I had to crouch to get under the shower head. I'm tall (5'11) but I can't imagine anyone much taller than me fitting in the shower. 

The biggest issue which I am sorry to publicize here was theft - I didn't know that the Kensington Hotel offered turn down service. I went out for a walk, leaving my suitcase open with some american dollars stuffed in the side. When I returned from the walk, I immediately realized that someone had been in my room for turndown, and there was money missing. I raised the issue at checkout, in which case the staff asked me to wait (I was heading to the airport) while they called the police. This was not something I was comfortable with, so I left under the promise they would investigate. After a week, I received a email that they were investigating, but that was it. The theft issue and the way it was handled made me feel as though it was not valid unless I called the police. 

I will not stay at this hotel again which is unfortunate because it is a preferred hotel for my company - the size of the rooms and the theft issue definitely soured my experience.",2,2015,01,06
113,Three night post Christmas break for husband's birthday,"The hotel in almost every aspect exceeded our expectations. We managed to get a very good price for the stay and were also upgraded.  The rooms we had (I'll explain later) were a very good size with big marble tiled bathrooms with separate bath and shower. The second room even had a TV next to the bath and a huge walk in shower.

We had an Afternoon Cream Tea on arrival and also had a meal in the restaurant which were both very good.

Our one problem which stops me giving a 5 out of 5 (I would have chosen 4.5 if the option was there) was to some extent out of the control of the hotel. The first two nights of our stay we had problems sleeping due to noise from a TV which was on well into the early hours of the morning. The night time staff failed to locate which room it was coming from. The second night we actually went to sleep in another room. I would say that the gentleman who showed us to the room did give us both the impression we were making something out of nothing which was unfortunate. On our last day we moved rooms properly (an upgrade on our upgrade) and had a good night's sleep at last.

I'm partly explaining all this almost to say that if you have any similar problem, don't suffer in silence as they will do their best to sort this out for you and move you if there is another room available.

In every other sense the stay was great. ALL other staff were very polite and couldn't do enough for us. It was my husband's birthday during our stay and he was given a birthday card.

The location of the hotel is spot on especially for shops, Hyde Park, Albert Hall, Science and Natural History Museum etc. South Kensington tube is the nearest and about a 10min walk at the most. There is a local little Waitrose around the corner and plenty of places to get breakfast if you don't eat in the restaurant. We had the Eggs Benedict in the restaurant and they were probably the best we have had anywhere.

I would recommend stopping at the Hummingbird Bakery (up near Christies)  and La Brioche does some great breakfasts and take away sandwiches / Paninis etc.

We picked up a couple of 'Boris Bikes' right outside the hotel and cycled up to Hyde Park and back again which was really fun and a bit of 'easy cycling' without too much traffic to contend with.

Overall a really excellent few days though it would have be nice to have had a little more sleep.",4,2015,01,06
113,Perfect,"The Kensington has everything going for it:  staff extraordinarily friendly and exceptionally helpful in all regards; we had asked for twin beds and when we arrived the beds were made up as a king size bed, but with in minutes the manager had the staff convert the bed to twins and we were able to settle in.  But the hotel room and bath were beautiful and nicely appointed; the public rooms through out were elegant.  Breakfast was also exceptional with a great choice.  The location is great, but one should know what one wants to see and where one wishes to go as this is South Kensington, perfect for the four of us, but a considerable distance, for example, to British Museum and theatre district by taxi.",5,2015,01,05
113,Exceptional Service,"The Kensington Hotel staff are the real stars here. While the Kensington is beautifully decorated, its restaurant good, and room amenities of good quality - the staff truly do their utmost to serve the customer. 

For example, we stayed five days during the Christmas Holiday, and they surprised us with a filled stocking and small gift for our son and cordials for us. It was one of many lovely gestures (beyond good service) that made us feel cared for.

Every person we interfaced with was always smiling, remembering our names, and asking how they could help. Being our first time in London, we felt welcomed and appreciated, and happy to meet them as well.

The restaurant's food was delicious, we had included breakfast in our reservations, and Christmas eve dinner was beautifully decorated and included Christmas Crackers. 

Like many London hotels, the rooms are not large, but we had fresh luxurious bedding, quality beds, robes & slippers, quality toiletries, espresso and tea fixings with shortbread.

Location: a few minutes walk from the Tube - easy to do. Close walk to the Natural History and Science Museums as well as the nearby park. Wide variety of restaurants and markets around the corner, yet a more quiet residential area to stroll in. French area nearby and a superb Patisserie.",5,2015,01,03
113,room let it down!,"Great reception, bar area. Lived up to its five stars.  Room was not so five star.  On arrival lights not working in room so had to ring reception twice to fix problem.  Sheets on beding was ripped. Stan on wall next to bed.all in all very disappointed in the room. ",3,2015,01,03
113,Wonderful Hotel,"This hotel is outstanding.  We chose it because we had stayed at its sister hotel - The Marylebone Hotel.  The Marylebone is very good - the Kensington is even better.

We had a large family room on the second floor next to the lift - room 223.  I loved the bold wallpaper.  The only possible improvement would have been more storage space.  We stayed for 8 nights and bought all of our Christmas presents whilst we were there.  Got a bit tight on space - especially for hanging things up.

We were out each evening to watch the Olympia Horse Show so we did not eat in the main dining room.  The lounge menu was very good, however, and on one occasion a waiter apologised for a delay in bringing a hot chocolate because they had run out of chocolate so he popped out to get some.  It would have been so easy in the late evening to have said that it was off the menu.

We also enjoyed the breakfasts.

Each evening mince pies and mulled wine were available in the entrance hall - compliments of the hotel.

The staff were very good.  Pleasant and helpful rather than stuffy.  As I came on to write the review, I saw that there were several positive comments about George.  George was so charming that he deserves a special mention.

We also particularly liked the tall elegant doorman who whistled up taxis.

A bulb blew on a light in the bedroom and tripped a fuse.  The bulb was replaced and the fuse reset within minutes.

it is definitely not a budget hotel but I did think that it was good value for a hotel so close to the Natural History Museum and of such quality.  There was also no feeling that we were being squeezed for every penny.  Some mornings for example, our girls choose food off the a la carte breakfast menu as well as having items from the continental breakfast buffet..  They only charged us for the a la carte food.

Also their festive tea was extremely good value compared with many central London hotels.

An excellent hotel - would highly recommend.",5,2015,01,03
113,Fulfills expectation,Stayed a number of times at Kensington Hotel when needing to overnight in town and as always the staff excellent and the room was exactly as expected - which for me means top quality - I have high expectations which this hotel always fulfills.,5,2015,01,02
113,Kensington Hotel.,"Lovely experience, staff is very attentive and caring. The decor is relaxing, elegant and comfortable. I would defiantly stay again, and I'm sure we would be welcomed back as not a guest, but family. Notable stand out staff members to myself personally would be George and Carmen. They both go that extra mile to ensure you are well taken care of. Overall staff is very well trained. I will miss staying at The Kensington.",4,2015,01,02
113,we enjoyed staying here a lot,"my daughter stayed in this hotel because we were sightseeing tour in europe From the moment we arrived, all staff were were polite, cheerful and hospitable with exceptions to George & Michael who were very helpful and welcoming The description in the advert was extremely accurate and easy to understand 
The room was very comfortable and clean, and the facilities were perfect.
It's a very good location, just next to the train station that has good links to the rest of London. It's also a nice area, with shops, bars and restaurants.
we hope to come back one day as we were made to feel right at home",5,2015,01,01
113,Perfect Hotel for a suprise weekend away,"We stayed at the Kensington Hotel for one night in early December as part of a suprise weekend away to celebrate my wife's 40th birthday. I had taken a lot of time researching the local hotels in the Kensington area to ensure I selected the best one to make this a memorable stay; I am very glad to say that the hotel far exceeded my expectations. 
From the moment we arrived and were greeted at the door by the concierge to the time we left, everything was perfect. The reception staff welcomed us with hot towels to refresh ourselves and checked us in quickly and efficiently. They advised us that our room had been up-graded, which was an unexpected bonus and although our room was not ready, they offered to look after our baggage to enable us to explore the local area. They gave us a map of the local attractions, tube stations and after a chat about the things we wanted to do, gave us some very useful tips. 
The hotel was within 5 minutes walking distance of the Natural History and Science museums and about 10 minutes walk from the Royal Albert Hall. We ventured out for the majority of the day and arrived back at the hotel late afternoon. when we arrived back, the reception staff greeted us again and gave us our room cards. Whilst we waited, we took the chance to sample one of the mince pies and sipped a glass of mulled wine that were on offer, yummy!
There is a lift to all floors and also a beautiful staircase situated near the restaurant entrance, which winds upwards and is worth using if you feel energetic. We found our way to our room very easily and entered to find a spacious, clean and extremely well presented area. The decor was classic with a modern touch and the bed was huge and very comfortable. Our luggage had been bought up and placed neatly in the dressing area, which was seperate to the main bedroom. Our room had views over the main road, but it was suprisingly quiet. The en-suite was well equipped, with clean towels, bath robes, slippers all available and the normal assortment of high-end shampoos and shower gels. The drinks bar and coffee making facilities were hidden neatly away in the large wardrobe along with extra pillows and bedding if you needed them. The large flat-screen TV had plenty of channels including the main Sky sports channels, (which my wife promptly turned off). ;-)
Once we had settled into the room, had a lovely shower and chilled for a bit, we decided to go to the main bar and have a drink. The prices were as expected in central London, ¬£6.50 ish for a bottle of Peroni and ¬£8.00 ish for a large glass of wine. We relaxed in the bar, had a few drinks, nibbled on the snacks that the extremely pleasant and polite bar staff kindly bought over to us and watch the world go by. To show how good this hotel must be, X-Factor judge Louis Walsh was staying and passed through the bar whilst we were sitting.    
We did not eat dinner in the hotel restaurant as I had made other plans, but the menu looked extensive and varied to all tastes. We went down for breakfast after a solid nights sleep in one of the most comfortable hotel beds I have slept in. The choice of breakfast was good, with full english, continental and many other options available at varying costs. I had the full english and was not dissapointed; my wife ordered scambled eggs on toast and got this as-well as a huge serving of fresh salmon.
After breakfast, we headed out and about to make the most of what was available before our train was due to leave later that day. We had a reservation for lunch booked at Babylon, at the Kensington Roof gardens, so had to plan around this booking. 
We checked out and again, left our baggage with reception who said it would be okay to leave it with them and pick it up later on the way back.
We arrived back at the hotel mid afternoon to pick up our baggage and were extremely sad that the weekend was drawing to an end. This hotel is quite expensive, but if you are looking for an extra special place to stay and somewhere to treat yourself or a loved one, then this is the place to go. I made a lot of plans for the weekend we were in London, and this was only one part of the jigsaw, but without the experience and memories we have of staying at the Kensington Hotel it would not have been as special as it turned out to be.
Many thanks to all of the staff and managment, we will be back!",5,2014,12,30
113,Excellent Staff,I stayed at the Kensington the day before and night of my wedding. All the staff were friendly and provided an excellent service. The rooms were comfortable and the hotel dressed beautifully in Christmas decorations. I would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2014,12,30

113,"perfect service,perfect stay and will be back soon","When we travel, somehow we still always look for the comforts of home. our cozy room offered just that! It was the perfect place for the two of us. Loved so many things about it -- its quiet location, its proximity to everything, and its cleanliness. Most of all, we loved how friendly and hospitable the staff were like George at the lounge with his fascinating persona also a lady at the reception was there to personally welcome us when we arrived. She made sure we had everything we needed. The room was equipped with amenities a traveler would need, from clean towels to other stuff to toiletries. More than anything else, it was actually the small personal gestures they did that made a difference to us, like the bottles of already chilled mineral water in the room and of course those heavenly chocolate cookies. We also appreciated how they made sure the AC was already cooling the room up by the time we arrived. Our stay was made more memorable and pleasant with all these. It made coming home after a long day full of activities, so relaxing and worthwhile. We will definitely recommend this place to our friends and relatives. To kensington hotel management, many, many thanks (and for the take-home memories as well!).",5,2014,12,29
113,EXEMPLARY - Thank You,"Where do I start! There are not enough words to express how much I LOVED staying in this hotel First off all the hotel is amazing. They turned a very old house into a completely renovated and modern place to live. There are many things to look at from their travels all over the world as well as many stories to go along with each one. The staff roam about freely and greet you in the morning when you walk out the door. The concierge Vincent , is one of the knowledgeable gentleman that I have met so far. Of course, not only is there hotel beautifully decorated, comfortably cozy and convenient to local transport, but the staffs themselves are the most wonderful hosts. I was in London for 4 days with my boyfriend wanting to see the sights, experience the lifestyle and learn about the culture and history. First, they provided a very helpful information booklet already ready with directions to local bakeries, bank locations and everything else we would need. Having no real plans about what we would visit in England, they went through a map of London with us showing the best places to visit and the best way to plan our stay. Our room was spacious, clean, and equipped with a comfortable bed. They also went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed from towels, complete use of the gym, coffee in the morning and even a copy of the daily newspaper. While I did experience all of the things I wanted to get from my visit in London, it was coming back to the hotel to have dinner, wine, cheese and good conversations with George that became the highlight of our stay. We learned so much through the stories and traditions they shared with us. Our wining and dining was incredible and made everything about London more authentic and real. We truly felt welcomed and at home ., thank you so much for everything that you did for us. We will be back soon no doubt about it and of course plan to stay with you. Everyone should stay here if you really want the best experience in London!",5,2014,12,29
113,Memorable stay!,"We stay at The Kensington the weekend before Christmas a surprise arranged for my wife`s special birthday. On arrival the Hotel looked lovely and the staff where very pleasant and helpful. The room we stayed in was beautiful. Unfortunately within a couple of hours of checking in my daughter came down with chicken pox! The hotel staff were fantastic sending her up a teddy and a colouring pack and phoning to check on her. However this meant that we could not enjoy the beautiful hotel`s facilities as my daughter was really poorly. We had to have breakfast in our room, I had planned to eat in the restaurant in the evenings and have afternoon tea in the lounge which all looked very nice but unfortunately were not able to do. Not quite the birthday surprise I had planned for a relaxing & exciting weekend in London together as I wanted to make this extra special. However the hotel and staff were FANTASTIC.    Dean C.",5,2014,12,28
113,"Lovely, affordable and really nice staff in central London.","Really nice hotel, big and clean rooms. Lovely area! I will come back for sure! and car park as well. What else can you ask for??? Thank you for such a nice visit. And breakfast was included as well, in my case. ",5,2014,12,28
113,Nice place,"I stayed solo over the holidays. The lobby was cosy and warm and convivial, and we were greeted with mince pies, clementines, and mulled cider. It smelled wonderful! The concierge was very helpful when I called for transportation advice, and again when I needed a cab to the airport. The women cleaning and doing the night turndown were charming and warm. The wifi worked perfectly for me in the room all the time. I had a glass of wine in the lobby, and appetizers with room service, and both were delicious and perfectly served. The room I eventually received was nicely decorated, light, very clean, and had a nice view of holiday lights in the hotel across the street. (some traffic noise in case that matters, though it didn't bother me). When I first arrived, I was given a small room at the end of a long corridor, in a newer part of the building it seemed. It was not at all what I expected. Although I rarely complain at hotels, I did go down to the front desk and the manager put me in another room for the night, which was better but still very dark and near the elevators, which have a dinging bell. (the hotel was quite full). The next night they moved me to a lovely room which I had for the rest of my stay. I really appreciate that they moved me, as the first room would have ruined my stay. But I do wish they had reserved a pleasant room for me from the outset. In such a fancy and expensive hotel, I expect that kind of attention, and I hate having to complain to get it. Perhaps asking about what room you'll be given ahead of time would be useful. Certainly the rest of my stay was very pleasant.",4,2014,12,28
113,Distinguished property ,"The Kensington Hotel is a hem to stay in. Though some may argue the style (traditional) the amenities are good, staff very helpful ad hospitable. Breakfast is great, nice area to have some food. There is enough room on the ground floor to read your newspaper without being disturbed. On checkout you'll get a bottle of water if one pleases. 
I'd appreciate the staff to have offered me their loyalty program as I intend to come back more often.
In short ; for business 2-3 days excellent hoteliers, great value for your money.",4,2014,12,28
113,nice place,"had a great time here it Being there many times but left a review today, can't be anything but amazed! The lobby is so cosy that you feel like at home, the service, perhaps not the most skilled in London, fill the gap with a huge kindness and will to help. Need to mention Eros, great bartender. He mixes like he's born with a shaker. The neighbourhood is very calm and the atmosphere is just too good to be true! My relatives was genuinely happy passing Cristhmas Day. If you want to feel like you never left home, you must definitely come here!",4,2014,12,26
113,Perfect pre-Christmas stay ,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Kensington Hotel for 4 nights the week before Christmas and it was a perfect choice. It's location is an easy 5-10 min walk (depending on how much window-shopping you do) to South Kensington tube, with access to 3 underground lines. The hotel was faultless in every way: the staff were very welcoming and eager to please; the common areas were beautifully decorated in the best Christmas fashion; the room we had was warm and big with a marvellously comfortable bed with equal doona. The breakfast was great, the bar lovely, and the fireplaces were a standout on a cold winters day. I truly look forward to staying again. It was the best hotel I've stayed in London!",5,2014,12,26

113,Tour bus of veterans,We were very tired and it took awhile to get everyone their keys for their rooms but eventually we all were settled in. We had some lovely walks in the park and around the area but we went for walks in small groups. We also were reminded to take cab rides only in black cabs even if it costs more. Lovely in month of may with apple blossoms on trees and sweetness in the air. We bought umbrellas with us on our trips and warm raincoats too. Tours  bus drivers often expected each to give money tips so I collected from each person as a friendly duty but some did not like to give but the 20 or 25$ had to come from somewhere for bus driver.,5,2014,12,25
113,Great business stay,"Stayed over for a night when visiting WoK auction, a very professional service with great breakfast. Bedroom okay, a little small, but nice bathroom made up for lack of space. I would stay again for sure.",5,2014,12,23
113,A very nice Hotel,"The reception staff were very welcoming and though the room was small it was very luxurious. We were attending a Royal Albert Hall concert and was in easy walking distance for the reasonably able. After the the Concert we visited a rather pretentious wine bar with very expensive poor wine, what a welcome to visit the Hotel bar which was warm and friendly and with Christmas decorations very seasonal. Though we were over charged on checkout, we questioned the bill and on breakdown there were several drinks we had not had and even after a refund was still not right. Though this did not detract from our stay and we would definitely stay again.",5,2014,12,21
113,the service which is truly fantastic,"we  started with the instructions on where to park the car and how to get to hotel. the reception was waiting for us when we arrived and we felt right at home instantly. The hotel is right where the action is in the west central London and all the beauties of kensington, yet we found it to be a quiet oasis in the midst of it all. We slept very well and had tea and coffee and pastries for breakfast served by George before we set off in the morning. Rubina is lovely and we enjoyed chatting with her. We have no hesitation in recommending the hotel to interested visitors!",5,2014,12,20
113,Wonderful,"Room was beautiful, bigger than expected. We were able to check in early which was extremely useful. Staff were lovely and accommodating. lounge was very comfortable and relaxing. Will return soon. Also, George is a legend!",5,2014,12,20
113,"Beautiful, Quintessentially English","I had the opportunity to spend two lovely nights here at the beginning of December 2014 with my brother.  

The hotel is in a great location in Kensington.  Super boutiquey and cute, this hotel truly makes you feel at home.  It was lovely to be greeted by mulled wine and minced pies in the evening upon arrival after work.  

Our bedroom was quite small, but it was our fault for booking at the last minute, where all the other rooms were fully booked far in advance.  I LOVED how the tiles in the bathroom floor were heated.  It made such a massive difference in the winter!  

It was also Christmas time in London, and the hotel ran with the theme 100%, having lovely Christmas trees and proper working fires in the fireplaces throughout the property.  

The bar atmosphere was also a massive highlight, with Alessandro the mixologist making all the difference.  Amazing cocktails.

All in all, fantastic experience at The Kensington.  Stay!",5,2014,12,19
113,An amazing experience.,"Was really pleased and had such a wonderful experience. The hotel has character, sort of boutique, and gives you a different feel from the usual big chain hotels.

Location was just great, 5 minute walk from south kensington station, Natural History museum, Victoria and Albert Museum etc. With the tube, you can practically get to anywhere.
For those interested, apparently there are a lot of clubs in that area. It is also near the ""french area"" as the French Institute is just round the corner. It is a very safe, pleasant area to be in.

Service: Excellent. On arrival, the reception staff sorted me out in no time, with warm smiles and also a nice hot towel which was nice after a long day of travelling for me.
I have to give special credit the concierge service. Just so personal and careful and patient. They were ever ready to help me with parking, return of rental car issues, etc. Absolutely faultless.
I also liked the little things like chocolates and a note at night to talk give the next day's weather forecast. The staff are very prompt in making up your room. Perfect.
Any call for assistance is met with promptly, efficiently and yet always warmly.
Room: The room was also beautiful and reasonably spacious!

F&B: The lounge has a pretty good atmosphere, though small. Drinks are quite refreshing.

Amenities: A surprisingly well equipped gym! Had no time to use it but I did take a walk around. Business centre was quite small, just two desktops with printers. Best to have your own laptop to get real work done. The lobby lounge are tastefully and classically decorated, with fireplaces, small chandeliers, comfortable sofas. A real boutique, cosy yet posh feel, which I much prefer compared to the more commercial large hotel chain atmosphere.

All in all, my stay gave me a superb experience. Further. for all the perks of the location, excellent service, and great atmosphere, the price was very very reasonable. I would definitely recommend anyone travelling to London to stay there, and would consider staying there again should I visit London again.",5,2014,12,19
113,"Great stay, it was sad to leave","The hotel is in a great part of town to explore but it's also useful being so well connected by transport to get around. The hotel is lovely - and the bed very comfy and the room was quiet for a sound sleep! all staff was very flexible about everything and no request was too big for them and so welcoming: happy to chat to and very interesting. Lovely range of breakfast provided, just sorry I didn't have more time to relax and enjoy the hospitality. Thank you so much for having me and I recommend this hotel to each London traveller.",5,2014,12,19
113,"Perfect spot, tiny rooms, charming decor","Cozy boutique hotel . Lovely charming lobby, bar area complete with 2 fireplaces . Rooms are small but well equipped. Make sure you know your roommate well! Great location ,quiet,  close to tube stop, Hyde Park, Chelsea shopping. I'll be back. ",4,2014,12,18
113,The Gem in South Kensington,I have been staying at this hotel since 2011 and it is gone from strength to strength. What makes this hotel special is aside from the location the tremendous friendliness of the staff. It has become my favorite hotel on my European travels. Thank you for making me feel at home. ,5,2014,12,18
113,Great Christmas Getaway,"Stayed here from Friday to Monday. We checked in very early on Friday (10 am) although the room was not ready we left our bags with reception. Upon our eventual return in the early evening we found our bags left in out room, which was a nice touch. 

As this was not our first time staying in the hotel, it was good to recognize some familiar staff members. I've always found the staff to be excellent and very attentive to our needs. 

The room was nice and clean, and the bathroom was great. Overall we really enjoyed our stay and are looking forward to returning at some stage next year.",5,2014,12,17
113,Does this hotel have the smallest rooms in London ?,"My wife and I chose this hotel on the basis of highly complimentary internet reviews that said it was a 5 star hotel. Regrettably, our experience was mostly uncomplimentary and rated in our experience as a 3 star hotel. The first room we were allocated was minuscule - only good for one person overnight with minimum luggage; and the TV wasn't working. After complaining, we were moved to a larger room with a single window looking into other hotel rooms, not very private to say the least. Unlike every other hotel we've stayed in in London over the last 20 years, breakfast was not included in the room tariff. The additional price was double the price of nearby restaurants. This hotel is an old building, it is noisy with creaky floorboards, floors that slope away from one corner to another, the public areas are dark needing lights on throughout the day, the corridors are very narrow requiring people to turn side on when passing each other and it has a musty smell about it in the rooms and hallways. We would not have remained in the hotel except for the fact that all nearby hotels were fully booked.",2,2014,12,15
113,Christmas Weekend,We arrived very late on the Thursday evening and stayed until midday Sunday. We were happy with the room although slightly smaller than expected.Staff were excellent and eager to please A definite yes,5,2014,12,15
113,Small room,"The Kensington Hotel is a lovely hotel.  All the staff are very courteous, attentive and helpful.  We enjoyed the mulled wine along with the excellent mince pies provided in Reception.  Breakfast was lovely with a good selection and there was no problem when I had send the toast back as it had not toasted!

The only thing we slightly found fault with was the size of the room.  It was on the small side and the bathroom was very compact.  However the amenities were lovely - nespresso machine, complimentary water, shortbread fingers, and chocolates left on the pillows.  Oh, and the bed was rather too firm.

We would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2014,12,14
113,Extremly small room,"Our superior room was  extremly small, with low ceiling, bathroom impraticable,noise coming from the window because of the external A/C engines . Television was not working properly, bathroom aspirator not working. I asked about the others rooms and a lady from reception said that the size is almost the same maybe rooms with king size bed are a little bit bigger .  For the price paid the value is very poor. We usually stay at others hotel in this area and I have to say that for the same price the size and the confort of the room is much better. I have no complain about the common areas that were very nice with nice Christmas decorations , also the staff was very kind and the breakfast was good.",2,2014,12,12
113,Another pretty London hotel,"The Kensington hotel is conveniently situated 3-5 minutes walk from the South Kensington Underground and duly 5-7 minutes walk from the Natural History Museum and a 15 Minute walk from Harrods and the rest of Knightsbridge. Location: Very good.

Unfortunately, the room we had booked over the phone was not where our bags ended. However, to credit the front desk staff, we were moved to a family room, even if under constant reminder that this was a ""courtesy"" and a ""free upgrade"". Changing a room to what was requested is not a courtesy. Check-in: Had a happy ending.

The Happy Ending room (223) was large sized for a London hotel. Since we were moved to an accessible ""family room"" that bath and shower were adequately sized. However, the room did have a major glitch: the heating. It was colder in our room than it was outside and we were there at the begin of December, folks. The room gradually heated up during the night, but even set at 29 Celsius, the room never got really warm. It got to a point where it was no longer unpleasant to sit about without a double duvet, but by no means warm. Our particular room was also low on power outlets and mirrors. Room: Could have been warmer, but it was more than acceptable by London standards.

We had a noise problem with the room above us, but this was solved very quickly. Front desk response to problems: Excellent!

There was one young woman on duty who seemed to either be new or not knowledgeable of the area. She needed a map to locate the NHM for us. If you concentrate, you can see the corner grounds of the museum from the steps of the hotel. We also enquired about the tube time for Sunday morning, as we were aware that these differ from the rest of the week. She confidently told us that the tubes begin at 6 a.m. I found this strange, but she reassured me that she had just checked in the internet. Funny? I saw her go to the computer, but I didn't hear the keyboard clacking away. We trusted her information. It was wrong. The tubes begin running at South Kensington well after 7 a.m. on Sundays. This is information that a hotel of this class and standard should have at their disposal or at a minimum really look up. 

That brings me to the last point. Because this is a hotel of this class and standard, I have to assume that they might not have many guests that actually don't mind taking the underground. After requesting a taxi to take us to the airport, we were directed to a car and driver. The driver insisted that a trip to Heathrow was a standard 65 pounds and that there is a law (!) that requires him to charge more if we use a credit card. A charge, maybe. A law, no. He then instructed us that he and the hotel had arranged this and I should check with them about the price. Why should I check with the hotel? Sounded wrong. We got out of the car with a not so happy driver and carted ourselves and bags to the underground stop at 6:40 a.m. There is where we found out that the underground information of the day before about 6 a.m. was incorrect. In the end, we took a real taxi to Heathrow. Imagine our non-suprise when the ride did not cost 65 pounds. Big city rules: always ask the driver (even a real taxi driver) how much the ride is before he takes off and before your bags are loaded. 

Overall, the hotel is in a good, safe location, and it's really beautiful, especially the decorations for the holidays with a gorgeous tree, fireplace, wreaths and, and, and! The service on whole was good. 

I will definitely give the Kensington a second try. I think the karma just may have been off that weekend. For that reason, I gave it 4 stars instead of 3 because I do believe it has 4 star potential. I hope they can actually convince me of the 4 stars the next time around!",4,2014,12,11
113,Amazing hotel,"We were really pleased with our stay in the Kensington Hotel. The staff were extremely helpful and the location is perfect. The rooms are slightly on the small side, but they have everything provided. We would definitely stay here again. We have stayed in numerous hotels in London over the years, but this was most definitely the best.",5,2014,12,11
113,Fantastic hotel,"Our first visit to this fantastic hotel for a four day break in London. It's in a  nice location only a 5 minute walk to the tube station and walking distance to the lovely Kensington Gardens ,Hyde Park ,Harrods and near to the Natural history museum. We were greeted by a friendly doorman and porter and  a  very friendly and helpful receptionist Lillian. Our room was cosy and warm and the lovely bathroom had under floor heating . We had chocolates and plums brought to our room on arrival a daily newspaper delivered ready to read on a morning with our coffee or tea . Fresh water every day and  on a night mulled cider and mince pies in reception a fully stock up mini bar if required. We did not use the resteraunt or bar because we wanted to make the most of our break in exploring London . Would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay again if we visit London .",5,2014,12,08
113,Luxury with  great service,"Fantastic location for visiting London business or private. 
high level of accommodation and the privacy required when conducting business. excellent gym open 24 hours and wonderful staff who cannot do more. 
A good selection of wines that are reasonably priced.",5,2014,12,08
113,A fantastic experience,"My husband and I stayed at The Kensington Hotel, London, for one week this fall (2014) and we loved it. Everything was perfect; the rooms were comfortable, the bathrooms well fitted, the location was perfect but the very best part was the staff and service we received. After our stay there, we went on to another city and another hotel and as nice as it was, it was not the Kensington. I recommend this hotel highly.",5,2014,12,06
113,Wonderful weekend get-away!,"Very friendly and helpful staff from the moment we arrived till the moment we left. 

We booked a superior room on the front side of the hotel, which was small but cozy. WiFi was free as well as water, tea and Nespresso coffee. A personal welcome note was present in the room, which is exactly the kind of small things that make a trip memorable. 

The breakfast buffet is excellent as well as the dinner we had in the restaurant of the hotel.

Overall the hotel is a very nice place to stay; warm nicely decorated rooms, excellent service, and a great location near restaurants, shopping and South Kensington station which brings you anywhere you want to go to in London.

I highly recommend this hotel for a wonderful weekend get-away!",4,2014,12,05
113,Fit For Royalty,"This marked our second stay at the Kensington in the past two (2) years and like before, our expectations were not met, the hotel exceeded all of our anticipations.
Located in the lovely upscale neighborhood of Kensington, the Kensington's mid-late 19th century hotel offers superb and refined accommodations for the most discerning guest.  We enjoyed proper afternoon tea in the gorgeous area off the lobby and on that cold raw day, appreciated the roaring fire.  Our room was stylishly appointed with luxurious linens and bedding and turndown service included some very tasty late night snacks.  We relied heavily on Kensington's excellent concierge service.  Both Vincent Peach and Martyn (forgive me; I forgot his last name) were super friendly, knowledgeable and assisted us with restaurant, theater and tour reservations.  Breakfast each morning was pure bliss in the newly decorated restaurant and we even had our friend from London meet us for cocktails one night in the clubby bar.  Staying at the Kensington is as close to being mistaken for royalty as one could experience at a hotel.  We look forward to our next visit in 2015.",5,2014,12,05
113,Excellence as usual,"Another great stay at this fantastic hotel. The staff are fantastic always welcoming, friendly and give that personal service, remembered me even though it's been nearly one year since I last visited. 
Great location, fantastic festive hot cider and mince pies on arrival.
The only negative is a new edition of clocks in the room which tick very loudly but can't really complain.",5,2014,12,03

Washroom-super small...While on the WC...one foot needs to b placed in the bath tub which needs a paint job...or maybe a new one.
Don't panic if your bed starts to shake it's just someone walking outside in the extremely narrow corridor wooden flooring.
Take a shower and be careful you could fall out of the small tub and if you survive that then the slippery flooded floor could welcome you.
The lights are dim and not enuf. Had a room facing a wall and some kind of a terrace with dead pigeons. 
The washroom doesn't have a phone so if you have a re-reminder wake up call...wait for it.
The chef in room dinning, honest man. Sincerely appreciate him-I wanted to eat and thought fish and chips (halal option)...  He called back to inform that the oil used is common...thanks.
This hotel has definitely hired the right people otherwise the hotel has nothing exciting about it.
For my Muslim friends, old Brompton street at the back has Beiruti and Bhosporous kebabs (a must try) as halal options...5 mins walk...open till about midnight.",3,2014,12,02
113,Perfect Experience,"From start to finish, a flawless experience. Staff are very efficient, friendly and helpful. The bar is great, good food, and they kept an area for us to have an informal business meeting. The concierge was great and organised transport for our business meetings. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,12,02
113,"In the words of Iggy Azalea, ""I'm SO Fancy!""","Mate, this place is perfection. As a global traveler, the last place I want to rest my American head is in a seedy spot. But from the doorman, to the porter, to the host, to the concierge, these people KNOW how to do hospitality. 

Warm wash cloths welcome weary travelers, hot cider pipping hot served upon entrance, and apple cakes served as sugary carbohydrates makes even Paleo dieters break all the rules. Call me PoshSpice because I'M SO FANCY! (At least that's how the staff makes you feel!)

Yes, my room is a wee bit small but it's LONDON?! I know Texans think bigger-is-better, but quaint is romantic. And speaking of romantic, there is a lighting dimmer to adjust your mood. BowChickaBowWow!

Lastly, the fitness center is modern and spacious. Brilliant!

Spend a few extra pounds and spoil yourself! This place is worth it.",5,2014,12,02
113,Just fabulous.,"After reading many reviews on TripAdvisor I ended up choosing The Kensington for my daughter and I, and we were more than delighted with our accommodations. This was a mom-and-daughter trip for my daughter's 12th birthday. 

**One note to put up top - the tube station closest to the hotel is on the Piccadilly line from Heathrow - if you were planning on taking the Heathrow Express, save yourself the additional transfer and just take the tube straight from Heathrow. The Express is faster into London, but then you would have to change to the tube or take a cab from Paddington. Taking the tube is cheaper and ultimately faster, and you'll get a seat from the beginning. (And after a flight from North America, the last thing you want is another transfer.) From the South Kensington station it's just a two-block walk to the hotel.**

We had a little bit of a hiccup when we checked in - the room we were first shown to was technically what we had reserved (Superior/queen bed) but looked out on the HVAC units of the courtyard and smelled kind of awfully of old cigarette smoke. 

A quick visit to the front desk and many kind apologies later we were relocated within an hour to a truly lovely room, with a picturesque view of Old Brompton Road. Going forward, the stay was flawless. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a centrally located, cozy, convenient little hideaway.

Specifics:
The room was stylish and cozy. not huge, but plenty of room for a week's stay. Mod cons, but with all the charm of an old-school London hotel. The bathrobes and slippers are a nice touch (and two fewer things to bring). The bed was very comfortable, with high quality sheets and duvets, and  feather pillows. The sitting area was tiny, but perfectly adequate and comfortable. We didn't use the minibar, but it was well-stocked. There were also tea things and a Nespresso. The TV was flat-screen with a good range of channels, both local as well as international news stations. Wifi was free and reliable.

The bath was lovely, a great shower, a deep tub, ginormous bath sheets, quality toiletries. Tons of hot water. Heated floors. A hairdryer that actually worked, rather than the feeble ones you usually find in hotels.

We were on the 1st floor (i.e. one up from ground floor) and street noise was never a problem. I'm sure there were other folks staying in the hotel, but noise from other rooms wasn't noticeable. 

The public spaces were gorgeous. We were there just as they were decorating for the holidays and it was really warm and welcoming. We didn't dine in the hotel, but had afternoon tea in the lounge and it was picture-perfect. Attentive waitstaff, really yummy food (PERFECT scones).

The area around the hotel is ideal for tourists. (And admittedly, there are a lot of them in the immediate area.) Extremely convenient to the South Kensington tube station and several bus lines (we took the 74 several times), a Waitrose and Tesco less than a block away, a great selection of easy family options (Pret a Manger, family-friendly pubs, takeaway, nicer sit-down restaurants, it really doesn't get better). There's also Boujis and The Brompton Club, if you're hanging out with that crowd. :) You're a short walk away from Hyde Park if you need to escape the crowds.

We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, and recommend it highly!",5,2014,11,29
113,World Class Hotel in a Great Location,"My son and I arrived at Heathrow from the USA for our first trip to London. We boarded the Piccadilly Line to the South Kensington tube station. The well-placed Kensington Hotel is a short walk from the station (get the Oyster card). Easy access to the Tube means easy access to all of London!  The Kensington neighborhood is beautiful and quiet (which is much appreciated after an evening in Knightsbridge or Piccadilly Circus). The Kensington Hotel, which would be perfect for couples, is very clean and comfortable; the staff are friendly and efficient. I will stay at the Kensington Hotel again!",5,2014,11,29
113,always a pleasure,"top location, great ambience of public spaces, rooms rather small yet stylish, friiendly and welcoming staff. Excellent quality of food and drinks
the perfect place to get you into the XMAS spirit if you stay late in the year",5,2014,11,28
113,Luxury in a great neighborhood.,"The Kensington Hotel is a really special place.  The 10 minute walk from the  train station is delightful - walking past all sorts of coffee places, dessert shops, wine bars, restaurants and shopping.  It gives you a great preview to this delightful neighborhood.  Then when you turn the corner on to Queens Gate it feels like you've arrived at an Oasis. It has a Victorian yet modern feel to it.

The staff were excellent and everything here is held to a very high standard.  My room had been upgraded and was quite large with a huge bathroom and sitting area. With lots of great amenities including an espresso machine. The hotel is made up of several old Victorian building so the room sizes vary greatly - best to check in advance to see what you are getting. 

Just down the street is a great park for running and also sightseeing with a few palaces, ponds and public art.  Several museums are just around the corner and Chelsea and Knightsbridge are an easy walk. 

We also visited the following places in the neighborhood: La Bottega - Italian deli/coffee shop; Vini Italiani - Italian wine bar and the best steak place - Marcellanaio's.",5,2014,11,27
113,Excellent accommodation,"Our stay at this hotel was very comfortable.our room (superior) was a little small, however, the room was very clean all amenities were first class. Plenty of toiletries, towels, robes and slippers. Breakfast was very tasty. Staff were excellent nothing too much trouble. We would definitely stay here again.",4,2014,11,24
113,Strongly recommend The Kensington,"Excellent stay in this comfortable, well situated hotel. Staff was friendly, efficient and capable. Nice room. We enjoyed the lounge area too.The great full breakfast started our day well. We'll return.",5,2014,11,21
113,"Lovely hotel, Very good location","Me and my husband stayed for 4 nights at the Kensington in our trip for exploring London. We are overall satisfied from our stay but there are some negatives. Let‚Äôs start with the positives
(+) The hotel is very beautiful in a beautiful neighborhood. The station is very close as well as nice restaurants. The staff was very helpful and polite. The room was small but we expected from other reviews. The good think is that it was very well organized so we did not have a serious issue. We stayed in the 5th floor and it was very quiet. The area for breakfast was very nice as well as the lobby. The breakfast was very good from the point of ingredients and appearance. 
(-) In our 3day of stay outside our room and in all the 5th floor work of painting were done. A horrible smell was all over the room and we were suffering. The staff was very polite and they  have moved us to another room and floor but that this was not a pleasant procedure. They should have warned us on our arrival. 
On the total we would recommend this hotel to a friend.",4,2014,11,19
113,"Lovely hotel, in amazing location","The service and overall atmosphere of this hotel is lovely, and the location is perfect if you want to be in South London. The hotel's interiors are luxurious and opulent, and we especially loved the twenties-style bar. The room was comfortable and plush, however a little on the small side, but it was fine for just one night. Room service was delicious and very reasonably priced, although watch out for the ¬£6 charge (as to be expected). All in all, it was great as an indulgent stay, and would recommend to couples who'd like to explore the city. The afternoon tea looked very tempting, too!",4,2014,11,18
113,A True London Jewel,"My husband and I stayed at the Kensington Hotel in early November; he'd been to London on several previous occasions, but this was my first visit. I can honestly say that I'll never stay anywhere else after this visit. The staff at the Kensington are incredible in their efficiency and incredibly welcoming in their attitude. From the minute we checked in, we were made to feel right at home, as every member of the staff go out of their way to greet you and make sure you're comfortably accommodated. By the second day, we were greeted by name by virtually everyone on staff--a small touch that made a large impression. Two members of the staff merit special mention here: Amy, one of the managers, was especially gracious in arranging our accommodations and Martin, the concierge, was spot-on with his every recommendation and thorough in following up to make sure that we'd enjoyed the arrangements he'd made. You could not ask for better, more personal, or more professional treatment than that which was provided by these two. After switching from an interior room (209, too dark) we enjoyed a splendid superior queen room (211) that looked out upon Old Brompton Rd. The room was spotless, well appointed and wonderfully comfortable, boasting a good-sized bathroom with delightful drenching rain shower head. The location of the Kensington is perfect--close to the Albert Hall and several museums and a 15 minute walk to Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. The South Kensington tube stop is a 2 minute walk, linking you with all the many delights and sights of greater London. There are several outstanding restaurants and comfy pubs within easy walking distance (we found several, thanks to Martin), and just walking around the neighborhood leads to myriad exciting discoveries. Apart from the restaurants in the immediate vicinity, the hotel restaurant is a find in itself, providing a delectable menu from breakfast through dinner (my husband is still singing the praises of the filet)! The bar is also quite nice, its dark wood and refined lighting providing a relaxed, comfortable atmosphere, and the lounge area, with its two fireplaces, is the perfect place to unwind with a late-night cocktail or snack. It is, at once, both luxurious and completely cozy. It's what your living room would be like, if only you could fit several couches and several more chairs into your living room. All told, the Kensington Hotel is the sort of five-star accommodation that truly begs for more stars. It is a delight in every regards, made all the more enjoyable by the people who staff it. We already are looking forward to our next visit, which cannot come soon enough.",5,2014,11,17
113,Fantastic service,"My wife and I stayed at The Kensington for a long weekend to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The hotel is in an excellent location and has recently been renovated to a very high standard. Although the rooms are small, they are very comfortable with high quality bed linen and bathroom accessories. However, what was truly outstanding were the staff. They were so friendly and so accommodating. It is rare in our experience to have experienced such a high level of service. They found out about our anniversary and left chocolates and a card in the room. A really nice touch. We will certainly return. ",5,2014,11,17
113,Excellent Staff,I really enjoyed during my stay in the Kensington Hotel. I am totally satisfied with the comfort and cleanliness of the hotel. Warm and welcoming staff helped us in every subject. Special thanks to George and Elisa for their friendliness :),5,2014,11,17

113,Wonderful,"A wonderful hotel within walking distance of South Kensington tube station.  After a long journey, we were greeted with a quick yet friendly service and warm refreshing face cloths.  The staff were all very helpful, knowledgeable and nothing was too much trouble.   The hotel restaurant was fantastic and mozzarella starter out of this world! The room was comfortable and turn down service excellent.  Check out was no trouble and bottled water for our onward journey was provided.  Fantastic experience, will definitely return.",5,2014,11,17
113,So average,"Initial impressions were great as the outside is very nice and the reception is as expected for a 5*. 

We were welcomed by very nice staff and given our room keys with no problems. 

For a 5* I was very surprised with the room. Nothing superior about our room. I wouldn't want to see the standard room as ours is very small. 

There is no table for the Mrs to do her make up which you get at mediocre hotels. There's a mirror on the inside of the wardrobe but no chair. Just enough room for the bags and two of us. The toilet is very small with a shower above the bath. 

The decor inside is ok but lacking in some places. The 4th floor down lights outside the elevator have been put in very roughly. They look cheap and not on par with a 5*. This is something that should be picked up and sorted by management. 

Water hasn't been replaced daily which I would have expected. The sugar wasn't topped up either. 

Pretty poor really considering we've stayed at other 5* hotels in London for less. Had 3 times as much room and better service. 

Unless you've got a suite I would look elsewhere. 

We won't be back unfortunately. Nice staff let down by average rooms.",2,2014,11,17

113,Fantastic,"We stayed 5 nights at The Kensington Hotel and the overall experience was fantastic. We have stayed in many 5 star hotels throughout Europe yet The Kensington Hotel experience stands out in every category. Staff were extremely helpful. Room decor was magnificent and lobby, bar and restaurant were super warm. Neighborhood is awesome. It is not too touristy or quiet. There are so many nice restaurants or sight-seeings within walking distance. 

Thanks so much for making our trip so memorable.",5,2014,11,14
113,Perfect!,This is a lovely hotel in a fantastic location.The staff were so helpful and friendly. The hotel is beautifully deigned and decorated. Our room was perfect and very quiet. I will definitely stay here again.,5,2014,11,13
113,Amazing,"I recently was in london visiting my daughter who lives there. On my last day I decided to check us into a nice hotel so we could have a spa day and relax. 
There was a small hiccup with our reservation the manager upgraded our room and was incredibly considerate. 
We enjoyed a lovely tea in the afternoon before our spa services, when we returned to the hotel we had a fantastic dinner in a very charming dining room that was lined in bookcases that we were able to take up to our room to read. 
We had a lovely fruit platter with our turn down service which was just perfect 
The room was lovely, the bathroom was very modern and had lovely amenities. 
I couldn't ask for a better ending to a wonderful visit with my daughter. 
The location was perfect for londin as well 
Plus it took only 30 minutes to get to Heathrow in the morning",5,2014,11,12
113,"Outstanding Service, fantastic location","wonderful ambience of old world luxury.  We had the breakfast plan, and was the best choice.  The food was fresh and delicious with lots of variety either continental with fresh squeezed juices, buttery croissants  and lattes, or off the menu choices.  The subway was a 5 minute walk.  When we were tired at night there were alot of good restaurants around the corner.  Museums and Kensington Palace all within walking distance as well.  Would recommend to 
friends without hesitation.  ",5,2014,11,11
113,Second visit even better than the first.,"Last time I had one gripe ( that I couldn't open one wardrobe door ).The management responded to my review and said it would be attended to.
This visit they delivered it all - friendly, professional, welcoming, cosy comfortable and stylish and wardrobe doors that both opened fully. I wish more hotels were as fabulous as The Kensington. I am planning my next visit!",5,2014,11,10
113,Good experience,"I was traveling for work with meetings in Kensington. I had never stayed in the area before and was very happy with the service, room was better than average, and restaurant/bar area had a nice feel. It's more of a destination for leisure travel (e.g. there was a wedding party staying there as well) but I would stay there again if I had to be in the area. The neighborhood seems residential.",5,2014,11,09
113,Wonderful hotel and staff,"We have just returned from a 2 night stay at the Kensington Hotel after getting married in London.  Wow!  Our room had been upgraded to a studio and decorated with rose petals, and we had been left a tray of fresh fruit and a bottle of prosecco on ice.  All of the staff were so friendly and wanted to make our stay special. Breakfast was included in our deal and was fantastic, we had the choice of the continental selection and the a la carte menu. A magical start to married life and it was very difficult to leave this morning. Will definitely return.",5,2014,11,09
113,Helped me out of two major crises ,"I was stranded in London and needed emergency accommodation - sylvia helped me and saw I had a quaint but very 
live-able room . The hotel is fantastic - just brilliant with excellent bar and attention to detail . My fianc√© lost her engaged ring at the airport and was assisted by Michael who told her about heathrow lost and found and miraculously it was returned !! This is more than a hotel - they are a like a caring circle of friends . Wished I could of stayed longer !! ",5,2014,11,09
113,A lovely hotel ...,"We stayed at The Kensington Hotel for a special occasion, and the staff couldn‚Äôt have been more kind or helpful.  The hotel is in a great location, right in the heart of South Kensington so you have access to lots of bars and restaurants in the area, along with the V&A, Natural History Museum and so forth.

On arrival, we found that we have been upgraded which was much appreciated.  The Studio Suite was a good size with a separate sitting area.  The four poster bed was comfortable and each night of our stay, the turn down service left us a little treat.  The bathroom was a bit on the small side, and didn‚Äôt feel as nicely done as the rest of the suite, but it was ok.  The room included a Nespresso coffee machine, along with a kettle.

We opted for a rate which included breakfast, but I think you can book a room only rate and there are plenty of places to get breakfast in the area, along with lunch and dinner.  The hotel breakfast was the usual fare of croissants, bread, cheese, cereals, yoghurt, fruit etc all of which were plentiful and tasted fresh.  Hot food was available at an extra cost.

The common rooms are nicely decorated and feel warm and welcoming.  There is also a gym.  The hotel serves afternoon tea which looked very good!

My only slight gripe is there was a delay when answering emails before we confirmed our booking, and also prior to our arrival which was a bit frustrating.  This is certainly an area which could be bettered; however, once we arrived, the staff were incredibly helpful and efficient at dealing with anything we asked of them.",5,2014,11,08
113,Lovely Comfortable Hotel,"I forgot I had not reviewed this hotel.  We stayed here a while back but it was an enjoyable experience.  We opted for a room only basis as we wanted to go out and about for breakfast.  We have actually stayed at this hotel on a previous occasion and returned because we enjoyed the comfort and location.  It is just a couple of tube stops to get into the centre and you can walk if you don't mind.  It is a large traditional hotel with a boutique feel to it.

On both occasions the room was clean, comfortable and well organised although on the small side.  In fact we couldn't both be in the bathroom at the same time.  But you are not staying there to spend all day in the bathroom.  There was no real space to store the toiletries bag without moving the surplus items you tend to find in bathrooms.  Perhaps as we were in London to shop it was our problem but the floor space was limited for our bags so they were all piled on top of each other.  They provided for guests, umbrellas a useful item for British weather.  If you go above the basic room, I imagine it would be larger but can say for sure.

Afternoon tea is lovely and very popular so if you want make sure you book in advance because you are very unlikely to be able to just book on the day.  We ate in the restaurant and the food was lovely and very well executed.  The cocktail lounge is great and the mixologist was very good.  All the lounges are very comfortable with lots of coffee books and table sizes and we managed to find somewhere to sit most evenings for a drink.  

Only problem we experienced was asking for coffee on the morning of our departure, we waited for an hour as we were busy filling in our customs forms and despite asking several times, it never appeared.  Lesson learnt never ask for coffee when they are doing breakfast service - they are too busy.  Check out and check in was easy and I like the bottle of water on departure as generally you are travelling and this saves you getting some en route.  The refreshing towels are something travellers are beginning to expect and a welcome touch.",4,2014,11,06
113,enjoyable stay,"Very nice hotel and comfortable  room although smaller than I expected. (but it is London)  The bathroom was nice but also very small. Not enough room for 2 people at once.

We stayed for two nights and i,m delighted to say it was a world of difference to our original stay .

113,Excellent Hotel,"We booked the Hotel through the Eurostar site and were hoping for a lot  and we were not disappointed. It is quite easy to get to the Hotel form St. Pancras International by taking Piccadilly tube/metro line (South Kensington Station) and then you need to walk 5 more minutes to the Hotel. The area is very nice with a lot of good restaurants nearby. Staff was very friendly and helpful and catered to our every request immediately. Hotel is very nicely furnished in classical style and very well maintained. Rooms are a bit small, or at least the one we were staying in, but that would be my only ""grievance"" with the Hotel. They are very nicely furnished and include everything that you need (safe, hair-dryer, coffee machine, etc.). There is also a gym on the Ground level. Breakfast was good and hefty and the choice was quite good. What we loved was the afternoon Tea, where you could sample some fine foods and beverages in a very comfortable salon and it turned out to be a real treat. All in all, a very comfortable and pleasant experience. ",5,2014,11,04
113,Great Location  - Good Value,I really enjoyed this hotel.  The staff is exceptionally friendly and accommodating.  It's also a bonus that a Barclay's Bike stand is right outside.  It's so convenient.  Hyde Park is right up the street!,4,2014,11,03
113,Beautiful hotel ideally located.,Had a wonderful stay here for 4 nights. Rooms are small but comfortable. And everyone here are extremely friendly and accommodating. George was especially friendly and I was treated wonderfully every time I sat in the lounge. If I return to London I will definitely come back.  ,5,2014,11,03
113,Fabulous. Already planning another stay!,"I just loved this hotel! Masses of character in an area that is part residential, part business and part everything else. Great for Imperial College, the museums, Albert Hall etc. A quick stroll is all that is needed to South Ken tube station. I only stayed for one night, and on my own, so I did end up with a somewhat small room at the back of the hotel with no view at all but this was no big deal really (the bathroom was extremely small too in all honesty). Extremely well equipped room and bathroom with top quality linens and toiletries! And a proper hair dryer! Full marks for that! I only had a drink in the bar in the evening and breakfast  the following morning but both were excellent. The staff are superb especially on the front desk, the concierge desk and the guys calling taxis at the front. Planning to stay over Christmas as their Christmas brochure looks lovely!",5,2014,11,02
113,Perfect,"Booked this hotel for a few days based on reviews and location (close proximity to our son whom we we visiting). Great location! Close to the tube, shops, restaurants, pubs, museums.. What a beautiful area. I found it to be posh and elegant. Room was a bit small but the marble bath with rain shower was great. The sitting rooms in the lobby were lovely with fireplaces and cozy coaches and chairs. Did not have any meals here but aftenoon tea was terrific. A shout out to the concierges and staff for being so wonderful. Our phone was not working and we had to change our flight.They could not have been more patient and helpful. THANK YOU!",5,2014,11,02
113,Almost perfect hotel in great location,"We stayed for one night at the Kensington to go to a concert at the Albert Hall which is just a short walk away. The location of this hotel is fantastic, being close to South Kensington tube and a number of shops, restaurants and pubs, as well as the Natural History, Science and V&A museums which are within a couple of streets' walk. Hotel lobby and reception staff were welcoming and helpful and our room was very nice, larger than I had expected from other reviews here, and we overlooked the Old Brompton Road which is a pleasant and interesting view. Some nice touches in the room were free WiFi, choice of bottled water and a Nespresso coffee machine with choice of pods. We found the bed very comfortable and the room was quiet - no noise from other rooms or from outside. The only negative was that the shower looked dirty (though it wasn't) because the dark grey stone shower floor had been permanently stained by water which was rather unappealing. Also not all of us have 4 foot long arms in order to reach the loo roll which was helpfully positioned across the room from the toilet instead of next to it! That aside, no complaints and the supplied toiletries (Aromatherapy Associates) were of a high quality. Breakfast the next morning was plentiful and delicious, and in a lovely room which felt like a stately home's library/drawing room marred only by the annoying and intrusive background music which was definitely of the 1980s department store variety - not at all appropriate for the hotel ambiance. Would have been better to have none, or perhaps something classical instead. Regardless, I would definitely recommend the Kensington and would stay here again in future.",4,2014,10,31
113,Great Location and Quiet,"Everything you look for in a London hotel. Classic Stucco exterior, two minutes walk to a bustling hub (South Kensington) and common areas that are calm and polished. The building itself is suitably cute - this is definitely old London and the corridors are narrow and winding. The room I had had a wonderful view over to the turrets of the Natural History Museum. The room itself was small but fine as was the bathroom. My only criticism is that the wardrobe door was stuck so I couldn't hang up my clothes. I could have called down but by the time I realized it was too late.",5,2014,10,31
113,quick London stay,"We were looking for an elegant hotel and a convenient location for a 2 night stay before a transatlantic cruise. The staff was wonderful!  Our first room was quite tiny..... We had ALOT of baggage but they were very gracious and found us another room that was definitely larger and much more to our liking! We spent the day walking to Harrods, seeing some sights and took the tube to go see a show and dinner.  Our only issue was that night we were rather wet from the rainy weather and tired and wanted to take nice cozy showers upon our return late at night...... But the water in our room was stuck and only boiling hot water would come out..... From both the sink and shower!!!!! They immediately sent someone up to check however it could not easily be fixed and by then it was very late. They offered to move our room to sleep however we opted to shower in the other room and remain in our first room instead of packing up again in the middle of the night.
The next day the management was very apologetic AND fixed the plumbing issue AND treated us to breakfast and cocktails and sent us a very nice note. We realize issues can happen anywhere.... It's the fact that they were very attentive and did fix it and also did what they could to make up for the chaos of our first night that says to us we would return to the Kensington again!  Thank you for a special few days in London.

113,Offers a lot but does it really deliver?,"My first time at The kensington was not the best. The bed linen was torn and when i complained initially i was told this was normal!!!! Fortunately a very nice porter, called Ronnie was delivering my luggage at the time, and offered to sort out the linen for me. The barman in the lounge area was totally disinterested in being of service and got our afternoon tea order wrong. The receptionist accused me of having a ¬£32 breakfast when i explained I didn't she continued with her accusations. By far the best member of staff was Ronnie but the rest need more training! On the plus side the lounge areas with open fires are delightful and the location is good.",3,2014,10,29
113,Fantastic London Experience,"From beginning to end, everything about my three nights at the Kensington was fantastic. The ladies at the desk greeted me very warmly. Oto was an excellent bellman, helping me with directions as well as giving me great service with my luggage at the beginning and end of my stay.  The hotel is really beautiful.  All of the bartenders were excellent. Alessandro was friendly and welcoming and made excellent drinks.  Martin and Michael were excellent concierges. They booked all my tours, including the symphony at Royal Albert Hall which is in walking distance.  I said to my friend who recommended the hotel, ""Why would anyone stay anywhere else?""  It was a true pleasure to stay there.",5,2014,10,28
113,"Perfect spot, friendly staff, must stay for London","We stayed here for one night and found it an ideal place for a quick stopover on London. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The location is ideal, with the National History and Science Museum and the end of the road!! Oxford Street, Harrods, Hyde Park are close by and the staff were very friendly in helping us arrange our night out to go see a West End Show. We had breakfast as well which was very tasty and we will think twice about stopping at another hotel next time we're planning a weekend away in London.",5,2014,10,27
113,Almost perfect,"We just stayed at the Kensington Hotel for the second time. It is a lovely hotel with nice sized rooms (by London standards) and very comfy beds. The staff is wonderful and location is great. The only downside is the noise. You can hear people walking in the hall and on the floor above you, plus this trip we could hear people talking several different times. Thankfully, we didn't hear a thing between midnight and 7 a.m. ",4,2014,10,26
113,"Great location, generally great service","my wife and I had a junior suite for 9 nights.  Overall, our review is quite favourable, but there initially were glitches that ought not happen at a hotel of this caliber. 

The first night, a fuse/circuit breaker blew and we got by using the flashlight on my phone to find our way around (the box being in another guest room and it being quite late)   Not the greatest introduction!  Fixed the next day with apologies. The suite (118) was nice, but at night the hotel floodlights beamed strongly into the room.  We asked for another room, and hotel staff said they would email us the next day if one became available.  One did, but no-one bothered to email us and the room was given to another couple.  2 strikes.  After expressing displeasure at the front desk, the manager called me in the room. After some discussion, he offered a profuse apology and promised a new room the next day.  They did move us the next day, and to a much nicer suite (123).  

From that point on, everything was much better. Staff in the main lobby were very helpful (thanks Otto and Michael).  Cleaning staff were first-rate. Breakfast was busy at times, but service generally was top notch.  The hotel lunch/dinner menu could use a refresh, but we didn't book the hotel for its restaurant.  

The hotel's location is excellent.  Fairly quiet street (for London), very nice area with decent restaurants nearby, and very close to the National History Museum, Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park

A few rough patches at the start but overall a very good experience and we recommend the hotel.  ",4,2014,10,20
113,Such a Beautiful Luxury Hotel,I went here for the night during my trip to London and did afternoon tea here. Great for people watching and amazing rooms. This is a very nice hotel and the staff is even better. I loved my time here and would recommend coming here to any friends. It is in a perfetc location to walk to the best museums in London.,5,2014,10,20
113,Excellent Hotel and Location.,"This was our first trip to London and we had a lot of options as to where to stay...luckily we found the Kensington. Located walking distance from the Natural History museum and one block from the ""tube"" made it's location very desirable. The staff was very helpful and seemed very happy to be able to assist in resolving our questions and needs.",5,2014,10,19
113,Great location pleasant staff,"I stayed at the Kensington recently while attending a function in London. A wonderful central location- Hyde park just down the road. Natural history museum very close by. The hotel is beautifully decorated. The sitting room is very warm with open fires. The rooms are very comfortable, great beds and well,appointed bathrooms. The nespresso machine was a nice touch. If looking for central London this is a solid hotel choice. Lift broke down while I was there but staff were very pleasant while fixing it.",4,2014,10,15
113,A bit disappoint,"The hotel staff at the front desk n concierge where very friendly and helpful, the hotel room was very pleasant and clean, but for the staff in the bar area and for breakfast where not good, we order breakfast from the menu and had to wait 20 minutes then they forgot the eggs or the toast, the meals also at night we had to wait 20 minutes or more, then it was nice to walk into our room at night to see it set up for us, but the chocolate left of our pillow was a nice touch but their was only one.",4,2014,10,13
113,"Book this hotel, you won't be disappointed","The Kensington is the most beautiful hotel, d√©cor is fab. But what makes a great hotel are the staff and we were treated like royalty while staying there. The room was so comfortable, one of the best sleeps I've had in a hotel.  Book this hotel and you won't be disappointed.  ",5,2014,10,13
113,Comfortable and Convenient,"My son and I had a 6 night stay here recently and couldn't have been happier with the location. A short stroll to South Kensington Station as well as an amazing variety of restaurants.  Also nearby are a couple of small supermarkets and a pharmacy, very handy.  We stayed in a twin deluxe room which was small but perfect for our needs. A beautiful free standing claw foot bath was a great way to finish off a full on day of sight seeing. I can't comment on the food as we didn't eat in the restaurant but the bar and restaurant looked very tempting.  Concierge staff were always very helpful and knowledgable. This hotel is a welcome refuge after a hard day on your feet. Would definitely recommend staying here and will be back,",5,2014,10,12
113,Awesome,"The hotel is elegant, very clean and beautiful. Location superb. Completely worth the price - apples, chocolates and nespresso machines are great extras. We totally enjoyed our staying there. The beds are very clean and the pillows are so comfortable. Also the breakfast is delicious. For sure I'm going to come back again. I have already booked 3 superior double rooms for my boss for their business vocation!",5,2014,10,09
113,"1st Trip Abroad, 1st Trip Alone..",I stayed here for 6 days in March. The staff at The Kensington Hotel were wonderfully accommodating. It being my first trip abroad and alone I had no idea how to navigate the city. The concierge was more then helpful my entire stay there. My room was clean and comfortable so no complaints there. My only gripe was that there was a mini-fridge in the room full and locked. It would have been nice to have been able to keep my own items cold. As a result I was constantly asking for ice to cool my beverages. was still an awesome stay tho! I've already booked my second ever trip to London but unfortunately the Kensington had no vacancies this time.. xo,5,2014,10,06
113,Outstanding Hotel Experience!,"The Kensington was perfect!   The room and bathroom comfortable and luxurious, the restaurant had excellent service and wonderful food, and the staff were so responsive and accomodating.  And close to Kensington Palace and the Museum of Natural History.  We would happily stay there any time!",5,2014,10,03
113,Room built for One Person,"Just a very small room.  Perfect if you are traveling by yourself, but unfortunately, I was traveling with my wife.  Just no place for two people and two bags.  Not to mention, no plug in the bathroom to use a hairdryer.

But if you think the room is small, the bathroom is even smaller.  I am not a big guy (6ft 185lbs), but I barely fit in the shower!

Very clean, and service is great.",4,2014,10,03
113,"Fantastic stay, amazing bed, wonderful people","Just a great stay in a lot of ways.  I had a good feeling the minute I walked in the doors.

Exceptional service, dangerously comfortable bed with perfect sheets, blankets, and pillows (ask for wake-up calls, set all of your devices), sparkling clean bathroom with great towels and toiletries, a thoughtful housekeeping staff, turndown service w/ chocolate on pillow, a NESPRESSO god-send machine in-room, 24-hour room service, fabulous smiling employees everywhere you turn or whenever you dial, lovely decor, awesome location.

Residential location, but that doesn't mean boring - it means you get to enjoy living in a neighborhood where you would actually want to live if you moved there.   Fun pubs, wine bars, cafes, bakeries, wine stores, parks all nearby.  There is a bike share rack across from hotel and you can ride for days.  ""Only"" downside is that there aren't many late night bars nearby if your body clock is off and you're not tired.   

Was running to a meeting and the concierge (martin I believe) told me I should take the tube bec there were traffic and cab issues that morning - took his advice and he was right, and when I came home at night 8 hours later, he remembered and asked me how it went. His advice saved me.   So kind and personal, and just one example of how great the people are who work here.

And the room - small, but beautifully designed and wonderful.  

Loved this hotel, and I know hotels.",5,2014,10,02
113,Perfect.,"We stayed at the Kensington Hotel for 3 wonderful nights.  What a beautiful hotel.

The staff was courteous and attentive.  They were professional yet always warm.  

Our room was clean and well appointed, though a bit on the small side.  It served its purpose well, though.  Although the bathroom was very small, it was extremely well designed and worked out perfectly for us.  

The hotel has a bar and lounge area downstairs.  We spent part of one evening having coffee/tea in one of the beautifully appointed rooms downstairs.  Our waiter was very nice.  The atmosphere -- what are a million different ways to say ""wonderful""?  We stayed there quite some time just soaking up the ambiance.  That was probably the most peaceful and relaxing evening of our entire trip.

This hotel is located near an Underground station, just a few minutes walk.  The area is very nice but not stuffy.  There are many restaurants in the area (tons of Italian restaurants as well as other types of food, too.)  Also close to Victoria and Albert Museum, not too far from Harrods.  Pretty much centrally located.  It was very easy for us to navigate the city from this location.

I love, love, love this hotel and their staff and hope to return.",5,2014,10,02
113,Our hotel of choice in London,A fantastic luxury hotel located in a very smart area of the city. We were attending a musical in the West End and The Kensington is a short taxi ride or a few stops on the underground away from Piccadilly. We enjoyed a delicious breakfast and evening meal during our stay and the service was very friendly and efficient. The staff were aware that we were in London celebrating my partner's birthday and they really made an effort to ensure our stay was extra special. Overall great value for money and we will definitely be staying here again.,5,2014,10,02
113,Charming & chic Kensington hotel | London,Lovely and charming hotel conveniently located near the South Kensington tube station. Great for business and couples travelling on holiday. The hotel staff are warm and sincere. A great oasis in a great city.,5,2014,10,02
113,homely and relaxed hotel,"The hotel is in a great part of town to explore but it's also useful being so well connected by transport to get around. The hotel is lovely - and the bed very comfy and the room was quiet for a sound sleep! all staff was very flexible about everything and no request was too big for them and so welcoming: happy to chat to and very interesting. Lovely range of breakfast provided, just sorry I didn't have more time to relax and enjoy the hospitality. Thank you so much for having me and I recommend this hotel to each London traveller.",5,2014,10,01
113,Gorgeous Hotel,"I enjoyed my recent stay at The Kensington Hotel. The lobby area is gorgeous and love the decor and all of the details. The rooms as other reviewers have stated are on the small side however, this is London and that is the way it is. My only complaint would be that upon check in, the gentleman checking me in must have been new or training. My reservation had been prepaid - he forgot to ask for my credit card for incidentals and therefore when I went out of the day and came back to my room I was locked out. I was annoyed that I had to go back downstairs to find out why my key didn't work. A note on the door would have been appreciated but simply locked out was a bit demeaning to me especially when at the fault of the check in staff . I was also told incorrectly that breakfast was included in my rate when it wasn't by the same check in individual .

Otherwise, a very lovely and comfortable stay and I do recommend this hotel. Close to the tube stop and shops and restaurants.",4,2014,10,01
113,Lovely.  Will return,"Porter Oto, Martyn concierge and Jennifer front desk/manager were outstanding for me
 Yes the toilet in my small room was very odd. But the lovely staff made up for it. I actually wanted to stay longer but they were full up
 I will return.   Breakfast was as another guest described as a ""debacle""  the breakfast food average or slightly below on some items and forgetting things or bringing overcooked cold eggs etc
.no toast etc. That is semi forgiven as the genuine warmth of the staff.  I would highly recommend.
Very comfortable
 Once again thanks to Jennifer martyn and oto
.standouts in customer service 
Housekeeping too.
Please get some xl robes and slippers too

113,Very small rooms and bathroom.,"Hotel itself looks good and clean. Concierge was very nice. Me and my partner been re-directed from Pelham hotel ( just 5 min. walk) to Kensington hotel, because of some mysterious reasons. When we saw our room ( which been booked by Pelham) it was so, so small! There was only space for the bed, and u can hear air conditioners from the street! We asked to change it, but next one was on the first floor and from the window u can see court yard with gates. Last room we took was a bit bigger, anyway hotel been fully  booked and i had go to meetings.  In general staff was very friendly, but i wouldn't stay there anymore just because i don't want any surprises with rooms.",3,2014,09,28
113,Friendly staff,I stayed at two hotels while in London . The Kensington Hotel was the first. From the moment I entered everyone was very friendly and helpful. My only negative is the small room and even smaller shower. The charm of the hotel and excellent staff make up for any small shower though. I wish I remembered the name of the front desk girl who always greeted me with a smile and a few kind words. ( she was blonde) . I have recommended The Kensington Hotel to other friends.,4,2014,09,27
113,perfect stay,"We only stayed here for two nights, and we really wish we could have stayed longer. Its an absolutely stunning and immaculate hotel room, easily one of the best I've ever stayed in. The d√©cor and attention to detail are fantastic, as are the location and the views!
 
They provided a lovely light continental breakfast in the room along with plenty of surprise snacks, which are refreshed daily. The kingsized bed is super comfy, and the wardrobe made me wish I'd brought more clothes!
 
Location-wise, kensington is just a few minutes from Knightsbridge, and there are a couple of nice pubs even closer. Plenty of leaflets and walking guides are provided from the concierge so you'll never be short of ideas of things to do.
 
Finally, George was a lovely host, quick to serve and welcome us, helpful and very friendly and accommodating when we did, I can't recommend this hotel enough!",5,2014,09,27
113,All the glows is not gold,"Nice bldg nice location, nice hotel, shame about the housekeeping dept and menu selection. Even atfer we called up reception and complained, the same things kept happening ... no water in room, room was not done till the afternoon ..
      
      ",2,2014,09,26
113,Amazing hotel with top staff,"This is a truly fantastic hotel. We were travelling with our daughter who is a toddler so were feeling a little apprehensive but all staff were amazing, the hotel is beautiful in a great, safe location and I can't find a negative word to say at all. If you're visiting London and want a top notch place to stay then this is your answer.",5,2014,09,26
113,Pleasant Stay,"The hotel is very nice.  The room is equipped with multiple outlet styles (UK, US & European, I believe) which is great for international travelers. I was a little disappointed that the bathroom didn't have a regular outlet (it only had a 'shaver' outlet), but there were mirrors in the main room so I could do my hair out there.  The bed was nice, though a little hard in my opinion.  The staff was helpful and friendly.  It is in a nice location, near shopping, museums & Hyde Park.  ",5,2014,09,25
113,Great location and atomosphere,"This is a great and underrated hotel based on the reviews here. The location is basically unbeatable because no matter where you stay, you have to take the tube at some point so you want to be close to the best stop possible and South Kensington is perfect, takes you everywhere. Also, the breakfast is great, the decor is perfectly traditional without being stodgy, and the staff are very helpful, even though I didn't really need them for anything because everything is all set. The room was comfortable and relatively large considering it's London. Will definitely stay again.",5,2014,09,24
113,Excellent but expensive!,"Excellent and very tasty breakfast and lovely dining area, rooms a bit small but in perfect condition!excellent service, perfect location... Reception area a bit cold, unpersonal but very efficient. In the heart of South Kensington!",4,2014,09,24
113,We loved it!,The hotel location and the physical appearance of the hotel is a plus but the real excellence of this hotel lies with the service and the personalites of the staff.  We can't say enough.  They must all have to pass some congeniality test.,5,2014,09,23
113,Great Place,"We stayed at the Kensington Hotel London for 6 days. It was the best. Great room, excellent service and staff, particularly Martin, who went out of their way to help. Location was great also. Close to many fabulous eateries and transport - both bus and train. Would highly recommend for a stay in London. We would certainly go back should the opportunity arise. Olga & Ray",5,2014,09,23
113,Food / Atmosphere,Has to be my favourite hotel in London. The Guinness Bread as a starter in the restaurant is the best bread I have ever eaten. It has a great atmosphere inside (lovely scented candles) and the location is perfect.,5,2014,09,22
113,Booking mix up,"It is a shame that this hotel let itself down by allocating us the wrong room that was booked via Trip Advisor and despite writing a complaint to this affect they have ignored us with not even an acknowledgement.  Its a shame because the rooms are good , the staff are excellent and friendly, the reception rooms are very comfortable and the food very good.  We had a lovely stay despite the mix up but disappointed by their lack of response",4,2014,09,21
113,Lovely Small Hotel with a great staff,"I really enjoyed staying here.  I have been to London many many times and never have stayed here.  Vincent and Jennifer were wonderful.  Cabs were easy to hire.  Quiet Room.  Nice Restaurant and an Excellent Location.
I traveled to another city in the UK and left my Bag there for my return.  This was very convenient for me.",5,2014,09,21
113,Lovely Hotel,I feel at home in this place. The staff treat me well and remember the drinks I have on every visit. Alessandro is the best bar man in Kensington. George is always at end to help. The entire staff is excellent. ,5,2014,09,21
113,Fantastic Stay,"We had a wonderful 5 day stay at this hotel. It is located 4 minutes from the tube station and there are plenty of restaurants around the hotel. Despite the great location it still remains quiet which is one thing I loved. The AC worked very well and the room was large for London. It was an average size American room in my opinion. The shower was very nice as well. They also provided bottled water everyday in our rooms, which was a nice touch.
Our room Included breakfast with the rate. Breakfast was excellent every morning. The eggs, hot cakes, and waffles were highlights. In fact the waffles were better than we had in Belgium later on our trip. 
I would stay here again. For a quiet, good sized room ask for room 523. It is on the top floor at the end of the hallway and doesn't face the street.",5,2014,09,20
113,Excellent hotel,Myself and my daughter stayed for 2 nights at the end of August and it was a real treat. This is my 3rd time staying at this hotel and would be more except that it hasn't always been available when trying to book. Great hotel and staff and the breakfasts were delicious. We hope to be back again! Ciara,5,2014,09,20
113,Excellent hotel,"The location is good, close to the tube. The hotel is everything a hotel should be - spick and span, excellent service by the staff, beautiful decor and rooms. Even the nice touches like the special tomorrow's weather forecast left on the bed each night. 
Would definitely return. ",5,2014,09,20
113,Friendly and top class,Only there one night but you are made welcome from the minute you walk into the lobby. There is a lovely aroma and exudes a homily feeling. It is very much an escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.,5,2014,09,17
113,Thank you for an excellent experience,"We feel so lucky and grateful to have found such a beautiful place to stay during our visit to the London The place itself has the perfect balance between the comfort and facilities of a 7-star hotel room and the coziness and warmth of a family home. The bed is unbelievably comfy and it smells great! The sheets, towels and robes were very clean, fluffy and soft. There is plenty of space for clothes and other things you may bring and the bathroom is squeaky clean and warm... There are a lot of traditional English Pubs and the closest pub to the hotel looked like it was built in the 1500's and it offers a great atmosphere plus AMAZING ales. Inside the restaurant there are books for all ages and a whole bunch of information booklets about most areas of London. This hotel is very close to many great shops and cheese and wine stores. We have no complaints whatsoever... even the price is great! As you can probably tell, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and were actually a bit bummed out we couldn't stay any longer. Many thanks and all the best for Frits the general manager (Amy, George and all his other lovely staff).",5,2014,09,16
113,Lovely charming hotel,"Stayed here for a short journey in London and really loved it the hotel is spacious, personal and full of charming and traditional ambiance. The checking was good and the rooms were good enough by Europe standards though a little bit smaller for the states standards. I loved having breakfast and every time being fully looked after by George, A very extraordinary server. The interior are refreshingly new and the whole scene is warm and relaxed. would definitely stay here once again.",5,2014,09,16
113,Impressive Hotel in perfect location,"The hotel is pristine, the staff friendly and the surrounding area buzzing with life.....in other words, the perfect location for a weekend in the City.  Couldn't find any faults.....which in my book, says a lot.  Highly recommended.",5,2014,09,16
113,Like being in your very own stylish and luxurious palace,"I've been back to this hotel three times now so that should say it all. The rooms are each bespoke and very tastefully decorated with classic English styles mixed with a plush and modern twist. It's not just the bedrooms though, I love to invite friends and family over to the hotel for afternoon tea/champagne and scones (with fresh cream and jam of course) or cocktails (who knew whiskey and bacon would be so yummy). Doing so takes the stress out of travelling across town in London which can take forever, when I know that I can instead relax and enjoy what almost feels like my own decadent palace. Staff are lovely and impeccably competent. It's 5 mins by cab to Sloane Square, THE place to enjoy a civilised shop in London in my view, and a walk away from the natural history museum which is always a treat. Love it.",5,2014,09,15
113,Very very nice!,"Stayed here just for the night. Great location, and very nice rooms. The beds are amazing and the bathrooms are very luxurious. My room was facing the road, but was still well insulated. Sooo...the negatives.. The doors in the rooms makes lots of noise, when being closed. But this is an older building, so has to be expected. Next the restaurant. I ate dinner there & the food was very nice. But..there appears to be a lack of staff, so the staff on duty were tending to run/rush everywhere, which is ok at an American diner, but not at a 5 star hotel. So I found dinner a bit uncomfortable & not relaxing, considering the surroundings are very serene. To end on a positive, is that most I of the staff I encountered was very friendly and professional. Great building and terrific bar. I will go back!",4,2014,09,14
113,Wonderful weekend in London,"Loved our stay here, excellent location few mins from tube and museums. Wonderful staff who made us so welcome and would do anything for you. Lovely breakfast and very comfy bed. Room was quite small but was aware of that when booking and it had everything you could possibly need including nexpresso machine.
      ",5,2014,09,14
113,Just amazing,"Great location. Very nice rooms. Great service. Food at breakfast is delicious. Gym. Nice staff although a little overwhelmed, so hard to get their attention (especially in restaurant and bar). Highly recommended.",5,2014,09,13
113,Location in South Ken ideal,This hotel is just a five minute walk to the South Kensington tube station.  Well appointed lobby and large space welcomes guests to socialize with other guests over tea and cocktails.  Room is well appointed and sizable.  Staff provided corporate tickets to the V&A which helped me jump the queues at special exhibits.,5,2014,09,11
113,Intimate and cozy hotel,"Nice location, charming neighborhood, walking distance to restaurants and caf√©s. About a fifteen minute walk to the shops and the Harrods department store. Very close to Victoria and Albert museum, Kensington park and gardens, and the tube.
The lobby and restaurant tastefully decorated. Staff extremely nice and helpful, especially the concierge. We stayed in a deluxe king, which was still very small, facing Queens gate, with two small windows, and quiet. With the size of the room it's not so inviting to spend a lot of time in it. Good size, clean, and modern bathroom with glass shower and a separate bath tub, with double sinks. Continental breakfast was pricey, for the basic items being offered. 
All together, it's a good hotel to stay if you are not looking for a real luxury stay.",4,2014,09,10
113,We would highly recommend The Kensington Hotel to anyone visiting London.,"We stayed a week in early September 2014. The reason why we chose this hotel was that my sister in law had previously stayed there and been very pleased. We were extremely pleased. We have stayed in some very high quality hotels in London and around the world and The Kensington rates very highly.
In-check worked perfectly - fast and smooth. And we got access to our room at once. 
The room was well furnished. Very good bed with quality linen and a quiet room, even with a busy road outside. We were especially happy for the coffee machine, but we are also from Sweden (the homeland of Fika). Every evening our hotel room was prepared for the night, they prepared the bed, curtain and lights. 
The hotel is centrally located, with three major museum nearby and Kensington Garden within walking distance. Close to the underground, South Kensington, and the bus station with several bus lines. There are many local restaurants in the area.
Hotel launch is very homely, and it feels more like sitting in your own living room than in a hotel. There are also books, of good quality, which you can borrow ‚Äì much appreciated.
The staff were friendly, approachable and attentive - professional in every way. One of them even spoke Swedish. 
We would highly recommend The Kensington Hotel to anyone visiting London.
",5,2014,09,10
113,"Excellent location, quality hotel","We enjoyed five nights at the Kensington. We arrived at 6.30 in the morning but the hotel staff were very obliging and happy to give us a room, which was much appreciated after 30 hours of travel. We overlooked Queens Gate, which was pleasing and not noisy. There are rooms at the back that overlook the air conditioning equipment that might be ok for one night but not for a longer stay. 
The rooms and bathrooms are not large, but this is London. The fridge is useless for personal items as it is really a small vending machine. The Nespresso machine was put to good use first thing in the mornings.
The common areas of the hotel are both beautiful and comfortable and despite the cost, the breakfast is a special treat. There is a good size gym, which was a surprise.
The staff were consistently polite and helpful. 
This is an expensive hotel but in such a good location and with high standards of service and accommodation to match. We are pleased we stayed there.",5,2014,09,10
113,nicest stay,"The neighbourhood was somewhat unusual to us coming from States but friendly and safe... . I enjoyed talking to everyone and little Cocktail bar was very cute. . The room and the hotel was clean and just as described. The subway to tube was right around the corner, but count 25 minutes to reach a tourist destination. 
It was the personality and hospitality of the staff that made our London vacation special, They were very friendly and helpful and made our stay personal and memorable, George is a great host . I would not have liked an unpersonal hotel in a big city  and this place was the perfect choice for my summer London, England experience. Thank you Kensington!",5,2014,09,08
113,Beautiful hotel,"Beautiful hotel although  the rooms are quite small.
 I couldn't put my suitcase anywhere. But the rest of the  hotel was  perfect. I loved the bed, really comfortable, I also liked that they would bring snacks at night for instance chocolate chip cookies and milk. 

The service was impecable and I would stay here again!",4,2014,09,08
113,London Vacation,Lovely hotel in beautiful South Kensington location on Queens Gate Road.  Near the V & A and other museums.  Drawing rooms was relaxing at any time during the day.  Hotel rooms are small compared to US standards. ,5,2014,09,07
113,Warm welcome,We had a very enjoyable one night stay.  The welcome started when I rang some days prior to our stay  to ask the concierge if he could get tickets for a late night concert. He went to exceptional lengths to include ringing me at work to update me as to progress.  Far more than one would expect from a London hotel.   Everything on arrival was as one would wish.  If I had to  make a constructive comment it would be for better lighting in the bathroom but it is a small thing as. Compared with the comfort of the room generally,5,2014,09,07
113,Live like King and Queen,"This is possibly one of the most beautiful (and romantic) hotels we have ever stayed in. Great location in the super trendy part of London not far from many sights and a short tube ride to many others. Foyer, lounges, bar and restaurant and simply stunning.  Staff extremely helpful and welcoming. Our room tip is this: indulge a little a book one of the suites - you will not regret it.  After all you are in the city of royalty - live like it for a few nights.",5,2014,09,07
113,Lovely hotel in great location,This is a lovely hotel in a great location. Easy access to tube and bus line. Wonderful breakfast even if the service was a little off it could be overlooked. The entire staff was very helpful and willing to please. A very memorable stay in London.,5,2014,09,05
113,Highly recommend,Could not fault.  Highly recommended in a great part of London.  Rooms were well furnished.  Staff where very attentive.  If I was very picky although the staff where attentive we were asked the same question four times each time we sat down for breakfast (very minor annoyance),5,2014,09,04
113,Great hotel in a great location,Stayed with my teenage son for one night when we were going to the Proms at the Royal Albert Hall. We booked a twin and were delighted to have a huge room with 2 queen beds.Harry had cookies and juice left out for him at bedtime! Room was immaculate and had everything (and more) we could have needed. The public rooms of the hotel were very stylish and breakfast was perfect! Royal Albert hall was a 10 minute walk and the shops of Knightsbridge similar.The hotel is just about next door to the Natural History Museum. We had a great time!,5,2014,09,04
113,Simply Superb,"This wonderful hotel never fails to deliver on comfort, service and attention to detail. The hotel is in a super location within walking distance of the park, brilliant museums and fab shopping. Having stayed a number of times at the hotel I've seen a number of the rooms and all have been great; spacious, clean and very comfortable. Other areas including the restaurant and bar are very comfortable and serve great food and drinks. A special mention also for the management and staff who are always extremely attentive and knowledgeable about the area giving great tips for restaurants and what's on. We couldn't recommend this wonderful hotel highly enough and always look forward to our return visit.",5,2014,09,04
113,Conveniently located,"Clean, updated, classy hotel in the heart of London. We could walk to most attractions: Hyde Park, National Museum, Science Museum and many other areas. The food was very good and the hotel staff were attentive and prompt. The rooms were a bit small, but very comfortable.",5,2014,09,03
113,Nice. Quiet & Quaint.,"After much researching where to stay for a week in London we chose The Kensington. We‚Äôre GHA members so we got free Wi-Fi, water and local newspapers. The hotel was #24 on Trip Advisor. Firstly we want to especially thank some people. Martin: who was extremely friendly, very knowledgeable and very helpful. Amongst other things he booked ‚Äò39 steps‚Äô and got us Parliament tour tickets .  Ronnie: always a smiling greeting, always great information on  best routes to and from places and really good restaurant information. Also Oksana who even  before we got to London was helpful with room information.  Note: We cabbed to The Kensington from Marble Arch in a downpour. There was a bike-a-thon. London cabbies supposedly know their way around. Ours was awful. He said he couldn‚Äôt get closer and dropped us 5 blocks from The Kensington with our luggage in the rain. We arrived drenched. Maybe that‚Äôs why the desk staff gave us a courtesy room until ours was ready. As for the hotel itself: It‚Äôs near South Kensington tube station. There are nice restaurants of all types (French, Indian, Italian, Burger, Tapas etc) and all prices nearby. Walk to Royal Albert Hall, Kensington Palace, Victoria and Albert Museum, Science Museum, Hyde Park etc. Our 25 sq. ft. room apparently recently renovated but in a traditional decor. The bathroom was big enough with place to put your stuff. Walk in shower, great water temp. and pressure. Lovely bath products. Housekeeping quick to arrive with extra luggage stand & towels. Bed, pillows and linens were fine. But there wasn‚Äôt enough lighting; and not much natural light because the window was small with no view or lighting from outside. TV and Wi Fi worked well. There wasn‚Äôt much place to unpack for a week stay. We used night stand drawers, got more hangers and used  2 narrow drawers and shelf that were on a bench under the TV.  We would have liked a desk & desk chair instead of a traditional round  table with wood upholstered chairs. Hallways are narrow and though carpeted, creaky noise from doors and floors was bothersome. Eco-friendly AC; meant no matter the setting it turned off during the night; we had to get up to turn it on again. There‚Äôs a good blow-dryer which you have to plug under the TV or in the closet. We used the Nespresso & kettle - but they‚Äôre in the closet. Nice complimentary tea, coffee & cookies. Nice robes & slippers. Good chocolates  with turn down service. We didn‚Äôt use the gym but it looked ok.  We didn‚Äôt go to the restaurant or bar. When booking beware that some rooms have footed tubs and no shower stall. It‚Äôs a nice hotel but we think we could have done better for the price.",4,2014,09,02
113,Simply wonderful,"My husband and I stayed in the Kensington Hotel for 5 nights 3 weeks ago and we still miss it. As others have already commented sufficiently on the wonderful location I will skip that topic and focus on the hotel itself and it's wonderful staff. 

The common rooms of the hotel (lobby, various salons and a lovely library) are beautifully decorated yet cozy with a wonderful but descreet fragrance for the scented candles placed in just the right corners. We spend one entire afternoon (after having a wonderful afternoon tea in the hotel) in one of the salons in front of the open fireplace just reading and drinking tea and cocktails as it was raining outside and we couldn't imagine finding a more homely place in London! 

The room was truly a bit on the small side (which we totally expected from London) but was well arranged and the bathroom amenities are top quality (Aromatherapy Associates - I love them). The beds are super comfy. During our first night we heard a small buzzing noise in our room that didn't really bother us tired as we were. When I adressed this to the receptionist the next day she apologized multiple times promising us a different room in case the problem couldn't get fixed in time. When we retunred ""home"" in the evening the problem was solved and we found a nice letter from the receptionist in our room incl. a voucher for 2 glasses of Champage at the hotel bar. What a nice surprise!

Which brings me to my favorite topic: make sure to have some cocktails in the bar, especially when Alessandro the bar manager is mixing them. To be frank: when I first looked at the cocktail menu I was completely lost not knowing one single drink. However, I gave it a try (especially as Alessandro promised to prepare me something different should I not like the first one I ordered) and never regretted it: the cocktails are so well prepared, so very harmonically balanced and so surprising I could not hinder myself from thinking that he's a true artist. When we talked to him a bit more we could feel how passionate he is about his profession as mixologist and what efforts he takes to bring out the best flavour of the ingredients - really fascinating!

But the entire staff were just outstanding and made us feel at home in no time. Frits, the Hotel Manager was constantly around (very good sign) and whenever we met enquired of our plans for the day, the evening etc giving us recommendations when needed. Marty, the Concierge, was a great help in arranging some sightseeing tours and I noted how he helped other guests getting their luggage back which was lost on some European airport. The restaurant staff (oh, those Club Sandwiches!!!) is extraordinarily nice (especially Valentina and George!) and the overall mood is so very positive! And it really never felt fake or too much. 

We will for sure be back and will hopefully see many dear faces again.",5,2014,09,02
113,Lovely hotel.  Great stay. Very happy.,"Stayed at this hotel for two nights over the weekend.  It's in a great location and very near to South Ken tube station.  All the staff I met where lovely, friendly and very helpful. My room was spacious and luxurious with lots of nice touches.  Lounge areas are fabulous and comfortable. I would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay again.",5,2014,09,02
113,Lovely birthday surprise!,"I stayed here last weekend and it was perfect. The hotel, staff and food were outstanding - when we mentioned it was my birthday, the staff left me a tray in the room with chocolates and happy birthday written on which was lovely! It's in a great location near the tube, and the interior is so well designed. We'll definitely be back!",5,2014,09,01
113,Nespresso coffee machines in every room!,"So often when travelling, the budget is priority like many other travellers. But every once in a while, you get the opportunity to go splash out for a real treat, and this is what I did for my wife on her birthday with two nights at The Kensington in August.

I'd arranged a couple of surprises for her in West London so finding a hotel central to the area was vital. I always search based on good reviews, and The Kensington was certainly one of the best albeit in a price bracket I perhaps wouldn't normally have explored.

What followed was probably the best hotel stay I can recall of any hotel in London, bar none. The elegant hospitality and attention to detail began upon arrival, where, while checking in, we were handed two warm towels to freshen up after our journey via the tube. Our room, 327 on the third floor, faced inwards from the street and was extremely well prepared, with a mixture of contemporary and modern fittings. It wasn't massively spacious but didn't need to be, and was complete with a Nespresso coffee machine and capsules along with the usual room amenities.

After a meal at a nearby grill, we returned to sample some fantastic house cocktails in the bar, perfectly served by Eros who we chatted to for a long time. The drawing room and all communal areas were in perfect decorative order, with a lovely cosseting feel to the place. We returned to find the room prepared with the bed made, two chocolates left and Smooth FM radio on the TV. I know other hotels do this but it was a nice touch, perhaps because the staff saw us arrive as a couple.

After a long day in town the next day we returned the following evening to try the restaurant. Again, brilliant service and a very unfussy menu; I had a chicken club sandwich that really hit the spot, as opposed to eating from a complex a la carte menu when most of the time it's the last thing you need. Similarly, breakfast was well-judged. I particularly liked the way service was spread across all three rooms of the restaurant with the self-serve food hosted as a centre-piece in the middle.

My only (very, very slight) complaint was the constant drone from the air conditioning units at the back of the hotel. I guess it's unavoidable really - something you often encounter at modern hotels - but certainly not enough to detract from a great experience.

The friendliness from staff - and indeed, the other guests we spoke to - continued all the way to checkout, whereupon we were handed a small bottle of water each before beginning our onward journey. All these small touches make a massive difference. Needless to say, this is a hotel we will definitely be staying at again and I'd urge you to do the same.",5,2014,09,01
113,"Nice stay, although the room wasn't too big","We stay at the Kensington hotel during the bank holiday weekend. Booked a room through Booking.com and paid for a superior. The photos portrayed the room to be of a very good size but that wasn't the case when we checked in. We were welcomed by an unpleasant damp smell, which must have been coming from the bathroom. The size of the room was disappointing and we would have expected something better under the ''superior room'' tag. The bed was comfortable, we've had a turn down service, and the toiletries were of a good standard. Unfortunately the mini bar only contained a couple of cans of coke and mineral water, all the other compartments have not been replaced after the previous guests.
The emergency exit light was on the whole night, and it illuminated the room in a green light, which made sleeping quite difficult.

The staff at the hotel were very pleasant, helpful and knowledgeable and overall despite a few hiccups with the room we did enjoy our stay.",4,2014,09,01
113,Superb stay,"My wife and I stayed here for a conference we were attending near the Albert Hall. From the first moment the service was outstanding. All staff were friendly in a genuine way and offered endless help. For example, on a rather humid day in London I was offered a warm towel at reception. The waiting staff and porters were attentive without being overly in your face. The room itself was quite small but everything was there that we needed and again nice touches not found at other places (e.g. heated bathroom mirror). The restaurant was lovely with a grand, old-world charm and the food was really good. The hotel was also close by Fulham Road which is full of great bars and places to eat. All in all a faultless stay and well worth the money.",5,2014,08,31
113,Wonderful but.................,"my wife and i were lucky enough to stay in this wonderful hotel whilst being treated by her daughter (ritz champers breakfast) and i cannot rate it highly enough. the staff are impeccable and so professional and friendly. the rooms are of an amazingly high standard, breakfast was delicious in wonderful surroundings with again such outstanding service. overall wonderful BUT.................... we could only stay 1 day. will return and would recommend without any hesitation. thanks to all the staff who made our brief visit a lovely memory.",5,2014,08,30
113,Very pleasant stay!,"We stayed for 4 nights and had a great stay. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The lounge area is very nicely appointed. The breakfast was excellent. So much variety when you have the all inclusive package. We were able to pick from the menu as much as we liked, as well as from the buffet. The room was very nice but a bit small. Would have been nice if the room had been slightly bigger, as well as the bath, but it did have a rain shower and the bed was very comfortable. That said, we booked the least expensive room and for London the price was quite reasonable, especially in a 5 star hotel. I would stay here again on my next trip to London.",5,2014,08,30
113,Staff friendliness,"We are surprised at how friendly the staff here are. Everyday for breakfast we have had many different staff member but a particular one that stands out is called George he only saw us once the next day he remembered our names and he actually titled us as mr & mrs also he remembered we needed gluten free toast before we even asked. Another staff member called Chris has been excellent well mannered, friendly & helpful he goes out of his way to do or get something for u. Today I asked the service staff member if I could have another vanity kit and she was very happy to give this she even asked if there was anything else I needed. We have stayed at many 5 star places and not all have been as accommodating as this hotel. Well done to all the staff including from reception to concierge to housecleaning and bar staff.",4,2014,08,29
113,Great location,"Stayed for 7 nights in August 2014 with spouse.
Great great location‚Ä¶5 min walk to the underground train station (which is a big plus), right in the midst of wide variety of places to eat and drink, walking distance to the beautiful Kensington Gardens‚Ä¶
Rooms are small (they all are in London/Paris), but adequate (we had the superior room).
Breakfast is decent (you should check if room qualifies for hot breakfast also, ours did).
Very friendly staff who were helpful with directions, and places to visit/eat. The hotel has a nice bar, which is great place to unwind after a day out in the city.
Very nice place to stay in central London, but a bit pricey.
A very pleasant stay overall.",4,2014,08,28
113,Best Place Ever,"Ii stayed in this Hotel for 4 nights with a friend of mine.
The only thing I can say about that Hotel is I will be BACK
everything in this Hotel is Charming and stuff are Friendly, Helpful, cheerful, as they supported me for everything.
LOVE all of them",5,2014,08,28
113,Uncomprable Service,"This hotel has an excellent location, near attractions, excellent restaurants, shopping, and a Tube stop. The staff is universally superb, from the concierge to behind the desk, in the lobby, restaurants, and thoughout. The conceierge especially will move mountains for you, and their bartender is rated one of the best in the UK- seriously. The first floor common areas feature beautiful design and decor. The room bathroom and shower are spacious, with excellent toiletries. My only complaint is that the room was small by American standards, but it fits nicely with European expectations.",5,2014,08,26
113,Best Steak on the planet,"I eat in their restaurant which is decorated like a very upmarket library in someones stately home ( not a bad look or feel ).
We were waited on hand and foot by the waiter and I had the most mouth watering steak ever.
It is worth the effort to eat there .",5,2014,08,26
113,"Comfortable, peaceful, relaxing, & beautiful","We absolutely love this hotel. Stayed with our family. Location is ideal. Friendly and very helpful staff. Super comfortable and pretty.  Home-like feeling, not loud or chaotic. Will definitely return.",5,2014,08,26
113,"Great hotel, depending on the rate you get","This is a gorgeous hotel in a nice, residential area with lots of dining opportunities around. Taking into account that we booked a special offer and got their usual nightly rate at half price (120 euros per night) we were very happy with the value we fot for our money. The reception area, as well as all the common areas are beautiful. However, the rooms are quite small and slightly dated. For a few nights it's pefectly fine but if I had to pay full price I would be a bit disppointed. But then again it's London, where every hotel is overpriced... 

BTW, this is a 4 star hotel in my opinion, not 5.",4,2014,08,26
113,Perfect for a small conference,"A wonderful hotel for a conference.
This place is neat.  Classy and has wonderful food you can eat in a library style restaurant.
We had a small seminar for about 10 people which was just perfect, and recently renovated.
The rooms are not massive, but of high quality, and the location is very upper class english.
Loved it.  Going Back.",5,2014,08,26
113,Staying at the Kensington,The Kensington Hotel has never failed me in going beyond just meeting my accommodation needs. They have the most hospitable of staff and focus on the most intricate details to keep you satisfied. I have stayed in this hotel around 5-6 times and I will most likely stay there again the next time I'm in town. ,5,2014,08,26
113,Less than 5 star quality,"We stayed at the Kensington Hotel recently for 4 nights. On the positive side, the doorman and concierge were  very helpful and extremely polite, as were the reception staff. Room was small,  but clean, and fresh but I expected that, and have no complaints there,. The decor in the hotel is nice and the lounge and bar area are very relaxing, coffee making facility in the room was a nice touch. Hotel is in a good location, and near Kensington South Tube station.

I dont want to be negative, but we found the service at breakfast very disappointing. The first morning we were sitting at the table for 20 minutes before we were given our menu, and despite having ordered tea and coffee and toast when we sat down, we had to ask again twice before it eventually arrived. extremely disappointing.  This trend continued throughout our stay, and unfortunately it put a dampener on an otherwise very pleasant stay.

In summary a lovely hotel, but it would be nice to have breakfast served without a hitch, and this   was a frustrating aspect to our stay.

Jake",3,2014,08,24
113,Comfortable and elegant,Fantastically located just 5 minutes from South Kensington tube. A good welcome from reception and excellent service throughout the Hotel. Late check out also helps. Breakfast was very good quality and great value. Well worth a return visit,4,2014,08,22
113,Fantastic Hotel Experience,"I recently stayed at The Kensington Hotel during a four day break in London. The whole experience from check in to check out was fantastic, Customer Focused staff combined with great hotel Decor, Food and Location made for a wonderful stay.",5,2014,08,22
113,Fantastic luxury hotel,"We had the pleasure of staying in this hotel on our wedding day. It was our first stay but it certainly won't be the last. We have stayed in some very high quality hotels in London and around the would and The Kensington rates very highly. We immediately felt very welcome and at home. The surroundings are sumptuous but  relaxed. Despite arriving early, our room was ready. And what a room!  It was beautiful and the spacious en-suite bathroom featured a luxury roll top bath that we made the most of. The staff were friendly, approachable and attentive - professional in every way. We were particularly impressed with Amy, who emailed us on several occasions before our stay to ensure everything went according to plan, was there to greet us on arrival and went beyond the call of duty to ensure our stay was perfect in every way. Thanks Amy! We are already planing to return on our first anniversary next year and would highly recommend The Kensington Hotel to anyone visiting London.",5,2014,08,21
113,Great location - Clean and comfortable with great staff.,"We stayed two nights at the Kensington Hotel and loved it. Yes the rooms are a little small, as too is the bathroom, but so was the time I actually spent in it. Very good bed with quality linen and a quiet room is all you can ask for in Central London for a fair price. Walking distance to the underground station, restaurants, coffee shops and close to Hyde Park. It was also a stroll to the hop on/hop off bus which was important for us. The staff were professional and polite, we loved Jimmy the concierge who was most helpful. It's a yes from me.",4,2014,08,20
113,fantastic stay in London england,"After a lovely stay in London our trip was fantastic, the staff are the jewel tresure  from Laura,Ronnie, and George were very friendly and vibrant people with an infectious laugh, just fabulous human being.. The hotel is really nice. It is very spacious and comfortable with high end features in a great building. Light floods the hotel because of the huge wall to wall windows.victorian age paintings . The hotel is perfectly situated in a convenient location and in the centre near many cafes, restaurants, shopping, tourist attractions and public transit. You will definitely enjoy your stay in this hotel.",5,2014,08,20
113,Great experience,"My lady and I traveled to London following a stay in Paris.  Our travel agent recommended this hotel and we couldn't have been happier.  When we arrived from the train station someone was quickly out to get our luggage - when we got to the front desk we were promptly greeted, and checked in.  Sounds like small things - but that is what made it special to be made to feel welcome!  

The entire staff was very helpful and made our time there very enjoyable.  I noticed others saying the location is good - and it is. We were able to walk or hop on the underground to get anywhere we wanted to go.  Oh yea, and there were some great pubs around the hotel so you could get real Pub Food. 

All in all I would recommend this hotel.  It is a little pricey, but then everything in London is pricey.",5,2014,08,19
113,"Quaint, charming and ideal location for exploring","Stayed here for two nights - location is prime as you are a 5 minute walk to the South Kensington Underground station, close to Kensington Park/Hyde Park and Notting Hill. The d√©cor was very traditional but still fresh and welcoming. The room was very very small - literally a bed, small table and two chairs all squished together. There was a small closet with hangers but for two people it was impossible to remove our clothes from the luggage properly. Luckily if you are in London to explore, you won't spend a lot of time in your room anyways but if you require space you won't get it here. Loved that the room had a Nespresso machine! The bed and linens are very comfortable. Great water pressure in the shower. 
Concierge staff was very accommodating - however upon arrival, I had to struggle awkwardly with my luggage up the steps with no assistance. 
The bar experience.. the other reviewers had really positive things to say so perhaps our experience was just an off night. We waited a substantial amount of time before someone came to take our drink order. We noticed a table next to us getting a bit irritated and finally standing up in anger and walking out. After at least a 20 min wait and still no drinks (we had only ordered a glass of wine and a vodka soda) we also stood up to leave - at which point the bartender ran after us to the elevator! Really inexcusable to have such untrained staff on hand. However, the bar d√©cor is very classy and comfy - would make for a nice evening before turning in. 
Overall was a great experience and if staying in the Kensington area again, would rebook with this hotel.",4,2014,08,18
113,A Hotel Fit For A Queen (and anybody else),"We stayed at the Kensington Hotel for one week and it was a WONDERFUL experience.   We stayed in a Luxury Studio Suite....it was pricey but well worth the money.  We had a large bed, walk in closet and sizeable bathroom with both a tub and shower.  The room was very clean and comfortable.  We loved the turn down service where we got chocolates on our pillows and cookies with juice.  However, the best thing about the hotel was the staff.  Every single staff member was helpful and friendly.  A standout staff member was Martyn, the concierge.  His help was invaluable.  We asked for his guidance almost every day, and he advised us with a smile and the information he provided was excellent. Another big help was Amy at the desk.  We arrived early in the morning and our room was not ready yet.  She offered us a courtesy room, until ours was ready, so that we could rest and freshen up.  The full English breakfast, which was ""free"" with the room was great.  We had our fruit, croissants, and very tasty waffles every day. The lounge areas were beautifully decorated and relaxing... my husband loved reading his book in the morning in the front room with a cup of coffee in his hand.  Very peaceful.  Also, the hotel is in an excellent location.....blocks from the tube station and in a thriving neighborhood.  There were lots of restaurants to eat in and a Waitrose across the street to purchase snacks.  When we left on our last day, Martyn and Amy were standing by the door saying good bye and wishing us well.  It felt like we were leaving our second home.  This hotel is a wonderful find in a busy city!",5,2014,08,16
113,Lovely Hotel,"My friend and I stayed at the kensington hotel at the beginning of august. It was a very positive experience for us. The location is perfect! Easy to access all modes of transportation, and is just a short walk away from Chelsea. The staff were extremely welcoming and friendly. The rooms are quite small - but we expected this from a London hotel. The only downside to the hotel was the cost of their food. I do feel it was really quite overpriced for what they were offering. All in all, a fantastic experience ",5,2014,08,16
113,perfectly situated with great service,"I and family stayed here and we both loved it. The hotel was lovely. Our own room was nice and clean and everything was like it was described. We loved the towels and the beautiful interior of the hotel.
The staffs were really helpful and gave us good advices of many things and were always happy to answer any of our questions.
Neighbourhood is lovely and peaceful; it had nice restaurants, cafes and also wonderful markets in Portobello on Saturdays. We had easy access by subways and it was always pleasant to come back to Kensington to relax. Thank you‚Ä¶thank you for a wonderful experience, we would love to stay here again!",5,2014,08,14
113,First impression terrible and then heaven!,"Upon arrival we were given a superior twin room.  The bathroom was so small that you could not fully open the bathroom door as it bashed into the toilet, nor could you open the shower door as it also bashed into the toilet.  Tiles on the bathroom floor were loose and the room was not at all like the gorgeous pics displayed on the website.  I repeatedly called the front desk and was told they would call back in 5 minutes - 30 minutes later I went down to the front desk and was told - quite nastily - that there was not availability for a change and that rooms in London are small.  I was not happy!  But the next day - the wonderful day manager offered us a new room - absolutely gorgeous - and large with a beautiful bathroom - she could not have been more pleasant to deal with and even sent along a hand written note of apology with passes to the Victoria and Albert Museum exhibits.  I was so impressed with their customer service and will definitly stay there again and will also stay at other Doyle properties.",5,2014,08,14
113,First Impressions,"Booked this hotel last minute with good expectations after reading previous reviews. Arrived and checked in very quickly. The room allocated was nothing like the ones shown in the pictures on the web site. First impression was not great as the room was small, dark and had no view. The furnishings were tired with a torn lamp shade and chipped bath. After some time in the room decided that three nights in this room may be to much to bare as a bit depressing.

Went to reception and spoke with Gillian Front Office Manager  who said that she would look into it and change our room. Returned to reception after a couple hours to be advised that we had been allocated a different room, packed our belongings and moved to a lovely room. Gillian was very helpful and apologetic. The Kensington is a lovely hotel with clean, bright public rooms the bar is well run with helpful staff and nibbles served with your drinks a very nice touch. 

The location of the hotel is good with lots of attractions within walking distance it is also served by a good selection of caf√©s an restaurants.

 We had a good trip to London and enjoyed our stay at the Kensington Hotel it's a shame that our first impression was not a good one.",4,2014,08,13
113,It got better!,"Our initial impressions were not good. We were allocated a Superior(??) double on the 5th floor. A large bed in a room big enough to comfortably fit a single bed. There was about an inch to spare at one side of the foot of the bed due to the built in wardrobe unit. The worst thing about the room though was the noise from above which sounded like a cement mixer. This went on until the early hours of the morning having although we  alerted Reception as soon as we noticed it. We probably would have checked out after one night but the Management absolutely bent over backwards to resolve matters by moving us to a far superior room on the 2nd floor. We cannot fault their service and attitude to our discomfort and therefore we would not hesitate to return.
Continental breakfast was very good with an excellent selection of food. We did not have anything cooked but that was our choice.",4,2014,08,13
113,Lovely hotel & location ,"Stayed here with my friend for two nights and were very happy with the accommodations and service. Everything was clean, comfortable, spacious, and taken care of while we were out of the room. They provided bathrobes, the weather report, newspapers and never bothered us once. Plus, it is in walking distance to shopping and Portobello St and there are a couple of fun bars in the direct area of the hotel. All in all I wish we could go back right now. ",4,2014,08,12
113,London Experience,"My daughter who is 14 and I stayed for 1 week.  The hotel and all of the staff were to notch, I wouldn't change a thing.  Great location and lots of great restaurants close by.  All the staff were very friendly and helpful.  The breakfast was superb.  The hotel was spotless and very comfortable.  WiFi worked very well.  Over all, it was a wonderful experience.",5,2014,08,12
113,"Go on, spoil yourself","Stayed for just one night (alas) in early August. Can't wait to return. Spacious well appointed room with good AC ( actually had HOT weather - amazing ). Gorgeous communal areas, bar, restaurant, lobby, gym etc. all has the air of an exclusive gentleman's club. ( No not that type of club, the respectable type..).  Impeccable service, great location. Staff really can't do enough to make your stay special.  Great value for the standard offered, if in London on business or holiday, I defy you to find better for the price. Don't hesitate, just book it>",5,2014,08,11
113,A lot of faults...,"A reasonable hotel with some positives and negatives to match.  A beautifully furnished hotel both in reception and rooms alike.  The concierge is excellent and this makes a huge difference.  Lovely refresher towels on checkin and bottles of water on check out.  That's where it ends.

The room was quite large and had a good size bathroom.  With all that bathroom space why they make the shower half a meter wide I have no idea...

On the first day we arrived we were not allowed to rest!  Firstly someone arrived at our door offering some club membership whilst we were trying to get some shut eye, and then once awake and in the shower the maintenance man simply let himself in waking up my partner and well actually giving us quite a fright!  A few hours later the LOUD fire alarm went off, again waking us up and alarming us at the same time.  We called reception to find out what was going on and were told please ignore it, they are testing things.  Perhaps a heads up is a good idea and how about doing the test at mid day????

We had late night restaurant bookings at a few Gordon Ramsay restaurants and hence left around 21:00, no turn down service was therefore done even though I informed them of this when leaving.  That's just not going the extra mile at all...

The rooms are loud, we specifically requested in advance a quiet room but due to the plumbing going all night and the fact that anyone walking in the corridor causes a large creaking sound up the walls it seems rather unlikely to get one.

Excellent location though and good turn down service when it is done.",3,2014,08,11
113,A neighborhood gem..,"This hotel knows service...from helping me book tickets to Wimbledon, arranging airport transfers, booking dinner reservations, this concierge staff is the tops!  Max, Marthign, Chanchal and Julian at the front desk made our stay just perfect!  The rooms were nice, but it's the staff that makes this hotel and its location.  Looked forward to returning to this lovely neighborhood after a long day of playing tourist.  The are many pubs and nice restaurants all in close proximity.  It was a treat to be able to walk to a local restaurant and not have to deal with any transport ion, although it is super easy to maneuver the underground.  I must mention the extraordinary grace and concern that Max  took with an elderly woman who was lost.  He was able to track her family down.  She had been missing for 2 days!  It was truly the most dear action I have witnessed in many years.  Having people care about people!  Congratulations to The Kensington Hotel!",5,2014,08,10
113,Great London Hotel,"The location, facilities, and staff were outstanding.  This is an ideal hotel to stay for a trip to London to see both local sites as well as plan day excursions to Bath, Windsor, Althorp and others.  It is a simple walk through a lovely neighborhood to both the South Kensington Tube station (5 min) and to Kensington Gardens/Kensington Palace (15 min...just might see Kate, William and George), and a few free museums (10min to Natural history museum and Victoria and Albert Museum)",5,2014,08,10
113,Solo traveller,"Stayed for 1 night for a business trip. Lovely room on top floor, very small but adequate for just myself. Great location walking distance to shops although Kings Street was quite a long walk! Got the tube back. Staff very attentive and friendly. Didn't have breakfast or food. Would definitely return.",5,2014,08,10
113,spot on,"Four nights in August in hot London and the hotel was, except for minor niggles with forgetful wait staff, exceptional.  On arrival, the welcoming smiles from reception, apologies for the room not ready - we did arrive early and advice about a great pub for lunch - ""this is my favourite"" offers Gillian were a very good start.  The location, a short walk to the South Ken Tube, with plenty of restaurants and pubs and easy access (Oyster Card essential) to every part of London is perfect.  Rooms spotless and most comfortable.  Bathroom elegant and amenities excellent.  Definitely would go back as first choice.",5,2014,08,09
113,Great Location and Service,"My wife and I stayed here overnight as it was a great location for shopping in South Kensington / Knightsbridge.
Upon arrival we were impressed with the boutique style of the hotel.  The reception staff were efficient polite and very helpful.
We had a deluxe room which was nicely dressed with a very decent size bathroom including a bath and separate shower.
While in the room we could hear squeaky floor boards upstairs which were quite noticeable. We contacted reception and they offered to get this looked into. When we left for dinner Amy the guest relations manager then offered us another room, but as we had unpacked we said we decided against this. She then offered to hold this room should we change our mind.
In the morning we went for breakfast and Amy came to see us to see how the stay was, which was very personable. 
The breakfast was disappointing with the service being a little slow and the food not so great for this standard of hotel.
Upon arriving  home we had an email from Amy explaining that the maintenance staff were looking in to the noise issues from the floor above and has personally offered to look after any future bookings. 
To summarise, great hotel with a few minor issues that the staff went above and beyond to try and resolve. Amy is a great asset to the hotel as is the friendly concierge. We would be happy to stay again and would recommend to friends and family",4,2014,08,08
113,excellent service,"The location was perfect, South Kensington is a lovely aerea. The service from front of house staff was exceptional. The rooms were well appointed. The only complaint would be that the rooms were suprisingly small for the price.

      ",4,2014,08,08
113,Great Service,"While the hall may be narrow and the elevator small, the service was exceptional.  The room was very comfortable and I liked that it was walking distance to the subway.  Also the drive to the airport was easy.",5,2014,08,07
113,Excellent Hotel and Customer Service!,"We arrive here in the morning, dog tired after taking the red eye from Canada. Even though we were there well before check in time, the staff went out of their way to locate a quiet room so we could get some sleep. The bed was super comfortable, excellent linens and AC worked great. We inquired about some ice in our room and they delivered a large bucket of ice to our room while we were out. The breakfast included with our room was excellent. Location is great, close to lots of restaurants and pubs. After our stay they followed up with several emails, looking for feedback on our stay. The only small complaint was the size of the bathroom did not allow us to follow open the bathrrom door. Not a big deal as it is an old hotel and your are in central London. The price we paid was more than reasonable for the area. Highly recommended.",5,2014,08,07
113,Excellent city break at the proms,"Thoroughly enjoyed our weekend stay at the Kensington Hotel. A large party of 9, including children and grandparents, the hotel exceeded our expectations. A wonderful location which enabled us to walk to our show in the Royal Albert Hall on a lovely summer evening. The children were particularly well catered for with little additional treats. Staff were very friendly and helpful but most of all, there was a lovely relaxing atmosphere. The family room was very spacious with all we required on hand. Would love to visit again.",5,2014,08,05
113,Good choice in the South Kensington area,"The hotel is close to South Kensington station, which means that the museums, Knightsbridge, Kings Road are all within walking distance. The rooms re comfortable, the bar/ dinner area quite relaxing, the staff attentive and friendly. Compared to similar hotels in the area I found the rates quite good. Definitely recommended.",5,2014,08,05
113,Mixed review,"Staff polite, room extremely  immaculate, but we won't return. Air conditioning is rationed and you must get up and hit the button during the night to keep it on. Ultimately a hotel is about getting a good nights sleep and our  was interrupted each night because it was hot. We were also told ""too bad"" you are checked in for six nights once you check in at all. ",2,2014,08,05
113,Best Hotel Experience Thusfar,"This is hands down my most favorite hotel I've ever stayed in, and I've stayed in quit a lot. I stayed in London for a weekend with my mom before heading to Paris and somehow I was lucky enough to find this boutique hotel online. The service was second-to-none, and every single hotel employee was helpful and polite. One night we asked for a recommendation for a good sushi restaurant within walking distance and they immediately made us reservations for a wonderful little place down the street.

The rooms were beautiful, the lounge downstairs is at once comfortable and stylish, and the hotel breakfast was excellent. We actually canceled reservations at Sketch in favor of eating in the hotel again. I could go on and on about this place but I'll just leave it at this: stay here and you won't regret it.",5,2014,08,05
113,Very nice,"Nice hotel.  Quiet location, great for getting away from all the touristy activities.  Breakfast and dinner were wonderful.  The staff was helpful and gracious.  The only person to give us bad advice was the concierge about getting to Gatwick, but luckily our tour guide corrected him or we would have surely missed our flight.   Our travel agent obviously booked us the least expensive room so the view was horrible.  Kept the curtains closed the entire time.  You get what you pay for, although this was a bit pricey.  That being said, I would definately pay a little more for a less depressing view.  The lobby and hotel bar were lovely.",4,2014,08,04
113,london break,we stayed in this hotel for our annual london break the staff were all excellent and were very attentive we only ate breakfast in the hotel and the choices were very good and the cooked breakfast was tasty and well turned out the room we had was very good the only thing i would say against it was that the carpet near the mini bar was not clean and it had what looked like paint on it  not what i would expect from a hotel of this standard  but overall we enjoyed our stay and would definately stay there again as it is perfectly placed for loads of attractions and eateries,5,2014,08,03
113,Hotel perfection,Smiling and courteous staff.  Nothing was too much trouble.  Food was excellent and we could not have asked for more from this hotel gem.  The location is ideal too.  Excellent value in the heart of London.,5,2014,08,02
113,excellent excellence,"The location was truly unbeatable- within comfortable walking distance to the Natural history museums, Hyde park, green park, science museum, the harrods store and much more. There were also several lively cafes on the same street as the hotel and we could easily walk to the supermarkets - a little waitrose just on the corner, for eating rocca, la bouche ( french cuisine) and a sushi shop near the station.It is also an area with beautiful architecture, flowers, 

The hotel is very clean and quaint with lovely furniture, cool victorian beam ceiling, and all thoughtful details. The rooms are very nice and have everything, the bathroom is spacious and The Internet wireless signal is strong which was very convenient to check emails 

Olga was a good hostess, George was fantastic and Amy(reception) provided very good information, very friendly and helpful staff when we arrived at the hotel. we highly recommend to this lovely 5 star hotel.",5,2014,08,01
113,Perfection!,"I booked to stay here for an anniversary celebration with my partner - a decision I will never regret. I had phoned and requested an ice bucket to be in the room when we checked in, and was quizzed as to why (quizzed in a nice way I hasten to add!), and said it was an anniversary. When we checked in, not only was there a big fresh ice bucket, but complimentary chocolates and chocolate dipped strawberries on a platter with 'Happy Anniversary' written in chocolate. We were also given happy anniversary vouchers for a glass each of champagne in the bar.

But don't assume that is why I rate this hotel. The room was large and immaculate - literally looked like  it might have been decorated a day earlier. Large and comfortable bed, and the room had a Nespresso machine! The staff were amazing. Polite, knowledgeable and attentive, but never in an overbearing way.

Location is perfect for what we wanted (Kings Road and Hyde Park) but I won't bore you‚Ä¶check out google maps and make your own decisions based on what you want to do!

I can honestly say, this was the best hotel experience I have had. Worth every pound!",5,2014,07,31
113,Afternoon tea for two is a must!,"We really enjoyed a four night stay at the Kensington Hotel. The reception and  the Concierge were excellent giving advice on a very nice restaurant locally. Fantastic room, comfortable bed, the room was very comfy,  well appointed, reasonable size and adequate bathroom with shower. The staff were exceptionally friendly. Especially the restaurant staff, made me feel very at home. The food was very good quality, unusual dishes and  all freshly prepared! Wonderful for afternoon tea for two, is a must! Close to an underground station so getting around is simple. 
I will definitely stay here again.",5,2014,07,30
113,Great vacation in London,My 20 year old daughter and I just spent 6 days in London and we had a wonderful time at the Kensington Hotel.  The hotel is in a very central location and it was easy to get around.  The staff was very pleasant.  I had the concierge make a few dinner reservations in advance and everything they suggested was terrific. The only thing I would suggest would be to replace the carpet in the room - it wasn't lying flat.  But it wasn't a problem.,5,2014,07,30
113,"Beautiful, romantic, elegant","We loved staying here, the staff are friendly and warm. The hotel is beautifull and has a real boutique feel to it, very romantic, great for couples who want to get away, also wonderfully located. All in all considered, it is good value for money considering other hotels in this range. I would stay again and recommend this hotel.",5,2014,07,29
113,Outstanding!,Outstanding & faultless in every way.  All the staff we encountered were professional and courteous and did everything possible to make our special one night stay a thoroughly fabulous experience.  Thank you.,5,2014,07,26
113,Nice hotel,"The Kensington is a nice hotel. It's in a great location, and was very clean. The room was very small for the price, but that's what you get in London. The staff were very helpful. I would recommend and I would go there again.",4,2014,07,26
113,great stay in London,"We couldn't have asked for a more comfortable and relaxing hotel to stay. George & is a genuinely wonderful host and was very accommodating  We have been traveling for weeks and staying here with my partner was wonderful, it was like a brief rest at home in the middle of a long overseas journey. Highly recommend this hotel Few hotels are as clean and as comfortable as with great service Furthermore, this hotel is perfectly situated in London, close to everything. Thank you for a wonderful stay and we would love to comeback soon.",5,2014,07,26
113,Exceeded beyond all expectations ,"My partner booked deluxe room upgrade. Unfortunately when we arrived it was not the room we had booked. The staff particularly duty manager Amy fell over backwards to make our stay the best she possibly could. The hotel was full and the only room available was the President Suite. The Kensington Hotel picked up the tab and allowed us to stay there. It was the most wonderful experience I have ever had in a hotel. We were treated like royalty and given lovely additional touches such as having our beds turned down with a cool thermos of pineapple juice and chocolates laid out on the bed. Amy wrote us a lovely card to welcome us to the suite and apologised. The four poster bed was huge and so comfortable and the bathroom was to die for with deep roll top bath and a TV in there also. So many first time experiences for me.        Well ....Amy and the staff of the Kensington hotel.....thank you so much for a truly wonderful experience you exceeded all our expectations. We can't wait to be able to come back for another stay. 
",5,2014,07,25
113,Beautiful in every way,"Booked through Secret Escapes so didn't really know what to expect but was hugely delighted.

I called ahead the night before as it was our first wedding anniversary and wanted to let the hotel know. Amy and Laura didn't disappoint and helped make the trip really special for us with a room upgrade and chocolates.

The hotel is stunning inside- every detail thought of and no 'chain' feel. The rooms are on the small side but beautifully put together and very comfortable. The added touches of a nespresso machine, turn down service and luxury bathroom packs add to the overall experience.

We had a full English breakfast as part of the deal and it was wonderful. Luxury ingredients, well presented, stunning dining room and friendly staff. A perfect way to start the day.

Overall, a wonderful hotel. Will not hesitate to stay here again. Would like to try their afternoon tea- looks amazing! Thank you for making our anniversary so special.",5,2014,07,25
113,Wonderful English Hotel,"If you want a typical British non-chain hotel with great service and location this is the place. Wonderful breakfasts, great neighborhood with lots of restaurants, easy access to the tube, Victoria and Albert Museum, Museum of Natural History, and Kensington Park. Loved our stay there.
      ",5,2014,07,23
113,A Great Hotel in a Perfect Locaton!,"We have stayed here several times.  The staff are wonderful.  Rooms are well appointed and the location is perfect.  A short walk to two Tube stops, or a nice walk to many major attractions.  Plenty of restaurants and coffee shops in the area.  On our last stay, we were both under the weather and the kitchen was kind enough to make us chicken soup.  Really a very nice place to stay while in London.",5,2014,07,22
113,Prize winning,"We won our accommodation through my husband's work and in our opinion, the Kensington Hotel was first class. The staff were very friendly working above and beyond to meet our needs and those of our children by booking suitable tours.",5,2014,07,22
113,Great spot,We loved the hotel and all the staff members were friendly and helpful and the location is the best of all places we have stayed in the area (eight visits to area in past four years) with many pleasant surprises at eating places in Old Brompton Road. Terrific lounge area for enjoying a quiet drink at the end of the day.,5,2014,07,21
113,Delightful!!,"We stayed here for a few days last week and can't wait to return!  The Kensington is centrally located to all of the wonderful sights in London, not to mention close to the Tube, bus stops, Kensington Gardens, and terrific restaurants.  The management and staff were very friendly and helpful, the room was very clean and comfortable.  Love this hotel!!",5,2014,07,21
113,Relaxing Luxury!,"The Kensington is a true blessing. The staff knew it was my partners birthday and had a little surprise waiting for her, Strawberries and chocolates then 2 glasses of Champagne were delivered to our room. Wonderful! 
The friendliness of the whole staff, the comfortable luxury of the rooms and the absolutely delicious breakfast is such a treat. I have stayed here many times and look forward to many more.",5,2014,07,21
113,Lovely London hotel,"This was our first stop on our trip. The hotel were very accommodating in holding our luggage while we waited for our room to be ready. Our room was spacious and quiet. The bathroom was of a great size and the bed super comfy. We had the full breakfast included in our room price and I have to say, the omelette was one of the best I have ever even. Thank you also for our lovely bottle of sparkling wine and strawberries in celebration of our honeymoon.",5,2014,07,21
113,Excellent Boutique Hotel,"Have now been staying at this hotel for many years and it really is a home away from home be it business or pleasure - professionalism of staff along with standard of service and facilities always excellent.  always gives feeling  of being relaxing and genuine caring for the guest. Good location also and close South Ken tube, Hyde park, Albert hall and more.
",5,2014,07,21
113,"Great location, staff who care, & modern rooms","After an unpleasant stay in another UK city at a dirty hotel with nonchalant staff, our welcome at the Kensington on Queen's Gate was beyond our expectation. The staff go out of their way to ensure satisfaction, the location is convenient to sites and great restaurants, & our room was modern.",5,2014,07,21
113,Very nice hotel,This hotel is very clean and the bed was great.  You are a short walk to the South Kensington tube stop.  The neighborhood is quiet.  The staff are all fantastic.  Only negative is that the rooms are very tiny.  My wife and I each had a 28 inch bag and it was difficult to maneuver.  I will say that our friends had the room across the hall and it was much bigger.  But overall we were very happy with this hotel.,4,2014,07,21
113,Classic boutique hotel,"Located in a quiet Kensington neighborhood, this hotel is ideal for the London traveler who wants casual elegance without the noise of the city center. A fifteen minute walk to Harrod's and other fine dining. Room sizes vary; some are generous and others are quite small. ",4,2014,07,20
113,Great Hotel,"Our stay at The Kensington Hotel was great...rooms were clean and comfortable, staff friendly and extremely accommodating.  Great Location....short walk to South Kensington station.  I would highly recommend!",5,2014,07,19
113,A Classy Classic London Hotel,"We were booked into The Kensington through a Wimbledon-related tennis-and-hotel package. After rejecting the first room we were offered because it was too small, too dark and had no view other than nearby walls, we accepted a much nicer room into which the sunlight streamed and where our window offered a nice view of the street life. This being an older hotel, every room is different, so do not settle for the first room you are shown unless you truly like it; you may be able to find better. The hotel is a few blocks walk from the South Kensington Tube stop, and there are many shopping and dining options along the way. Our package included an excellent breakfast, served by staff and augmented by selections at the buffet stands. You can be seated in any of three handsomely furnished rooms for breakfast and there is no line or crowding up at the buffet. Local newspapers are laid out at a nearby table. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely return.",4,2014,07,18
113,Wonderful Afternoon Tea,"I had arranged afternoon tea at The Auburey restaurant as a surprise for my boyfriend and was amazed by the food, atmosphere and level of service at the hotel.The decoration of the hotel was wonderful and we were seated in a cove by the windows which was great as it was a lovely day. The staff were friendly, helpful and cheery the entire time, showing us around the hotel and library, which was incredibly refreshing as often as younger people we can be looked down upon! The food was incredible, we had the Kensington tea for two and there was far more food (AND FAR MORE TEA) than we had expected! The sandwiches were very tasty, and we decided that the scones were by far the best either of us have had and the deserts were fab twists on some classics! We will most certainly be visiting again in the near future!",5,2014,07,18
113,Excellent Service As Always,"Staying here for the first time this year, as always the staff were fantastic, always exceptionally helpful and just so nice. The room was slightly updated from my last stay with inclusion of a coffee maker in the room. The rooms are small (it is London) but very comfortable.
Barr staff were excellent Eros making awesome cocktails, Alessandro and the team never disappoint.",5,2014,07,17
113,Friendly staff,"The Kensington Hotel has most likely the most friendly staff I have every been facing. Location is great, and the lounge and caf√© area is very cozy. The Hotel is like most other London hotels suffering from tiny rooms. ",4,2014,07,17
113,LOVED THE KENSINGTON HOTEL,I went to London to visit my son who was studying abroad and stayed at The Kensington Hotel. The staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly. The rooms were superb. The food was wonderful. I really cant recommended this hotel enough. ,5,2014,07,15
113,Excellent,"I was staying here on business and was blown away by how GENUINELY nice the staff were. Not a ""have-a-nice-day-sir"" style nice, but a real, friendly and helpful bunch of people.  Especially the restaurant staff, made me feel very at home.  What with an awesomely comfortable bed, a real coffee machine in the room and great air con, this was one of the most pleasant hotel stays I've ever experienced. 

If you're visiting London, don't even think about staying anywhere else.",5,2014,07,15
113,Feel like royalty at the Kensington,"We loved the Kensington, stylish hotel, fabulous location, easy walking distance to the tube and many attractions of London.  Rooms and bathroom not overly large but beautifully appointed with lovely furnishings and amenities.  Nespresso machine in room was a lovely touch.  We loved this hotel.  

      ",5,2014,07,14
113,A good place to stay in SW7,"We used this as a base to visit several museums and exhibitions in Kensington and it was a good experience. The staff were friendly and helpful, the food in the restaurant was good and the room was small but comfortable. I wouldn't have called it a 'Superior Room' myself but I don't suppose a hotel is going to describe rooms as ""Nice but with an iffy view Room"".",4,2014,07,14
113,London stay,"Our travel agent arranged for our stay at the Kensington Hotel.  (Our paperwork had it as the Doyle Kensington for some reason.)  We had an issue with noise from the air conditioner in the room to which we were assigned. After the maintenance man was unable to fix the problem, we were moved to another room.  The staff was wonderful in making certain that we were satisfied.  The rooms are small but nice.  There are great options for breakfast and it is served in a very attractive setting.  The location is close to Kensington Palace and Gardens, good restaurants, and the underground train.  The concierge was most helpful as well.  We loved it!",5,2014,07,14
113,Super Hotel,"If staying here, you will not be disappointed. Stayed in London a couple times now and have got to say this was the best for overall location (lovely area), location of underground (easy to get to most areas from South Kensingston station) and general quality of the hotel. Wouldn't stay anywhere else! ",5,2014,07,14
113,Great Service,"The Kensington Hotel is beautiful.  The service is top notch and the location is terrific for getting around London.  Plus the Concierge Staff were wonderful at helping us figure out where we needed to go and even finding us tickets for the theatre our last night in town.  Also, the buffet breakfast is very good.  My only complaint is that the room was really small.  Basically it fit the bed and that was all.  There wasn't a dresser so I couldn't unpack my clothes.  I put my suitcase in the closet below our hanging stuff while my husbands was in the room next to the bed.  However, to end on a positive note: the bed was super comfortable and the linens lovely.",4,2014,07,13
113,"Small room, perfectly formed.","Unlike other reviewers, I didn't comment to reception on the size of the room we were given and I rather wish we had, as it did spoil what otherwise would have been an outstanding experience.   The room was very comfy and well appointed but only just big enough to get between the wardrobe and the bed.  Annoyed at myself really for being so British about it.  If you're given room 333 I hope that you speak your mind and try your luck at getting moved.  The evening bar was lovely, the staff delightful and breakfast was perfect.  ",4,2014,07,13
113,South Kensington,"Absolutely loved the Kensington Hotel, beautiful, charming...the staff were delightful.  The room was a bit small, but considering the age of the hotel, I'm sure that was the reason.  Comfortable in every way.  Close to Kensington station, as well as the Natural History Museum which is free!  Tour bus picked us up at our Hotel, just a very lovely hotel.",5,2014,07,11
113,"Excellent location, breakfast and room","I was fortunate to stay at The Kensington Hotel at Knightsbridge.  The room was excellent, comfortable, plush....The night turnover chocolate was delicious.  The staff was helpful and full of information.  The location was excellent for catching the tube, visting the Victoria and Albert Museum and walking to Harrod's.",5,2014,07,11
113,"Great Location, Fantastic Staff","Chose The Kensington  based on location and reviews on TA. Spent a week at the Kensington. Great location, great staff, especially Concierge staff.Front Desk staff, attentive  and friendly. Allesandro at the bar is great , Mixologist Par Excellence!

113,Amazing location & value,"Amazing two night break for The Libertines gig in Hyde Park. Perfect location within walking distance of a lot of great restaurants & Kensington High Street as well as tube access only a couple of mins away.

Will be back & also looking forward to checking out their Marylebone location. ",5,2014,07,10
113,Perfect Class,"This was out second Hotel in London and we loved it. Our first room was too small and they did all they could to accommodate our needs. Within hours our luggage was moved to a room twice the size and I figured I would be paying that as well however, when I got the bill I was pleasantly surprised that it was the same price. 
My daughter called it the princess room. 
We loved the neighborhood lots of great little restaurants and bars very close by and we walked to Harrods from there twice. 
We will def be back",5,2014,07,08
113,Excellent in almost every way,"The Kensington Hotel is unpretentious and quietly Grand at the same time. We stayed last weekend for my wife's Birthday in London. Easy to find and parked right outside the door. The concierge looked after moving it later the next day. Lovely suite on the top floor. Very comfy bed and all the facilities you would expect in a class hotel. The reception and particularly the Concierge were excellent giving advice on a very nice restaurant locally. Its easy to get into the West end and transport links are very good.

The ambience in the Breakfast room and Bar in the Hotel was friendly and informal and the food was limited but very good quality.
The only advice to the hotel would be the Cocktails are mediocre and the Service at Breakfast was not as attentive as perhaps it could have been. Otherwise top marks. We would definitely stay again",5,2014,07,08
113,A Wonderful Stay in London,"I chose this hotel based on trip advisor ratings.  We had a wonderful time there. The location is fantastic and rooms were great for Europe!  We had an issue at arrival which was taken care of immediately to our total satisfaction! You couldn't ask for a better neighborhood to be able to walk around, take the Underground, eat at many restaurants etc.  We would definitely stay there again.  We are family of 6 and we had 3 rooms, doubles for the kids and a deluxe double for my husband and myself.  That room was the largest and a wonderful space but even the doubles for the children were roomy.  Highly recommend!
      ",5,2014,07,06
113,"Lovely, well sited hotel","After so much research, we finally decided on the Kensington Hotel due to mixture of great reviews and good prices.  We stayed three nights, taking the Eurostar from Paris.  Taxi was St. Pancras was about 25 pounds.  Hotel is lovely, as is the staff.  Max saved us some time and money on tickets for the Big Red Bus (don't recommend), the London Eye (fast pass is worth it) and the Tower of London.  Vincent had a wonderful restaurant recommendation for British food (Bumpkins).

Our first room was right by the elevator, though we had e-mailed that we wanted a quiet room.  The front desk person was reluctant to move us, but a manager walked us to room 428 to see if it was acceptable.  So funny.  It is all the way at the back and then you walk down about 8 stairs.  This room was exactly what we wanted.  Bed was comfy and room was very quiet.

No complaints after we were moved to the new room. Note that taxi to Heathrow was 60 pounds. Ouch, but still worth it.",5,2014,07,01
113,Pokey room,"The hotel overall is very nice.  However when you book online you never really know what you will get.  I booked what was billed as a ""Superior Room"".  So I guess I was thinking it would be pretty good.  However Superior in London must have another definition.  Maybe I'm out of touch with how much I need to spend to get a room.  Basically we got a room on the top floor, level 5.  This level of the building would most probably have been the servants sleeping quarters in what was probably an old London Terrace house.  Essentially the roof line and internal ceiling line is cut away so that the walls slope inwards.  This results in low head room , especially when negotiating the end of the double bed.  Getting into the bathroom was a funny one also.  The door only opened to give about 400mm between the corner of the vanity and the opened door!   Seriously these rooms are smaller and more pokey than most hotel rooms in Tokyo which has one of the worlds highest price/ sq meter costs. Believe me no room to swing a ""cat"".    They would have done better to leave the area as servants quarters or for services than converting them into rentable hotel rooms. The hallway connecting all the rooms to the lift area, while undoubtedly meeting London Council requirements , was just over a meter wide and 1.9m high maybe a bit less, so you should get the picture.  There was the maids service trolley in the hall when we were taken to our room, and the porter had to let us go on ahead, then move the trolley back past the lift area , just so he could then get our bags along the hallway!
Next time if I return to London will be more careful in room selection.
Apart from this , location and proximity to Tube, pubs etc was good.",4,2014,06,30
113,A little gem in stylish Chelsea,"Small but perfectly formed - that's the refurbished Kensington Hotel just a short stroll from Chelsea's King's Road.
Its service could not be faulted; nothing was too much trouble for the charming, mostly Irish, staff. In fact, the concierge valet-parked our car overnight for just ¬£5 - in the heart of London! - and brought it round next morning ready for our departure. 
My husband and I agreed that breakfast, individually served at our table in the lounge, was the best we had ever had in a hotel.  Interesting and unusual dishes and juice cocktails were all available, freshly prepared to order, as were the more typical English breakfast choices.  All absolutely delicious!
Our room was quite small, but both it and the bathroom were beautifully designed and presented.
There was even a Nespresso coffee machine  - what style!  
This is going to be our home from home in London from now on. 
A delightful experience in every way.",5,2014,06,30
113,Lovely hotel,"We stayed here for one night but wished it had been longer.  Great location, lovely hotel (room a little on the small side but very well appointed and comfortable) and very friendly and efficient staff.",5,2014,06,28
113,Did Not Disappoint,"We enjoyed a lovely five night stay at the Kensington Hotel.  It's a beautiful hotel in a great location with professional and attentive staff.  Our room was nicely furnished, linens luxurious and bed very comfortable.  Nightly turndown service includes a sweet treat which was fun to find.  Wifi worked flawlessly during entire stay!  Gym is nicely equipped and was spotless.  Excellent experience.",5,2014,06,26
113,Highly recommended!,"My family and I stayed at The Kensginton Hotel for 2 nights in early June.  We booked after reading all the great reviews on TA and as usual, we were not disappointed.  This is an absolutely lovely boutique hotel located in a great part of London.  We had 5 people in our party so we booked two rooms:  a standard room for one couple and a superior room with an extra bed for the remaining 3 people.  It worked out great.  Yes, the rooms are small-ish, but so are the prices.  I don't think you can find anything else as lovely for the same money in the same area.

We had afternoon tea in the hotel and it was absolutely fantastic.  Elegant service, tasty sandwiches, scones and pastries and all-around great.  Breakfast is served in the same area.  The breakfast was plentiful.  Lots of fresh juices, cereals, breads, meats and cheeses, yogurt, etc.  You won't walk away hungry.  Our waiter both days in the restaurant was George and he was delightful!  He was so cheerful and interested in where we were from and how we were enjoying our holiday.  

The hotel is within walking distance of so many great places (Kensington Palace, Harrods, South Kensington tube station).  We would definitely stay here again when visiting London.",5,2014,06,24
113,A London Gem,"The Kensington Hotel is, in my family's opinion, the best hotel in London.  It offers first class service, beautiful rooms, an excellent location, and the best staff a guest could possibly hope for in a London hotel.  An added bonus is the Kensington's superb concierge team.   Vincent and Max are a resource that should not be overlooked by any guest.  The Kensington was our home away from home.  Thank you!",5,2014,06,24
113,Excellent stay at The Kensington Hotel,We booked a last minute mid week stay for two nights at The Kensington Hotel. The main reason we booked this hotel was due to it's the central location. It was around a 5/10 minute stroll to South Kensington tube station. The surrounding area was full of plenty deli's and shops. It's also perfectly located for visiting the museums and art galleries. Exceptional concierge and reception service. Will book to stay again in the future.,5,2014,06,23
113,Very posh!,"One of the Doyle Collection's hotels, The Kensington Hotel is a wonderful spot in South Kensington where you can sit and relax in their gorgeous surroundings! It is all very civilised and posh. Wonderful for Afternoon Tea for 2! The food is delicious and served very well, just what you would expect for a few days in London! I can't wait to go back!",5,2014,06,22
113,Great Experience,"Being first time visitors to London, we weren't quite sure what to expect from our accommodations and service. This hotel far exceeded our expectations. The staff greeted us upon our arrival at the curb where our driver dropped us off. From there on the service kept getting better and better. The desk clerks, manager and concierge were excellent both helpful and informative. The room was well appointed, clean and large enough for our needs. The traditional English breakfast, which was included in our room rate was perfect, giving us a choice between a beautiful buffet or a cooked to order meal with may items to choose from. The concierges set up tours for us and explained carefully and patiently everything we needed to have a great time. The hotel is located in a beautiful neighborhood with plenty of shops and restaurants. There are 2 or 3 museums within walking distance as well. We will definitely stay there again on our next visit. Well Done!!",5,2014,06,22
113,Wonderful stay,"The staff here are truly amazing people. I loved the location. The tours we booked picked us  in the morning right in front of the hotel. After sightseeing in London it was nice to come back to a quiet hotel. You are still walking distance to Harrods, Natural History Museum, Albert and Victoria Museum and other great places. The rooms are extremely small and the floors really creak. But with that said, I would come back because of the staff. I have to mention the Concierge, he asked if we would like to see a play. So we asked if it was possible to get Phantom of the Opera tickets for the same night and he delivered. We had great seats and he made sure we had several dining recommendations. Thank you!

113,"Almost perfect, especially if you are in one of the little ""suites""","My usual London haunt The Arch in Grand Cumberland Place was booked out so I stayed here on recommendation of a colleague. It was such a lovely experience, I am thinking of changing allegiances. With exception of some minor glitches at breakfast and patchy service at lunchtime, and dusty bedside posters and furniture, which is not a huge drama, this was almost a perfect experience. I especially loved the attention to details, absolutely the best housekeeping staff I have encountered on my frequent travels, and super friendly reception staff, especially french speaking gentleman on reception who was always happy to help with a smile.  I stayed in room 118 on the first floor which had its own balcony, they opened the window for me so I could sleep without aircon and with fresh air, which I really appreciated. Beautiful bathroom, actually it is probably one of the cosiest interiors I have had pleasure to say in in a long time. Just the right balance between decorative and modern. Coffee machine, tea making facility, chocolates and weather card on the pillow, and lovely little surprises from housekeeping staff every day (eg mango iced tea with homemade mango cookies on a hot day), all just a bonus. Loved this place and already look forward to next stay.",4,2014,06,21
113,gran place with nice staff,"wonderful location, boutique hotel, bit pricy, very nice staff, tasty breakfast in stylish room around fireplace. I ve been redirected here from Melia White House Hotel because of booking system error and found out this hotel is beautiful but not worth the money for me as they charge 320 GBP per room. However I enjoyed the stay here",4,2014,06,18
113,"Excellent hotel, great staff!","We stayed 3 nights at the Kensington, and what a stay we had! Great hotel - elegant and classy hotel which felt like home from the moment we arrived. Warm and cosy atmosphere throughout. The staff are EXCELLENT! Very friendly, warm, genuine, helpful, so service minded. Martyn, George and Elisa deserve a special mention. They made our stay so memorable! I can't fault the hotel one bit, and I've stayed at many hotels! Very comfortable bed and the little extras that came with the turndown service was a very nice touch. Great location near the underground and close to many restaurants and shops. Fantastic breakfast and the afternoon tea was great too. Don't miss the eggs royale for breakfast and the scones are homemade and really delicious! I highly recommend this hotel , and would stay here again on my next trip to London.",5,2014,06,17
113,Great Hotel,"I booked a secret hotel deal on Last Minute and was very happy when the hotel name was revealed as the location was perfect for the weekend in London. From the moment of check in I knew this hotel was going to be a delight, the staff were friendly and very professional and check in was a delight. The rooms were great, not the biggest rooms I have had in London but everything you need and were clean and well kept. I did not have breakfast but the bar area was very comfortable and as I meet friends there was perfect as was quite and impressive with the decor. Internet was free as I had booked an executive room and was fast and reliable again not always the norm. I loved staying here and hope to again.",5,2014,06,16
113,Super hotel,Had a wonderful two nights stay at this hotel.   Fantastic room.    Amazingly comfortable bed.   Really high quality toiletries.    Turn down service in the evening and nice touch of a chocolate mint on the pillow.  Superb service.   Great breakfasts.  Staff went out of their way to be helpful.  All in all a wonderful experience.  Would  highly recommend this hotel.,5,2014,06,13
113,Kensington,"Quality hotel in desirable location.  The rooms were reasonable size and adequate bathroom with shower. The service was exceptionable.  Good location  close to underground, Kensington gardens, and museums and a 20 minute walk to Herrod's.",5,2014,06,13
113,"Great location, excellent tea service","My wife and I stayed at the Kensington Hotel for the third leg of our anniversary trip to Europe. The staff were exceptionally friendly.  I was well rested every night with no comfort or noise issues. Breakfast was absolutely delicious every day.  The afternoon tea service is a must!  Great way to relax and recharge after travelling.  
      ",5,2014,06,12
113,Great staff made for a good stay,"Just spent two nights at this hotel and I must say the staff are super. Special mention to the porter who supplied cold bottles of water following our morning run. Nice touch. Reception staff were also excellent. Internet worked without the usual fuss fo some hotels. Room was clean as you would expect.. Coffee machine, nice bed linen and a comfortable bed. Our room 521 was very small and more like a single room than a double which was disappointing. The neighborhood is great for restaurants, bars and coffee shops. Also very convenient to the tube  for District and Piccadilly line so a good spot to stay for getting around. Didn't eat there so can't comment.",4,2014,06,12
113,The Best Hotel in London,"Great hotel with fantastic staff, service was first class, our suite was perfect, room service breakfast was all very good and the longe service in the evening very attentive.
I would recommend this hotel as one of the best I have stayed in.

113,Fantastic Hotel,"We spent a night in the Kensington Hotel and found it to be wonderful. The room was well appointed and the service and friendly staff were exceptional. Food and facilities were also great and the WIFI was simple to connect to and it worked well. Room was very clean, bed was comfy and the room had everything we needed. 
The friendly service from the staff makes the difference though - they were exceptional - making it a great hotel. When we asked for something it just happened - and quickly. 
Close to an underground station so getting around is simple. 
We also loved the Nespresso machine but not all rooms may have one?",5,2014,06,10
113,"Nice hotel, nothing exceptional","We stayed only for one night at this hotel and we like it. We were upgraded on arrival and had a very spacious room, with comfortable bedding, still there is nothing special. Breakfast was not pleasant at all.",4,2014,06,09
113,The best in England,"This place was even better than described. It is calm and spacious and has charm and style. We loved Staying here and looking into the queensgate you have a feeling of staying in the posh precint and 20 minutes away from oxford street .
We could calmly start in the morning and take our breakfast  and when we came back from the hustle of the city could have a bite and some nice relaxion.
The staff here treated us as if we were friends and took care for everything we needed or wanted to know. Thank you for everything - Danke f√ºr alles. If we come back to London we would like to stay here again.",5,2014,06,08
113,Wonderful Stay,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Kensington.  The desk, concierge and housekeeping staff were all friendly and helpful.  This was our first trip to London, so were were a little unsure about the location of the hotel, but we couldn't have picked a better one.  Within a short walk you are at the South Kensington tube stop and the neighborhood has many restaurants, bars and markets.  We also walked to Kensington Palace and gardens and the Royal Albert Hall for a concert.  Our hotel room was called a family room.  It was large with two double beds and a huge bathroom.  It faced out the back of the hotel.  The view was the roof tops of other buildings, but it was quiet.  Our stay was so comfortable and relaxing after full days of sightseeing.  We also had breakfast and high tea in the first floor restaurant, both times it was delicious.",5,2014,06,08
113,Superb Hotel,"The Kensington is a fantastic hotel, the rooms are a decent size, well decorated and spotless, the bar area and whole of downstairs is excellent , staff are very attentive and the location is spot on a short walk from Knightsbridge and the museums. Would recommend !!",5,2014,06,08
113,Fab Birthday!,"Celebrated my birthday with a night and meal at The Kensington Hotel with my boyfriend. Upon arrival I noticed the wonderful aroma in the lobby, I think the hotel must work closely with an aromatherapy company as I noticed the shampoo and conditioner were aromatherapy as well. We were upgraded upon our arrival as it was my birthday and we were only staying one night. The room was fabulous with a big bed, huge bathroom and amenities (Nespresso machine). I was delighted to receive a bottle of prosecco and small cakes with my name on the plate in the room with a personal note from the hotel. My boyfriends plan but orchestrated perfectly by the hotel and the personal note was a great touch. 

The marble bathroom was the pi√®ce de r√©sistance of the room, walk-in shower, separate loo, and small television in the bathtub. 

Dinner was very good in the small but lovely hotel restaurant, a bit awkward being seated in the restaurant as there is no hostess or clear front door. All in all it was a lovely ""staycation"" in London... would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a luxurious relaxing holiday.",5,2014,06,08
113,"Perfect stay, great service",The hotel was nicer than I expected. It was clean and tastefully decorated. Nice thoughtful touches managers and staff made me feel welcomed. Loved the neighborhood. Very quiet and felt safe enough to walk around. Hotel is definitely on my list to stay on my next visit to London,5,2014,06,07
113,terrific hotel,"The room is quite lovely. Personally it is my favourite theme for a room. The room was very clean when I arrived, and the checking was easy. It is also in a very good location. Many cafes open late, if that's your sort of thing. Relatively close to the subway. One of the best features of the room is the shower. It was a big, powerful shower head. Over the public area is luxurious and very comfortable.
George is a wonderful staff, the best service I‚Äôve had so far throughout London. Always willing to help out in any way he can, and he is extremely friendly and I definitely recommend him
The one thing I have to mention is about is the room is just slightly too small. Particularly the shower, you have to position yourself in a certain way to get the shower door to close. Can be awkward when you have multiple people in there. But the room is still worth staying in.
Overall a wonderful stay.",5,2014,06,06
113,LOVED LOVED LOVED,"we visited at the end of may and spent 5 nights here. It was such a lovely stay! the staff were completely kind and helpful. yes, the room was small, but that is just typical in europe. I loved that they provided umbrellas, especially since it rained 4 of the 5 days we spent exploring london. i would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone! great location, quiet and safe, but still next to so many restaurants and shops. For burgers, may we suggest byron burger around the corner. we also loved it being close to south kensington station.",5,2014,06,05
113,Exceptional Service,"I recently stayed here for two nights for my wedding. I was overwhelmed by the excellent service and attention I received from the hotel during my stay. They went out of their way to ensure that my stay at the hotel was a positive experience and they over delivered on everything. Even though I  live in London, I would love to come here again for a staycation!",5,2014,06,05
113,Wowed in London,"We found the hotel very much at first sight it seemed small but it was fine. We were warmly welcomed us and everything was well explained. The room was very clean and nice light. The bed and bathroom were fine, the shower only had a massive pour. The hotel looked outside a traditional townhouse and from the inside it was very nice. It was less than a 5 minute walk to south Kensington subway station. From there it was about 25 minutes to Oxford Circus, with change at piccadilly. At the south Kensington subway station were small shops and restaurants (and a Starbucks). There was also a very big shopping. There were tesco and Waitrose supermarkets,the bumpkin was very nice eatery have eaten here expanded, with desserts and drinks and it was really delicious! We can definitely recommend this. We felt very much at home in this hotel and we hope to stay here soon again.",5,2014,06,04
113,A really exciting hotel,"it‚Äôs a great place to stay both for short and long trip. It is a family friendly hotel plus it has everything you need and it is very comfortable and convenient. The hotel is very secure & without keycards you cannot access the doors
It is situated in a nice neighbourhood with shops all around,Oh, and for those who love clubbing, downstairs in the same neighbourhood, there is one of the hottest clubs called the buji‚Äôs club  which regularly hosts famous DJs and as well as celebrities.
All in all a great place to stay and if I came back to London I wouldn't want to be staying anywhere else!",5,2014,06,04

-Quiet location; almost forget you are in a huge city
-Cool view from the windows
-Good Internet connection
-Adequately furnished for our needs
-Good for families with kids
-Nice refrigerator
The service from the staff is brilliant and they exceed your expectation, overall this a hotel /home away from home.",5,2014,06,04
113,"A good, solid choice","First off - location.  It's only about a 5-minute walk from the South Kensington tube station, and along the way there are lots of restaurants and bakeries.  What I enjoyed about the area is that one almost feels like going back to a neighborhood, with small independent shops, instead of being in a commercial area.  
Rooms - okay, they are small, but the decor is nice and the place is well-maintained.  I've stayed there twice and even being only on the 2nd floor it was always quiet at night. 
Service - Concierge and front desk are helpful and pleasant. 

That's why I titled this 'a good, solid choice' - you won't find much to quip about, but it also isn't a big 'wow' hotel.  I definitely would go back again because I find it reliable and consistent in both stays.",4,2014,06,02
113,Our London experience,"we have nothing negative to say about this hotel !   we stayed only 2 nights in London :( ‚Ä¶.but this hotel helped our stay to be very enjoyable‚Ä¶We totally enjoyed London & the Kensington hotel‚Ä¶.also think the location is excellent

113,Enjoyed the Irish hospitality,"We had a fantastic time here we felt like we could really make ourselves feel 'at home' with use of the lobby, gym. it was nice to look outside each morning to see the fresh blue skies for the day ahead. The bed was comfortable and nice linen was soft. There was plenty of space to hang clothes and some space for suitcase. We enjoyed the Irish welcome and staff gave us some good local drinking and dining recommendations. The hotel also was very kind to leave a surprise fruits and chocolates. The local area is absolutely fabulous ‚Äì Old brompton street is part of the thriving south Kensington and also has great bars and restaurants meaning you could easily get back after a late night. The hotel is also close to two different subway stations. Despite this, the hotel was very quiet and we always slept well. We would definitely consider staying here again for our next visit to London! Thanks for your great Irish hospitality!",5,2014,06,01
113,Elegant hotel in a beautiful area,"The staff is very helpful and welcomed us with face towels since we had just landed from a very long trip. Felt great! The concierges are the best and most helpful!!!!  The room and the bathroom were quite small but I loved the Aromatherapy products!

113,"Nice Place to stay, away from the crowds!","I loved this hotel. It is in a quiet neighborhood  with in walking distance of the Museum of Science, Albert and Victoria Museum, Hyde park and the tube. Their choice of bath product are very good. They have in room coffee and tea, with turndown service. The staff is attentive and they always greeted and helped us with a smile. Breakfast was real good, my husband fell in love with their scrambled eggs, bacon and coffee. I liked the variety of choices of the continental breakfast. High tea was excellent, I loved it!

I would have given them a 5 stars, but for 2 days our trash was not taken out. And they would replace the coffee and cream in the room, but they would not replace the coffee cups? The complimentary water was not replaced, is that only for the first day?
At one point we had a tray in the room and the turndown service did not remove it. Perhaps I was supposed to call call the kitchen to have it done. I did not want to put it out in the hall, because they are narrow and I did not want anyone tripping on it.",4,2014,05,29
113,Very pleasant hotel,"I arrived at this hotel to find the service very good and the room quiet.  I liked the sitting room where breakfast and all day snacks were served; it was very cheerful and welcoming.  The location, near Hyde Park, is convenient but not so close to the main tourist areas of London as to be too noisy or busy.  All in all, a very enjoyable stay.",5,2014,05,28
113,Boutique hotel in great location,Just minutes from the Kensington tube station and restaurants and cafes just around the corner this lovely boutique hotel may be pricey but it is a find.  My room faced the back and it was incredibly quiet. Not the typical cookie cutter corporate hotel room either. The rooms are beautifully appointed but very small - I was in a superior double with a small table side chair and the bed - nothing else would fit! The shower and bath were equally as tiny. But quality throughout!  Aromatherapy products in the bath were a nice touch. just around the corner is a Cafe Nero and Muriel's Kitchen where I found a less expensive and lovely breakfast. I would definitely go again.,4,2014,05,27
113,Friendly hotel,"Fantastic hotel right in the centre of Kensington Very quiet road - no noise at all but a two minute walk from the Tube station , Lovely independent shops & restaurants at the end of the road. - everything we could have possibly needed was there and all lovely things.

113,An Ideal Choice,"A really lovely hotel in a wonderful location. Just up the road: Kensington Park and Hyde Park for a morning run. Quick breakfast spots nearby and the tube is right around the corner. I stayed in 210 and it was ideal. The staff even sent up a small bar fridge upon request. My only complaint: a tiny shower, but this is London and space is at a premium. More importantly: the staff was wonderful. Everyone I dealt with went way beyond the call of duty. One of the women at the front desk even popped up to help with a dress zipper one night. :) Special kudos to Martin, the Concierge, who helped me plot each day and offered detailed and excellent advice on getting around town. He even hailed my cab, loaded my bags into it and sent me on my way back to Canada. Would not even consider looking for a different hotel next time. In fact several of my friends were staying around the corner and once they got a look at my setup, they all intend to try the Kensington.",5,2014,05,21
113,Very comfortable stay,"We got upgraded when we arrived for no extra cost which was a nice surprise, we were visitng Chelsea flower show for my birthday, it was a very comfrortable welcoming hotel, with really nice touches like offers of water to take, maps of the area etc.  Would highly recommend it.",5,2014,05,21
113,Wonderful find,"We stayed for one night and booked this hotel at the last moment. We were returning from a short vacation in Italy and decided to have a night in London before heading back home (Scotland). From start to finish the experience surpassed our expectations. We frequently stay in London with a couple of 5star hotels who always provide a beautiful experience for the guest. However, The Kensington Hotel could match the others in terms of the excellent service from ALL members of staff. And that was without exception. You are made to feel welcome, that you are important to them. Nothing is too much trouble. The staff are very polished. The hotel itself is beautiful. Charming boutique style but with more of an air of authenticity than some other small hotels which fall under this banner.  The room we had was perhaps a bit on the small side. However, it was adequate for our needs for one night, if we had been staying longer, we would have opted for a larger room. Lastly, the breakfast was perfect. Served in the drawing room, it was leisurely, with great food and attentive service",5,2014,05,21
113,Fantastic,Great hotel. Staff superb besides attitude of one waitress in restaurant. The food was top notch. The high tea was amazing. the rooms clean neat and spacious. location was perfect. Concierge Vincent was great. Would stay hear again.,5,2014,05,20
113,Home away from home!,"This is now one of my favorite hotels ever.  The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly. The hotel is small and beautifully furnished. WiFi was free.  They had a wonderful breakfast spread which was included, served in a cozy setting.  The food was good, location great.....we could walk to the V&A, Hyde Park, Harrods.  We enjoyed a lovely high tea sitting in the parlor. They couldn't do enough for us and Vincent, the concierge was a doll and gave us great tips for touring. I absolutely love London and would come back here again.",5,2014,05,20
113,one word say's it all - the best,"The hotel is very nice, cozy, calm, clean and well equipped. When you get outside you find yourself in a culinary paradise with bakeries and plenty of shops selling Japanese sushi, French & Swiss cheese, fruits, chocolate and cooked specialities from all over the world. , Victoria and Albert hall, natural history museum and the science museum are within walking distance (10 to 15 Minutes), which makes the place an ideal starting point",5,2014,05,19
113,The epitome of hospitality,"Amazing place! Definitely recommend it for anyone looking for somewhere beautiful and unusual to stay in Kensington. The area is lovely, all the sights, museums and parks and shops including Harrods in walking distance and fantastic staff like Elisa, George and Steven. The Kensington hotel has been beautifully decorated. I will definitely stay here again.",5,2014,05,19
113,Incredibly fabulous,"Our stay with Kensington hotel was perfect and we were made to feel at ease immediately, and were very informed with great recommendations for bars, restaurants, bakeries, etc. in the neighbourhood.
It is comfortable and traditionally luxurious, and feels Irish and English at the same time. It is part of a very cool compound of buildings. Every aspect of the building, the entry door, walkway, and buildings themselves are beautiful and impeccably maintained. The neighbourhood is also awesome - our favourite in London with tons of activity around our whole experience was great, the whole thing feels like an episode in made in Chelsea
 I would highly recommend this place!

113,relaxing and great for Business,"I stayed here while on a business trip on and the hotel is beautifully decorated with amazing art pieces. I had a very comfortable room and a marble bathroom .The location is very central and extremely convenient, with plenty of nice restaurants nearby. Staff spent a lot of time with me advising various points of interest from parks to famous landmarks, giving restaurants or visits suggestions.
I will definitely come back if I have the opportunity to do so, whether it is for business or for holiday!",5,2014,05,18
113,Luxury and excellent staff,"This was my first experience with a london hotel and it was definitely positive. Sylvia is a great and very friendly manager who will do anything to accommodate your wishes and was extremely helpful, The highlights here are comfort, cleanliness and luxury. Not just the room, but also the lounging place and the bar finally the building and the location is great. I would highly recommend everyone to stay at the Kensington hotel.",5,2014,05,18
113,A Perfect Stay,"Everything was just perfect for our holiday in London.

The location was just perfect in nice neighborhood, it's quick walk to South Kensington station, close to all attractions, but the quiet location provide you with a relaxing environment when you return.  We enjoyed morning run from hotel to Kensington Park/Hyde Park (hotel provided jogging map), I also found the fantastic yoga studio (evolve wellness centre).  Great neighborhood restaurants, cafes, TESCO : ) and Aus Merveilleux De Fred near by.

As a frequent traveler to NYC, I was pleasantly surprise with spacious room & bathroom!  Room amenities such as Nespresso and electric kettle was a big plus.  Daily breakfast was included, but at the check out the hotel gave us a 15% discount on our restaurant/bar bill for our ""long"" stay which was 5 nights.

All hotel staff are professional, yet friendly, and eager to help.  Everyone - I mean everyone made us feel very welcome throughout our stay.  

Thank you for making our first visit to London very memorable.

113,Luxury and comfort ,"I have now been using this hotel for two years for business and personal visits to London.  Very good, staff remember you, which makes a difference.  They are renovating the breakfast area but it is not disturbing the customers in any shape .... ",4,2014,05,17
113,The excellent 5 star hotel with a royalty style service,"Staying in this lovely hotel for the first time and turned out to be a wonderful experience and set the bar really high. 
I have got to say even with all those remarkable reviews there is still more to be said. 
There is the Aubrey bar on the ground floor of the hotel that has wonderful cocktail (even one custom made for me) and amazing food that I was introduced to. 
Hotel is as described and even better. To say its clean is an understatement‚Ä¶ if not anal. The hotel is welcoming, airy, light and with the sun shining through ‚Äìtruly a beautiful sunny room with a view. The room is a great size with an amazing bed which one has to try to appreciate. Tons of storage, luggage storages, hangers, AC. There is everything you need in the hotel and if it is not there , they will provide it ... You could pretty much just come with your luggage as they  provides toiletries and good quality ones. I can be fussy with towels, sheets, bathrooms... But had no hesitation to touch, feel or lay on anything. 
George is the greatest staff of all time and depending on whether you want a friend or just a server, a translator of a couple of languages (Japanese included) or any info around London you have it. He is warm, pleasant, genuinely cares and will go out of his way to make your stay a pleasant one. The hotel is well located, from the day I arrived, exploring Hyde Park, exploring food and cocktails, dining with Londoners. They were was also very flexible in checking in and out and offered to let me store my luggage after the new guest arrived.
I haven't stopped relaying my experience to family, friends and all and would definitely stay at here and wish the hotel had more locations all over the world. I will recommend anyone to stay with here. As the Kensington hotel goes by the rule of thumb ‚Äúhome away from home‚Äù.
Thank you also to Andrea, Gillian and everyone for a great experience. Hopefully see you soon.",5,2014,05,15
113,"Very good service, perfect location","South Kensington metro station, Science Museum, Natural History Museum, Albert and Victoria Museum, Royal Albert Hall, Imperial College and Kensington Park are all in walking distance. Rooms are quite small, but clean and tidy. Meals are delicious, hotel staff is very polite and helpful.",5,2014,05,14
113,Very nice but not worth the price,"I've stayed here twice. The first time was during the Olympics. Probably one of the best rooms I've ever enjoined. I assumed this was the norm. I was wrong. The second time was in May and my room was smaller than most closets.   I changed rooms the second night, for a slight up charge, and found it only slightly bigger. Overall a beautiful hotel in a great neighborhood but not worth the very high price. ",4,2014,05,14
113,"returning customer, simply the best","I stayed here last year and this place never lets me down.  Besides being brilliantly located to the underground, rooms are great, breakfast is of five star standrd with great selection of jam and conti.  Staff even better than before, especially the gentleman on the desk (sorry dont remember the name).",5,2014,05,13
113,Perfect London Hotel,"I've stayed in a number of London hotels, but the Kensington Hotel is a keeper.  This is a charming hotel with great service, in the middle of Kensington.  You are a short walk to the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Natural History Museum, the Royal Albert Hall (the Proms anyone?) and Harrods.  This is a great area just to wander around and experience the city, to head over to Hyde Park. It is an easy walk to a tube stop. And quite literally around the corner on the Old Brompton Road there are any number of restaurants for any meal of the day.  I had a fine italian meal and discovered the pleasure of Bumpkin, which I urge you to try.
In the hotel, the spacious and lovely ""Drawing Room"" is the perfect place to unwind, have a drink, or a light meal.  It's actually a perfect place to pass the time reading in a comfy chair by the fire, taking a break from meetings or seeing the sights.  The rooms can vary in size, but even though mine was a bit on the smaller side, it was perfectly fine (and I loathe small rooms).  I love well run older hotels with charm, and so forgive them their quirks and idiosyncrasies (because I do not want the surefire sameness of a chain), and in this room, it was necessary to forgive them the size of the bathroom, which was quite small (that is not true in all the rooms).  But it was an extremely efficiently designed bathroom, to make up for the lack of space.  And I would trade that small discomfit for the pleasure of sitting by that fire, and the genuine and professional service of the staff. I have just discovered the Doyle Collection of Hotels (through their alliance with Omni) and the warmth and competence of their staffs seems to be a trademark. Having stayed in two of them, in two countries. in one week, I am sold.",5,2014,05,13
113,"Beautiful area, beautiful hotel","The Kensington Hotel is located in the beautiful South Kensington area of London.  It is about 2 blocks from the tube station.  The staff is sofisticated, efficient, and very friendly.  The rooms are small, but very well appointed.  Every need is met (free bottled water each night, coffee, tea service ( complete with a tea pot and shortbread) gourmet coffee selections, robes, slippers, umbrella).  This hotel feels classy without being pretentious. I will definitely book here again",5,2014,05,13
113,‚ÄúHighly recommended‚Äù,"Very well located central to tube station Rates are good too. Rooms bright, stylish and open. Beds are superb and hard to get up out of for all the good reasons. dinning room is superb with un-intrusive service. bar and lounge also worth a look. Cant wait for my next passing through kensington.",4,2014,05,13
113,Our new go-to hotel in London,"Wonderful hotel, excellent service, lovely room.

We stayed for a long weekend over the recent bank holiday and the staff were so helpful, especially Max, Vincent, and the other front staff.

My husband had to do a phone conference call after we had checked out, and the staff showed him to a cozy area near the elevators where it was quiet and semi-private, while I waited and enjoyed tea in the comfy lounge area. 

The area is upscale and residential, close enough to restaurants and shopping and transportation. 

We're members of The Doyle Group loyalty program, and we'll definitely be back. We recommend this hotel very highly.",5,2014,05,12
113,A real pleasure,"A very nice hotel in a very nice location in the middel of Kensington area. Close to the tube and to the Museum and University area. The staff is very kind. My room was a little bit small and I had a little problem with the room's shower
      ",5,2014,05,11
113,Terrific,"We had a wonderful stay while staying here
All staff are supersweet  with few exceptions namely Eliza, Silvia and Jimmy and the hotel is really nice. Our  room for was spacious  spacious ,tidy.  Breakfast was lovely with cereals, yoghurt, toast and different kind of jam, honey etc (and of course  the irish breakfast which was very yummy, you can also order a Guinness bread a traditional Irish classic and the service was efficient too.
South Kensington and Chelsea is a really nice area with plenty of good restaurants,bars and cute little shops. We would highly recommend staying here when visiting London , and there is no need to go into the city for a good meal or drinks. West Kensington, Chelsea or notting hill and Portobello market are all worth a visit, and it is a nice stroll over to Brompton Road and getting off at the famous kings road, That said it is also very convenient with the trains to the city centre just 200 meters or so away.
Would love to go back, and will never consider staying anywhere else if visiting London again.",5,2014,05,10
113,"The positives outweigh the negatives, so go ahead and stay here!","My daughter and I visited London in early April for a week and stayed at The Kensington Hotel.  We selected this hotel due to its location and it did not disappoint.  We were an easy five-minute walk past stores and restaurants to the South Kensington Underground station, which in turn connected us quickly to all the sites we wanted to see.  We loved being able to swing in a grocery to pick something up on the way our or on the way home.  Besides the location, we loved the free WiFi as it helped us plan out our activities day by day.

Like many European hotels, we expected a small room.  However, the ""superior"" room was very small.  Just enough space to walk around the bed, only one chair for sitting and limited closet space.  On the bright side, we were just steps from everything in our room.  

The bathroom was tiny, too.  We could turn in a circle in the bathroom and reach everything.  It is important to note that if a guest weighs more than 150 pounds, squeezing into the shower between the two glass doors would be a challenge. I was dismayed to find evidence of mold and soap scum in the shower.  It is true that the bathrooms are done in marble, but it is important to note that the shower is not maintained.  We had to ask to have the edging on the door fixed as it was allowing water to leak onto the floor.  Because the bathroom floor space is so small, after a shower you found yourself standing in shower water.  The hotel staff did make that fix upon request, but it should have been noticed by the housekeeping staff and addressed without us bringing it to their attention.

We had a room on the fourth floor by the elevator.  Unfortunately, we could hear the elevator bell each time it came and went.  By the third night, we were getting used to it.  However, the elevator was seemingly silenced when I was awoken by what I thought was the arrival of severe weather or rushing water. A quick look thru the peep hole revealed a hotel staff vacuuming the elevator / hallway at 3:10 AM. Ugh!

In summary, if you can live in tight spaces, love convenient locations and want to spend your days enjoying London and not your hotel room, this is the place for you.  If you are claustrophobic or OCD when it comes cleanliness, you may want to consider another option.",4,2014,05,08
113,Wonderful Hotel and Great Service!,This was an amazing hotel from the moment I stepped into the lobby.  The staff go out of their way to make sure everything is wonderful.  My room was comfortable and had every amenity you could want.  The concierge booked us a BMW to the airport and offered suggestions for a wonderful Italian meal in the area.  It is in a quaint neighborhood with several restaurants and shopping nearby.  Our waiter for breakfast was wonderful anticipating our every need and the food was delicious.  On my next trip to London I am sure to come back and stay here my only bummer was that I wasn't staying longer!,5,2014,05,07
113,A must for Afternoon Tea!,"My husband and myself were in London celebrating our 10th Wedding Anniversary and we were looking for somewhere special for afternoon tea. Well I am so glad we found this gem of a place! From the moment we were shown to our table we knew that this was somewhere special! Once we were seated a glass of champagne was brought over to us by George, what a lovely man he is! I don't think I have ever met a waiter so helpful and friendly, his smile lit the whole room! I had mentioned at the time of booking that it was our anniversary and the chef had prepared a special plate just for us, as well as the usual afternoon tea. The tea is fantastic and we were also given an extra pot of hot water to top our teas up with! The food was lovely, fantastic sandwiches, scones with clotted cream and jam so delicious! And the cakes, well what can I say I have never enjoyed cake as much as I did! We sat for over two hours, and we were never once hurried or felt as if we had over stayed our welcome! This  really is a must for afternoon tea if you are in the area and I would return if I am in London again!",5,2014,05,06
113,Very pleasant experience," 
I had a great time at this hotel.
 
It is very well situated, close to main subway lines and within easy walking distance of all great attractions.
 
It is well furnished and was perfect for our week. The rooms was extremely comfortable, which is nice after a long day walking up and down the city. Good heating system too, very appreciated
 
As said before in the comments, it is a a home away from home the, but nothing you would not expect in a city centre with a homely feel. The bathroom was awesome- the water was plentiful and that was definitely a plus and I think it's worth the credit.
 
Communication with the guest relation staff was easy (thanks Szilvia !!), and I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to enjoy a gateaway in London england!",5,2014,05,05
113,Amazing service!,This is a wonderful hotel and I would highly recommend it.  The service was wonderful and the staff were very helpful.  I would have like dto stay longer and would come back to this hotel again on my next trip to London. The rooms were quiet and very comfortable.  The area around the hotel was very nice and was more of a residential area with lots of restaurants within walking distance.,5,2014,05,05
113,Indulgent experience!!!,"As always this place never lets you down!! Location is great. Atmosphere  and experience was fabulous. Food was amazing and drinks made by talented Alessandro were very , very delicious!  Thank you all for fabulous evening! ",5,2014,05,05
113,Steps to the Tube,"Charming, elegant, yet relaxed and friendly.  Steps to the South Kensington station, Victoria & Albert Museum, Kensington Place and so much more. Hotel staff courteous, and Martin the hotel Concierge is an absolute pleasure to work with. Rooms are comfortable, large soaker tub with a TV for those that need some relaxation after a busy day of touring London.",5,2014,05,04
113,fantastic hotel with fantastic staff,"Kensington hotel was fantastic! We really appreciated the interior design and style, making a traditional English feel amazingly comfortable, spacious, and relaxing. The hotel was wonderful, the room super comfortable, the shower strong and hot, the mini fridge was stocked with some great necessities and surprises, it was very, very quiet (and I am a light sleeper) since it faces the queens gate street , the bed was great, plenty of storage and closet space, umbrellas for use, extra phone chargers for use, and many other great additions that I do not have space to list. We only used the place as a couple, and it was wonderful for that, but it would be very comfortable for a third person if that was needed. The location is also superb. The royal borough of Kensington and Chelsea is a great, safe neighbourhood with fantastic places to eat and drink and transportation very close (although we did everything on foot since it is so central...walked to south Kensington Station in less than 10 min), but is also a very short and nice walk to many other great areas (Chelsea village, Harrods, Knightsbridge, Hyde park and green park, Westfield shopping mall, Portobello market , etc.). The Hyde Park was a few blocks away and that was very cool. Staff like Baptiste, George and Olga really did everything they could to make the place great and our stay easy. They were happy to recommend whatever we needed, including shopping places (we loved Harvey Nichols and Harrods...both a 10 min stroll away). Also a block away on old Brompton Street is Bumpkin restaurant/ Cafe (which was amazing! I have stayed in London all over the city, and my family is all from vancouver, and Kensington hotel is a GEM! If I am ever on need of a place in London again, I will definitely stay here. We searched and searched and searched, so save the search time and just book Kensington hotel.",5,2014,05,04
113,Truly a treat,"We came to London for a couple days and LOVED The Kensington Hotel! The room was so lovely and comfortable. The bathroom was tiny, but it was well-appointed and had a great makeup mirror, as well as a rain shower head. We were well-treated by the staff, who were pleasant and friendly. The concierge even arranged for a wheelchair to help my grandmother around town with all of the walking we were doing. Breakfast was very good and had many options such as fruit, cheese, yogurt, smoked fish, etc. We loved this hotel and would consider it again if returning to London. ",5,2014,05,03
113,Splendid,"April 2014---My husband and I booked this hotel for our recent holiday/business trip to London and were thoroughly pleased. We spent the first four days of our trip here. The hotel is impeccable and located in a wonderful residential area in South Kensington. It is a beautiful, extremely safe area with old historic English charm. There are some wonderful restaurants, museums, and shopping within walking distance. Also, excellent location to the tube. Max, Amy, Sylvia and Jemma were not only knowledgeable but also an absolute pleasure . We had a few bumps in the road and the maintenance person was called up to our room which resulted in a couple of room changes, but the third time is a charm. Our first room was a bit noisy since it was right at street level, as well as, having a leak in the bathroom, our second room had a T.V. that did not work, but the third room was not only beautiful with a lot of character, but extremely quiet and peaceful. Turn down service was special. They treated us very well and also went above and beyond to go out of their way to accommodate our needs. We will definitely be back in our future stay in London.",5,2014,05,03
113,beautiful hotel,"We had some great day¬¥s in London and this was also because we¬¥d found this wonderful hotel at kensington. It was as beautiful, and tastefully furnished as on the pictures shown. The room was very comfortable, pillows were nice and soft.
Shops are close by and it was a pleasure to have breakfast in this well well established hotel, with wooden panels and black marble tables
It was also a pleasure to sit in the beautiful lounging room just for a while to make plans for the day.
Staffs gave us a warm welcome and were very kind and helpful, e.g. Ronnie finding the bus to harrods or the fastest way to piccadilly. Also the tip for taking a cab was very helpful. He offered me bottle of water which really took us back.
We¬¥re looking forward to our next trip to London and then nowhere else than at the Kensington hotel
If there were more stars we would to give ‚Äì 100 stars !!!",5,2014,05,03
113,excellent Irish hotel,"This was perfect, and his hospitality was the best of our five country adventure! Check in was a quick process thanks to the fantastic Paul who was like literally waiting for us to come through the front door. The hotel was clean and very comfortable. shopping, eating, sites, transportations, and adventure are all advised by concierge Their attention to detail was impeccable. Local is great: a short ride from the train station with bus and tube stops well within walking distance. I literally have already recommended This hotel to my parents for their next trip to London!

If you stay here, you must go for A drink or food at aubreys restaurant with amazing service ever from the waiters ...If you want to be treated to good, honest Irish hospitality, The kensington hotel delivers a golden standard. Highly recommend!",5,2014,05,03
113,"Excellent Choice - quality, value, location","This is a wonderful hotel.  The location is fantastic.  A few minutes from the S.Kensington tube and it's fab eating places, around the corner from pubs, restaurants and shops. Close to everything, but on a quiet street. The hotel staff could not be more attentive. This hotel has a classy atmosphere. The lobby and 3 guest lounges are attractive and lively.  Their small restaurant features good food and a nice wine collection. The bar is very attractive. These areas are lively with guests chatting, reading, having a tea or a drink. It's very lively and friendly - great place to spend some time after a long day.  This hotel is very well appointed. Clean crisp sheets and towels, very nice complementary toiletries, coffee/tee station, large screen TV and a spa too!  Very, very nice. This hotel is a great value compared to other London hotels.  I will definitely be going back to this gem.",5,2014,05,03
113,One word- splendid hotel,"
My recent stay in this lovely hotel  was enjoyable and for me owed its appeal to two qualities. One is Staff who were charming, amiable and knowledgeable and are proud of their hotel and respectful of their guests. The other ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù was the amazing South kensington itself, with its magnificent heritage-protected architecture, fine restaurants around the area and rich connections to the London international rail services. The hotel has been thoughtfully laid out with amenities to make a stay comfortable (e.g., quality bed, modern bathroom ) and has a home-like lived in feel and very unique spaces. This is not a blank-slate hotel-type as would be expected for some hotels in london All staff demonstrated great integrity and thoughtfulness in handling my needs and I felt fully at ease at all times. Highly recommended.",5,2014,05,02
113,Very good hotel in the heart of South Kensington,"Impeccable position and located in a beautiful street full of white building and black doors... very Londond.
Is at 3 minutes walk from South Kensington Tube and 1 minute from old Brompton road with its restaurants, pubs, bars and stores..
The hotel is modern and elegant. 
Rooms are really small but perfect for a short stay... bed is comfortable, bathroom is modern and new... just the closet is really small...
overall rooms are nice but just with limited space. To me is perfect cause I don't need a lot of space but could be an issue if travelling with huge bags.
On the lobby floor there is also a gym, a bar,  restaurants and a pleasant living room area...
Breakfast was not included in my rate but it's not a problem. round the corner in Bromtpon road there are several cafes and places for breakfast.
Overall a good hotel, elegant and nice, perfectly located with all the necessary.",4,2014,04,30

113,Fantastic Experience,"I cannot tell you the last time I was treated so well at a hotel.  I  travel quite a bit and The Kensington Hotel was one of the best. We were greeted as soon as our taxi door opened and check in was fast. We had some special requests that were taken care of with a smile. We went to the sitting area and the hostess noticed we were tired from our 9 hour flight and brought out tea and snacks, the warm tea was just what we needed! The room was beautiful and spacious, the bathroom was much bigger than we are used to and had heated floors, a nice treat in the morning.  The entire staff was friendly, knowledgable and went out of their way to make our stay fantastic. We even had hot tea in the cutest thermos in our room when we returned one evening.  If you are looking for a great place to stay with amazing service and close to the tube, this is the hotel for you.

113,Sarah&Nick,After looking at the reviews on trip advisor we decided to book a night at the Kensington for the weekend of the London Marathon. We are so glad that we did. As soon as we arrived we were greeted by a really friendly lady on reception. She then told us that we had an upgrade on our room. Our room (115) was absolutely breathtaking. Our stay was wonderful and we hope to return very soon - we both decided that it's a special place to go.,5,2014,04,28
113,Great location!,"Great location and friendly staff. I booked a deluxe room and it valued the extra cost.Minor issues: the concierge was not aware of the conditions to use the Oyster card and I had to return after check out to pay for the latest breakfast.
      ",5,2014,04,28
113,"The Hotel in a Fab,fast lane","I flew into London for a combined business/pleasure visit. I chose the Kensington hotel largely for the location and the neighbourhood reminds me of what traditional English mixed with fun environment was like 20 years: lots of funky bars/restaurants dispersed throughout a very diverse neighbourhood. Secondly, the close proximity to the blue line I was traveling via south Kensington and the Kensington hotel is a short walk to the blue line station. 

The neighbourhood is terrific, and the hotel fits in beautifully-a nicely redone vintage hotel with high ceilings, nice woodwork-they do not make windows like that anymore-while being very tastefully decorated throughout, with lots of natural light. The room itself is very comfortable. 
This place is perfect for younger couples in their 20's & 30's, or anyone that wants to experience living in a real, authentic, Chelsea neighbourhood. It‚Äôs not a  place to be lagging behind because there is a lot of excitement all round from Lamborghini show room, Harrods, 3 key museums, Sloane street boutique shops, Hyde park and  a wonderful experience in urban living.

Very highly recommended!!",5,2014,04,28
113,Excellent Hotel,"We've stayed there in the Easter Period 2014. Excellent Hotel, great breakfast but our room was very small. We hardly had space for the second luggage. The service was ok.

113,Our 'go to' hotel in london,"Our third time staying at The Kensington and as good as ever. Staff, location, comfort and overall quality puts this above all of the others for us.

113,Little Ireland in London,"For the hotel itself, it is really new and clean. The design is modern, decoration are simple and nice, We did not expect big hotel room in London but this hotel is just ample and everything we needed was there. Toilet amenities (shampoo, conditioner, body shampoo), toothpaste, hair dryer, clean towels are provided. Coffee maker, wide screen plasma TV is provided too. Building is very traditional English townhouse but there is lift in the building.
Distance wise around 7-10 minutes from south Kensington Station. Kensington/Chelsea itself got nice food to hunt around. One of the place u won't miss to hang around in London city. This residential area is quiet and it is very safe to walk around even in the mid night.
Service wise, the staff are all experience and kind host, concierge, waiting staff, all were willing to provide a comfort experience for their guests, and we love the place mostly because of the perfect Irish charm in a big city..... If given a chance, I will stay here again and again",5,2014,04,27
113,Afternoon Tea,We had afternoon tea at the hotel and the waiter George made us feel vey welcome. He was extremely friendly and polite with a great service.

A big thank you to George for his is good humour being attentive.  And also Roberta for her warm smile and being helpful. 
Overall very relaxing and satisfying.

113,Great Birthday treat,"I am a little late writing this review as I visited in November however I feel I should let everyone know this is a great hotel! I was lucky to get a really good deal in terms of price as London hotels are not cheap. However the manager of the hotel which I contacted made our stay unforgettable. We were given an upgrade as I was celebrating my 40th birthday and the staff was wonderful from the minute we stepped into the hotel. The front desk staff welcomed me and wished me a happy birthday (which was on the day we arrived). They had a wonderful birthday gift in the room for me with champagne, fruit and sweets which was a real treat. 
The room was wonderful, not huge but really comfortable and nicely decorated making it really cosy and warm. They had a Nespresso machine in the room and they left us water, tea and cookies every night at turndown. 
The bathrobes and slippers and the free wifi were all great add ons and even the floor in the bathroom seemed heated (not sure if it was but it felt like it). Bathroom size was great, the only thing I would say is that I felt they did not have enough drawers in the room to keep your clothes in and the room needs reading lights/lamps near the bed.
We did not have breakfast included in our rate but it was not a problem for us as there are several wonderful caf√©s and places to get yummy pastries nearby. We did not use the restaurant or the fitness room.
We loved the cozy sitting rooms/lounges next to the lobby beautifully decorated and very comfortable.
We loved the location of this hotel. It is in a quiet residential area which felt really safe and it is really close to the many great restaurants so you can just walk out and have dinner nearby. It is an easy stroll to the subway and to the Natural History museum and the Victoria & Albert museum.
All in all it was a great stay and the staff we dealt with were all very efficient and friendly, they even offered us bottles of water at check out for our trip back home! 
We hope we can stay there again when we return to London.",5,2014,04,25

I am still recommending the hotel, because service, reception and staff are very good.",4,2014,04,24

113,"Very good hotel, but I got a room with no view :///","Very good hotel, with price - quality adequate. Good location, with great interiors - modern English style plus some minimalist accents. Nice stuff. Very warm lobby. 
Just... I got a room with a window, which was not a real window... !!! As it had a view on the yard, they put a no translucent sticker on it, so the light was passing thru and that is all. I really HATE this. I can imagine that this is because I bought a ticket in the promotion with Eurostar, but still I was disappointed and felt a bit like in the hospital. 
Room was small (it is London sir :), but well decorated, with all aminities, with nice, elegant bathroom (only shower as far as I remember), comfortable bed. 
I think if I would have a room with a view, I would love that place. But the truth is I was disappointed.",4,2014,04,24
113,Lovely,"Great quality lodging, exceptional staff, great location. Very convenient to the tube with shops and restaurants around. Great for leisurely strolls after dinner, felt like a very safe neighborhood without the hustle of the big city.",5,2014,04,23
113,Excellent afternoon tea!,"We came here for afternoon tea after finding a 2 for 1 offer (only ¬£25 per couple!). The hotel itself is beautiful and well-located in the heart of Kensington. The afternoon tea was delicious and the quality of the food was excellent - the sponge of the cakes, for example, felt like clouds! The food was also well presented and a lot of care had clearly gone into preparing it. We had the peppermint tea as well, which was lovely. The service was great and the staff were all very friendly - George in particular made our experience all the more enjoyable. We would definitely come back and common others to go to The Kensington Hotel for afternoon tea!",5,2014,04,23
113,"Superb Townhouse, superb address","Stayed many times at this wonderful Kensington Townhouse Hotel, never a problem, all staff could not be more professional, one of the finest locations in London.
The Aubrey Restaurant within the Hotel is superb.

113,Fantastic service,"We couldn't find a better place to stay in London than the Kensington hotel ,the description is correct: spacey (modern, warm and cosy (it really felt like coming home every day). The hotel has a nice view and the public transport is nearby. A Piccadilly line brings you in a few minutes in the city center or in soho! We had nice Champagne inside the Aubrey cocktail bar and we tasted and appreciated it! For Myself I appreciated the fresh ingredients more than the beer.
Thank you Kensington hotel staff you made our stay in London unforgettable!",5,2014,04,22
113,Afternoon tea,"My sister and I visited Kensington Hotel to have an afternoon tea. We really enjoyed it, there was plenty of food (mostly delicious), good tea and very nice staff, we were being looked after by George who was very attentive, smiling and polite.

113,"Loved The Kensington from Richmond, Va","Our first time ever to London and it could not have been better thanks to the wonderful staff at this hotel. The room was not that small (they upgraded us to a Superior bec. we had to wait longer than we were supposed to for our room); our room on the 4th floor was very private and quiet. The house keeping service was excellent since we in the States are not use to this service beyond 3 in the afternoon. The location was excellent for the South Kensington tube station and the restaurants within a walking distance were many and of several ethnicities. Also found the wifi connection good and the fact that we did not really need our electrical convertors was a nice bonus. I have already recommended this hotel to  a US friend who will be travelling to London her first time next May. We will be back to this hotel in a heartbeat hopefully in 2 years!

L & L",5,2014,04,22
113,Meets All my expectations,"Fabulous Hotel, can not fault it in any way. Made to feel right at home. Beautiful rooms, fabulous breakfast, kind staff, met all of our expectations. Location Excellent for touring around London. Close to all sites & tube stations. Will be definately returning.",5,2014,04,22
113,"Wonderful service, well appointed room","This was my first time to London so please note I have nothing to compare this to. But, the service was impeccable from the bellman to check-in to housekeeping to concierge to restaurant/bar staff thru check-out. The hotel itself is beautiful and very well done. My room was quite small but not at all uncomfortable. The bed was heaven. Free water bottles in room and upon check-out, free wifi, lovely turn down service. Lots of little touches that made it even better. Will return!",4,2014,04,22
113,The best hotel in it's own style,"This is a really FANTASTIC hotel, they welcomed us so warmly and open-heartedly; even before getting to the room we got good recommendations about seeing around in the neighbourhood. We're ever more grateful to the staff for that and Furthermore, as it was my birthday on the first of the couple of days we stayed in this luxury hotel, I couldn't have expected a better bday treat than we had around the drawing room table at The kensington hotels cosy fire place...together with some sparkling wine :). It was just great! The next morning we enjoyed morning tea/coffee in the aubrey restaurant at the ground floor with the background music warming up the bit crispy air. Still, it was not all - besides tea and coffee, The hotel offered us some nice bites for breakfast and we really felt like home. Thousand thanks to Saoirse & George for their exemplary hosting  and Also to Paul . Highly recommend.",5,2014,04,21
113,Fantastic hotel and location,London maybe a hectic city. Having the possibility of some relaxation after a busy day in a nice and quiet area may be extremely important for the traveller. The Kensington Hotel is just that: A perfect opportunity for relaxation. Helpful personnel in a very welcoming place. We were a family of three and it is the best hotel experience we have ever had in London. Strongly recommended.,5,2014,04,21
113,afternoon tea,I had  a special birthday celebratory afternoon tea with my three Sisters on Thursday 17th April. The customer service was excellent.  A special thank you to George and  his colleague.  They made me feel very special and were very attentive.  Had a great time and would definitely visit again.,4,2014,04,20
113,Top notch 5 star hotel,"This was my first experience staying in a five star hotel in England,  I think it was a success. The reception and guest relations responded very quickly to my emails and was very flexible with our check in/out times. I simply said our arrival time and how soon we could be at the hotel and it was Ok When we arrived, Ronnie was there to let us on and gave us a quick rundown on the place and told us that if we had any concerns with the room whom we should contact Fortunately, we never had any concerns , but we did enjoy an excellent meal at the Aubrey's which is at the ground floor and the Manager Segolene was really friendly among other staff at the restaurant .The hotel was neat and with everything we needed. We didn't eat a lot outside but we frequently used the Nespresso machine We never had a problem with Internet infact it was the fastest internet to ever use inside a hotel for Free, all the bedding and towels had been freshly laundered. The tube station is close (about 2 min) and easy to find. We used it to get wherever we wanted to go. The bed in the room was comfortable. Despite being on a busy brompton street, we felt that inside the hotel was actually quieter than we would have expected from its proximity to the road. All in all we had a pleasant trip and the hotel suited our needs very well.",5,2014,04,20
113,Perfect location for the Royal Albert Hall,"We chose The Kensington Hotel because of it's proximity to The Royal Albert Hall where we were seeing James Blunt.  We also fancied a look in the local museums and The V & A and Natural History museums are on the doorstep.

We loved the hotel.  Our room was on the first floor and very snug but well equipped with an extremely comfy bed and plenty of toiletries.

We stayed for 2 nights and had dinner at the hotel on the first night.  It was pretty quiet but we were tired and couldn't be bothered to go in search of a restaurant.  The food was average.  Boyfriend had a steak with spinach and mash.  The mash was cold and had to go back.  I had a lamb dish which was ok.

We would have given the hotel top marks but boyfriend is an apple cider drinker.  They ran out at lunchtime on day one and didn't replenish stocks.  At the end of each evening when we wanted to relax at the hotel with a night cap before bed, we had no choice but to go elsewhere.  This was not really good enough and there's no excuse for poor stock control especially at the beginning of a busy bank holiday weekend.",4,2014,04,20
113,Excellent,"The perfect hotel to stay at while in London! Very comfortable and a quiet area, just on the outskirts of the tourist places. Access to restaurants and transportation to go around the city. Beautiful hotel and more importantly, great service.

We've had George help us at the lobby twice now and he's extremely helpful, fun, and very wonderful to talk to. If he wasn't working, I'd have him sit down with us. Just about the kind of service we love to have. Thank you George.",5,2014,04,19
113,Very pleasant stay,"Room was very comfortable, staff were very friendly and attentive, location ideal as only 5mins walk to The King's Road.  They're also very generous with the toiletries!  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,04,19
113,Afternoon Tea,"We booked The Kensington for Afternoon tea to celebrate our sister's 60th birthday. First impression was how warm and friendly the staff was. The ambience was calm and elegant.
The waiting staff were excellent and made my sister feel special by presenting her with a special chocolate cup cake on a plate with her name and greetings written in chocolate...nice touch.
The afternoon tea was just the right amount as we were full by the end. A very chilled afternoon and there was no pressure leave when we had finished.
Special thanks to George who was very attentive and Roberta for her patience. :-))",4,2014,04,18
113,Excellent Hotel,Stayed here for a business trip.  I had to conduct many 1:1 meetings in the lounge and was very satisfied with the venue.  The location is also excellent with many great restaurants.  The staff were spectacular.,5,2014,04,18
113,The best birthday!!!!,"It was my 22nd birthday yesterday and my partner surprised me to afternoon tea at The Kensington Hotel, was beautiful when we walked in as well as being greeted by our lovely waiter George who honestly gave me the best service I ever had! So friendly! The food was great and really well presented! Would definitely come again and recommend!!",5,2014,04,17
113,Afternoon Tea,"I took my daughter to afternoon tea at the Kensington Hotel for her 21st birthday, before going on to the theatre. We were treated like royalty from the moment of arrival. We were spoilt by the charming waiter, George, who made the whole experience special for my daughter, including having a 'Happy Birthday' message written in chocolate on her plate. The sandwiches, cakes and pastries were delicious, and the tea was topped up on request. A thoroughly wonderful experience. Will definitely be going again!",5,2014,04,17
113,BREAKFAST WITH A SMILE,"As usual the Kensington never disappoints . An added extra to the morning breakfast is the lovely smile and warm  welcome from George , who just makes the day that little bit nicer. It is wonderful to return to an hotel that is a home from home. Every need is cared for , just ask and it arrives to the room promptly and with a smile .  The decor is exquisite. Rooms are perfect with an endless supply of refreshments and little welcome  touches. The staff go far beyond the norm to make the stay special.... Thank you Andrea for remembering my VIP voucher to Bicester village... I'm amazed that you did that..... And that is why we return !",5,2014,04,16
113,Gem of a hotel,"Small inviting hotel in a great location: 4 minutes walk from South Kensington tube station bordering a street full of restaurants and small shops, well-off area, around the corner form the natural history and Albert and Victoria museums.   Very helpful staff, very nice common rooms.  Too often common rooms in hotels they are a way station between destinations, here they are a destination in their own right, comfortable chairs, fire in fireplace, nice setting for afternoon tea.  Rooms are nice with well placed work desk (great touch--plug outlets in American and European modes as well as British), roomy closet, not many drawers but enough shelf space, bathrooms updated and modern and nice shower hardware, comfortable bed, quiet, turndown service with chocolates on pillows.  Breakfast included, unsure of price, but nice buffet with lots of fruit, cold cereals, breads ,croissants and the like, hot choices on the non-buffet menu (one oddity, no matter if you ordered sunny side up eggs , or over easy, all turned out the same), good service.  Good recommendations for local restaurants from concierge.  Definitely hope to stay here again.",5,2014,04,15
113,The staff are friendly and the hotel is wonderful,"It was my first time staying in a hotel of this kind, so I don't have much to compare this to, everything was very straight forward there were no surprises and I was very happy with my stay. Staff was extremely welcoming and helpful. They made sure I had everything I needed, showed me around when I first got in. The restaurant staff and managers were very friendly as well, and they were all easy to chat with. They even did a good job of letting me know about the museums nearby which was a great experience. Rooms and bathrooms are the most ideal part of any hotel and they were lovely, a clean set of towels and of course a nespresso machine
To the staff: Saoirse, George, Olga, Segolene, Ross and Paul among others Thanks for the awesome stay you were super welcoming and I would stay here again.",5,2014,04,14
113,excellent stay,"We had a great time at this traditional hotel, There was a large room for me and my wife. The hotel was modern and comfortable with a streched and comfortable lobby We loved the location - South kensington Right near lots of great restaurants, pubs and shops as well as the famous Kings road. We used the 14 bus which stops right near the hotel to get into town. We also used the Barclay's bike hire system. Again, right near the hotel, Did I mention that we loved the location! all staff members was super helpful and very accommodating. Next time we are in London we will stay at the same place. 
thanks to everyone :)",5,2014,04,14
113,Extremely comfortable with great service,"This was a gorgeous hotel, and in a perfect location, so close to everything. Loved the little shops close by.
The Staff : I was check in promptly & Rubina  met me with a huge smile and was a lovely receptionist. She was more than happy to help me with all the inquiries,Also inside Aubrey restaurant there was Segolene who was very knowledgeable and provided great information about dining.
The hotel:  itself is bright and traditional Irish/British themes ...Beautifully decorated, and very comfortable.
The rooms : Crisp white linens,waterfall showers  and a big cosy bed await you for the end of your day.

Lots of details in the bathroom, nice products, welcome gift...
Thanks to all the team for making our stay perfect

      ",5,2014,04,14
113,Disappointing for that kind of hotel,"We stayed there with the family (3 people)  for 3 nights.
Hotel is globally good and very comfortable. 
However, when we arrived, I booked a room for 2 adults and one additional kid. It was mentioned in the reservation. When I arrived, I got charged for an extra bed at ¬£ 35 per night. I mentioned I wasn't happy about it and I did not get any gesture.

They installed the extra bed properly but forgot each day of our stay the towels for the kid. I had to call each day. How bad is this !

Small details not great... No water in the coffee machine, they forgot once the moisturiser, they set up every day the AC to ""freezing"".

For that class of hotel, I would call it average. There are certainly better options in London.",3,2014,04,13
113,Stay 12th April 2014,Excellent excellent hotel. Staff all extremely helpful and friendly . Ate in the Aubrey Resturant Saturday night fabulous food and service. Will be back hopefully soon. Great location for exploring London.  Ideal parking as well. Room excellent clean bed very comfortable.,5,2014,04,13
113,welcoming stay at Kensington Hotel,"we just returned from a week long trip to London and our stay at Kensington Hotel was great. We booked our hotel through a travel website and the room that we (my husband and I) were given was very small initially. When we told the Hotel  front desk about the size of the room they asked us to give them a day to arrange for another room. Our second room was not only bigger (no price difference) but was also on the top floor with a view of the roofs and the skyline. The staff at the hotel was very friendly, helpful and welcoming and we will definitely return to Kensington hotel next time that we are in London.",5,2014,04,13
113,A Wonderful stay this year,"This was a most delightful hotel, Everything was well arrayed and in order and exactly as promised. We were welcomed very warmly and felt like locals south kensington!  and the whole atmosphere is comfortable and laid back. You should be in a good exploration mood to be able to enjoy all the fascinating museums, shopping spree and restaurants, this was a big advantage. Thank you so much and we certainly will come again.",5,2014,04,13
113,Fabulous Afternoon Tea courtesy of Gorgeous George,"I booked online for an afternoon tea with my two daughters and it was fantastic, The golden stands were perfectly stacked with a variety of sandwiches, warm raising scones and Victoria sponge cake that were absolutely delicious, much credit goes to the new chef Pieter for all his effort and also to our handsome, very attentive and charming server named George who looked after us from the moment we arrived made us feel very welcome and entertained, this was probably the best afternoon tea or dining experience that I have ever had, the whole experience was just amazing, the food was full of flavour and the service was flawless Overall what a Great afternoon we and must comeback back soon. ‚ÄúTHANK YOU‚Äù",5,2014,04,13

 It was my 6th time visiting.
 I had always lovely tea time at Kensington hotel so I come back often and love to take my friends who loves good tea and scorns. We had seat on 12pm then left 3pm. 
Afternoon tea food was changed since my last visit. It was really good. About tea which I think they need tea menu booklet.

The bed was at a very interesting spot, but we thought of it as very funny and a really good way to save space - We always felt good to come back ""home"". The tube station was just about a short walk down the road; waitrose and tesco for groceries shopping as well. Paul told us all we needed to know and the check out wasn't a problem as well. 
We already said that when we go back to London next time, we'll be staying at the kensington hotel again for sure!",5,2014,04,07

113,The coolest place in Town,"If you are visiting London either on business or pleasure The Kensington Hotel Queens Gate South Kensington is the best place to stay for the highest standards and quality all round.
In my view this 5 star hotel is superior to any of the hotels in Park Lane and beats them on price too. 
You will feel welcome as soon as you arrive by excellent & courteous staff.
The Location is spot on for the Royal Parks, Buckingham Palace, Royal Albert Hall, Harrods and the Museums which are all nearby
South Kensington Underground (Tube) station is just 5 minutes around the corner. 
South Kensington is vibrant, fashionable and with a host of good restaurants and eateries.
For exceptional service and best value I would recommend this 5 Star hotel to enhance your trip to London for business or pleasure, you will not be disappointed.
",5,2014,04,07
113,truly Amazing hotel,"This is excellent place to stay in London We spend few nights there. The hotel is very nice, quite big with nice business area and lounge. Rubina is very helpful also the concierge had everything prepared for us ‚Äì maps, recommended places in neighborhood to eat or to buy some souvenirs. 
The hotel is very well connected with London‚Äôs (subway just over the corner. This is also excellent opportunity to see the everyday life on a lush precinct what was also a part of our trip.",5,2014,04,06
113,short sweet stay,"Kensington hotel is an incredibly wonderful hotel with the staff that goes out of their way to make sure you are happy, comfortable, and having a good time in London. Concierge Martin is a great company and a wealth of knowledge on things to see and do. I felt really at home in this hotel for my duration. The room is super comfortable and warm, also the hotel is spacious and well equipped - it was fantastic to have full use of the gym and all the machines! This hotel is in a fantastic location only minutes walk from south Kensington. I highly recommend staying at Kensington hotel as I had a fantastic stay",5,2014,04,05
113,A lovely hotel in a great neighborhood.,"Of course London is very expensive and this is not a cheap hotel, but the service was top notch. They have free wifi that works everywhere, printers and Mac computers for you to print out tickets etc..Thankfully the living room was a good place to hang out because the rooms are quite small and even though the room had a desk, there wasn't room for a chair.
The bath and bathroom was very nice and the staff looked after us very well. Overall a very positive experience. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel but at a lovely `real' Italian place around the corner called La Brioche, fresh orange juice, capuccino and a full breakfast for less than 10 pounds.",5,2014,04,02
113,"Fantastic hotel, service and location","I have stayed in some amazing hotels around the world and never felt compelled to write a review, but just had to for The Kensington Hotel where I stayed briefly last month. 

I lived in Chelsea/Kensington before moving out to Singapore a couple of months ago so was very familiar with the hotel and its location, which really is as good as it gets. For those that are familiar with London and know the city well: it's close to the likes of Fulham Road, Kings Road and Sloane Square which is where I spend most of my time. And for tourists: It's close to all of the museums, the park, Knightsbridge, etc. As such, the location really caters to everyone's needs.

What really struck me about the hotel, and motivated me to write this review, is the service. I was arriving into London at 6:00am so had requested an early check-in, more in hope than anything else given the very early hour. However, upon my arrival, I was informed by the lovely team at reception that this had been taken care of and I could check into my room immediately. After a 16 hour flight, there couldn't have been any better news, and they - without any prodding - gave me a quiet room towards the back so I could rest off the jetlag. The room itself was lovely as well with great little touches to make it special. 

I couldn't recommend this place, and the people that work there, highly enough.",5,2014,04,01
113,Very professional staff,"well situated hotel but we had to move rooms due to building noise (suppose it had to be expected in the 'low' season). The second room was two rooms but with no view at all - apart from air conditioners. The staff were excellent, the bar very nice and lounge areas very popular and comfortable. Would return",4,2014,03,31
113,Wonderful stay,"I had a wonderful stay at this hotel for a business trip. The location is great, the service is pleasant, and the rooms are nice. I had breakfast at the hotel and it was good. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay and I would choose this hotel again.",5,2014,03,31
113,"Perfect location, outstanding service","I stayed for seven days at the Kensington Hotel and could not have been more impressed. The location is perfect - quaint Kensington but a four minute walk to the Tube so it was really easy to get around and use as a home base. The rooms and the open spaces are spectacular it's like being in a French salon, it's gorgeous.

I actually had more fun in the neighborhood than anywhere else. It's right next to Royal Albert Hall, Victoria & Albert Museum and Kensington Palace. There were also a ton of great restaurants, coffee shops, pharmacies and even a farmers market two minutes away.

Last, but certainly not least was the service. From check in to the concierge and the bartender everyone was polite and more than willing to help. The concierge even helped me book my Eurostar ticket to Paris and told me about some expected work to be done on the Tube so I could avoid any delays while traveling. 

I can't wait to come back to London but you can be sure I will be staying at the Kensington Hotel.",5,2014,03,30
113,Fantastic stay,Spent a Saturday night here end of March. From the moment we got there till when we left nothing was too much trouble. Really a great hotel in a great location. This was for an anniversary. Quite a few nice extras which really made sure that my girlfriend and I had a great time. Very comfy beds which made it hard to get out in the morning.. Thanks ,5,2014,03,30
113,An excellent hotel,"Last time we stayed here we were not happy with our ""superior"" rooms and this time they kindly upgraded us to their ""junior suites"" which, in our opinion, raises the hotel to 100%. Charming and efficient reception staff, excellent porters and concierge and wonderfully attentive and professional  bar and restaurant staff. I would particularly mention ""Baby"" George who, the first time we entered the bar rushed up to us with two cushions; he had remembered from our last visit six months earlier that my elderly friend had a bad back. That is what I call service.

Regarding the comfort and facilities of the hotel, I can only repeat what I said in my last review It has been tastefully and luxuriously upgraded and, combined with the superb staff, leaves very little to be desired.

One small point which perhaps holds it back from the very highest echelon of London hotels ‚Äì I believe they should require a little more decorum and formality from some of their guests. On one evening there was a man in shorts and sandals with a baseball cap worn back to front lounging in the bar. This would not have been permitted in more formal and traditional establishments and perhaps the porters should discreetly mention to guests from overseas that in England it is considered very bad manners for a man not to remove his head-dress indoors. On another evening a drunken hen party effectively made the bar untenable for residents with their shouting and periodic outbreaks into song. Again, behaviour which should not be permitted in a 5-star hotel.

This point aside, I have nothing but praise for this excellent hotel.",5,2014,03,29
113,Wonderful hotel with a prime location,"We had a wonderful three nights in this hotel. It is located in a very classy area few minutes from harrods yet in a quite area. There are many restaurants and caf√©s located two minutes walk. The rooms were very clean and the toilets are very well decorated. The staff in this hotel were extremely friendly and helpful especially the room service and house keeping staff but I encountered few problems with the restaurant service during the breakfast and the lobby restaurant service, they were slow and not as efficient
 as the other staff in the hotel. I do recommend this hotel strongly and I would definitely consider staying again here. ",5,2014,03,29
113,Darn Near Perfection: Kensington Hotel in South Kensington Locale,"We just spent the last four nights in a great hotel, The Kensington (Doyle Group), located a five-minute walk from the South Kensington station, a direct ride from Heathrow, and also the site of two other tube lines. The staff is wonderful and attentive. The room we had (323) had two queens (we had our daughter along with us in the room) and was larger than any european hotel room we've ever had. The two elevators were also generous by European standards. The sitting rooms, bar and dining rooms were meticulously decorated and grand. We enjoyed wine by the fire prior to dinner our last two nights, and wondered why we hadn't started that practice earlier... The views from our room weren't great, but the room had windows on three sides, and had a lot of light. Everyone including the maids, concierge, wait-staff and management were kind and engaged. We have nothing negative to report, other than perhaps a 4 out of 5 on the food.",5,2014,03,27
113,Supernice Hotel with great location.,"We stayed in a total of 4 days at the Kensington Hotel, when we first came the staff were very helpful and we felt very welcomed. Our room was a standard room, it was not big but enough, very clean and nice interior. It had a little coffee machine from Nespresso and you could also make tea if you wanted. We asked to have a dress and a shirt ironed because we were attending a wedding, the staff were again very helpful and we got them about 40 mins later than what I told them at the first place (had to ask to get the clothes) was a bit disappointing but the ironing was made perfectly. I would have given this hotel 5+ if it wasnt for the terrible staff in the Breakfast area, I mean they were very kind and nice, but it seemed like they had no overlook what was going on, the breakfast itself was GREAT! But again the staff brought wrong coffe, the food you ordered was a bit cold (sometimes) and they didnt know what a coffe americano was (I mean I expect that from a high class hotel like this). Except from that our stay was perfekt and i recomend everyone to stay here. The street just outside had a bunch of great restaurants and it is close to the tube and walking distance to a  lot of things s well.",4,2014,03,26
113,"Nice hotel, good location","The Kensington ist an nice hotel. I like the wonderful lobby and rooms in the ground. The staff its always friendly. Our room and bathroom was a little bit to small and the decoration has to be renovated, but otherwise it's tasty and has am warm atmosphere. I'll come back soon!",4,2014,03,24
113,Smiling service never intrusive for our tea party,"What a delightful venue.  And what a charming welcome.   A friend and I had chosen The Kensington Hotel as a much-need change of meeting place for the annual gathering of some 15 old school friends and the hotel staff had been most friendly and efficient in setting it up.  A section of the lounge had been specially reserved for us.  Low tables, set amongst comfy armchairs and sofas, were beautifully set with linen napkins and little bowls of freescias.  Tasty sandwiches and gorgeous patisseries (including delectable chocolate temptations) were served with smiling attention that was never intrusive.   Everyone voted enthusiastically to come here again next year.  After the others had gone, the  two of us went to the bar for a glass of champagne to celebrate the real success of our suggestion for this change of venue.",5,2014,03,24
113,Simply exquisite,"I had an afternoon off so i decided to collect a bunch of pals to this Hotel, for an afternoon tea  The sun was shining and we were sat by the window on a very comfortable arm chair with red velvetty  covers ,we sandwiches, scones and clotted cream, all served with on a golden plated stand with 2 cases on each and was well arrayed. I‚Äôd highly recommend to go again as the spring flowers blossom also before the brights days go out",5,2014,03,23
113,"Tea, Cakes and Sweets","I Went to this hotel one week ago and I think it is the best afternoon tea I have had in London. The servers were professionally attentive while anticipating our  needs The sandwiches were delicious with variety of flavours,and I appreciated the fact that we could chose the bread as I‚Äôm not really keen on white bread,  the raising scones,cakes,pastries very pretty too.
Overall I was impressed and with the standards of service mostly and the hotel offers more value for money.",5,2014,03,22
113,If I could have opened both wardrobe doors it would have been a 5*,"I have been privileged to stay at quite a few 5 star hotels thanks to my job, however too often they are high in standards of decor, food and prices but average in warm welcoming service. This hotel should have a very special award for its staff. Whether at reception, the concierge desk, the bar, restaurant or housekeeping all of the staff seem to genuinely enjoy talking with and serving their guests. 
My only gripe was the aforementioned wardrobe. I was astonished that in a hotel of this standard that due to the room size and the bed that I could only open one of the doors on my wardrobe.....to be frank it was a bit of a pain. I didn't complain as I literally only slept in my room as I had a packed social calendar but if I return I will be sure to ask for a room where I can open both doors of my wardrobe!",4,2014,03,22
113,Fantastic hotel,Stayed here with my mum after booking it on secaret escapes and we loved it. The hotel is so classy and perfectly located 5 minutes from the tube in zone1. We had a great weekend and having such a lovely hotel as a base really added something special. We were a little disapointed with the room as we had paid for an upgrade - dread to think what it would have like without one. The bed was comfy and the room was nicely decorated. Nothing too fancy about it. The staff at the hotel were amazing and offered us guidence and a free bottle of water everytime we left the hotel. We were then greated by name asnd asked how our day had been (they remebered what we had planned to do). If the hotel was on offer again we would definately go back.,5,2014,03,20
113,A London hotel to fall in love with,"My husband and I, and our little 2 1/2 year old son, stayed here for the weekend in January and had a fabulous time. This hotel is a shooting star - a very special place to stay right in the heart of beautiful Kensington. From the moment we arrived, to the time we left, we felt truly at home - with added comfort and good sense of style and decor. The room was spotless - but what makes this place stand out from the crowd of other luxury hotels is the staff. They were sincere, friendly and not least, very efficient - able to resolve any issue - big or small in no time and alway with a smile. The concierges have to be some of the best in London and this meant that our precious time was perfectly spent. When did you last stay at a hotel where you felt that your custom was highly appreciated and people were working hard to make you feel in heaven? We will come back to this little gem again and again.",5,2014,03,18
113,High tea in a private mansion,"On my mums birthday we went to have tea at the kensington hotel/ private mansion because of the looks inside, it was a fantastic experience in one of the few hotels which provide this level of value. Saorise is amazing and a great server, we are no.1 fan of this fantastic hotel.",5,2014,03,18
113,very posh place,"my parents came over to visit me and we had a blast together at this fantastic irish hotel which is part of the doyle collection group of hotels Staff are the greatest asset in this hotel with especially saoirse,George and another italian girl in the lounge dining area. we all had a great time had a great time and well worth the money.",5,2014,03,15
113,Warm welcome and,This warm and comfortable hotel has everything you would need for your stay from morning newspapers to free wireless internet. We stayed here on our last London visit but this hotel was a home away from home for us. It‚Äôs centrally located and reasonably Quiet Street. Walking distance from many attractions and also subway stations are only five minutes away. Thanks to all your staff for being great and also for storing our luggage as our flight home was late in the day.,5,2014,03,15
113,a stay with a difference,"What a brilliant hotel to come home to - quiet and peaceful. The hotel is incredible and the beds are lusciously comfortable after roaming the city.Concierge have a brilliant list of cafes, restaurants, and bars in the neighbourhood ‚Äì even with a map to each. at the western end of the street is for all your food needs  and We would stay here again without a moment‚Äôs hesitation.",5,2014,03,14
113,Great service and staff,"I loved staying at this hotel The room was great, spacious with lots of light. The hotel is adorable and in the cutest neighborhood in south kensington. If you're exploring the london you really can‚Äôt beat this location- its in the center of everything!
Saorise was awesome!. This is my first time in this hotel and so I was skeptical going in but I got so lucky having Saoirse as a hostess. She was so welcoming and easy to talk to. I felt so much at home and comfortable. I had such a positive experience. I would stay here again in a second.re",5,2014,03,14

VEry good Atmosphere... felling like at home!",4,2014,03,14
113,Couldn't be happier than this,"MEMORY OF A LIFE TIME
My friend and I stayed at this hotel for a few nights. The hotel was great, especially the fact that there were plenty of sights to see. The hotel was clean and tidy and when we arrived there were plenty of towels and blankets for all of us. The breakfast in the morning is at the ground floor and has everything you need to keep you energetic and healthy. The location is great as it is a very short walk (5min or less) to south Kensington station which is a major tube stop, and It is also a leisurely walk down to the museum, and there are a lot of restaurants down on Brompton road, I Would highly recommend the hotel.
",5,2014,03,14
113,Excellent hotel with great staff,"

Excellent location in London, The nearby restaurants were a very good option to lunch and dinner. The hotel looked recently renovated and the same as the pictures. It was clean and with all the necessary amenities to a comfortable stay. The breakfast was plentiful and varied.
Valentina & George & Izabella are all great host‚Äôs, providing tips and recommendations around London
I recommend the Kensington hotel.",5,2014,03,14
113,Most memorable stay,"Located in South Kensington, is a very posh part of London. The Hotel is very interesting and quite long
The lounge is more like that of a Private club and is decorated accordingly.reception is an area that is discreetly placed in a red velvet background. Staff are very professional and yet warm in welcome. Rubina , one of the receptionist, is fabulous and I cannot recommend her enough
The aubrey Bar is very traditional,Walls are decorated with portraits on mahogany wood with a fantastic blend, The bar is a delight and I highly recommend a negroni or  cucumber tini,  The Dining area is fairly large and the Breakfast served is plentiful with variety of foods.
If you are enthusiastic about open Space then a short stroll to the South or West and you reach firstly hyde Park plus if you continue walking down you‚Äôll come down to knightsbridge and harrods, harveys, and sloane street and kings road. Since south kensington is known as the Museum center of london they are just a 2 minute walk and should not be missed And there are various restaurants within walking distance of the Hotel
I would recommend this Hotel without hesitation.

113,Full of luxury,"Kensington hotel was perfect for us, and just as described on the website. The photos all seem to be recently taken and the place is exactly as it appears in the photos. And the location is fantastic: We were able to walk to everything on our spur-of-the-moment agenda, and in spite of the short amount of time we had, the place is so conveniently located that we didn't even need to grab a cab for dining, site-seeing, or entertainment.
Having a well cooked English food for breakfast was a very nice bonus, and we intend to stay there again when we visit the city we highly recommend staying at this hotel.
",5,2014,03,13
113,london home,"my room was quite large and decorated with the best wallpaper theme which was very well done. A large closet next to the bed, with clothes hangers and other amenities, the power shower which had a good pressure, as you go to the lobby there is a two space business space with computers to browse and print documents down. The restaurant service is delivered by professional yet friendly staff and there was not a problem in requesting a newspaper or any inquiries. All in all, we were very satisfied with our stay.",5,2014,03,12
113,A surprisingly nice London hotel,"I honestly didn't know what to expect of this hotel. There are so many hotels that look similar from the outside and so often the experience once inside disappoints.  This was quite different and I will definitely return again.  It's a Mr & Mrs Smith hotel. A warm welcome awaited from the moment of arrival and all my dealings with the employees was excellent. My room (501) was small (especially the bathroom), but very well appointed and comfortable.  Plenty of room for luggage and an iron and ironing board appeared at peak time very quickly indeed. The public rooms are very light and stylishly appointed and my two breakfasts and one evening meal very enjoyable. Overall wonderful service all round.  I enjoyed it very much and it's one of the few London hotels I look forward to returning to.",4,2014,03,11
113,great stay,"This hotel is fantastic and the Aubrey restaurant is a fantastic option for breakfast and lunch. The hotel is beautiful and just as it appears in the photos. Jennifer (front desk manager) was very accommodating when we had to check in. The neighborhood is great and yet the room is very quiet. Perfect location for exploring all the areas of South Kensington, Sloane Street, Knightsbridge, Hyde Park and Green Park. Highly recommend.",5,2014,03,11
113,super splendid stay,"My partner and I had a great stay at this lovely hotel. There are so many reasons why we loved it that I better just list them.

1. The View: Looking out of the window you can see so much of the nice neighbourhoods. The science museum,the natural history museum , photos don't do it justice. It is breathtaking.

2. The neighborhood: The hotel is surrounded by everything you would want,all sorts of caf√©s and diners just a short walk away, and metro and bus stops on either end of the queens gate street. It also has a great shopping center nearby if you are a shopper. Living in this part if town, you really feel like a londoner and get to experience this incredible city from a unique perspective.

3.The hotel: The hotel was very stylish and had many accommodating rooms including a bathroom, and a coffee machine,bathrobes and the slipers  that my partner really appreciated.

4. The staff like Jennifer,Paul and Valentina are a real credit there were so great to work with. We had a lot of questions as a first time traveler to London and the concierge was more than happy to help me with anything I needed.
That is a short list of the many things I loved about this hotel . I would recommend this to anyone. Thanks",5,2014,03,11
113,Thank You,"I live close to this hotel and having toured local venues chose The Kensington to get ready with my family on my civil wedding day. What swung my decision was the stunning communal areas - in my opinion this hotel has the most beautiful lounge(s) (with open fires) in the area - and the staff. The staff could not have been more helpful, with particular thanks to Jennifer, Baptiste and Paul and the door staff.

In summary, South Kensington is very central - a primarily residential area perfect for brunches, dinners and walking distance to Hyde Park as well as the Kings Road. The Kensington Hotel is as you would expect perfectly clean, staff could not be more helpful and the communal areas in particular luxuriously furnished. I would gladly recommend this hotel to friends of ours coming to London for a trip and think compared to some of the Mayfair based hotels it is good value for money for what it is.",5,2014,03,11
113,perfect stay with amazing staff,"We stayed here together in the hotel while on a short trip to London.
The front desk lady allocated a quality room & very quiet and with a comfortable work space, the next morning the tea & coffee was freshly brewed in a silver pot, the breakfasts were excellent with plenty of food on the plate mushroom‚Ä¶ bacon, scrambled eggs and black pudding. On the buffet was well arranged aesthetically with plates of fruits, selection of fresh homemade bread and fresh juices, a truly impeccable service from the hostess Valentina and Isabella who were very professional.
The old Irish/English charm of the hotel was exquisite, located close to south Kensington station was extremely handy, Getting back to the hotel each evening my family and I were quick to freshen up and get down to the Aubrey‚Äôs cocktail bar where you meet Alessandro who is a very friendly and personable manager as he explains the dinner cocktails, the champagne, aperitifs etc. I never actually knew that there so much information about the drinks. The whole stay was a fantastic experience and I‚Äôve soaked a lasting impression from this magnificent place.",5,2014,03,10
113,Lovely Weekend,"A relaxed, luxurious and fabulous hotel.
We arrived Friday night, greeted by lovely and friendly staff.  Greta location many nice restaurants nearby.  Came back to the hotel after dinner for lovely drinks in the lounge.  I would come here again!

113,Another great stay at The Kensington,"Last week I had to host an important event at The Kensington and thanks to all of the staff - in the restaurant, cocktail bar, front-of-house and concierge, everything, although complicated, went like a dream thanks to them. Smiling personal service at The Kensington cannot be faulted. I travel a great deal and this is without doubt my favourite home-from-home in London. The hotel is warm and elegant and inviting. The staff second to none. Thanks to all of you, Barbara Jones",5,2014,03,09
113,pleasant stay,"I have just checked out after a short stay in London and it was lovely the fresh scented room and relaxation was just what was needed, my room was large and well away from the lift plus the view was spectacular, ordered a few bites to be delivered and then joined my friends around the neighborhood pubs. It‚Äôs an amazing homely hotel in London and will certainly be craving to come back",5,2014,03,08
113,Really fabulous home away from home,"This was yet again a fantastic stay the rooms are lovely, the staff are super outstanding in every manner with mostly George, Valentina and Martin and Leonardo.The food is expertly made with delicious taste .It was an absolutely great visit in my home away fom home. ",5,2014,03,08
113,"Great sleep, great food and fantastic service","This was an ideal place to stay for a sightseeing visit. We were out most of the day so were just there to sleep sometimes after a very busy day; luckily my mum and I are both quite easy people. The room is fantastic with nespresso machine, towels and hot shower. In saying all this location was perfect, a little walk to the London metro and it is a really lovely precinct and streets are lined with gorgeous restaurants and Lamborghini shop is next to the station, My mum enjoyed the English food a lot, also the room service staff called George was extremely professional as he explained the meal like a food professor and cared enough to ask if our stay was pleasant. This hotel is the best in London and we can‚Äôt wait to comeback.",5,2014,03,07
113,Delightful and charming,"Stayed here for one night,but still really enjoyed my stay.The location is perfect and extremely convenient.The Kensington Hotel met and exceeded my exspectations,I hope I will get the opportunity to stay here again.",5,2014,03,07
113,The return trip,"We have just returned from another very memorable stay at the Kensington. I first reviewed this hotel a few years ago after staying at Christmas, which was nothing short of wonderful. I can say again this is a must stay location for antone visiting London as the location is excellent with many bars and restaurants near by plus the added benefit of being a stones throw from the Tube. However all that said the one thing that stand out above all the hotel I've stayed in is the incredible service from all the staff you deal with. London, not being the easiest place to find parking is just one reason why you should use the Kensington. The Concierge took care of my vehicle the minute I arrived and kept the meter topped up meaning I saved money on the private car park around the corner. The check-in staff, so efficient and welcoming without being overly false as is the case in so many other hotels. There really seems to be a genuine delight to see you! The room service is also excellent with nothing to much trouble. Although we never used the restaurant this time I can say that previously the service was again exemplary and I'm sure this has been maintained. Finally, the bar staff! What a great bunch of guys. They really have made our time in the kensington memorablel each time we have stayed. I don't recall all of their names  but each one of them delivered such a friendly service and took the time to have some friendly banter which both my partner and I enjoy. I believe Sam was the name of the ""mixologist"" and he was exceptionally welcoming not to mention the fabulous cocktails, so a special thankyou to him. I suppose overall what makes the stay special is the intimate feel of the hotel which is so seriously complimented by the staff. As I've previously said I wouldnt stay anywhere else. Thankyou so much to all at the Kensington!",5,2014,03,07
113,classy and luxury,"We stayed here for a short weekend  the hotel has a private club/ town house from the outside but as you go inside it‚Äôs perfectly comfortable, the luxurious lobby was great for coffee and a morning newspaper , the easiest  connection to all the museums and shops, so my tip is that you explore all the museums before going down to Harrods , and to add cherry on the cake is the great service from the likes of George and his colleagues who were all very helpful, the front desk is available every time there was some issue or doubt!  A very comfortable hotel and our stay was as great as we had expected it would be, in conclusion, ""I would definitely recommend this hotel highly""",5,2014,03,05
113,good location coupled with great service,"The hotel was spotless and comfortable and exceptionally luxurious and they make their guests feel welcome right from the entering the door, The location of this hotel in south Kensington is really convenient (5 minutes from the tube station), and I‚Äôll be recommending this  hotel to anyone wishing to spend some time in the London area. Excellent communication whenever you need assistance y quick ranging from a bucket of ice to directions around. George was gracious, friendly and very good at his job,also most staff are multi lingual with european languages such as French,Spanish and german , Overall, a perfect experience",5,2014,03,05
113,what a spectacular stay at the Kensington hotel,"We stayed at the Kensington & everything went really smooth during our stay (booking, check-in and check-out). We really enjoyed our stay at the very nice London town house located inside the lovely south Kensington. The bed is super comfortable and the bathroom clean with luxurious amenities. We loved the neighborhood and the location's proximity to public transit. Thanks to all your lovely staff and to Alessandro for mixing the best cocktails in the evenings",5,2014,03,05
113,very friendly hotel with Irish style charm,"The accommodations are of a five-star hotel, the location is prime, a short walk to Harrods and Chelsea in west London, and it makes for a delightful stay. Staff were incredibly helpful and accommodating from making the reservation to serving the best meal,drinks and company especially George at the breakfast, This hotel is provides guests with everything they could possibly need, the location is excellent and secure, It was the perfect place anyone to stay, and we will recommend it highly to others. You really cannot go wrong with this hotel and we‚Äôll definitely come again.",5,2014,03,03
113,splendidly treated and wowed 100%,"Alessandro the bar manager and George were the greatest host that i have ever encountered they were really welcoming and made me feel at home.

113,Cozy hotel,"This is my first time checking into this hotel. Was very pleasantly surprised by the setting, cleanliness and coziness of this hotel. Do not let the simplicity of the exterior of this hotel fool you. The staffs are very friendly and quite humorous at times. A special mention should go to the restaurant staffs during breakfast time. They really make you feel at home. And the free chocolates that come with the weather report leaflet every night adds a nice touch to the already pleasant stay. ",5,2014,03,02
113,the best of the best in Kensington,"I loved staying at the Kensington hotel in London. It was private, roomy, and very nice.

We were continually (pleasantly) surprised by unexpected touches that made us feel looked after throughout - hot towel to freshen up on arrival, fridge stocked with mineral water in the gym, chocolate delivered to room at 6pm, bottle of mineral water on departure. Would recommend and will certainly stay again. Many thanks.",5,2014,02,28
113,Thumbs UP,"What can you ask for more....A comfy bed to have a restful night and a central location to rest the tired feet the bed is massive and couldn't ask for a better location? A stone's throw away from south Kensington station and just across the road is the natural history museum, V & A , museum and if that‚Äôs not enough you can always jump on the tube to the central parts nearby and view the Westminster Abbey ,the House of parliament, London eye  All staff members  are awesome who unreservedly shared some pointers with us and hosted us exemplary Although there is no swimming pool but there is a gym on the lower ground floor  a modern cocktail bar to cherish your tongue, staff are extremely kind  and helpful mostly Alessandro,George and Paul.we'll definitely comeback.",5,2014,02,27
113,wonderful hotel in Kensington,"The hotel is in a stunning and ideal location, It's beautifully kept and you're made to feel very much at home Lovely stylish and immaculate rooms.

113,"Great hotel, lovely weekend break","Stayed for two nights recently with my mother. Great location; within easy reach of the shops, sights and good restaurants.  Lovely decor throughout. Very relaxing seating areas with fires lighting at all times. Reception very friendly. Breakfast particularly noteworthy.  If I had small niggles, one is in regards to seating guests too close together for breakfast even though they have an overflow area in the restaurant - some thought required by the hostess here I'd suggest.  Also, while the Bar very relaxing, the service is a little slow and could be improved upon...something we and other guests experienced on the particular night we stayed.  These are only niggles because overall an excellent experience and I would certainly recommend and will return myself again soon.",5,2014,02,22
113,One of the best,This is a great hotel  with fab rooms wonderful food  and friendly staff. the only thing was the price of drinks  however that's London. we found a great pub near the hotel. The d√©cor throughout the hotel is beautiful lookout for the hand painted trees in the lounge done in gold leaf it is amazing,5,2014,02,21
113,great stay in london,"We stayed here over a weekend a few friends visiting London, after arrival at this hotel the room wasn‚Äôt ready but we enjoyed the comfortable lounge while drinking London beer and champagne.

It‚Äôs a very clean and safe area to walk around at night and I would stay here again.",5,2014,02,19
113,This hotel gets all of it right.,"This is a very welcoming place, well situated close to the District and Circle lines of the tube, and a lot of convenient buses. Their great about getting a cab too. The rooms are good size and comfortable as are the public areas. It seems people not even staying there, meet up in the lobby sitting areas with their fireplaces and tea service. The rooms have great beds, great bathrooms, and the way you can tell a first rate hotel from the rest is that the wi-fi simply works. It's strong, I've put together presentations in that room including uploading and downloading music and videos and there was never even a moment of buffering. Try that in most hotels and you'll end up crying. This hotel is simply aces. It's expensive and you can find cheaper hotels, but I've found in London that you definitely get what you pay for.",5,2014,02,17
113,Excellent Hotel,"It is a very clean hotel, staff are very helpful and warm ! I felt very  well welcomed. The hotel is situated in a very good zone it is very closed to many underground stations, South Kensington, Gloucester, Hyde Park corner. In addition it is very closed to many museums, Hyde park and Royal Albert hall   In the restaurant Aubrey  you can find great open buffet breakfast, great food and good environment to work or meet with somebody!! Just hotel rooms are smaller than it appear in the pictures other than that it is a great hotel and I do recommend it !!",5,2014,02,16
113,"Well situated hotel, friendly service but made some mistakes.","Loved the location of this hotel.  Just a few minutes walk to South Kensington station.  Very conveniently located and fairly quiet even though I was in a street side room.  They have double windows which helped and I am a light sleeper.  Rooms were quite small, I was in a Superior but this is Europe after all.  Great things about the hotel: mints on my pillow.  Weather report for the next day each evening.  Very friendly staff.  Cons: small rooms, they double charged me for breakfast and I had to write to the hotel to rectify.  Nobody contacted me regarding the error but I noticed it was corrected a few days later on my credit card statement.",4,2014,02,13
113,"Wonderful location, elegant and comfortable lobby, smiling and capable staff!",All four qualities above have made me return to The Kensington Hotel for or five times in a row! Enjoy it next time you are in London - but do leave a room available for me when I return in spring :-),5,2014,02,13
113,Unforgettable,We stayed at The Kensington Hotel in January. I had chosen it as the venue to propose to my girlfriend so there was a lot riding on it. The staff went well out of their way to make our stay as special as it could have been. The suite we were staying in was stunning and the attention to detail was amazing. The hard work of Beccy and the rest of the team ensured my plan went ahead without a hitch. Thanks again to everyone at The Kensington. We will be back!,5,2014,02,11

113,the new gem for Tea,"The best afternoon tea in London is found in this hotel, the service is fast, efficient and non-robotic. My friends and I Enjoyed had a thrilling experience as we were celebrating one of my friends birthday. We arrived a little bit earlier but this was not a problem as the host told to relax in their Aubrey bar while waiting for the rest of my friends. When we were all sat and comfortable, we started off with a glass of champagne which was refreshingly good. Then came the sandwiches, scones and to our surprise the chef made a chocolate written plate wishing a happy birthday, We will definitely comeback and highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,02,08
113,Nice stay with great activities around to do,"Great hotel with great staff based in south Kensington, this hotel is well designed in lovely area, the decoration of the private club and the traditional English style town house is a nice scene. There is a chess board in the lobby for all those chess enthusiasts which I was keen to try but didn‚Äôt have enough time as the shopping got always in the way and sampling of pastries not to mention taking over the museums was the pick of the day. I went for a 7 miles jog around Hyde Park which is not far off from the hotel. Lovely rooms though slightly smaller but considering it‚Äôs in London it‚Äôs a much greater value for your money.",5,2014,02,07
113,"wonderful,wonderful hotel","This is undoubtedly the best hotel in London and after staying here I was really treated like a royalty by everyone, it‚Äôs situated just a few minutes from the south Kensington tube station and linking with queens gate on the other side, the advantages are bountiful location wise: shopping you have Harrods, Harvey Nichols, and the designer shops on Sloane street and Knightsbridge just a few minutes‚Äô walk, the Lamborghini show room opposite the south Kensington station. The area being nicknamed the museum quarters you have the London‚Äôs biggest and best museums: the Victoria and Albert museum, science museum, natural history museum and the royal Albert hall which plays bbc proms each year, I also took a walk in both Kensington gardens and Hyde park many restaurants were around just to name a few la brasserie, bumpkin, open between Monday ‚Äì Saturday mostly The area is very trendy with tourists along the way and locals as well.
Kensington hotel has been well designed with chandeliers that were sparkling the floors and the lounging area but more specific the chandeliers inside the Aubrey bar were extraordinary and well lighted fire place to relax and enjoy the soothing music as you pass the evening, Aubrey restaurant serves very tender steak, very humble atmosphere with a few photographs around the wall perfect for dinner mostly as the restaurant is adorned with candle lights. The service from the servers is that a lasting memory as they explain the wine and specials, and also breakfast time when the plate is well cooked and plenty of buffet to sample ,  special mentions to Saoirse & George. I highly recommend this hotel again for a wonderful experience.",5,2014,02,06
113,Good quality hotel,Second visit to the hotel. Very attentive and efficient staff and good facilities throughout the hotel. Hotel located in a good location only 200 metres from the tube station. Will certainly return and would recommend. ,4,2014,02,06
113,Latest visit not that awesome,"It had been a while since I visited the Kensington Hotel-- about four years to be precise. Before that I had stayed a good 5 or 6 times with absolutely nothing to complain about, once we even got upgraded to a great suite that was one of the best hotel rooms I've had in London. This time however we booked one of the ""deluxe"" rooms, which by the name you wouldn't guess give out onto the kitchen ventilators, but there you go. Kinda puts a damper on the week end when you have to keep the curtains closed all the time.

This was made all the more aggravating by the reception staff saying ""oh we have a delightful room for you on floor, etc etc."" Which, really dude, if it's a standard double room that looks onto the kitchen vents, spare the act. 

You'd also expect room service and the hotel bar (which is really nice, can't argue with that) not to be cheap, however they were not-to-be-cheaper than expected this time around. Kind of surprised, bar tab really stung.

All around, still a great hotel I guess. I'm sure bad luck on the room and inflation are mostly to blame.",3,2014,02,05
113,I love this hotel,"This is a very nice hotel in a great area of London.  Though I only stayed at the hotel for one night, I was able to see all the tourist areas in London on a  morning run.   The reception was very nice.  The person that checked me in, was very polite and nice.  He put me in what he said was one of the larger room, though there was not a view.  They also helped me to plan my run for the next morning, all of the staff was there to help me with it.  The room was very nice and very clean.  The rooms are small, but you need to expect this when you are staying in one of the most expensive cities in the world.

Though I spent little time at this hotel, I thought that the hotel and staff were great and I would highly recommend this to anyone staying in London.",5,2014,02,03
113,Afternoon tea at The Kensington,"As a frequent international traveller we were very pleased with the excellent and human service of the waiter George when we took our ""classical ""afternoon tea with all the family.

We can recommend it very strongly.

A Paris based family",4,2014,02,03
113,great place,"We took our 9 year old daughter to enjoy afternoon tea at this hotel and she loved the long British tradition, the afternoon began with a pot of tea for me and my wife and for our daughter she had a glass of lemonade, when the sandwiches came we didn‚Äôt expect such a huge amount we had a selection of five ingredients with brown and white bread, our daughters favorite was the honey roasted ham with brown bread, After a short period of time the teapots were brought back, Both teapots were warm and a very strong aroma from the leaves it‚Äôs like coming out of a brewery . The whole afternoon went exquisitely well and George our server was an expert at his job and made the afternoon a very delightful experience for our daughter mostly. ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù",5,2014,02,02
113,NYer in London,"Great staff and service, largest gym of any London hotel I know, and Scandinavian breakfast. only hotel that could make me beark up with claridges. George in lobby was best server in recent memory, great unrushed service.",5,2014,02,02
113,Feel like a royal family......excellent service,"A gem of a place situated in the heart of kensington. The location is simply great as all the interesting places are nearby.

Thank you to all the staff on the service provided.
I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,02,01
113,Very impressed,"This hotel gave us an upscale London experience while sightseeing for leisure, such a lasting and memorable experience to remember, we have been immersed in this gorgeous hotel, The service from the staff is superbly flawless  as in my years  of touring places never have I been offered a drink without asking and as it turn out to be just what I wanted for the time, the waiter (George)at the lounge read my mind and wowed me brilliantly, and he remembers my name which is an absolute plus in terms of quality service, also all of the staff members here are attentive, professional and flawless , the cocktail bartender was concocting martini and vodka cocktails at the Aubrey bar and cappuccino with chocolate on top to form an art which matches the hotel logo and delicious too. Plenty of red, white and rose wines from their long wine list menu and afternoon tea cakes all this can be enjoyed in a sparkling clean and utterly luxurious lounge, the Kensington hotel is one of the best in its 5 class service. If you are passionate about art, history and science then south Kensington is the place to be you‚Äôll visit the science museum, natural history museum and the royal Albert hall, Victorian and Albert museum. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,02,01
113,top notch hotel,"This is a beautiful hotel and  we cannot fault it, a wonderful location on brompton road with excellent and easy access to the stores and museums.
the main big attractions in this location are (natural history museum, royal albert hall, science museum, hyde park and Harrods, the extras are the fine cuisines just 5 minutes walk like japanese, italian and european. The rooms are dazzling and clean,beds were comfy. The personalised service is impeccable from the waiters, receptionists and the concierge is truly outstanding and I would recommend this hotel highly.",5,2014,01,30
113,Very modern English,"This was a boutique hotel and it was a very posh place to stay in London.  I would've given it all 5s but, our television wasn't working properly in the room.  Sometimes it would work sometimes it wouldn't and the staff were not very quick about resolving this problem.  Also, when we arrived the extra throw blanket at the foot of our bed had hair on it.  Pretty gross.  The maids immediately came to rectify the situation and provided a brand new blanket which was much appreciated.  The staff was very nice and very helpful.  My husband and I did eat in the restaurant and it was excellent.  For the price we might stay there again, but I might look at other places comparable to theirs for a different experience.  I'm very particular about bathrooms and I must say that the bathrooms were immaculate.",4,2014,01,29
113,"Elegant, luxury and good location","This hotel is a 5 star hotel and the location is first rate, a few minutes walk to the hyde park and museums, theatres,knightsbridge and if you have more time you can get to westfield and enjoy more shopping, the hotel is clean ,cosy and neatly decorated with a perfectly homely charms around it. The staff treat you very well, and extremely helpful.",5,2014,01,28
113,My hotel of choice for afternoon tea,"After months since I visited this hotel, I took my mum to enjoy a nice afternoon tea at the Kensington hotel and the standards are still high, Jennifer at the reception kindly escorted us to the lounge and there we met George with his winning smile still like the last time. We started the afternoon with a pot of earl grey and afterwards continued with the sandwiches. I'm very impressed with this hotel for maintaining good food and service. I can‚Äôt wait to return soon.",5,2014,01,28
113,Excellent Staff,My wife and I stayed at The Kensington for 3 nights (23-26/01/14). The room was compact and hanging and storage areas a bit tight but the room was excellently equipped and the bed very comfortable. Our package included breakfast which was as extensive as you wanted and the service impeccable. The hotel is well located and the doorman seems to be able to memorise everyone's name which provides a welcome touch.,4,2014,01,27
113,Good value,"I booked this because its rates seemed to be about half what the other five stars were charging, so I knew it would not offer the full five star treatment. 

The location is excellent, easy access on the tube from Heathrow and up into the West End, lovely caf√© area around the South Ken tube and you can stroll up to Knightsbridge and Hyde Park. 

However, even though the service is extremely pleasant and friendly, and therefore very good, this is not a five star experience: more than one member of staff failed to set the table properly at breakfast, I wasn't offered a menu for the cooked breakfast, someone tried to take away food before I was finished and then left without taking away the glass and plate I'd left aside. None of this annoyed me because they were all so pleasant, but it's not five star. I was a bit less impressed with cleaning staff banging in my door at nine o'clock on the morning I checked out and then walking away without explanation.

I had a superior room which had a good bathroom, bedding, nespresso machine and tea (thanks you for proper milk), but it was very small. I wouldn't like to have booked a standard room.

All in all, for the rate I paid and given the great location, I would stay here again in a heartbeat but some serious staff training is required before this could be called a five star. All extremely pleasant though. ",4,2014,01,26
113,Business trip in London,"I stayed at this hotel for business trip while in London, I chose to stay at Kensington hotel after reading the good reviews and this hotel is superbly maintained by management,all staff were busy and we still had excellent service from the point of checking in until when we left the building, The hotel is a few miles from Harrods, and a few metres from the south kensington station. in conclusion this is a fantastic hotel and would recommend it highly",5,2014,01,25
113,Best Stay ever,"This is was my best stay in London to this date, as I'm normally bombarded with bad experiences in the hotel I have stayed in before, but this time round the kensington made my stay warm and exceeded my expectation, fast check in from Paul at the the front desk and excellent personalised service from George who remembered every time I encountered with him. I was quite impressed with the amenities and Free wifi, very thoughtful indeed.",5,2014,01,24
113,Tip top,"I have just winded my London trip with a blast while my abode at the kensington hotel was top of the range. The hotel is very modern on a cross road to queens gate. my room was excellent , the nespresso machine, the iphone docks and all other amenities were state of the art. The staff are always the back bone of any establishment and I was really pampered with great service from everyone and mostly George at the lounge. highly recommend.",5,2014,01,24
113,Outstanding Service,"Have never written a review before but feel compelled to do so for this hotel. Have stayed in many different hotels in London, however, never have we been treated so well by all the staff. From check-in to check out, all members of staff were helpful, friendly, smiling and all continually offering to help us in any way. A particular mentioned to the concierge guy who parked our car, feed the meter for us and advised us very well - never before have we received such good service and we have stayed at many 5* hotels in London including The Savoy.
My husband stays in London for business alot and is very fussy, however he will definately be recommending your hotel. Thank you for a very pleasurable stay.",5,2014,01,24
113,five star stay,"A five star experience coupled with superb ambience in south Kensington, London. Everything was accessible in terms of museums, shops and theatres, parks.  Alessandro and George are outstanding staffs; we were impressed with their level of professional service. Thank you Kensington Hotel, We strongly recommend anyone visiting London to visit this friendly hotel",5,2014,01,23

113,mixes  from the award wining mixologist,"Stayed here recently on a weekend while sightseeing London, very nice comfortable rooms, street views, Museums, clubs like boujis, and cafes and restaurants near this hotel. The staff was really excellent, all very smiley and friendly. I loved Alessandro‚Äôs cucumber martinis the best! Such a great cozy bar and he is fabulous. I will definitely come back.",5,2014,01,21
113,Afternoon was fantastic,"This was an excellent Afternoon tea, and they couldn't do enough to make this better experience than it already was, impressed by the scones here. The sponge and fruit cakes were delicious and tasty, The scones were perfectly shaped, fresh yet ever so crumbly. the ambience was just and the lounge wasn't stuffy at all.",5,2014,01,20
113,An excellent central hotel,"Having had lunch at the hotel a few months ago I decided to stay, as I had another meeting there. Great people in reception and very organised and friendly when I checked in. A good room, after an upgrade and a very comfortable and quiet room. So, I would recommend this hotel to any business person and you will have good, free wifi, excellent food with friendly waiters and a very comfortable lounge area to work from during the day and the evening.",5,2014,01,20
113,wonderful weekend,"I stayed at the hotel with my wife and 4 other friends. The hotel is very elegant but with a charm all its own, the rooms are really nicely decorated, the food in the restaurant was superb and the cocktails far too tempting. But most importantly the service from the staff was perfect throughout. A thoroughly enjoyable weekend.",5,2014,01,20
113,Not a great experience - Room was like a cupboard,"We were meeting friends for dinner in Central London and wanted somewhere nice and close to Holland Park. We chose The Kensington and secured a room that was advertised at about ¬£200 in other places. The deal we got was ¬£150 room only which I appreciate is not much in Central London but it was not good at all.

The hotel itself is fine, public rooms all nice, staff seemed friendly but we just wanted a quiet and nice room as we were literally just sleeping there and not using any of the facilities.

The room we booked was on the 5th floor and was simply ridiculous. The bed ( only a double ) took up the entire room, we had to constantly move to get past each other in the room which became almost laughable, the shower room was equally small with the basin, loo and shower all crammed into a room the size of a cupboard. 

The walls we're paper thin with TVs in other rooms blaring out all night. There was constant noise late into the early hours with people slamming doors and yelling in corridors. The window in our room looked out over a roof and a wall.

I fully accept that we opted for a standard room but in this case it was simply not of an acceptable standard at all. We will not go back and would not endorse this hotel for a relaxing and enjoyable stay to anyone.",2,2014,01,19
113,A very good hotel,"This hotel is in a great location, beside the V&A, the Natural History Museum, South Ken and just a stones throw from Knightsbridge and Kings Rd. The hotel has a beautiful lobby/ drawing room where you can sit and while the hours away, watching people coming and going. And the bar is really very nice, nearly too nice! The staff, without exception, are extremely helpful and polite. Skip the smaller rooms if you can, they are good but the best are the larger ones.  Have stayed here several times, and when you put all the parts together, it is a very fine and relaxing place to stay.",5,2014,01,19
113,tea for two,"The hotel is right next to queens gate and south kensington Tube - easy access to gloucester road, Harrods and chelsea, hyde park Park is not far and the street itself,the precincts is  lovely and quiet.Inside is the stretched lounge,very elegant. flower pots on top of each table arranged neatly, and photographic books were scattered throughout the hotel.the experience was an absolute work of art.",5,2014,01,18
113,Wonderful!,"Stayed here for just one night, but just had to write to say how wonderful our stay was. 
The hotel is absolutely lovely but the staff really make this hotel, from the guys in the lobby, the reception staff and of course the fabulous mixologist in the cocktail bar! Would always stay here when visiting London! 
p.s. Try 'The Velvet Kiss' cocktail it's heavenly!!!!!",5,2014,01,18
113,"luxury, luxury, luxury","This hotel truly is at the top of it's game, the Location awesome and is just off queens gate; hard to find quality customer service but not here because the Staffs were unfailingly helpful and cheerful.

113,my new jewel,"It was my first time to stay at The Kensington Its a luxurious hotel which has just been given a complete refurbishment, you gets lots of caring attention, the personalised service like having your own butler, the location and the decor are amazing, its walking distance to all the fine dining, boutique stores, museums and the hyde park. The rooms have plenty of amenities you need including an ipod charging unit and there are other lots of thoughtful touches, I stayed in room which had lovely views and Can't wait to come back, I've found my new haven.",5,2014,01,18
113,Extra mile,"I just returned from my short trip in England. Arriving at the Kensington was like coming back home after a long day at work, the staffs are genuinely friendly and they make you feel as if you already know them. They even made dinner suggestions and reservations for me at Aubrey‚Äôs restaurant, Alessandro made some really nice cocktails and George was the best company at Breakfast, my room could not have been nicer. Marble walled showers had a lovely feel as were the robes. I cannot recommend this hotel more highly. I will definitely go back.",5,2014,01,17
113,"lovely,homely hotel","I have stayed at this hotel numerous times although I live just on the outskirts of london, From arriving at the hotel this time round everything is still exemplary as usual, It‚Äôs  located in a lovely quiet area in Kensington .

113,Best Hotel in london,"We visited this hotel for a long weekend for a friends wedding in London a while back.We chose to stay at Kensington hotel after reading the numerous good reviews. this hotel is a 5 star and seems pretty from the outside. We stayed in a room on the 1st floor which had a modern bathroom, large lcd tv and the best part was the king size bed that has got to be the most comfiest bed to have ever slept on, Staff know what they are there for and we had excellent service from the point of checking in to when we departed, The hotel is approx 10 minutes walk from south kensington tube station
All in all it was a brilliant hotel and when we return to london we will stay here again. I personally would recommend this hotel very highly.",5,2014,01,17

The staff at reception showed all the professional qualities you will expect from a classy hotel by check you in as quick and polite possible and I was told everything about the hotel even before I arrived to my room by the doorman. The hotel serves very nice doyle burgers and cocktails are being prepared by Alessandro who is a mixologist, in the morning nice pot of coffee and buffet and amazing service from George,this hotel is for whoever is looking for the perfect place to stay, ‚Äòa home away from home‚Äô.
",5,2014,01,17
113,All in one,"Our stay at the kensington hotel was a good one, upon arrival the concierge opens the door for you and they offer to assist you with you luggage afterwards without us needing to point out which is a good standard for a five star hotel. The check in was quick and the professional lady at the reception gave us a towel after the long journey. they have comfortable beds and clean  atmosphere all around. If you are a enthusiast of cocktails go downstairs to their cocktail bar and you'll be pleased with the choices. nice and happy guest .",5,2014,01,17
113,Beautiful place,"I was staying at the Kensington London for my partners birthday and was delighted by fact that the quality of the hotel is high, modern and in a nice neighbourhood in London coupled with the level of friendliness and warmth at this hotel.

Unfortunately we had a problem with an error made by staff on checkout with a pre authorisation payment which caused great inconvenience on our forward travels.,4,2014,01,14
113,As Always,"It's always a pleasure to return to the Kensington Hotel. It's mostly motivated by business that I stay, however it's becoming more important to take some time out when in the Hotel. The reason? The staff and their welcome,  attention to every need. It's my relax time too, and I always leave smiling! Kensington is such a great area to stay. It's easy to get in and out of, and has with plenty choices as to however one might like to fill their time.",5,2014,01,13
113,Excellence,"We have just returned from an overnight stay at the Kensington and are still feeling relaxed.

All the staff are friendly and helpful, the room was spacious, clean and comfortable and the location perfect. We have stayed before and will stay again.",5,2014,01,12
113,Great location and service,"This hotel had great reviews on trip advisor and so we booked a superior double room for 6 nights from end dec to early jan. The location is good with easy access to the tube and within easy walking distance to Hyde park and Knightsbridge. The area has numerous restaurants and shops. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the lounge areas were very relaxing and inviting. We were however, very disappointed with the size of our room. There was almost no storage space or area to store bags. There was just enough room to walk around the bed. The bathroom was very small and useable by only one person at a time. The restocking of the bedroom supplies was not consistent. On a positive note, It was nice to have an espresso machine in the room and the room was nicely decorated.",4,2014,01,12
113,Afternoon tea in London,"
The afternoon tea at the kensington hotel was a wonderful experience, My friends came here last year around october and recommend that we should try whenever we are in London. The sandwiches were delicious and our server George is a very good host. we will be back again soon",5,2014,01,12
113,Good for Business,"This is a good hotel for business and corporate meeting, the hotel offers free newspapers, and they are very generous with their fast wireless internet service, it‚Äôs almost impossible to find free wifi inside the hotel without a hidden charge. We were warmly greeted by all the staff at all times that we encountered them, extremely friendly and professional at the same time which I‚Äôll count as a bonus point. There a Lovely breakfast in the morning with a quite lounge to enjoy my coffee and making calls.",5,2014,01,12

113,lovely,"We stayed at The Kensington over the Christmas period and, after having experienced other popular hotels in the area at other times during the year, thought the staff at The Kensington were far more welcoming and friendly.  It had a home away from home feel in a great location and for probably the first time in London I actually found it easy to get my sense of direction on track in relation to Hyde Park, the museums etc.  Would highly recommend this hotel over others in the area just for the staff's attitude alone which makes all the difference as to what one thinks about the time they had there. Great hotel.",5,2014,01,10
113,Lovely Hotel,"My husband and l normally stay at this hotel when we visit London. The staff are very friendly and helpful, rooms have always been very clean and in working order.

113,Service like no other,"After having read all the fantastically great reviews I decided to try to stay and see things for myself and I was more than amazed. The Bar manager Alessandro is a real credit, he leads his staff very well like Valentina at the restaurant and George who was at the lounge among other members like a small family,  this is how hotel's atmosphere should be keeping in mind the hassle and bassle around the busy London.  I was also pleased with what the hotel has done with the lights adjusting them with the mood around by the hour. thumbs up.",5,2014,01,10
113,Better than expected,"When we came to this hotel we didn‚Äôt really know what to expect, but i couldn‚Äôt have been more happier with our decision. it was an excellent experience the hotel is superbly furnished with the most pleasant staff that i have  ever seen .you experience a great feeling as you walk inside your room a sense of relaxation as every detail has been taken into consideration. being quite picky myself I couldn‚Äôt fault this hotel.",5,2014,01,10
113,Nice welcome - staff willing and friendly - great location.,"Located close to South Kensington station - an easy walk away - easy parking, (outside Congestion Zone) close to museums and West End and on the Piccadilly line from Heathrow, this hotel is perfectly placed. The building is an old converted typical large Kensington property, brought up to date with good taste. Cosy lounga and calm ambience, good for informal meetings and meeting friends, etc. Staff very attentive (the porter even paid for a little extra time on our parking, when we missed the 8h30 morning deadline. Receptionists sweet and charming and restaurant staff attentive.Some items on the Breakfast buffet were a bit ""tired"" - cheeses going dry round the edges of the slices, but a decent selection. The bedroom was fine but there was not alot of stortage space ( I imagine most visitors are there for only one or two nights) so inadeqaute for a longer stay or for storing all those ""Sales"" items(!) Our bathroom did not have a radiator and the underfloor heating in it was inadequate - however it soon warmed up when we open the bathroom door to the bedroom. Aircon was efficient. Also an irritating little problem with the plug of the sink basinnot shutting or opening with the lever behind the tap meant we had to fiddle around to fill the basin and empty it. Not a big problem but also not very good for the finger nails! Although this was reported on the first day it never got fixed. However, it did not spoil our stay and all the rest was excellent.",4,2014,01,10
113,Quintessential London elegance with amazing service,"The KensingtonHotel is located by the Natural History museum, Hyde Park and with access to everything via South Ken tube.  The lobby is an amazing comfortable place to relax, meet, enjoy the view through big windows and warm by the fireplaces on chilly days. I was overwhelmed when a gentleman named George in lobby remembered me by name and what coffee and tea my girlfriend and I liked. As an American I am not often impressed with service in London but thanks to this warm reception I am thrilled. Highly recommend Kensington Hotel.",5,2014,01,10
113,"Beautiful hotel, Outstanding service!","I spend some time at the lounge and I have to say the service provided is outstanding. The decor is beautiful and the food excellent.

Thank you again for such a great experience.",5,2014,01,10

113,Wonderful hotel with great staff.,"My husband and I stayed at The Kensington Hotelfrom 28 - 31 December 2013.  The hotel is situated in a great location and has lots of good restaurants nearby.  It's close to the Royal Albert Hall, Natural History Museum and Science Museum.  Or if you enjoy posh shopping, it's near to Harrod's and Harvey Nichols.

My friend bought us a Mr and Mrs Smith hotel voucher for our wedding present and we used this to stay here.  I emailed the hotel to let them know that our stay was part of our honeymoon.  We were greeted on arrival by friendly staff and they upgraded us and gave us complimentary champagne.  

Our room was on the top floor and had a very comfortable four posted bed.  The room and bathroom were lovely - they even put rose petals on the bed!  The room was a good size for London hotels.  

We didn't eat at the hotel, but the afternoon tea looked good!  We instead ate out at some lovely local restaurants.  There's such a variety of places to eat on your doorstep.  We found a great little pub call the Queen's Arms on Queens Gate Mews - this was tucked away from the main drag and served good food and drinks.

When we went back to the hotel we treated ourselves to champagne.  Jimmy served us and he was such a lovely chap - I said that I'd mention him in my review.  We sat in the lounge, where there are huge comfy sofas and a big real fire - very relaxing.

The location, staff and decor really made this hotel stand out for me.  I have stayed in numerous hotels in London and can honestly say that this was my favourite.  The staff were very friendly, but not over bearing.  

We will definitely be staying at The Kensington Hotel again.  Thanks for a wonderful stay and the upgrade - we really appreciated it!

We sat by the long curvy sofa near the window with spectacular views both of the hotel and the street. we chose to go for a champagne tea which started with a glass of champagne then later came countless number of stands filled with sandwiches on top and scones at the bottom and the other one was filled with cakes.

The days started with laughter and an amazing breakfast thanks to the lovely service by Nicole and George. The rooms are elegant and comfortable and the salon beautifully decorated for the holidays. I truly recommend it!,5,2013,12,24
113,A Wonderful Stay,"We loved everything about this hotel.  It is much more of a boutique property than a ""chain"" hotel.  The decor was elegant, the rooms extremely clean and comfortable, and the staff was top notch.  It really felt like a high-end luxury property, although it was much more affordable than others in that class.  The location is terrific for shopping and dining, and very easy access to the tube for sightseeing.  There is a lovely French restaurant just around the corner, as well as an excellent Italian bistro (next to Italian meat market) for breakfast.  The concierge was helpful and knowledgeable and really made our trip enjoyable with his excellent recommendations.

Really, there is nothing I would change about this property or its staff.  Very pleased!",5,2013,12,23
113,Fantastic service,"Organised afternoon tea as a christmas gift for my mum and we requested to change the choice of sandwiches. This was at no time met with complaint, and Alessandro, the manager on duty was lovely, personally taking the order. 

George our waiter, was knowledgable, polite and ensured we were happy thoughout our visit. We must have come across so fussy, as we sent back the cakes for two extra scones, which by the way are delicious, especially with the clotted cream and jam, yum!! 

Whilst sitting another table ordered fish and chips and I can honestly say, it looked and smelt divine. Everything is served fresh and to the highest standard, with all the staff as friendly as one another. The hotel is spotless and well presented from point of entrance and no detail is left out until the moment you leave. 

I would highly recommend a visit to this hotel, even if it's to have a drink, as the cocktails also look amazing. 

Ask for George, he's a gem!!",5,2013,12,23
113,Birthday Treat!üéàüç∞üéÅ,"My Friends and I loved our stay at the hotel. 
As soon as we arrived it was warm, welcoming and homely with gorgeous scented candles. 
Although we arrived before check in our room was ready for us. The room was perfect, with the comfiest beds, amazing shower and to top it off fluffy bathrobes and slippers!!! Which were perfect for us girlies after a night partying in heels!

Breakfast was yummy and served by possibly one of the nicest waiters we have met - George! He was professionally, friendly and made our morning.

The hotel is beautifully decorated with a chilled out atmosphere and roaring fire - perfect to sit in front of after a hard days shopping!

Overall we did not want to leave, the hotel is like a second home and we're already planning to come back next year! 

Thanks guys!",5,2013,12,23
113,Sight seeing in London,This is such a well run beautiful hotel. The staff are well skilled and friendly. Especially George who looks after your every need at breakfast. Great spot in Knightsbridge close to major attractions especially if you love museums. Highly recommended.,5,2013,12,23
113,Fantastic service,"Lovely hotel - fantastic service. The location is great and on a cold afternoon tucking in my the fire with a hot chocolate is brilliant. Mr George was a real delight, very kind and helpful. I would come back.",5,2013,12,22
113,Much more than expected,"stayed at the kensington and I was really taken away to a land of luxurious living. I was staying on the third floor and I absolutely fell in love with my room ...the decor was modern yet classy without being too fussy generally making you blend in with the wallpaper ,silky pillows and waterfall showers which is not usual to come by.
the concierge Martin is well informed with all the happening with the area , from theatre tickets to the best sushi,italian and continental cuisines around not to mention their very own Aubrey‚Äôs restaurant where the journey begins with a nice green, sinking sofa  to the starters of foccacia and soda bread accompanied by homemade butter,  then followed by a juicy steak accompanied with spinach on the side and to finish my sweet tongue with a peanut butter brownie thats absolutely an experience to digest. Later on I‚Äôm back in my room  enjoying a nice glass of wine and relaxing with a big screen plasma TV and one of the fastest wireless internet I have come to use in hotels. The next morning I went to the breakfast room on the ground floor to have my kick-starter and was welcome by the hostess to the seating and shown around the giant buffet full of fresh fruits, meats, cheese selections and bread before I ordered hot plate of eggs benedict, the highlight of the morning though was a Staff named George who was personable, friendly and a very good conversationalist, and also thanks to Alessandro for the best cocktails, never have I come across such an extraordinary level of service. Also to wrap things up after the beautiful day is the turndown service and the note pointing the weather for tomorrow, All in all this a brilliant hotel and I couldn‚Äôt find any fault and I had a memorable stay.",5,2013,12,21
113,FABULOUS HOTEL,"My daughter, grand-daughter and myself recently stayed at the Kensington Hotel and had a wonderful time from start to finish.  On arrival we were handed hot towels to refresh us after our journey.  Then to our delight we were upgraded to a suite.  The room was superb with everything we needed to make our stay comfortable.  The staff were so nice and friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them.  The manager Becky Gunne does a fantastic job and her managment skills are second to none.  All in all we had a fantastic time and can't wait to get the opportunity to stay at the Kensington again, hopefully next year!!!

Three very happy guests, Beatrice Marcroft-Falvey.",5,2013,12,21
113,Beautiful hotel - definitely recommend,"Thoroughly enjoyed our time at this hotel. The front desk staff was incredibly helpful: allowing us to check in early after a long transatlantic flight, printing our boarding passes, etc. They were a delight. Also, the concierge was incredible. He set us up with restaurants and activities that helped us see as much of London as possible in a short trip.

Great location - walkable to Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park, Harrods and two underground stations (South Kensington and Gloucester Rd) which connect you to the rest of the city quickly and easily. 

We had the most basic room and it was a bit small but perfectly fine for us considering we were out and about so much. Our favorite thing was the heated tiles in the bathroom. So awesome! Will definitely return next time we're in town.",5,2013,12,19
113,Beautiful and tasteful hotel,"We have just returned from a three night break at The Kensington, we had booked a twin for my two teenagers and a Double room. Although the double room was lovely, the bed was just too small for myself and my husband. The next day we were moved to a King room with no hesitation, the staff asked me if we were happy with the room on a few occasions. 
The staff are very good, attention to detail was excellent.
On Saturday we had afternoon tea, which was lovely but perhaps fruit cake or cake without creamy toppings would be better than such rich cakes. 
The bar in the evening was beautiful and very relaxing, I would normally avoid a hotel bar but I couldn't wait to order a G&T and a burger on Sunday evening after a long day of Christmas shopping. It didn't disappoint.
My only criticism would be that as a converted old building it's rooms vary greatly in size and location. There is some building work going on, and whilst it's not an issue if you are out all day, there was a constant hum in our room (107), I have no idea if it was to do with the works or it was an air conditioner, but it was quite loud.
I'm looking forward to staying here again, I feel like I have finally found the perfect London hotel.
",5,2013,12,18
113,"Lovely hotel , Great location. Good value for money.","Stayed 2 nights, Had a great stay, Perfect for shopping walked miles but we eventually got our bearings and covered all the shops around Harrods and Sloane St .  The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas complete with open fires. All the staff are attentive but not pushy,the room was pleasant with everything you would expect for the 5 star status. Breakfast was just ok,not a great choice on the buffet, but adequate.  Excellent gym,with more than enough quality equipment.   Overall I can recommend this hotel and would love to go back.",5,2013,12,17

113,Beautiful Saturday Tea party,"I had the pleasure to come to the kensington hotel to have an
afternoon tea with my cousin and it was nice, We were sat by our host next to the fireplace and a gigantic Christmas tree which was well decorated .The tea started with a pot of jasmine tea and my cousin had lapsang which were served in tea leaves, shortly after we had our stands; one with scones,sandwiches and jams and the second one with cakes. Overall it was a nice experience.",5,2013,12,17
113,Probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in!,"Perfectly located in South Kensington, just a short walk from the tube station. 
We visit London about 3 times a year, our capital is simply stunning. 
The Kensington Hotel shows the UK at it's very best. Beautiful architecture, tastefully decorated (Christmas tree was just lovely) and the most polite staff. Nothing is too much trouble.
The rooms had everything we needed and more. 
Merry Christmas to everyone at the Kensington Hotel and we will be seeing you in 2014.",5,2013,12,15
113,"Great stay, other than one big problem","Stayed 4 nights just recently.  Upon arrival to our room, we noticed the duvet cover and sheets on our bed were tattered and literally torn in the corners.  Unacceptable for a 5 star hotel.  Those linens should not even be in the closet.  It gave us a very bad first impression of the housekeeping that went on in this hotel.  We put a card on the bed each day requesting our linens be changed, however, they remained every day.  Room service wasn't great either.  Every order we placed was missing items.  Had to call down 3 times to get one breakfast order corrected.  Things like one place setting for 2 people, cereal but no milk, coffee for two with only one cup.  Little things that show lack of attention to detail.  Not what we expect from a 5 star hotel.  Also, our room was bit attended to until at least 4:30pm each day.  Nothing else negative to say about this place.  Everyone was very pleasant.  Location is great.  Plenty of good eating establishments in the area with good variety.",3,2013,12,14
113,final treat before xmas,"When we booked our short holiday at this hotel we didn't know that this was going to be the best holiday for this year, the hotel is located in south kensington area and after we arrived just a few minutes after midday and  checked in. We went to have some lunch at the bumpkin restaurant near the station, did lots of shopping at westfield and came back to the hotel at around 7 pm. 
The hotel is well furnished with xmas tree at the lounge and holiday season touches, the food was lovely plus cooked splendidly and great service from Greg at the Bar and 'Happy smiling' George who were very kind and looked after us throughout our stay. we'll definitely make this hotel our no.1 choice always.",5,2013,12,12
113,Excellent stay as always,The Kensington really looks after its customers - I loved the Nespresso machine in my room - a real treat.  The ladies at the front desk were very courteous and friendly and the front lobby was so warm and welcoming with aromatherapy candles and mulled cider.  I look forward to my next trip.,5,2013,12,12
113,Highly recommended!,"As a regular visitor to London for both business and pleasure I can highly recommend this Hotel.
In particular the bar/restaurant area is wonderful and very reasonably priced, especially considering the area!
The staff there are very friendly - especially George who is outstanding - and with free wifi, ample space etc it can make for the perfect business environment.
Great location as well being only 100m to the Piccadilly and District/Circle Lines, Natural History/Science Museums et al but the service and environment are what really stand out!

113,Weekend stopover December 2013,Second time we have stayed at this hotel and the hospitality and courtesy shown to us was as good as ever can thoroughly recommend this hotel Greta location for museums and Chelsea close too the tube etc first rate,5,2013,12,11
113,Great Hotel.  Fantastic location.,"Went to London for a birhtday weekend, and it couldn't have been better.  The location is superb.  In a beautiful area, within walking distance of so many restaurants, bars, museums.  Even the tube is near by.  The staff are extremely effecient, without being overly fussy.  The room was slighly smaller than I mght have expected, but this is often the case in big City hotels.  It's not a cheap option to stay in, but if you want to treat yourself to a weekend in London this is the place to stay.",5,2013,12,09
113,Could not have been better!,"Just back from a family weekend in London - Christmas shopping with the kids, attractions, etc. The Kensington - yet again - delivered........from perfect Family rooms to accomodate parents and kids, a secure/very conveniently located and luxurious base, real/healthy breakfast to start the day, excellent gym, small treats for the kids (colouring books, teddy bears, cookies & milk). The opportunity for Mum & Dad to relax in the beautiful lounge for a well earned drink after a hard day in town - beautiful :-)
This is our fifth stay at the Kensington - and we will be back.

Special recognition to George in the dining room - he couldnt have done more to make us more comfortable.

Thank you Kensington!!",5,2013,12,09
113,pleasantly enjoyable,"I stayed at the kensington for a couple of nights and had a memorable stay, for starters this hotel is well located near the south kensington tube station thereby making it easier to visit all the museums and if you like shopping there is harvey nichols,harrods,knightbridge and sloane street closely by. The rooms are clean and and nice beddings to sleep on, there is a gym at the lower ground floor to keep fit and a business centre next to the lift. Breakfast was delicious coupled by great customer service from Aladdin,Jade and George who were very professional and yet friendly. I reccomend it and will stay here again.",5,2013,12,08
113,oustanding hotel!,"we were guests of family down from Scotland and had a wonderful stay.   such a warm, friendly atmosphere, efficient service, lovely fires in ground floor lounge areas, comfortable restaurant if a little warm at breakfast, superbly comfortable beds, we could not fault it and would highly recommend.",5,2013,12,08
113,Excellent boutique hotel,"Wonderful staff, location, and rooms! My wife and I stayed here for a night to start a 3 week trip around Europe. 

Plenty of great restaurants, bars, and shops nearby. Short walk to Hyde Park.

Concierge took great care of us. Small but nice gym downstairs. Highly recommended.",5,2013,12,06
113,5* in a fab location,"We stayed last year for one night in a suite and loved it so much we returned for 3 nights this year, in a superior room. We were pleasantly surprised that the 'downgrade' in room actually wasn't too bad - plenty of space, nice decor (as you would expect after a 20 million refurb) and a pretty decent view over the street. We did have a few issues, I.e. no iron in the room and had to ring twice to get one sent up, the seal on the shower was broken when we arrived and was hanging loose. Instead of fixing it they pulled it right off so the shower door wouldn't stay put and there was a resulting cold draft whilst using the shower! Not what you expect in a 5* hotel! The staff are good, but could do better in my opinion. Service was slow at times even though there appeared to be many hands in deck! Although staff are polite and courteous, they lacked the warmth and welcome that you normally expect in a top london hotel. Also, I noticed that when we used the Nespresso machine in the room, we were given more refills of decaf (which we had not used) and not enough normal refills. Again, this is hardly a massive issue but I felt the standards had slipped from our previous trip maybe. Our key card also failed to work so we were locked out of our room and had to return to reception... (Annoying after a long day and you had just got to the third floor!) 
The location of this hotel is fab, 5 mins from South Kensington tube and walkable museums and Hyde park, etc. The staff offer you a map if needed and the area is great - many places to eat and visit nearby. I would say DONT bother with breakfast here, you can get a breakfast which is better and cheaper very close by. However dinner was excellent on both occasions we have eaten here, and the cocktails are also top notch! 
Thoroughly recommend this hotel for those that want to stay in South Kensington, there are a few niggles but we only paid half rack rate through booking on another site, and of course no one is perfect! 
Overall a pleasant and enjoyable stay!",4,2013,12,06
113,Faultless stay,"Great hotel with lovely common parts, beautiful rooms and friendly helpful staff. With free wifi as well, what's not to like? Location couldn't be better either with Piccadilly & Circle/District line trains 5 mins walk away. Would happily stay again.",5,2013,12,05
113,Superb Hotel,"I recently stayed at the Kensington with the Family and must say they were very accomodating.  We had requested a bath and a cot for the baby and all requests were in the room on arrival!

We dined in the hotel one evening in the very grand lounge area and the service and food were excellent!

The concierge and door men were incredibly helpful and always there with a smile and an offer of assistance!

The room we had was very large wtih all the amenities you could need!

The location is also great for the shopping areas of Knightsbridge, Chelsea and Kensington..all a short walk away.  Harrods and the Kings road being our favourite.  The shops of oxford street about a 30-40 minute lovely walk through Hyde Park.

You are surrounded by history, culture, museums, shopping and restaurants so a great location!  Some of the finest restaurants in London are a short walk away.  

Be sure to try the award winning mixoligists cocktails in the bar also!  Some of the best i have tried.

The gym facilities are good for a hotel gym with more than enough weight training, cardio vascular and plyometric facilities than you need!

I also use this hotel for business because of the quality of service and warm welcome you always get!

I will see you next week on my return...thoroughly recommend to business and leisure travellers alike!",5,2013,12,05
113,The best of all worlds in the heart of Kensington,"I stayed three nights at the Kensington Hotel and I honestly can't rate this place high enough. On all fronts, it was top notch. As an extremely weary business traveller I arrived there at 10 a.m. thinking I would just drop my bag and soldier on until my room was ready, but they immediately checked me in.(I cannot tell you how rare this is!!)
The location is terrific, near South Kensington tube which links to both Piccadilly (Heathrow) and District and Circle lines. It's also only a hop to both the V & A and Harrod's.
The rooms are quiet and comfortable with very luxe amenities, including an espresso machine and San Pelegrino each day. There is a very well outfitted gym in the basement.
The breakfast buffet was wonderful and the staff incredibly accommodating and service oriented.
I would stay here again in a heartbeat!",5,2013,12,04
113,Best location,"My sister and I stayed here last week and had the best experience. The location is perfect, museums and Hyde park just around the corner, endless drinking and dining options within walking distance, and the South Kensington tube station a ten minute stroll away making the rest of London easily accessible.
The staff are courteous and professional, as well as very knowledgeable and helpful. The hotel itself is elegant and refined. Our room was perfectly proportioned with all the conveniences you would expect from a top-class hotel. Breakfast was delicious and set us up nicely for a day of sight seeing. I would recommend this to anyone travelling to London and am looking forward to returning myself!",5,2013,12,03
113,Nice hotel but we had to leave with no breakfast,"Stayed here for 1 night as were attending a local event.

The hotel is beautiful, the staff are extremely friendly and the reception area was so welcoming on a warm day with mulled wine and amazing christmas fragrances everywhere.

We had a superior room which was nice, very clean and well laid out. As with most London hotels its was very small and the bathroom door kept smacking on the toilet when we opened the door.

The TV could also do with some more channels but the WiFi was free and worked well.

The only really disappointing thing was that we went down for breakfast at around half 9. We were seated quickly and the table was very nicely presented. We both ordered a cooked full english and in the meantime toast and tea was bought to us which was great as we were very hungry.

10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes later and no breakfast but people around us that had arrived after had received theirs. We tried to get someone's attention but they were running round so much it was near impossible. At one point our waiter looked at our table and walked off to the kitchen, we assumed to see where they were but 15 minutes later after waiting 45 minutes we left without telling anyone as we had a train to catch and there was nobody around to let them know.

We were so disappointed. Mistakes happen we know but the croissant I had to eat at Liverpool street in no way made up for missing my breakfast.",4,2013,12,03
113,"Great Location, Great Staff","Seriously - this is an awesome hotel with a great staff and very comfortable location. Short walk to Hyde Park, museums right around the corner, tons of food nearby, Kensington Station down the block - really was happy to have gotten to stay here.",5,2013,12,02
113,Warm Toast to All,"I often stay in this hotel when I am on business in London.

I like it because it is convenient and the staff are always friendly and courteous .

I was amused to read about the complaint about toast arriving too early to the breakfast table - maybe we could start putting our toast orders in on arrival to avoid disappointment! come on now let's keep it real x ColinD",5,2013,12,02
113,Fantabulious lunch at Aubrey Restaurant,"I recently had lunch with a friend at Aubrey Restaurant. As I work in hospitality I can be rather finicky whenever I go out, but I honestly couldn't say one bad thing. The food was amazing, I had Scallops followed by the Butternut squash salad, it was fresh and flavourful. The service was efficient and knowledgeable. I couldn't have asked for a better meal. I would definitely come back!",5,2013,12,01
113,Excellent hotel,"Stayed for one night as part of a theatre trip weekend away. Received a very friendly welcome on arrival at 11am. We were allowed to check in and store our bags in the room before we went sightseeing. Room very clean and comfortable. The bed was extremely comfortable. when we returned to our room after 11pm we found complimentary raspberries, blueberries, pear and a plum. A flask of green tea and shortbread biscuits. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. we will definately stay there again. hotel is very nice and in a lovely location.",5,2013,11,30
113,Lovely hotel with great service,"It really says something about a hotel when your biggest complaint is that the night porter was a little grumpy. This is a lovely hotel, great service, fantastic food and gorgeous rooms. The staff couldn't do enough to please us and even upgraded us to a suite as we are members of GHA (the group this hotel belongs to.)
Highly recommended. 
",5,2013,11,28
113,"by day 3, it had become an irritation.....","A friend and I stayed in this hotel in November for 3 nights. The Hotel is very nice, I loved the public spaces and the service was very good and very friendly. It does feel pretty much like a 'Townhouse' rather than a hotel which is a good thing. It is perfectly located and is very convenient to the South Kensington Tube station. The room we had, 424, is small but perfectly formed, the en-suite bathroom is very small but very well thought out and very well equipped for such a small space. The only issue I had with the room was the lack of storage space - I had to use my bed side table drawers to store some clothes, but not really a major issue for me. I have read many of the other reviews posted here and see that several draw attention to the fact that when you arrive for breakfast, the toast and coffee/tea arrive far too early - I, like many others, enjoy my toast freshly toasted & hot, in this hotel it is served with haste. I have noted that on this site, the manager is gracious in the response given to reviews and a promise is made to address the issues raised - all commendable - however the toast issue is, of itself, a minor issue but by day 3 it had become an irritant .......all the staff have to do is ask each client if they would like their toast now or later! I enjoyed lunch in the hotel restaurant on one of the days I stayed here.  Good location, very comfortable and warm, welcoming staff, very courteous and obliging. I will, most certainly, stay here again.",5,2013,11,28
113,The perfect Irish experience,"After our holiday in London at the Kensington hotel, I can honestly say it was an excellent stay in all aspects. Our room was well presented with a couple of bottles of drinking water and fresh towels. The concierge Martin recommended us to good restaurants around Kensington and a must see attractions in London. The Kensington suburb is a nice place with boutiques, leafy trees, and museums just a short walk away. The next morning we were spoilt for choice with a big breakfast and a selection of cold buffet and to top the icing on the cake is Aladin and George who served us and made sure we enjoyed our breakfast.  I‚Äôll miss my London home but I look forward to coming back soon",5,2013,11,27
113,Just got back from a fab break at the Kensington,"My daughter and I have just spent 2 days at the Kensington hotel it was wonderful from start to
finish. Staff were so friendly and helpful room 409 was huge and very clean. The bathroom was
large and luxurious. Couldn't fault the location as it had everything one could need around the corner from the tube to great bars and shops. There was mulled wine on arrival and the staff were always smiling and seemed happy at work!! I cannot wait to go back. London is expensive and bar and food bills will always be just that!!  Waitrose and tesco express are just around the corner if you want to go back to the room and eat and drink. Our breakfast was beautifully cooked and well presented and nothing was too much trouble in the restaurant. Thank you to the Kensington Hotel.",5,2013,11,27
113,"Lovely hotel, super staff","Stayed here for two nights last weekend, gorgeous hotel on a beautiful street in Kensington, Staff were so friendly and helpful. Room was little small but perfect.Tube station only 7/8 minutes walk away, ideal place to stay for a weekend break.",5,2013,11,26
113,Excellent location and staff.,"All the staff we met here were very friendly and helpful. Concierge were excellent and had a good sense of humour.
Breakfast was well cooked and with plenty of choice. 
Afternoon Champagne Tea was memorable and the setting is cosy and relaxing. 
Only a slight gripe was the size of the room. I know its London but we had a 'Superior Room' which had about nine inches between the end of the bed and the wardrobe which one had to shimmy through to get to the other end of the room. We managed okay but anyone infirm may struggle (room 333). The room itself was very clean and actually very quiet overnight. Bed was a joy, good bedding and  very cosy.
Overall an excellent stay and we will come here again next time in London.",5,2013,11,26
113,Amazing afternoon tea,"I have been to afternoon tea at many places in London, but the experience at this hotel was exceptional.
Food was delicious, the presentation was expert and the service was outstanding, especially from our server and host George. The hotel seemed to be busy at the time with brisk movement of people and the staff all afternoon. We had a lovely selection of sandwiches, the plain and raising scones were freshly made, with a selection of homemade strawberry jam and clotted cream. Overall it was a lovely time at the Kensington.",5,2013,11,25
113,Another Gem from The Doyle Collection,The is a great hotel offering the same high quality as the others in the DC chain. Staff are friendly and helpful making our stay sublime. Food is very good as is breakfast. Look out for the great deals they do so worth signing up for their email or going online regularly. We have now stayed in all their uk hotels and despite a few teething troubles early on at The Bristol they all offer tremendous value for money.  ,5,2013,11,24
113,Brilliant afternoon tea,"Went for afternoon tea and was not disappointed. Delicious sandwiches and scones followed by an amazing array of tasty desserts. Our waiter, George, was fantastic and made the afternoon very memorable. Good for celeb spots as well! Would definitely recommend.",5,2013,11,24
113,Excellent hotel for a break in London,"I can highly recommend this delightful hotel in South Kensington. Relaxed luxury.  Welcoming lounges and restaurant. Helpful, friendly staff from reception to the restaurant and bar. Very helpful concierge.
We enjoyed two lovely meals in the restaurant as well as a delicious breakfast. Our room was small but adequate, if slightly too hot, and the bathroom, again small was well equipped. Very clean. Comfortable bed. Complimentary fruit on arrival as well as bottled water.
Located close to South Kensington tube station with The Natural History Museum and V and A within close walking distance as well. A short walk from Kings Road and Knightsbridge.
This a great place to stay for a relaxing London break.",5,2013,11,23
113,My experience in the Kensington Hotel,"I accompanies my wife on her duty and stayed in the Kensington Hotel for one night, I was very impressed from the friendliness and warm welcoming from the stuff members. 
The meal was excellent the service very professional. I enjoyed the atmosphere in the restaurant the lighting...very romantic.
I had a great sleep I loved the bed very conformable.",5,2013,11,23
113,An excellent Hotel for any discerning visitor to London,"We stayed here for 2 nights recently. This is pure quality. The facilities are 5 star but what makes the Kensington stand out is the lovely warm, intimate feel to it and the friendliness and professionalism of the staff including the manager. We loved the location as well, nice and quiet   with some lovely places to eat nearby and a couple of minutes walk to the Tube. We wouldn't consider staying anywhere else in London. Can't wait to go back!",5,2013,11,22
113,Outrageously expensive drinks,"The Kensington Hotel is elegant in a great location, with attractive d√©cor. But I was taken aback to be charged ¬£32 for a double vodka in the downstairs bar which was empty. At those prices I'm not surprised. It appears that the price of a drink is more than many salubrious West end hotels London. Otherwise it is a welcome addition in a great part of town.",2,2013,11,22
113,Elegant English luxury,"A real elegant, luxury hotel, care of everything, but not a disturbing way. Stylish, classic furnished rooms, however some are too small (especially bathroom), and some are without any view. The room was changed upon request. Staff very kind and friendly, always helpful. Breakfast great and in a lovely area, just chicken salami missing, but the home made joghurt and fruits are excellent. Loved the afternoon tea, and the romantic envoriment in the saloon, with open fire place and candle light. Location perfect, walking distance from the best museums and Harrods.",5,2013,11,22
113,"Great location, great service","The location of the hotel is excellent , a lot of nice restaurants around it. The service at the cafe of the hotel is great, George was really helpful and paid great attention to us. The rooms are quite small, but the quality offered is really good. Overall, a very nice hotel and holiday.",5,2013,11,22
113,"Excellent service, good location","We stayed at The Kensington Hotel for two nights, and would be more than happy to go back. At our arrival we were upgraded to a Studio Suite - a very pleasant surprise. The room was great, big and cosy, with a nice and spacious bathroom. The service was also great, and I especially loved the thermos with mint tea and the biscuits we found in our room at night. The underground, Harrods and Harvey Nichols are all in walking distance, as well as Le Pain Quotidien.",5,2013,11,21
113,Amazing,My wife and I stayed here two weekends ago. From start to finish it was a marvellous experience.  The hotel is small and boutique like and has such a cosy and welcoming atmosphere. It is also so well located. Our room was very spacious and beautifully equipped. The espresso machine was a great touch.The bathroom with separate walk in shower room was spotlessly clean. The breakfast was beautiful (the buffet and the hot breakfast) and the dining staff were attentive and very helpful. We had a drink in the bar one night which again was perfect. The bar man introduced himself at the start took our order and was unobtrusive thereafter. The concierge gave us very good local restaurant recommendations. All the staff were so polite and friendly and nothing was too great an effort. This level of service and friendliness is what sets the Kensington apart. I would recommend the Kensington without hesitation and will stay here again...hopefully very soon.,5,2013,11,21
113,Somewhat Disappointing,"The only three reasons why I booked this hotel were the location, the 5 star rating and its relative affordability for the area. I wanted something nice for our first wedding anniversary. Immediately after I booked the hotel I noticed many reviewers were saying the rooms were small. Had I read this first I would not have booked this hotel. Indeed the room was small, not the smallest hotel room I've stayed in but for the price and star rating of the hotel I'd say the room was indeed too small but we managed in the end. Bathrobes supplied, slippers, plenty of towels, even umbrella which you can use. A little note with the turn down service informing you of weather, nice touches. I still managed to wow the misses but next time it will be better and better researched.

We liked the decor and many of the staff at the hotel were friendly and did make you feel like you were in a 5 star hotel. George is a great waiter and very friendly. 

Hotel room was clean no question, and turn down service nice and thoughtful. 

The downstairs atmosphere and fire places are lovely and it's a nice area for a drink, though very expensive we found. 

They tried to double charge me for breakfast on the first morning and all that seemed a bit amateuristic since I paid up front for breakfast for all 3 mornings at check in. Breakfast overpriced as well. Breakfast is a little bit hectic with toast coming out to the table before they even take your order for hot food. Also the order wasn't quite right one morning but fair enough it was all quite tasty and their restaurant in the evening definitely worth a try.

Some issues with the room: toilet seat didn't stay up, no toilet brush, shower leaked (no bath btw), room was cold during the day and heating didn't seem to come on. Keycards didn't work on second day so had to get replacements from reception, only to find maid had left her key card in the light-slot which may have been the reason I guess. The staff member who escorted me to the room with the replacement keycards didn't seem to want to make conversation but instead was more interested in his hairstyle in the elevator mirrors (rather awkward elevator ride!). 

Two out of the 4 supplied milk tubs were off on the first day. Thus didn't bother with any further hot drinks in the room. Have seen hot drinks facilities a lot better in lesser star hotels but there was a coffee maker. No bin supplied in the room, though there was a tiny one in the bathroom /ensuite. Very few power sockets, but this is nothing unusual I guess. Strange mini bar which you cannot use for your own drinks or milk or anything.

Weird behaviour from a maid who was cleaning the room on the first afternoon we came back to the hotel, she locked the door when I was checking she was in there to ask how much longer she would be. 

I'll pick another hotel next time. Rather stay further away from the city centre with a bigger room than go back here.",2,2013,11,21
113,STUNNING HOTEL,"We stayed at this stunning hotel for a long weekend in October 2013. The rooms were fabulous, clean and luxurious. Location is perfect, all of the staff were extremely helpful, friendly and professional. The concierge went out of his way to assist with every request that we had, which made our stay perfect. We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and would certainly class it as one of the best Hotels in London!!!",5,2013,11,21
113,Fantastic stay,"All the staff were superb and extremely helpful and polite. The rooms were extremely comfortable and well equipped. The bar was brilliant and the restaurant superb. I will use again and again. 
The concierge sorted everything we asked for and the welcome back in the evening was grand, and the open fires welcoming. 
If you need refrigerated storage ask and it will be provided. Don't give one star reviews based on stupidity!!",5,2013,11,18
113,Birthday weekend,"Marvelous hotel, outstanding high tea, small but comfortable room all the usual touches but felt special. Forgot the paper but sorted over breakfast. Close to our final destination. Staff all very friendly and helpful and attentive.",5,2013,11,17
113,Best Hotel in London,"The Kensington has all the ingredients that go to make a great hotel - excellent location, lovely relaxing public areas, beautifully equipped bedrooms and fabulous food. However the one thing that sets it apart is the consistently high quality of service the staff deliver. Every member of staff is totally focused on making your stay as enjoyable as possible. It is so nice to receive ""is there anything I can do to help you?"" delivered with a genuine desire to do just that. The standard never drops whatever the changes in staff, wherever you are in the hotel, whatever the time of day.

That is what makes The Kensington the best hotel in London.",5,2013,11,16
113,Never Again!,"I stayed with family for 3 nights in November. Location, staff and rooms all very good. I especially appreciated the walk in shower rather than those cheap over the bath showers. So why one star and ""Never Again""? The stupid fridges in the rooms. They are designed to prevent you storing your own drinks. I could not keep the fresh milk I bought chilled. None of us had seen fridges like this and we all out of curiosity removed a drinks can that could not be replaced due to the security system on the fridge. The cans were not consumed and were left on top of the fridge. On check out the hotel wanted to charge us for these drinks!. The hotel is part of the Irish based Doyle Group. Perhaps the management has become infected by Ryanair's approach to customer care. As I said, never again and I will check in future to ensure no other hotel I book has these idiot fridges. Lesson learnt.",1,2013,11,16
113,Great stay,"The hotel is amazing !! Amazing lobby and restaurants !! The rooms are clean and comfortable!! The waiters are very kind specially Georges!! Hes very nice :) 
I enjoyed my stay so much and the hotel has a very good location not far from harrods and harvey nichols and the train station... Lots of cafes and boutiques around.. I recommend this hotel to every person visiting london :) ",5,2013,11,13
113,Very much service,"Fantastic location, excellent service, in letting us use an other room whilst waiting for our room and keeping our bags in storage. Lovely porters, very helpful. I shall definitely return with my family.",5,2013,11,13
113,Afternoon Tea,"The afternoon tea is delightful!The sandwiches were very tasty,and the scones were delicious.We all enjoyed the gin and tonic sorbet,Service was very good,just the right mixture of attention to detail without being in any way intrusive. Our waiter George was lovely.very professional and helpful. Will definitely go back again.",5,2013,11,11
113,My favorite hotel in London,"Beautiful hotel, classic and modern at the same time, and ueber stylish without been pretentious. Rooms are delightful and the little touches - for example, turn service in the evening accompanied by a lovely retro thermos of tea - are a real joy.

Breakfast is delicious. Personnel is friendly and personable, and extremely professional at the same time. The real gem is George at the restaurant!",5,2013,11,10
113,A Very Pleasant Stay,"We were celebrating our Wedding Anniversary and chose this hotel as it was near to the places we wanted to visit. The hotel is approx. 10 minutes walk from South Kensington tube station. We arrived in reception and welcomed by staff, we had to wait for 20 minutes as our room was not ready, we were told we could have an upgrade as were staying for more than three nights. The room was on the 5th floor, was quiet and pleasant enough but not massive and we were greeted with bottled water and fruit.  The bathroom was large with a shower and bath. The room was very clean.  I would have liked to have had a small fridge so that I could kept cool some of  the food items I purchased when out shopping.The cleaning service was a bit hit and miss, on one particular day we had been out all day and just wanted to go back to our rooms for a rest but on arriving we were locked out of our room, our room had not been cleaned and the cleaning woman was just about to do embark on cleaning, this wasn't a huge problem but we would have preferred to have had the room cleaned before we arrived back. The cleaning woman told us we should have put the sign out on the door. A similar thing happened the following day when we were trying to pack and check out. There appeared to be a lack of communication between the cleaning staff and the hotel. In general the hotel staff were very welcoming. We ate dinner in the hotel one evening and the food was OK. There was a gym in the hotel but we did not use this.  In all we enjoyed our stay and I would recommend this hotel.",4,2013,11,09
113,nice hideaway in kensington,"I stayed at the kensington hotel after reading the numerous good reviews the place looks to have undergone a refurbishment recently all done very well. I stayed on the room facing the leafy queens gate street and had a wonderful view. I had a massive bed that has got to be the most comfiest that i have ever slept in so far, staff are very professional and knew how to make you feel welcome like Aladine on breakfast and  also the reception when checking out. The hotel is close to many museums and a short walk to Knightsbridge, lots of good restaurants nearby less than 5 minutes walk. i had a nice stay and I'll definitely stay here again.",5,2013,11,09
113,my new fav hotel - warm and cozy refined elegance,"I typically stay at the Morgans hotel group of hotels (sanderson/st. martins lane.) Staying at The Kensington was out of my comfort range as I typically go for uber modern and sleek. This trip, I opted to stay in Kensington for proximity to an event I was attending and I was so not disappointed. I love this hotel. It completely relaxed me after hectic days and nights roaming around London. It reminds me of staying in the guest room of a grand home of a relative but with modern updates. The staff were super attentive- I received early check in and a room upgrade. They addressed any minor problem I had in the room immediately. The shower was amazing, bathroom updated, bed really comfortable. The lounge downstairs is a perfect place to meet up with friends or read the paper and have a drink or coffee. I would highly recommend this hotel - great location to museums/park and tube. And mostly, the staff really care about you having a great stay.",4,2013,11,08
113,Pretty good until checkout,"We had a deluxe queen that was quiet and fairly large, but with a tiny bathroom.  Location was convenient for sightseeing and dinner.  The turndown service was able to replace all the towels correctly only 2 out of 4 nights.  Breakfast was convenient but expensive, and the staff was slow to clear empty plates and bring the bill.

I checked out with my US credit card and, when I was given the paper to sign, I said to the clerk that I wanted my card charged in pounds.  He told me it was, but when I got home I found out that wasn't true and that the exchange rate was much worse.  I contacted the hotel and got no response, but got my money back through the credit card company.",1,2013,11,06
113,Recent Visit,"Excellent hotel, very attentive staff, warm ambience, relaxing in front of open fire reading a paper. Really enjoyable stay, rooms were spotless, food delightful, and the cocktails in the bar went down a treat. Very central location. It is my home from home, I'll be back",5,2013,11,06
113,Traditional Afternoon Tea at its Best!,"Some friends and I (including a child of 8) booked afternoon tea and it was a sumptuous experience. Log fires burning, doorman taking the coats, exquisite bathrooms with individual towels for drying hands plus rose-scented creams. We sat on luxurious sofas and were served by our own personal waiter who took care of us for the next hour and a half. The tea-menu was extensive with all sorts of brews on offer, once we had chosen our teas our waiter unfolded large, square, white cotton serviettes and placed them carefully on each of our laps. We were then brought trays of tiny sandwiches, 5 each with different fillings served on varying breads. The waiter used silver tongs and placed the sandwiches on our china plates. Then followed a gin & tonic sorbet (passion fruit for the child), then came hot, crumbly scones with clotted cream, lemon curd and raspberry jam. If that wasn't enough two silver, tiered cake stands were presented to us brimming with little deadlies. Chocolate mouse; pavlovas; hazelnut; tiny lemon tartlets. We couldn't fit it all it but it was heavenly. My advice is don't eat a big lunch beforehand and don't rush the tea. The waiter is laid-back and you are quite a liberty to loll about on those sofas listening to the jazz and indulging yourself with a proper English tea after a hectic stomp round the shops.",5,2013,11,05
113,"High quality, elegant, perfectly located!","Stayed for a couple of days while visiting London during a business trip. The area is perfect and the hotel's location is pretty much one of the best you can get. Close to subway and bus stations. Plus, around the hotel you have every cafe, restaurant, bar, and shop imaginable. Very safe area and excellent to walk around. Expensive for sure but London is expensive overall. You cannot hide from the high prices in this city, no matter where you go.

The hotel was nice, high class with very educated and helpful staff. The rooms are equipped with great technology and all kinds of outlets (US, UK, etc.). The bathroom floor is heated, which was a beautiful surprise. The hotel is not cheap, that is for sure, but it is definitely good. Will stay here again if I can manage to get a deal like I did on this past trip.",4,2013,11,04
113,So far so good,"We are enjoying our second night of our seven nights stay in London.  Upon our arrival yesterday, we were warmly and enthusiastically greeted by Martin, the concierge who later answered some of our questions before we started out to explore the city.  Since we got to the hotel early in the morning due to an overnight flight from the States, we were pleasantly surprised that the front desk staff had a room available before our official check-in time.  The staff were very professional and good at their jobs especially our waiter George.  We enjoyed this evening's snacks and drink in the lovely lounge.",4,2013,11,03
113,Amazing staff,"The hotel was great and the staff was amazing. They couldn't be more friendly and helpful. They truly cherish their guests.
The restaraunt for dinner was fantastic. And the location was perfect for my needs. 
      
      
      
      ",5,2013,11,03
113,"Brilliant service, lovely location, beautiful lounge","The staff here are the icing on a rather delightful cake. Attentive service with a smile is de rigueur. Special thanks to George in the lobby bar and Paul on reception for making me feel right at home and attending to my various requests.

The lobby lounge with its fires and luxe English decor is a beautiful place to relax. 

Pretty decent gym, breakfast no complaints.

My 'superior double' room was fine, it could have done with a little more decoration on the walls, but then I am fairly fussy about these things :)  oh and note to management - a mini bar without alcohol isn't much fun! 

Definitely would recommend this hotel. ",4,2013,11,03
113,Incredible High Tea Experience,"On a whim, we booked at The Kensington Hotel for an afternoon high tea session and it was one of the best things we did in London. The staff were incredible (particularly our waiter George) - they went above and beyond our expectations, even providing us with an umbrella as the weather had turned when we were leaving. The food was incredible - both taste and presentation. There was an amazing selection of savoury and sweet treats, with unlimited tea to compliment it. Mind blowing afternoon...if we had more time, we'd go back again!!",5,2013,11,01
113,TRYING TERRIBLY HARD...,"We stayed at The Kensington for one night as a treat - not having to drive home after a meal!  It's well decorated (a bit over decorated for my taste but nonetheless...), immaculately clean in all areas, and the staff were, without exception delightful.  Lots of little extras like the chap on the door feeding the parking machine for us, a bottle of water each on departure, lovely snacks in the room and jasmine tea before bed.  It was an amazing deal pricewise - ¬£198, an additional ¬£13 and breakfast was included - and a ¬£10 money off voucher and an upgrade...which meant full breakfast for two cost the grand sum of ¬£3.  They forgot our order but still..the thought was there!  Having said all this, we won't unfortunately be going back because the bed was incredibly uncomfortable, the shower was only about 50cms wide, and it was incredibly noisy - traffic noise, fridge noise, builders noise...  A shame but there you go!",4,2013,10,31
113,Another Satisfied Customer,"Just back from my stay at the Kensington - once again the standard of service was first class. A special mention for George for the attentive service and Martin the Consierge for being as helpful as ever. This hotel never fails to impress .

113,"Nice hotel, lobby, and very good location... But quite expensive","I really like the location of this hotel, very nice staff, lobby. Rooms not bad, nice decoration. Its really few steps from nationak history museum, v&a museum, and nice streets like kings road fulham road... The only problem is that its expensive, probably more expensive than other very decent hotels around... But all in all a good experience",4,2013,10,31
113,Cream tea in style,"Booked a cream tea via afternoon tea.com which came with free glass of champagne.  Great experience we were shown to a very nice lounge area with burning fire, mix of modern and traditional sofa and old fashioned pictures on the wall great.  The staff were very well presented and very attentive.  We ordered the afternoon tea for myself and wife and scones, jam and cream for son.  Good choice of teas beautifully presented sandwiches, scones and cake.  All items were very fresh, home made and very original making use of different breads, types of scones and beautifully presented cakes.  service was good throughout with just the correct balance of attention and privacy.

113,Tries hard but noisy and lacks real comfort,"We stayed here for one night and on arrival had an excellent welcome. We were upgraded free of charge, were given an amazing deal on the price of the room, breakfast and free cocktail in the bar. Our car was taken care of and parked on the street for much less than the cost of the NCP. However the rooms were a little soulless with no pictures and poor details like no fresh milk and not enough UHT for the tea and coffee. Our room also suffered from being on the corner and continuos road noise throughout the night. on top of this the fridge was faulty and rattled all night. At breakfast the waiter took our order without pen and paper and needless to say it was forgotten about and was half an hour late. then when it did arrive it was wrong and had to be sent back. Staff were friendly and the hotel offers good value for central London but I wouldn't stay here again.",2,2013,10,31
113,Afternoon Tea,"Afternoon tea at The Kensington Hotel's Aubrey Restaurant is wonderful. The sandwiches, scones and cakes are absolutely delicious and the atmosphere was relaxed and welcoming. The staff are courteous and attentive, especially our smiling waiter George. The perfect way to end a visit to the Museums. Affordable luxury and excellent value. Highly recommended.",5,2013,10,30
113,"Excellent luxury-feel ambiance, clean, quiet","The hotel is very clean and very well maintained. When entering the hotel you are welcomed by a lovely smell of lavender, as there are aromatherapy candles lit throughout the hotel; that adds to a sense of cleanliness and puts the guest at ease. 
The ambiance is excellent and there is a luxury feel to it, with lit fires in each hall room which makes having a lovely cup of tea or drink even more enjoyable and cosy. The bar area is also very good, and the cocktails are lovely even for those who do not particuarly enjoy alcohol. 
The night concierge is beyond friendly and very helpful.
The rooms are ok although quite small: the bathroom was very clean with good quality products in it but it was extremely small (2 average-sized people struggle to be in at the same time). 
The breakfast selection was great, very varied and of good quality. 
Only negative side: for each day we were there, the breakfast orders were mixed up or incorrectly served, and we could hear other tables loudly complaining about the same type of issues. It seemed there was either lack of co-ordination in the kitchen or very poor communication between the staff, part of which seemed inexperienced.
Overall, very good hotel!",4,2013,10,30
113,Super hotel and staff!,"Location:
Ideal location for the Victoria & Albert, Natural History and the Science Museums, all of which are World class. There are various restaurants, bars and cafes all of which seem good quality and cover a wide range of budgets. South Kensington underground station is also just a few mins walk and there are two stunning ice cream parlours which you should also try!

Rooms:
The two rooms we occupied were both immaculate and bathrooms sparkling clean. Air-con worked fantastically well. Well stocked minibar. Beds are quite large and comfortable. The good quality lighting adds to the premium feel of the room.

Staff:
Immaculately turned out. Extremely polite and professional but also very friendly and helpful. A good balance like this is hard to find. Well done! 

Overall thoughts:
Definitely a good hotel in a good location and one I will definitely be using for future London trips.

Well done everyone at the Kensington Hotel!",5,2013,10,29
113,Good hotel in a good part of town,"This hotel has a quality feel and is in a good part of town: just a few minutes walk from South Kensington tube with has plenty of good restaurants.  Had an evening meal, which was OK although the portion size could have been more generous for the gentleman guest.  The breakfast however is a bountiful feast apart from the coffee, which was weaker than mellow birds!  The room was on the smaller size but with nice decor and a quality bathroom with expensive fittings.  The staff were helpful and polite and I wouldn't hesitate to stay again.",4,2013,10,28
113,all good - then came breakfast,"well what a pleasant surprise straight in to reception quick straight forward check in.Room nice and clean if a little small but for once not over looking the airconditioning. Slightly skimpy tea/coffee facilities but there we are. one recommendation do not book standard room if you are overweight, youd have not a hope in hell of getting in and out of bath/shower, couldnt swing a cat in there.Beautiful lounge/bar seating area. Everything otherwise very high standard then came breakfast..... slighty poorly presented continental food bar. was no explanation given as to whether you could eat from there if youd booked for full breakfast, we opted for full english what could be difficult about that ? you know bacon eggs etc.....toast presented approx 15 mins before food arrived and also tea, had finished that while waiting had to keep requesting butter for toast such a mean amount almost thought there'd been rationing.Eventually came full english barely warm on a cold plate.Er presented this back to staff brought it back a couple of mins later and hey presto still cold! What was it they didnt understand here then. Spoilt the stay on that basis as always look forward to the brekkie its such a simple meal isnt it? would make me hesitant to book for food there. If the kitchen fails the simplest meal of the day al a carte would be like the krypton factor to them shame cos brilliant location and all very pleasant otherwise.",3,2013,10,27
113,Centrally located and extremely comfortable,"We stayed here for 2 nights on a quick visit to London and loved this hotel!  Perfect location in the heart of Kensington, close to Chelsea and Knightsbridge.  Large and comfortable room ready upon arrival.  Can't wait to visit again!",5,2013,10,22
113,Classy - Afternoon Tea,"Afternoon tea at The Kensington Hotel was something to savour.  The venue, decor and service of the staff were exactly what you'd expect of a premier location in London, however the service from George our personal waiter was exquisite.  An absolute Gentleman with a wonderful and personable nature complemented a delicious selection of sandwiches, scones, desserts, champagne (and other drinks) perfectly.

I'd recommend afternoon tea here any day.",5,2013,10,21
113,Top Class Service Made Our Stay Even Better,"This hotel is in a great location, located within walking distance of museums, restaurants and South Kensington tube station. Our room was small but nicely decorated and more than suited our needs, although the bathroom was very small and didn't have a bath. The restaurant, bar and foyer areas of the hotel were very comfortable and had a nice ambiance conducive to whiling away the day drinking coffee, reading the complimentary newspapers and watching the world go by!
The staff were all very professional, courteous and helpful and made us feel very welcome with nice touches such as greeting us by name and remembering details such as which sites we had mentioned we were planning to visit.

The selection and quality of the food and beverages was excellent. Breakfast each day was a feast with a wide choice of options both in the continental buffet and hot food. Dinner was excellent with an interesting menu and a good wine list. Afternoon tea was a decadent treat on our last day.

Overall the service was exemplary and a few notches above other hotels I have visited recently. I really liked the extra touches such as the turndown service, weather forecast for the following day, Irish newspapers and complimentary bottle of water on checkout.

I will definitely stay here again next time I'm in London and will be checking out some of their other hotels too.",5,2013,10,21
113,Outstanding Service,"I recently stayed seven nights in this delightful hotel in South Kensington. While the hotel is furnished to a high standard it the service which marks it out. From the time I arrived the staff at reception, the bar and restaurant staff and  especially Michel, the restaurant and bar supervisor, made a point of remembering and referring to me by name each time they saw me. Their friendliness and cheerful welcomes and readiness to stop and chat added a sense of warm hospitality to my stay which I have not experienced in a London hotel for quite some time. While the Superior rooms are small, they are fully equipped and I was very pleased to be upgraded to a wonderful Studio Suite for the weekend. The ground floor lobby, bar, restaurant and reception rooms are grand but warm and welcoming. The Continental breakfast is extensive, imaginative and more than adequate. I look forward to returning soon.",5,2013,10,21
113,Amazing. We didn't want to leave.,"We were lucky enough to have the Brompton Suite (Presidential Suite).  Large, lux, deep reds, huge Victorian bath, enormous bed. Hallway, sitting room, bedroom and bathroom, not far off the size of our flat.  We had cocktails in the spacious lounge (but felt snug) area in front of a fire in large squashy leather armchairs, and an excellent breakfast. Choice of cooked and/continental. Frankly the latter is so extensive/generous we didn't need the former.  Loads of varied restaurants nearby (all walking distance) as are museums and Kensington High St/kensington Palace.  We really did not want to leave. Within seconds of opening the door to the suite we felt we were a million miles from our everyday realities and stress.  Treat yourself!",5,2013,10,20
113,Afternoon High Tea,"My wife booked a surprise treat for afternoon High Tea! From the minute we arrived, the service was excellent! Our host George for the afternoon was very professional, polite, catered for all our needs and made the afternoon very special! He is a credit to your hotel! The sandwiches, champagne, tea and not forgetting the desserts, were great! We were so full from that! I would definitely  recommend the hotel for afternoon tea, the warmth around the whole place just made it so cosy an relaxed!  Thanks Mr & Mrs Patel",4,2013,10,20
113,the only hotel I want to stay in when I visit London,"I visit London at least once or twice a month for work, and the Kensington is my first choice every time. It's friendly, not too expensive, but it's the service and quality of the staff that makes each visit exceptional 

The rooms are not huge but I think they're pretty adequately sized, very comfortable, and beautifully finished. Perhaps the more expensive rooms are bigger, but the suites are really nice. 

Great little touches, like every evening there is a little note on your pillow telling you about the next day's weather, and of course with some chocolates

When you check in, you're greeted with a friendly welcome, and there's always a hot towel for your hands and on the way out there's a bottle of water waiting for you. Little touches make the difference. But yesterday when I checked in, it was slightly later and there was milk and cookies waiting for me in the room! Top service! 

I've eaten in the restaurant a few times (something I seldom do in hotels, as the food's often just average), and the food's great. A few of my work colleagues also stayed, and we had a three course meal (I had a steak - amazing) and it was a lovely meal, with great service

This year alone I've been to Milan, Madrid, Barcelona, Malaga, Gibraltar, Tel Aviv, Manila, Sofia and this is my favourite hotel of all the trips in all the cities.",5,2013,10,18
113,Nice stay Brilliant service,"Stayed recently at this beautiful hotel.Great location,only 5 minute walk from Gloucester road station.Little bit expensive but its worth it for the most part.Enjoyed a fabulous room service in the morning as I wasn't feeling the best.Was delivered perfectly by Francesco who was very helpful throughout our stay. Overall it was a great experience in london however we would appreciate if the rates were a little lower.",5,2013,10,17
113,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed at this lovely hotel for a long weekend not so long ago with some friends. The location is very good, only two minutes from the tube station, and from there it is easy to get to all the main attractions around London. The rooms are a bit small, but for my short stay it was no problem. The best aspect about this hotel is the wonderful service, one server in particular who made my stay so pleasant was Greg. He was very friendly but also very professional. He always welcomed us at breakfast with a smile and ensured we were very well taken care of. Would definitely return to this hotel after the great service I received!",5,2013,10,16
113,Wonderful Place to stay,Had a lovely stay here. Service was excellent. Our waiter was Greg and if i do say so myself he was very charming and attentive. He made our stay at the Kingsinton Hotel very pleasant. The location of the hotel was very convenient for all our site seeing around London. The rooms were very cosy and  roomy. Overall a lovely stay.,5,2013,10,16
113,"Excellent space, service and ambiance.","I met a friend here for a drink this evening, I arrived early and had some time to kill. 
The lounge bar was an excellent spot for me to get on top of some work. Overall the sensory experience was top notch.
Lighting, sound, perfume, decor, comfort and service all succeeded my expectations.
Most helpful of all was George a.k.a George Clooney ;) who was kind, generous and highly professional throughout the evening.
I recommend hiding here as the winter months begin to grow in presence! 

A really lovely start to my evening.",5,2013,10,15
113,Great Location,"Yes location is everything and this is a short stroll from South Kensington tube station (you walk up the Cromwell Road and its round the corner).
It is within walking distance to the V&A, Natural History Museum and slightly further Harrods.
We had a superior room and yes it isn't the biggest but it had everything you need and was comfortable and kept to a high standard throughout our stay.
The Aubrey restaurant is rather cosy and quite relaxing compared to some of the local ""squeeze in as many as poss"" establishments. Although I booked our meal through Toptable.com as they were doing a set meal with wine for ¬£50 per couple, you may want to do this as wine starts at ¬£25 so this was by far a better deal.
Hubby went for pint in the bar whilst I was getting ready and well they don't serve pints (lager by the glass at ¬£5) I guess it is to keep the riff raff out, but we were delighted with the ""mini Waitrose"" round the corner which has a well stocked chiller cabinet with bottles of Champagne for ¬£20, wine for ¬£5 and beers etc, this was also handy for the sandwiches to take as packed lunches. There is also a Tesco Express, countless cafes and a personal favourite ""The Hummingbird Bakery"" which is delish! 
My only gripe with The Kensington was some of the other guests felt the need to slam doors and smoke in their rooms which you could smell wafting under the door, the hotel could try adjusting the door springs to keep this to a minimum. There was not much noise street wise, which was great.
There is a kettle with tea, coffee and shortbread, mini bar is useless, pop round to Waitrose for drinks for the room, hairdryer, mini sewing kit etc. A safe, tv and everything you would expect.
Staff were polite and cheery.",4,2013,10,15
113,Nice stay best service,"We love this hotel! The decoration is wonderful, the lobby is very cozy, we love to spend afternoons working there. Had little problems with lack of hot water at some point during our last stay, but the hotel offers great service overall. Our very favourite, someone who helps make this place so special : George! George is the most kind, helpful waiter one could wish for, always a word to cheer up your day, his thoughtful and caring approach really made our stay memorable.",5,2013,10,13
113,Afternoon Tea,"My wife and I took her mother down to London for her 70th birthday and we pre-booked afternoon tea at The Kensington Hotel. The place itself lived up to all expectations. A stunning building, beautifully decorated and furnished to a high standard. The staff were excellent from start to finish and had a great balance between formality and friendliness which really added to the experience. The Afternoon Tea was lovely with plenty of choice and variety. Everything was really delicious and well presented and we only wished we had given ourselves more time as we couldn't manage to eat everything in the hour and a half we had before we had to leave to head back to Kingscross. An experience we will definitely repeat. Thank you to all the staff who looked after us on the day.",5,2013,10,10
113,"Excellent Hotel, Excellent Location","My wife and I stayed at the Kensington in late September 2013 at the recommendation of our travel agent and were very pleased from the initial greeting at the front desk, the wait staff in the bar, the room attendants and the concierge who recommended some excellent restaurants within easy walking distance. Every staff member we encountered tried their best to make our stay perfect and seemed genuinely pleased to help wherever they could.  Every time we passed a staff member, we were cordially greeted.  Something to be aware of: some of the rooms are small, which is well outlined on the hotel's website and prospective travellers would be well advised to consider.  We didn't spend a lot of time in our room, so it didn't concern us, but if this bothers you, please opt for a bigger room.  Our room was well appointed and the shower was wonderful -- worth the price of the room alone.  Also the bed was incredibly comfortable and the sheets were very soft.  We had a problem with the drains in our shower and our bathroom sink, but I'm pleased to advise that these were fixed very quickly. We also asked to change rooms when we arrived as the a/c outlet in our 5th floor room was right over the bed.  Again, we were moved speedily and cheerfully to another room.  To sum up, would we stay here again?  Emphatically yes because of the location, comfort and excellent attention by staff.  And next time, we might even opt for a bigger room!  Many thanks to all the staff for making our stay so comfortable. We look forward to coming back.",5,2013,10,09
113,Fab hotel.... minor problems!,"Great hotel, great nights sleep, great location, great weekend.... Only problem we had was when it came to eat there! Booked a table for dinner and I ordered a well done steak, first time it came back rare to which I sent it back and it then came back medium rare which I ate a few mouth fulls of! being pregnant I was advised all meat is thoroughly cooked, not rare meats as this could be harmful, so obviously I had a little panic about this. Also eating breakfast in the morning we was asked if we would like toast to which we replied yes but no toast ever arrived at our table. We had my steak knocked off the bill at the end of our stay after explaining to the lady at reception what happened, however this is not the point, for the money we paid to stay we expect what we order",5,2013,10,06
113,"small room, service was hit and miss, excellent location","Even though our room was ""Superior"", it was surprisingly small and was difficult to move around the bed. Service was a hit and miss; some staffs were very nice, some were rather blunt.

There were some non-important details lacking, which made this hotel short of the excellence. 
(ex. the used glass was not replaced in our room, a biscuit came with coffee in the lounge was soggy and not edible,  2 bottles of sparking water were put in the room when we asked 2 bottles of still water. )
 
I would rate this hotel 4 stars, not 5. 

The location was excellent, though. Walking distance to museums and nice cafe area in South Ken.",3,2013,10,06
113,Service with a smile,"The hotel is a great oasis from which to base your stay in London. The location is not only very convenient to museums and the underground, but quiet too. The staff bends over backwards to accommodate, and there's even a reasonably priced restaurant right on the premises on nights when you're too tired to walk another step. I don't write reviews often, but when a property stands out from most of the rest, I want to let others know.",5,2013,10,05
113,Nice Family Stay,"Stayed in London a few weeks ago for a trip with my wife and kids (7, 5 and 2) Nice atmosphere, everything clean and  tidy. Friendly welcome. Breakfast in the morning was great! Perfect stay, was just what we wanted.",4,2013,10,04
113,Disappointed in Abercrombie & Kent for recommending this hotel it is not up to their standards,"My husband & I went with our teenage granddaughters.  We had 2 rooms with an adjoining hallway which was very nice and hard to find in London.  They were booked with A &K and were not up to A & K's usual standards.  The rooms were small and needed some updating. They were not ready when we were brought to our rooms.  The location was not good because it was far from the theatre and center of town. The cabs were extremely expensive from that location to every where we wanted to go.
The best thing about the hotel was their food.  Breakfast was included and was fresh and delicious.  We also ate dinner there one night and it was also very nice.",3,2013,10,02
113,Perfect service and cosy atmosphere,"I was invited for breakfast by a business partner last week and I had a really pleasant time.
Really nice breakfast with professional and smiling staff. Having the breakfast in the lounge has a special note.
I will come back in the future for sure.",5,2013,09,30
113,Amazing hotel,Last week I had a light diner in Aubrey bar after a busy day.i would like to thank the staff for his warm greet. The hotel is beautifully decorated and the extra mile is that you feel at home but with the chic &luxury touch.the food was delicious and I have to admit a great deal regarding the value.it is definitely a place to top up for a drink after work.,5,2013,09,30
113,Just short of excellent,"I used to stay regularly at this hotel when it was plain Jury's and this is the first time I have stayed since it received a complete refurbishment and upgrade from 4 to 5 star. The new public rooms are magnificent with service to match. All the staff are friendly, helpful and thoroughly professional. Cocktails in the bar are made with love and expertise and the breakfast buffet is the finest I have seen for many years. Reception is fast and welcoming (hot towels on arrival) and the concierge's department is calm and thoroughly capable.

The hotel is so nice that I am sorry to have to say that my friend and I were not happy with our rooms which were described as ""superior"" but were so small that they could not even accommodate a comfortable chair. A large double bed took up most of the space and it would be even more cramped if two guests were sharing. The bathroom was nicely fitted out but had no additional shelf space for guests to put their own personal stuff. We had persistent trouble with the heating/aircon and my TV packed up 3 times during our 3 day stay. The view from the window was the rooftops and air conditioning intakes which emitted a continuous hum even with the double glazing and shutters. The beds were very comfortable and the rooms clean and well serviced but compared to other 5-star hotels in London (and Dublin) these rooms were really not acceptable.

I raised all these points with the management who were very sympathetic and assured us that they would look into these deficiencies. They also kindly offered us a complementary upgrade if we gave the hotel another chance which we may be inclined to do as the rest of the hotel was so pleasant.",4,2013,09,27
113,Splendid service at this genteel hotel,"We stayed 3 nights at the Kensington Hotel on Queens Gate. The reception staff and bell service were superb. Our room was not a suite but still very spacious (especially for London standards). The bed was large and comfortable (and we are picky about beds!). The tile/marble bathroom was also large and had great lighting at the sink as well as in the shower (inset into the small shelf where shampoo and soaps were displayed). Elegant, comfortable chairs and a table by the window let us look down onto Brompton Road. Road noise was NO problem. Victor, the attentive and knowledgeable concierge arranged a private tour with guide/driver to take us touring for a day, which was a highlight of our trip. We did not dine at the Kensington, but our sole breakfast experience was a C- . I want to just forget that since the rest of the stay was so lovely!
This hotel is 15mins walking distance to Royal Albert Hall, 10 mins to the Victoria and Albert Museum, 10 mins to Bibendum (an amazing restaurant) and 4 mins to Bumpkin (also amazing).",5,2013,09,26
113,Great Neighborhood to Experience London!,"Value: Booked on Tablet.com for the prepay and save 20% deal which ironically you pay when you arrive so you are really holding your reservation for the discounted rate, which was significantly lower than the published rate on the hotel website.

Location: The best location - South Kensington is an affluent neighborhood and the hotel is minutes to the trains, Victoria & Albert Museum, Kensington Palace, Harrods. 

Rooms: Small but clean and classy interiors. Great hotel water pressure and selection of bathroom products. 

Customer Service: Complimentary water and dried fruit, nuts and chocolates, weather report on the next day. 

Only negative was the driver they got us for the airport, who did not do his homework and got us stuck in a traffic jam for 45 mins, We asked for him to take an alternative route but he did not take the initiative and charged us 100 pounds - the hotel said the trip would take 45 mins and cost 55 pounds. Even when we got close to the Terminal he even insisted to go the longer way (I assume to clock up more kms). Since I was already late for check-in,  I did not have time to negotiate with the driver.",5,2013,09,26
113,Treat for Birthday,"We had already been in London for a couple of days but I purchased this on a 1-night only Deluxe Room with Breakfast included so it was a very good deal with Secret Escapes.  Its like a suite with sitting room - very large separate tv to bedroom. Perhaps my only criticism was that it was slightly dark. But huge bathroom with separate loo and a bath and a very large walk in shower.  When we nipped out for lunch as they let us check in very early too we had a platter of fruit and nuts and 2 bottles of Itlalian Water delivered to the room.  Huge comfy bed - we have a 6ft bed at home and this was larger than that.  Staff were all very friendly and helpful - I cant even especially anyone in particular either.  I believe they have a Gym but we didnt get to use that.  
Breakfast was lovely with Lovely Irish Sausages - my partner is a connissieur of sausages and he was very impressed.  But a good selection of different foods and a lovely array of cooked foods for breakfast.
The Loction is good very close tp South Kensington Tube Station but with all bars restaurants shops etc in between.
We never heard any road or traffic noise.  
Would definitely recommended anyone to stay here - I would again - although I do like to try different parts of London so will look at the other 2 London Hotels next time 
We were going to try out the Cocktails in the bar but the Air Con was a little too cold for us and we didnt want to sit in the adjoining lounge but otherwise everything else about front of house was perfect.",5,2013,09,25
113,Simply the best!,"I stayed at this property on the second leg of my trip for holidays to London last week and was just amazed by the service, ambience, and features of the hotel. I was greeted by the bell boy outside and greeted professionally by Paul (who gave great service during my stay along with the lady that worked at the front desk), who checked me in to a nice suite within minutes.

The hotel is beautiful on the inside and has a unique den or library-type of setting near the front desk, which was cozy-feeling. Upon entering my suite (facing Queen's Gate), there was a nice greeting on the bed and everything was just in immaculate shape. Double-paned windows kept the noise from the street out. Easy to open to get fresh air in.

You will be amazed by the shower head in the washroom - it is just heavenly and the washroom was modern along with the comfort of the excellent bed. Even the Wi-FI worked perfectly (included in rate)...I usually find that free wi-fi means ""spotty wi-fi"" but not here. Even though I only watched a little TV before going out for dinners, they offered many channels.

Special thanks to George, who delivered professional and friendly room service one night as well as an ice bucket for beer several times. Paul and the woman in the front desk were great also as were the management of the hotel. Located near S.Kensington tube stop about 5 minutes away and several Italian restaurants and cafes are around the corner on Old Brompton Road as well as a mini-grocery and liquor/wine stores.

Overall, I cannot stop thinking of my positive experience here and would highly recommend the property for your stay in London. It is even a 20-minute walk close to Hyde Park - good running paths here. I will be back for sure!",5,2013,09,24
113,"amazing, amazing , amazing","This hotel is unmatched for service, courtesy and professionalism and I can't think of any negative comment to make about this beautiful boutique hotel, it has amazing decoration and very modern.
I arrived and the front desk checked me in very quickly, George the waiter is very helpful and friendly was very happy all the time, Also a lot of shops and nice restaurants which are only 5 mins from the south kensington station and museums. I wish to come back to the same hotel every time that I‚Äôll be visiting London.",5,2013,09,23
113,Excellent in every way.,"I go to London a few times a year and after trying lots of different hotels have happily settled on the Kensington. Location wise it is perfect, the staff are friendly and kind: if its a hot day they'll be giving you water to take with you, little things like that which are lovely. We stayed in a suite which was beautiful. Having stayed in regular double rooms before we found we really needed a little bit of space. If you can afford it go for a bigger a room. We arrived very late and were able to get delicious food, which was great. 

I wouldn't stay anywhere else in London!",5,2013,09,22
113,Excellent Hotel in South Kensington,"I am a constant customer of The Kensington for few years. Why? This hotel is managed to an excellent standard, all of the staff is very efficient. The hotel is kept very clean with an elegant decoration. You can use the TV flat screen for browsing your computer and see your own movies from your hard drive. There is a free and fast wifi (something everywhere should have but don't). We also appreciated the tranquil atmosphere of the hotel's location in Queen'gate with very good food shops and restaurants of Old Brompton road, with walking distance to Chelsea King's road, and Knightbridge (Harrods and Sloane street).",4,2013,09,22
113,Great place to stay,"Stayed here and had a really good experience. We got there and our room must have been allocated accidentally because there were painters in there, the problem was quickly sorted out and we were upgraded. Nice friendly staff, would recommend. ",4,2013,09,20
113,Excellent Location,"We had a really wonderful 3 nights here. The location is great with the station an easy walk and the Vic and Albert and the Natural History Museum a stones's throw. The restaurant was excellent with attentive staff. Our departure flight was a late one and the staff stored our luggage while we spent the day in town and then languished over a very late afternoon tea and drinks in the comfortable lounge until a more convenient leaving time. The room was pleasant, not enormous but comfortable and with a view. I'd definitely go back",5,2013,09,20
113,Top notch,"Beautiful hotel, friendly, helpful staff. The room itself was small but the bathroom was large and very modern, and the shower was outstanding (rainfall shower head). Great location, plenty of restaurants in walking distance, tube station 4 blocks away.",5,2013,09,19
113,This hotel is a gem!,"Booked The Kensington after many hours of reviewing hotels on TripAdvisor.  Nearly all of the reviews were quite favorable and the hotel did not disappoint!  We were only in London for three nights and it was the perfect base location.  I cannot say enough about the staff and their desire to achieve customer service.  It is clear that they have a clear vision of what is expected of them and that says a lot about the person in charge.  I have worked in the hotel industry and The Kensington nails it with every single employee.  The staff in the bar was attentive without being overly so.  The front desk could not have been more pleasant.  Even the tech man, who came to our room to check on a safe, seemed to truly care about our stay.  The hotel is beautiful and extremely clean in every area.  Finally, a standout would be Martin the concierge.  He was always around when we needed him and was so helpful no matter what we wanted to do.  This was our first stay in London and the only negative was the size of the room and bath.  I was prepared for this as reviews of many London hotels mention the size.  We booked a deluxe room hoping to have a little larger space, but it was pretty tiny.  The hotel even offered to move us to a different room because 132 is a little smaller than most deluxe rooms, but we decided to stay.  The room had so many plugs that the small area didn't seem to matter.  We could dry our hair just about anywhere!  Also, the cord on the blow dryer was super long.  They even had a plug for American appliances!  Closet tiny and we had to keep most of our things in our suitcase as no chest of drawers for storage.  I would absolutely stay here again as everything else about the hotel made up for the small rooms.  Loved it!",5,2013,09,19
113,Wonderful Stay,"My husband booked this hotel online,on arrival we found that the room given was not what he had anticipated,however a very helpful and friendly receptionist called Gillian arranged a wonderful room with a lovely huge bathroom without any fuss,which made our anniversary even  more special.The staff were all polite and efficient and the breakfast was of a good standard.
The hotel's location is also very good,very near the tube station and close enough to walk to the National History and V&A museums .",5,2013,09,19
113,"First, but not last visit","We stayed at The Kensington Hotel for a 3 day trip to London to visit our children. We have been to London many times but this was our first time to stay here and we were not disappointed in our choice. 
Our room was beautifully decorated and had everything you might need, although we did not spend too much time in the room. All staff members that we met were very friendly while remaining professional. 
We will definitely be recommending the hotel to our friends and family; looking forward to visiting again.",5,2013,09,18
113,Fabulous high tea,"Have just had high tea and I must say that it is superb. Apart from the high quality sandwiches, cakes and loose leaf tea the standout was George (our waiter) who was very funny and friendly. We shall return when next in London.",5,2013,09,17
113,"Great Location, Good hotel","I spent a weekend here with my wife in August.  The hotel location is superb. Two minute walk from South Kensington tube stop in a nice neighbourhood. Hyde park and Harrods but a quick walk away.  
The Hotel is very nice, staff where helpful by and large. The breakfast was good without being superb.  The only negative is that the aircon didn't work in our room which wasn't great when its quite warm.  I would rate the overall experience as 4.5 rather than top draw. Will definitly stay again when in London.",5,2013,09,16
113,Super outstanding and excellent service,"I chose to stay at The Kensington hotel after reading the numerous good reviews about the hotel, from the moment i checked in to the time I left i was treated with class every moment of my day. I must say i like the decor in the lounging area, it's like entering the London private club one minute then the next minute you are enjoying a nice meal at the Aubrey restaurant and to finish the night off with a glass of cocktails drinks . Every staff member was really professional but my biggest credit goes to the staff members at the lounging area. they were professional and yet courteous, never have i ever seen a team that is so genuinely passionate about their job ' a big clap to them'. I will definitely be recommend this hotel to all my friends and associates.",5,2013,09,16
113,Excellent service and comfortable stay,"Finally, a five star hotel that is actually a five star hotel.   I was able to check in earlyish...and offered an upgrade.  Found the hotel lounge to be very comfortable, good service and a nice tea while waiting for the room to be prepared.  The room itself was nicely arranged.  The suite had a nice large bathroom and nice toiletries.  Returning from my trip to the V&A to find a lovely fruit tray was a welcome touch as was the cool tea and treats in the evening.  The service was really very good,  polite and prompt.  Perfect.       The doors are a bit on the thin side....so you may want to make sure you are away from the lifts etc if that is an issue for you.",5,2013,09,15
113,Perfect find- Amazing staff,Stayed here for a quick get away for 2 nights. Amazingly well appointed hotel. Lovely public area. Room was a little small but ihad only booked standard so i dont mind as it had everything you wiuld expect with still a feel of luxury. What sets this hotel apart is the staff- especially in the lounge and breakfast. We also treated ourselves afternoon tea while there- such attentive-warm service. Already planning return,5,2013,09,15
113,"Perfect Location and Perfect Afternoon Tea, courtesy of George","We searched for that elusive combination of a proper afternoon tea with value, and found it here. Just blocks away from The Victoria & Albert Museum. 3 courses, with a Gin & Tonic sorbet for palate cleansing. Each course was better than the next. Our server, George, was knowledgeable, attentive and very entertaining. He deserves a promotion! Great selection of teas, as well. We will be back, and will likely stay at the Hotel next time we are in London.",5,2013,09,09
113,Ideal Location & Cosy Rooms,"We booked this hotel for it's central location plus we have stayed at Doyle Collection hotels in the past and always found them to be super.
It is beautifully decorated, the bedrooms and bathrooms are small but more than adequate and have lovely complimentary toiletries.
We had afternoon tea in the lounge area and later pre dinner drinks in the bar and both areas are comfortable and cosy and not a jot of stuffy Kensington attitude that you get with most central London hotels. Breakfast is not included in the price but there is tea & coffee making facilities in your room.
All in all we would recommend it as a great place to stay in a superb location.",5,2013,09,09
113,Great service; great location,We stayed 5 nights in August and had a wonderful time. The staff is great and Martyn the concierge was very helpful since this was our first visit to London. Location was also very good. Close to the tube station and excellent restaurants near by. Room was a little small but I think that is common in London. My only complaint was that the check out staff advised me there was no difference in paying with dollars vs. pounds. But there is a 3.5% foreign currency fee added to the bill which I was not advised of.,4,2013,09,06
113,Nice hotel in a nice area!,"We were quite happy with our stay. We were a group of friends staying in four different rooms. First we were surprised to see how small the rooms were, but we were quickly moved to bigger more comfortable rooms. The service is very good, but I have to mention that we were quite dissapointed with the concierge service. This was poor concierge service compared to similar hotels. But the personnel working at the front desk are very helpful and professional. 

Also I was annoyed with the way the mini bar works where you can't store anything. I had some sweets I bought and I eventually had to throw them out. 

This is good value for money in a very nice area of London. I would stay here again, and I would recommend the hotel to others.",4,2013,09,06
113,My Absolute Favorite,"I discovered The Kensington a couple of years ago and, honestly, this is my first and only choice hotel in London.

As others have previously pointed out, the staff here is simply incredible.  Flying in from New York, one of my favorite things about a trip to London is that first moment at check-in.  Really awesome people, really awesome vibe.  Such a great start to any trip.

The hotel itself is a cool mash-up of historic old townhouses with beautiful, yet timely, decor; I love having my London friends over for a drink/dinner at my temporary home in one of the living rooms downstairs.

The rooms are, admittedly, not enormous, but this is made up for with the attention to detail inside, right down to the toiletries.  Between the details, the overall decor, and of course the staff, you've got an upmarket hotel without any of the pretentious nonsense.

The location can't be beat; the South Ken tube station goes like this: walk out the front door, turn left, and then another left, then walk for a couple of minutes and you're there.  Lots of great restaurants in the neighborhood too, the museums are close, and shopping's nearby too (including a couple of great grocery stores and quick lunch places).

If you're thinking about staying here by all means do it!",5,2013,09,05
113,Professional!,"Great to come across a hotel that is unswerving in its commitment to deliver a really high quality of service at all levels.

This hotel must have strong management as every staff member is committed and clear on their mission from the door staff to reception to the bar tenders - all offered a consistent and top quality level of service.

The hotel facilities are excellent with a very nice lounge, comfortable and elegant furniture, nice bedrooms well kitted out and all pristine and clean.

Location is a short 5 minute stroll to the tube station with a plethora of South Ken' eateries and bars on the door step.

Don't hesitate to book this hotel.",4,2013,09,05
113,Afternoon Tea,"Had a delicious afternoon tea at the Kensington last week. exemplary service from the charming and funny George. Attentive but not intrusive. Lovely explanation of the sandwiches-great combination of fillings. the scones were exceptional-warm and beautifully presented. loved the lemon curd and passion fruit as well as jam.

Couldn't quite manage all of the cakes but of those we sampled the Bakewell tart and lemon tart stand out.
Lovely setting, great service and good value. we will be back.",5,2013,09,03
113,The Kensington,"great hotel - good location and perfectly designed rooms. Went for a special occasion and they went out of their way for us. Staff from the Front Office team to Restaurant staff are excellent, couldn't be more genuine and helpful! Turndown service was a nice touch.",5,2013,09,03
113,Fantastic Hotel - Fantastic Staff,"We stayed in The Kensington Hotel on Saturday 31st August for one night and from the moment we arrived to the moment we left all the staff we met couldn't do enough for us and I can say are a true credit to the Hotel and made our stay so special. 
Without hesitation I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for something that little bit extra special and we will definitely be staying here again. 
Thank you to all the staff at The Kensington Hotel",5,2013,09,02
113,Will be back (again),"This hotel goes above and beyond for its guests. 
We returned in August for my partners birthday as we were heading out to Paris early the next day and wanted to stay in London overnight. 
The hotel upgraded our room by what we think was two upgrades and left a birthday card, a fruit platter/cake and drinks for my partner wishing him a happy birthday. 
The staff greet you with warmth and smile and treat you as if you're the most important guest there (though of course everyone has this special treatment!!) 
Our bed was turned down that night and we had a flask of cranberry juice and biscuits left for when returned from the theatre.
Sleep quality is great at this hotel and the bathroom was lovely!!! Plenty of hot water, space and very clean.
The location is great for exploring London too.
Breakfast, as ever, was the best. So much choice, fresh juice, fish, meat, cheese, pastries, breads, cereals and yogurts and of course a selection of made to order hot meals (we had the full English again as is yummy) 

I have no doubt that we will be back at some point in the not so distant future.

Thank you for making my partners birthday extra special. :)",5,2013,09,02
113,Great location in great hotel in Kensington,"Stayed a night here to attend the very nearby Proms. Great location for Albert Hall and the Natural Historu Museum. The hotel is beautiful, well equipped and the breakfast and service were excellent. Expensive but it us london and prime location after all!",5,2013,09,01
113,Remove your Shoulders and bring some ear plugs!,"After an early arrival I was given my room number - room 220 (herein in known as the postage stamp). 
Regrettably I had no time in the morning to speak to reception as I had meetings almost immediately after arrival. 
Upon return to my postage stamp and a long tiring day, I had room service - I must congratulate the chef on his gastronomic expertise. He managed to carbonise a burger yet maintain the meats raw state within - incredible!
After food I thought I'd try and sleep, but regrettably I was placed in the postage stamp  with little to no sound proofing, particularly from other guests. Laughing, shouting, yelling were the sounds of my unsuccessful lullaby. Despite two complaints to abeyance.  

By the morning I'd had enough, lack of sleep and a sense of increasing claustrophobia. 
Time for a shower and a swift departure.

The shower however is no wider than a coat hanger, so without the assistance of an orthopaedic surgeon or maybe a butcher, anyone with broad shoulders will have a problem. 

Regardless of your shoulders however, you will enjoy a lovely swim in the shower room after, as the shower leaked horrifically causing a small lake to match to serpentine in Hyde Park. 

I should have noticed the tell tale signs before hand, as the carpet around the shower room was stained and peeling away from the edges. Obviously this is a frequently ignore issue in postage stamp 220. 

At check out I informed the staff of all the above mentioned issues, alas, very little sympathy, indeed a greater amount of sarcasm and condescension was applied. I wouldn't say rude, but I didn't appreciate the inference that I was making it all up - good job I had the photos to prove it all! 

Basically, don't stay here if you'd like to sleep, enjoy room service or if you'd like a room that doesn't double as a postage stamp or a swimming pool.",2,2013,09,01
113,Excellent Upgrade,"I had stayed in this hotel several times in previous years and had enjoyed the experience especially the excellent location. It has now been given a complete upgrade and the facilities are first class. It has lost none of the friendly service which was characteristic of it but the d√©cor is now modern and very tasteful. The bedrooms are equipped with everything that a guest might reasonably request.

113,London - Surrey 100m Cycle weekend,"Two night stay with breakfast, ok so I'd firstly like to point out that it was our first visit to London and we had an amazing weekend overall. There are great things about this hotel, the location is amazing and the staff couldn't do enough to make sure we were happy and they were very polite and approachable at all times.

The breakfast we had on the first morning, mine was perfect all from the buffet section fresh and in a beautiful dining area however my husband ordered an omelette and he commented on how dry it was and a little burnt around the edges he simply left it. The next morning though he had a cooked breakfast which was done perfectly and me I asked for fresh cheese & ham as they had none out and they simply went and got fresh for me I also had smoked salmon and eggs it was also perfect. 

Our room, we had mixed feelings about this as it was a deluxe room the bedroom area was of adequate size but the bathroom was much smaller than we were used to. We found out on our first evening that the fan/generator that was outside was rather noisy - had we been staying for longer than 2 nights we would have needed to ask for a different room. Great size TV and lovely toiletries. We had a broken coffee machine so we called to reception who said they could get someone to repair after 10am and in the mean time would provide us with 2 coffees in our room (when these were brought the water hadn't been hot enough to dissolve the granules so we left them) I did mention this as we were leaving to go out for the day and that as the room hadn't quite been ready on our arrival we had waited in the lounge but it appeared that there was long dark hair on the carpet of the room and could they vac whilst we were gone. When we returned the machine was fixed, room cleaned and the next day of our stay they had even put in our room an apology card with a bottle of wine and a platter of fruit & Chocolates !! Wow it was a real pleasure that although I had been very polite in pointing out these two things they were resolved as quickly as possible and this was a great little extra for customer relations. 

Our only other thing that we found a little shocking was that we had paid for our room in advance and when we arrived as always handed over a card for check in, now may I clearly state we have stayed in 5* in Edinburgh/Cotswolds/Stratford Upon Avon and many more but never have we had ¬£300 deducted from either of our cards as a g/tee for our stay this was only noticed when we returned home and when we called the hotel they said it would go back on to available balance within 5 working days and it was in the small print of the check in form, I think it would have been better to be advised of this verbally when giving over the card as when there are other people waiting behind you and only one person on the desk and after a long journey you are not going to read an a4 sheet plus small print on your arrival? Anyhow luckily for us my husband didn't notice the ¬£300 until after our break but this could be very different for others and in turn it could wreck someones weekend away if they needed the additional ¬£300 whilst they were in London only a thought.",4,2013,08,29
113,Good hotel in great location,"We booked a room here for four nights via the hotel's Doyle Collection website. We paid top dollar for a small room. Unlike other reviewers here, we did not get upgraded. We have never been upgraded except once at The Taj Lake Palace Hotel in Udaipur. How do these hotels decide who will enjoy an upgrade? There must be some special handshake or facial twitching required at check in?

Before the hotel manager replies that these old houses have to have odd room size configurations, we'll just say our room was small - very small - with a queen size double at the front of the building. There was no traffic noise and the bed was comfortable. There is adequate wardrobe space and good wi-fi. The bathroom was small - best described as efficient? But why in a double room for two people is there only one chair? The answer will probably be that the room was only large enough to accommodate one chair so following the hotel's logic, we were two people put into a single size room?

Otherwise everything worked and the hotel is very well located - just where we needed to be. We did not bother with the very expensive breakfasts which are over ¬£20 per person for typical hotel fare. Instead there are several very nice cafes nearby with an eclectic choice of freshly cooked food for breakfast for less than ¬£10 per person including coffee or tea. Likewise, the hotel restaurant is expensive for dinner - it is better to try somewhere from the large choice of local restaurants just a few minutes walk away.

Would we stay here again? Yes - providing we get a room large enough to fit a bed and two chairs (useful to sit on whilst waiting for the rain to stop or just to have a cup of tea.) If there are no suitable rooms then we would definitely stay elsewhere - after all there is a vast choice in London!",5,2013,08,28
113,A great surprise,"My boyfriend and I booked the bank holiday weekend here last minute after our other accommodation plans fell through and ended up being glad the other hotel cancelled our reservation! Very beautifully decorated hotel, clean and modern. The staff were friendly and helpful and the turn down service was a nice touch. I wouldn't recommend the room service, there wasn't anything particularly wrong with it, but it just wasn't to our liking however I suppose it was room service after all! Definitely planning on returning and having a spa weekend!",5,2013,08,28
113,A fabulous stay- perfection!,"I booked a one night stay through the hotel website to celebrate my husbands birthday and its certainly one he will not forget. We checked in effortlessly even though we were early and told we had been upgraded(a first for me).  We enjoyed drinks and snacks and the elegant lobby and then headed to our beautiful room, our one year old daughter had been catered for with a travel cot. The room was quirky with a fantastic bathroom complete with a tv and lovely products.  The best thing for us was the extras that the hotel provided such as hot towels on arrival and bottled water once you've checked it really is these simple things that make you want to return.  We now hope to make this an annual trip to London.  Overall a perfect stay- thank you x x",5,2013,08,27
113,Great stay,"This is an excellent hotel. The suite was a good size with a lovely big comfortable bed. Though we looked out onto the street, traffic noise was at a minimum and therefore not a factor.

Cooked breakfast was delicious. In particular the attentiveness and friendliness of the staff was noteworthy.

Given its great setting, tremendous value for money.",5,2013,08,27
113,Afternoon tea at t Kensington Hotel,"I had afternoon tea with friends at the Aubrey restaurant in the Kensington Hotel.  I would highly recommend this hotel for tea.  The variety of teas offered was great. The sandwiches and scones were delicious as well.  Our group received excellent service from our server, George. He was pleasant, knowledgeable and made sure that our group had every need met.",4,2013,08,26
113,Not so pleased,"We stay in London for a week twice a year, and has for years stayed at the same hotel in Bloomsbury. Now we became tempted to try the Kensington, by the reviews and offer from ""secretescapes"". Well, 16. - 23. August in a juniorsuite on the 5th floor, and the room was rather small and with a queensize bed. Busy wallpaper. Low ceiling. Two small windows. Rattling aircondition. 
If we had not prepaid, we would have moved to ""our"" hotel after the first night. 
The moral is: Never change routines that work for you.",3,2013,08,24
113,Come see for yourself!,"I used to live in London and was visiting for 3 days and stayed at The Kensington. It exceeded all expectations. 
Staff were exceptional!
The location brilliant.
Rooms very comfortable - the bed great, shower had a huge head, lovely features throughout...
The best way to end our honeymoon!! Thank you so much. We were both so happy to stay and sad to leave! We will return again!!",5,2013,08,24
113,"Lovely hotel,","I had no preconceptions of the hotel as a 1 night stay was a surprise from my husband.  All staff in the hotel were polite and friendly,  the public rooms were delightful and very much in keeping with the age of the hotel.  

Overall the stay was fantastic and I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.  The couple of niggles for me were the room itself was smaller than was expected but clean and tidy and had everything we needed, also the towels were not what we would expect from the calibre of hotel as they were rather worn and a little rough.",4,2013,08,24
113,Pure Luxury .. making a work trip a real pleasure!,"Well, it's something of a miracle that I'm writing this review. Not only do I stay in many hotels all over the world I am generally quite picky where hotels are concerned.
My brief two night stay at the Kensington Hotel was for business, a training conference I was hosting in another renowned 5 star London property. I must admit I chose this hotel because it was reasonably priced through an offer I'd seen on Secret Escapes, it also appeared to have the necessary facilities in order to ensure that after a hard day at work I could unwind and forget about the reason I was there.
Hotels are much of a muchness for me, I require a high standard of bathroom and the rest is unimportant as long as it meets the same standards I have at home, I live in a modest town house in the city of Lichfield so we're not talking about a rich man's palace here.
No, as long as the bathroom is of a high standard I'm generally quite happy. So what was it that drove me to writing this review? Well, it's simple. The property itself and facilities as I'm sure you would assume being a five star hotel in Kensington are exquisite. But it was this, let's face it I've stayed in lots of lovely hotels. No, for me the cherry on the icing on the cake was the staff.
As I've already mentioned, for reasons that will now become apparent, I don't live in a castle or in fact 'live the dream' but I do travel for work a great deal.
All too often the wonderful hotel experience is ruined by staff who believe they're being professional yet to me appear rude, snooty or just plain arrogant.
Finally, I have found a fantastic hotel with staff to match, not just one member of staff, all of them. Without exception. The training the staff at the Kensington must be given has made the most dramatic difference to my hotel experience. Everyone appeared to enjoy their job, had a smile on their faces and above all treated me like a human being, not just a customer.
This is what drove me to writing this review. I will definitely be returning and should the opportunity arise, be staying at other Doyle Collection hotels.",5,2013,08,24
113,excellent,"I stayed in this hotel for 2 days, it had been recently refurbished. Its very near the South Kensington tube station and also near the high street South Kensington for shopping. The rooms are small like most London hotels, but are luxuriously decorated with extra comfortable beds. Cannot fault this hotel for its excellent professional service and will definitely be back.",5,2013,08,23
113,excellent venue,"Had travelled to London for buisiness  and had been accommodated at   "" The Kensington Hotel  Queens Gate ""   for 4 days. We both had great time there really enjoyed that much  venue , location nearby, food, service rooms and staff. All of them tried to the utmost possible to cacilitate  our kind requests and or demands ( of course within  the limists of Hotel's policies and accommodation practice)
Room was cleaned twice by a very competent  staff,  waiters in  salon, bar, restaurant and breakfast room provided the very best of their service , very friendly making us feeling like home.
Checked in -out,   simply within 5-8 minutes maximum by a very friendly and qualified individuals servicing  hotels reception and guided thereafter to the room.
Will be glad to be accommodated again...

113,Book without fear,"As it was my first time traveling to london, I was very unsure about where to book a hotel.  I happen to see a very nice discounted rate for this hotel and after reading the tripadvisor reviews, I felt confident in my decision.  Upon arrival, I knew we were in the right place.  First of all, you will need to use the tube or taxis to get to the eastern parts of the city like the embankment and near the Tower.  This happens to be easy as taxis are plentiful and there is a tube stop less than 5 minutes up the road.  We took the tube from Heathrow with our bags and walked right up to the hotel.  You will save a lot of money by doing this.  You can walk to certain attractions if you are someone who likes to take 30-45 minute walks.  Other positives about this location are the quiet streets and nice restaurants (with various price ranges and styles.)

As for the hotel itself, it is very nice looking and the staff is very friendly.  It is clean, well-decorated, and you feel that you are in a 5 star hotel.  The lobby is nicely decorated and when everyone is enjoying high tea (we did not), you feel like you are in an authentic English setting.  Concierge was extremely helpful.  I believe the gentleman's name was Victor.  He booked our day trip and other tours.  Our room was a deluxe and this meant a room with a nice queen bed with enough room to walk on either side. and a decent sized bathroom with a nice sized shower.  My fiancee who has traveled across Europe and stayed at some of the best hotels commented on the nice size.  We had a room that overlooked the main street and never had a problem with noises except for the random loud person coming off the elevator.  

We only ate at the hotel the morning we arrived while we waited for our room.  I don't think the breakfast is worth the money, especially with a lot of cafes in the area.

I would definitely stay at this hotel again if I found the right price.  Everything in London is expensive and I know I had concerns about paying a lot of money for a hotel but knowing what you get at this hotel, I feel you don't have to worry about booking this hotel.  Like I said, it's not really near any attractions BUT the tube is so easy to use that you can get anywhere in london within minutes.",4,2013,08,21
113,"Wonderful hotel, with a few tiny niggles","Overall, The Kensington Hotel is a gorgeous hotel, with very attentive staff and wonderful rooms. However, our recent stay was not the 5* quality I was expecting. In the end, I could not expect any more for what we had paid for the room (booked through secret escapes, therefore got an amazing deal) however, regardless of what you pay, you should still expect the same standards as a full-paying guest.
Upon arrival, we were told that our room had been upgraded to a suite, which we were both overjoyed at, however, the room was not ready, and so we went and had lunch and were asked to come back around 45 minutes later. Once we arrived back at reception, we were then told we were in a room on the second floor (and subsequently not in a suite as was originally said. However, I had to specifically point this out, as staff at reception seemed to neglect to tell me we were no longer in a suite, almost expecting me not to notice, which I did not find very professional. When I asked why we were no longer in a suite, I was not given a satisfactory explanation, and simply told that I would be happy with the room we were given and if not I could report back to reception and they would ‚Äòsee what they could do‚Äô. However, as we only had limited time in London, and had technically paid for a deluxe room, we did not want the hassle. The deluxe room itself was lovely; however we could not fully enjoy it knowing that we could have potentially had a suite. Also, the room was very noisy at night, with sounds similar to toilets flushing and feet shuffling across the floor. We then realised we were in the room right next to the outdoor extractor fans, which explained the majority of noises. The bed was extremely comfortable, and complimentary toiletries were lovely.
Service at breakfast was exemplary, however, we did not find that the full English breakfast was worth of its ¬£21 price tag, but it was already included within our package. The hotel itself is situated in a wonderful part of Kensington, and is very close to the tube station, which was very handy. The staff, as said previously, could not be more helpful, and they are a commendation to the hotel.
Had it not been for the few niggles we had originally, we would have awarded this hotel 5 stars, and would have most definitely returned and paid full price. However, we may look at other hotels in London for our next stay.",4,2013,08,20
113,"Great hotel, great location, great value for a London hotel",Spent 5 nights here after arriving from Dubai at the start of our UK holiday. Had some concerns before we arrived about the size of the room but couldn't have been happier. Great location close to South Kensington tube station and great for a run down Queensway and around Kensington Gardens. Friendly and helpful staff; we had an issue with a light switch that kept shorting out our lights but maintenance arrived promptly and dealt with it quickly each time. This part of London really is a lovely place to stay and the Kensington Hotel is certainly somewhere I'd recommend.,5,2013,08,17
113,A big thank you!,"We have stayed here before a few years back and decided to book in for one night on the day we arrived into London from Sydney at 6am....got to the hotel about 7am and amazingly the guy on the front desk gave us a room we could check into immediately!  That gestures made such a difference to our first day in the uk as we got over our jetlag and I want to say a big thanks to the staff. 
The package we booked also had a late 3pm checkout, so we really got to make the most of our time there and the facilities.
Location wise the hotel is in a great spot, nice and quiet but near the tube and some nice little restaurants. The bar and restaurant are beautiful rooms and the buffet breakfast was well set up.  We used the gym too which is pretty well equipped and well stocked with towels and cold water.
This is now our hotel of choice for whenever we return to the uk and I would recommend it to anyone!",5,2013,08,17
113,Beautiful hotel in London,"It was a great hotel, we loved the location, the room was  lovely.  It's close to the Underground, nice restaurants, very nice residential neighborhood. Absolutely no complaints.
We would definitely stay there again.",5,2013,08,16
113,"Recent stay in May 23, 2013","I am just getting around to posting my review of our 5 night stay at the Kensington Hotel the end of May.  I read all the great reviews of this hotel before booking but  we have mixed reviews.  The hotel is charming and the staff couldn't have been nicer.  The problem was with our room.  We booked an upgraded room and arrived late in the evening after a 7 hour flight from the US.   When we checked in we were taken up to our room which was a decent size and very clean except for a very large red stain on the carpet which looked like it might have been blood.  I asked if we could be moved to another room.  We were told there was only one other room available that they would show us.  When we viewed the room it was much smaller but the carpet was clean so we changed rooms.  The room was not only much smaller but it had weird angles that we were constantley bumping into the walls.  The bathroom was very small but had nice bath products, towels and a comfortible bed.  We loved the feel of the hotel and the nice bar to have a cocktail in after a long day of siteseeing.  The hotel was expensive and we paid the same amount for the small room as we would have for the larger room.  The area was very convenient;  the tube was only a 5 minute walk and there were a lot of places to eat around the tube.",3,2013,08,15
113,Where I always stay in London,"Clean and friendly, good sevice and great breakfast. Good location near South Kensington tube stop, but it's a quiet neighborhood and, this being London, there are no late night dining options if you get back to the hotel late... so plan on grabbing a bite elsewhere in those cases.

If you can get breakfast buffer included in your rate, the hotel is a great value... for just 5 pounds more you can add hot eggs or other options like smoked salmon.

Had dinner there for the first time the other night and it was great... try the cod filet. Aladine was a fantastic waiter and explained how they recently revamped their menu.

The desk was helpful in storing some food I had bought for my outbound journey, and restaurant staff make it a point to know your name.

Only downside is limited after hours menu, but then again this is London and there are few places that do have a good midnight menu. The staff made me a custom salad after I couldn't find what I liked on the menu, which was great.",5,2013,08,15
113,Excellent Location and Service,"This Hotel is a great location.  It is an easy walk to restaurants, the Underground and I recommend the Big Bus.  Excellent Hotel staff, ready to help with any question or problem.  
Overall, this is a great place to stay.",5,2013,08,12
113,Amazing!,"Stayed for the weekend with my mother for my eighteenth birthday, and we both agreed that nothing would ever beat this hotel. Staff were tremendously helpful, a special mention to Allessandro behind the bar, who makes excellent cocktails and provides excellent company. Close to Kensington station and boujis club, also many bars and restaurants right on your door step. The food in the Aubrey was insanely good,although slightly expensive, which is too be expected in this area. The only negative I can find was that our espresso machine didn't work for the duration of our stay, but that is barely worth mentioning. Loved it so much, we shall be returning next month.",5,2013,08,12
113,Amazing,"What a lovely hotel. Its located about 5mins away from South Kensington station. Having looked at previous reviews on trip adviser I knew I wouldn't be let down. Our room was located on the 2nd floor the room was lovely and spacious, with the added touch of having a free standing bath.
Staff couldn't of been more friendly.
Breakfast was lovely with a variety of hot and cold food. If I had to say anything negative it would be trying to work the coffee machine! But after 10min of playing around with it we worked it out!! 
I Look forward to staying here again when I return to the city.",5,2013,08,12
113,Nothing beats this hotel!,"We stayed at the Kensington Hotel for 8 nights and they were perfect! The hotel is beautiful from the outside in! Not sure what people mean when they say they had a small room, if you book a standard room, you can never expect anything great!  Our deluxe room was perfect, large, big bed, beautiful bathroom and lovely views. On the 2nd night our air con broke in our bedroom, went downstairs the next morning to speak to staff, straightaway they apologised and offered to move us to another room, we decided to stay in our room and see if the maintenance man could fix it. The next day they advised us it would take a couple of days to fix and would like to move us, we checked out the next room, moved our backs, but I didn't like it, bathroom was tiny, so my partner asked if we could move back to our old room, the hotel staff kindly came back and collected our bags and took us back to the old room. The next afternoon, we came back to the hotel to be advised that we had been moved to a studio suite :) another perfect room! 

every single hotel staff we came across was friendly, polite and wonderful, no staff member failed to greet us or talk to us when we entered or walked past them. They were so accommodating and it had defiantly been the best service I have ever received.

Location is great too, everything is near by and only 5 min walk to the tube station which to get to most places is between 2 - 4 stops. Hyde park, Kensington gardens and palace and museums and restaurants and everything is near by.

I cannot wait to come back to London simply to go back to the Kensington Hotel! I could write so much about this fantastic hotel.  You have to stay!",5,2013,08,10
113,"Good location and old style charms not enough to compensate for slipping standards, old rooms and inconsistent service.","The good
- good location.
- great looking lobby with old style charms.
- staff generally friendly and helpful. 
- good breakfast (not a great selection but good quality). 

The bad
- inconsistent service, some staff are helpful, some are not.
- went into the room and realized the toilet was not really flushed. 
- rooms are small and stuffy. 
- TV was not working in my room. 
- mini bar initially locked for some reason. ",3,2013,08,09
113,"Good hotel, great location","Stayed here for one night with a last minute reservation. The hotel was nice and staff were very accommodating. The computer system was down at time of check-in and the process still went very smoothly. We stayed in a nicely decorated room but it was quite small. However, this isn't a complaint given we only booked on the day of stay. Will definitely be back.",4,2013,08,08
113,Delightful!!!,"This hotel was delightful, from the charming lobby to the clean rooms to the fabulous staff, Vincent, Ward , James.... Too many to mention, but all were quite helpful and always charming.  The rooms were small but very clean and just what we needed. They have w delightful afternoon tea, great gym. The location is great, just a couple of blocks from the South Kensington tube stop, short distance from Kensington Garden, cute restaurants nearby on Old Brompton Road' close to the museums and a short walk to Harrods.....I can't wait to go back!!!",5,2013,08,06
113,Great Place,"My Fiancee and I stayed here for New Years 2013. The hotel was great. You cannot beat the location. We were just steps away from museums and shopping. The staff was wonderful by remembering and greeting us each day. We had read reviews on the room sizes being to small, but were pleasantly surprised about the size (yes it isn't American sized, but this is London!). In all I would highly recommend this hotel. Also the complimentary umbrellas by the door were a great touch.",5,2013,08,06
113,5* quality and service,"Just returned home from a 1 night stay at the Kensington Hotel.

We visited as part of a package weekend, which included tickets to the David Bowie exhibition and the V&A (which was great!) The hotel is convenient for the museums, and for South Ken tube station. We paid slightly more for a queen sized bed, and our room was huge! Nice touches such ascomplimentary  chocolates and cherries, and it was fantastic to see a nespresso coffee machine in the room (even if it did take me 10 mins to work out how to use it!) Bathrooms are compact but luxurious, with lovely smelling aromatherpay shower gels etc. A nice touch was an umbrella in the wardrobe, although thankfully the heatwave temperatures meant we didn't need this. Breakfast was delicious - I can recommend the twist on eggs benedict, replacing the ham with smoked salmon! Every member of staff we met was polite, welcoming and attentive. All in all a great stay, and we will be back!",5,2013,08,04
113,A great option,"Nothing is cheap in this part of London, but The Kensington offers better value than many others and lives up to its 5-star rating. Location is excellent with easy access to South Kensington for tube and restaurants, plus some of London's best museums.

The rooms will not suit everyone though as they are very small. Everything is compact, including the bathroom and 'shub' which makes for a very tight shower and quite a lot of toe-stubbing on the drain plug due to a rather silly design.

Unless you particularly need space though, this is a great option when in London and I will happily return.",5,2013,08,02
113,"Great location, rooms are compact but very well fitted out and very comfortable","We went for two nights to celebrate my 40th. Kensington is a great area, fantastic houses and good cafes, bars and shops. The hotel is about 5mins walk from S Ken tube which is very convenient for getting to most places. Staff were very professional, rooms are very comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay and will stay again.",5,2013,07,31
113,Doyle's Kensington Hotel London,"This is definitely one of the best!  The staff is incredibly attentive and handle any request with a smile and quickly complete what is needed.  The front desk, concierge, room attendants, and the lobby staff are perfect.  All from greeting us at breakfast, hailing a cab in the rain, or endless requests for directions, they are outstanding.  The room amenities are complete, the bathrooms are wonderful (something about 'rainshower' showers are superb) and the cleanliness of everything is great.  The fitness center is the most well equipped with every machine, free weight, and mats and bosu balls - they have it all.  Ten minutes to Kensington South tube station, so it is convenient to the whole city.  Definitely a repeat visit in our plans.",5,2013,07,30
113,Quality Hotel,"What a quality hotel, from the minute we arrived we knew that we would be looked after in true style. Our room was very comfortable and clean and of high spec. the extra's that came were far and beyond most London hotels, the flask of cool apple juice and biscuits for night time was a nice touch. The breakfast table lay out was really impressive with such a wide juice for the healthy choice or the full English for a perfect start to a hectic day, I had the Irish smoke salmon and scrambled eggs, I think that the salmon is by far the best I've had. I cant fault this hotel and will be going back on all my future trips. excellent.",5,2013,07,30
113,Great Hotel,"Just got back from an overnight stay at the Kensington - great hotel, staff were very polite and really helpful.  We had been upgraded to a junior suite which was lovely and the fresh fruit in our room on such a hot day was very welcome.
All in all a great hotel in a great location - by the way breakfast was also really good!",5,2013,07,30
113,"Lovely hotel, great staff","We stayed for a night in July, and really wished it could have been longer. The hotel is in some former town houses in South Ken, and has glorious architectural features like the original stone staircase: the decor has been beautifully done and is tasteful without being bland. Some very nice paintings too, many showing the Irish heritage of the Doyle Group. Several staff are Irish, including the charming barman, and we found the welcome and service to be very pleasant. A problem with our shower was rectified within minutes, and we had the feeling that it really mattered to the lovely handyman that everything should work well. We were lucky enough to have a so-called suite, which was a good-sized room with a spacious bathroom: we shall book this again when we return, as we certainly plan to do - we stay often in hotels and this one is a gem.",5,2013,07,29
113,Another great stay,"Having already written a review on The Kensington Hotel, I thought it would be good to update TripAdvisor with my latest experience.

Yes, it's still five star. Yes, the service is still first class. Yes, the rooms are still immaculately clean and superbly finished. Yes, the hotel still looks fantastic. Yes, it's probably my favourite hotel.

Unfortunately on this occasion we could only book the one night and sadly spent the other two elsewhere. But upon check-in in we were informed the rooms weren't ready yet. They checked us in, handed us the keys, took our bags and sent us to the bar. We must have ordered around four cocktails and were then told the room was ready and ""sorry for your wait, the drinks are complimentary"".

That sums up the Kensington. A truly great hotel.",5,2013,07,29
113,Classy hotel,"We stayed here for 3 nights in a very hot spell in July, having previously enjoyed an excellent meal in Aubrey's restaurant. We were not disappointed by the hotel, it was fabulous. We chose a deluxe room as it was clear from previous reviews that some people find room sizes small. This was an excellent choice; the room was quite large and had a very comfortable queen bed. The room itself was very nicely decorated and furnished. There was no view (except for air-conditioning units) but I don't think there is really a view to be had in this area. The position of the room suited me very well as it was quiet. The wardrobe was a bit small and there were no drawers (seems to be an odd fashion in hotels these days!), might have been an issue for a longer stay. It was extremely hot and the air conditioning  worked well thank goodness. The bathroom was lovely, nice products and good robes, slippers and towels. We tried Aubrey's restaurant again and it was just as good, as was the breakfast each morning. Staff were always smiling and extremely pleasant. I loved the beautiful candle smell in the hotel lobby. I love this hotel and we are very likely to return.",5,2013,07,26
113,A very comfortable home away from home,"My husband and I stayed at The Kensington Hotel for 12 nights during July and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The staff are fantastic - so well trained, enthusiastic and seem genuinely keen to assist with any sort of enquiry.  The lounge areas are very comfortable and a great place to relax with a pot of tea after sightseeing,  in our case,  during some hot weather.   Fabulous location and we enjoyed all the great cafes and restaurants in the area.   Easy walk to Chelsea which was a bonus.   We will stay there again
Thank you",5,2013,07,25
113,"Good location, poor value.",The hotel is well located a short walk from south kensington tube station. Whilst i recognise that this is an affluent area at ¬£200 plus a night the rooms were tiny and u literally had to shut doors behind you to manoeuvre around the room. Food was again overpriced and poor value. Not impressed. ,3,2013,07,20
113,Feels like home in London,"Love this boutique hotel.
I came to London on a work trip and this was home for me while I was here.
Very elegantly decorated. I love the wallpaper and curtains. Somewhat eclectic.
About 5 mins to South Kensington Station and along the way, you have Tesco Express, Little Waitrose, Hummingbird Bakery and other cafes and eateries.

The room is very inviting, and beds comfortable.
I rested very well every night before going off to work.
The radio was useful as it helped me to unwind.

My room had short stairs up to the bathroom. Totally love this ... 
Bathroom is modern with white grey marble walls.T
The aromatherapy bath products were awesome and it was a great way to unwind after a day's work.

I ran into a few minor problems. My bathtub didn't drain very well and it was quite uncomfortable when the water accumulated up to mid-calf. Had to inform them twice before it was fixed. But once it was, it was perfect. My key card didn't work on 3 different occasions (not sure why), and it was a long walk from my room to the lift down, just to get to the lobby. Was a bit frustrating especially when I came back with my heavy work bag and shopping.

Other than that, this was place is perfect. Will definitely return again.
Miss those arometherapy products!",5,2013,07,20
113,Comfort and Style,"The photos do not do this hotel justice! The exterior is pleasing to the eye and the interior is stylish and elegant.
We had two very hot and sticky days in London but the luxury of air conditioning in our room and the most comfortable of beds meant that we awoke refreshed!
All the members of staff were courteous, attentive and friendly.
Our best stay in London yet.",5,2013,07,19
113,Great Location,"This hotel was great in every way!  The location couldn't be beat, you could pretty much get anywhere in London quickly and easily.  The hotel staff was superb in every way.  The rooms were small, but very nice and clean.  The only problem we had was the shower, it only had a 1/2 door and couldn't shower without getting everything wet, but it could have very well been just me who couldn't figure it out.  Overall I was more than pleased and would definitely visit this hotel again and would recommend it to anyone I knew who was visiting London.",5,2013,07,15
113,Sheer luxury at a great location,"The Kensington Hotel is an expensive but well worth it. My family and I stayed over a week end there in April. We opted for the superior rooms which are well appointed. Everthing oozes quality from the entrance right up to the lobby and rooms. The bathroom and bathroom products are of high quality too.The staff at the reception matched the standard set by the hotel management and may have exceeded it. Every detail is dealt with promptly. there is a bowel of free fresh fruit in front of the reception desk and you get offered a free broly 'umbrella for the non-Brits' at the doorstep when it rains

The breakfast is delicious however it does gets busy very quickly and there is a queue. This is the only negative that I can mention. Around the corner is Old Brompton Road where you can find restaurants from every cuisine in the world. The location is ideal for those who wish to visit South Kensington such as the Royal Albert, V&A, Natural Museum, Harrods, etc

Overall cannot say a bad word except for the breakfast queue otherwise an Excellent Hotel. Highly Recommended!!",4,2013,07,15
113,Stylish West Kensington,"A Stylish hotel with excellent public rooms for a relaxed Kensington stay.

The bedrooms are well appointed but very small. When they renovated the hotel they really pushed the space option a little too far, even for Central London. You get a warning when you look at the size of the door to the bedroom from the corridor, not dolls house size but heading in that direction.

The bathroom must have some sort of record for size, don't turn around too fast or your will bounce of something. The shower was OK once you got into it.

A pleasure to stay there overall, but the space trade of was a little annoying.
But for a older hotel in central London in nice area it was good value.
The breakfast cost was very high, but some excellent places just around the corner are a much better option nice summers morning.",4,2013,07,13
113,Superb service,"Stayed at all top London hotels and on visiting the Kensington for the first time would definitely visit again and again. Fantastically helpful and polite concierge and all other staff . Room small but very clean and nicely laid out, superb location reasonably priced and don't try to rip you off.

See you again soon

Martin and Jo",5,2013,07,13
113,Enjoyed very much!,"Excellent location - 2 blocks from tube station, 1 block from Natural History Museum. Staff very friendly & helpful. Many restaurants of varying types all around area- and if you're missing your Starbucks, there is one on the corner across from tube station. Room was very clean- high-quality linens. Not too roomy, but we weren't there much. Bathroom very & clean nice but small & only suitable for 1 person getting ready at a time. If you are a very large person- you will find the shower super- small. Shower amenities were very high quality. Only ate breakfast buffet 1 morning. While a bit pricey, there was a large variety & service was great. Had desserts & drinks one night in the bar- good but expensive. 

In summary, really loved this hotel. It's quiet, has a good location & attentive staff. Would recommend.",5,2013,07,13
113,Very good but pricey!,"We really liked this hotel and the ambience but for the price they could throw in a few extras eg  a welcome drink or evening drinks and snacks. Excellent location, very helpful staff, nice smallish room and very good breakfast! Wifi included. Whoever mentioned the perfumed smell is just ultra sensitive because it is not a problem. Recommend if price is no worry.",4,2013,07,12
113,Excellent !,"Stayed at the hotel for one week (which can be a long time). Very comfortable stay. Friendly and efficient staff, great service (very pro active and ability to anticipate your needs was amazing), housekeeping, comfortable room, modern bathroom. 

Location is very convenient with a tube station very nearby within walking distance.

Also lot of convenience stores around the hotel.

Strongly recommend this hotel.",5,2013,07,12
113,A hidden gem,"This is a super hotel in a quiet tree lined street.  It feels a million miles from the hustle and bustle of the city but in fact is just a short walk from South Kensington tube station.
The hotel is understated but beautiful.  Our room was large with very comfy beds.  The bathroom was fairly average.
We loved the Cocktail bar and the cocktails.  We had dinner in the restaurant and it was delicious.  We also enjoyed snacks in the lounge area.  The staff were very friendly and attentive.",4,2013,07,11
113,Everything was great except for the bed...,"This hotel is in the middle of where we want to be. 2 blocks from South Kensinton underground, walking distance to Knightsbridge and King's road, totally convenient.  Staffs are friendly and helpful. Room is decent size.  Only 1 thing: the bed is small. We traveled with our son (11), he got the single, we got the double... I guess we just didn't realize how small double could be.  It is on the booking that we would have a single and a double bed.  Guess it's misinterpretation on our part. Other than that, love this hotel.",4,2013,07,10
113,Brilliant,"We had the pleasure of enjoying an afternoon tea here.
The service was exemplary , staff were extremely polite and understood out dietary requirements making alternative suggestions for us. The sandwiches were delicious.The bread was fresh and the fillings generous, tasty and flavoursome. The scones were the best, hot from the oven and cooked to perfection, same for the patisserie. We would most certainly recommend this as a venue for afternoon tea in London, the standard of the food is on a par with The Dorchester and the service better.   ",5,2013,07,09
113,"A delightful, outstanding stay in South Kensington","From the moment of our arrival until we departed, we felt pampered without being smothered or intimidated.  The Kensington Hotel is very well staffed - in terms of the numbers of employees and their training.  Courtesy and kindness were the bywords at every turn.

The restaurant is outstanding - serving fine food in a relaxing environment.  As an American, I am not used to finding such a fine restaurant within the hotel confines.  We ate dinner there four out of four evenings.  The buffet breakfast is delicious and varied in terms of offerings.

No-one does hotels like the Irish - this is just one fine example.",5,2013,07,08
113,Happy clients once again,"I have stayed at the hotel a number of times this year, one night to ten days at a time. This last week I have seven clients from Florida with me and I am pleased to say they were delighted with the high level of service, atmosphere of the hotel, the comfy beds.  The only thing we observed this time was the breakfast Buffet doesn't change, which could be considered (after the third day it does get a little boring) however, the quality of the food is a high standard. The staff always want to help and remember your name, which is nice. I have read comments on the candle, I love the scent, but I think all it needs is a smaller candle then it would reduce the high scent. Two clients did comment on that too. Overall the hotel is wonderful, location great, and I look forward to next weekend when I return with more clients. Keep up the good work but remember there is high competition in the city ",5,2013,07,07
113,Excellent Family Stay,"Our family - myself, my wife and our 11 year old daughter - just had a wonderful 6 night stay at the Kensington Hotel; 3 nights as part of a Wimbledon Experience package and then extended another 3 nights on our own. We were impressed with how all the staff we encountered were so friendly, pleasant and helpful - definite kudos to management for encouraging such a customer friendly environment. We arrived at the hotel after an delayed overnight flight from Chicago in the early afternoon and since our room wasn't ready - the hotel was full due to Wimbledon - enjoyed a very pleasant lunch in their restaurant. By the time we finished our room was ready with our luggage already in the room. We loved the close proximity of the hotel to shopping as well as to a variety of excellent local restaurants. The South Kensington tube station is only a 5 minute walk away which made getting to Wimbledon very convenient. Hyde Park is close by so we were able to get out for a very pleasant run one morning. Our daughter was pleasantly surprised by the nightly milk and cookies that was left for her - it spoiled her for the rest of our European trip.

We stayed in a family deluxe room with a double and a twin bed which was very spacious for European standards. 

We also enjoyed the breakfast options - we had the full breakfast with the hot options with our Wimbledon package for the first 3 days and then just the continental breakfast for the last 3 days. Service was quick and efficient which allowed us to get on with our very busy days.

Our entire family would definitely recommend the Kensington Hotel as an excellent and tranquil place to stay in the hustle and bustle of London. Thanks to all the staff for making our daughter's first trip to London such a wonderful and memorable occasion!!",5,2013,07,07
113,Very nice boutique hotel,"This hotel,is in a great location.  the decor and ambience are very welcoming.  The rooms, while a bit small, are very nicely decorated.
There is a lovely high tea served in the afternoon and we had one meal in the hotel, which was pricy but good.
we would return to this hotel on a mother vacation.",5,2013,07,02
113,Romantic and peaceful break,"Booked a Saturday night here for a romantic break with my wife. The location is excellent for the shops of Knightsbridge (including Harrods) and some less famous local shops and restaurants. The hotel has an intimate, stylish ambience and was great for the winter weather. We passed a happy hour sitting on the big leather sofas in front of the fire, drinking the surprisingly good cucumber martinis. We were fortunate enough to be upgraded to the main suite, thanks to my GHA Discovery loyalty membership, and it was charming in an unflashy kind of way. There was a decent sized sitting room with books and unusual furnishings/ artworks, a very large, high-ceilinged bedroom and a small but well laid-out bathroom that included a little TV set into the wall. Towels were thick, there was good natural light, the bath was large enough - all the boxes ticked. When it came to time to go out for dinner we opened the latest copy of ""Time Out"" magazine to look for recommended London restaurants and the very first one on the list was the hotel's own restaurant! We wouldn't normally eat in a hotel restaurant in that part of London, since there is so much choice in the area but it was an easy option and we were glad that we did. The food was a kind of modern British in style and really well done. My wife is vegetarian and sometimes choices can be rather limited for veggies but there were several tempting options and she really enjoyed her food. I had a great steak.  All in all, it was a great hotel for our break: comfortable, intimate, romantic, unstuffy and slightly pampering.",5,2013,07,02
113,A Superb Hotel in every way.,"I have stayed at this very "" stylish""  Doyle Kensington Hotel many times, without question it is my favourite hotel in London.
Drinks at the Bar are  so ejoyable with Staff who are so professionally trained, same applies at Reception area. Location is superb for Museums, Shopping and more.",5,2013,07,01
113,Would never stay there again,"Parts of staying at this hotel were nice, but overall not a pleasant experience. I had to hold my breath every time I went through the lobby because the place was so perfumed that it gave me an instant headache. Honestly smelled like a perfume store, not a hotel. When we got to the room, the smell was just as strong. I had to throw out all the soap and shampoo outside, so that I could breathe. I didn't want the maid to come in and replace anything I threw out, so we kept a Do Not Disturb sign on the door, which they refused to honor (see below). Very snobby place and I would never stay there again.     

Positives:
Comfy beds
Excellent room service and food
Helpful concierge
Good neighborhood with close grocery store and pharmacy
Easy walk to museums, tube station and Harrods
Taxis right outside the doors   

Negatives:
Heavily perfumed lobby
Heavily perfumed soap and shampoo
Lack of privacy. Multiple notes a day about cleaning our room, even though we had a do not disturb sign on the door. We let them clean the room on the second day and after that they completely ignored our Do Not Disturb sign for the rest of our stay. Incredibly inconsiderate of them. 
Snobby atmosphere throughout the hotel, guests and staff. We felt under dressed the whole time, even though we were dressed in business casual attire, not jeans.",2,2013,06,26
113,Perfection!,"My family had two rooms at the Kensington Hotel for three nights and it was absolutely wonderful. The staff was welcoming, the room was great and the food/service was awesome. Make sure to stop in for high tea; it was a high point in our trip.",5,2013,06,24
113,"Great Hotel, worth to stay.","My family members starts to stay in this hotel since last year, they're all highly recommend Kensington Hotel. After my 2 nights stay, I was impressive with their service, staff are nice and friendly, always responsive and the breakfast is really tasty. Also, they provide complimentary bottled water, chocolates and dessert every night which makes my stay more memorable. I plan to stay in this hotel in my next London Trip.",5,2013,06,22
113,Good Value - Good Service,Despite a room which was too small for 2 people we felt we got good value for the money in such a convenient location.  the continental breakfast included was really very good and the food there and in the restaurant was excellent.  service was very responsive and first class and the3 concierge could not have been more accommodating.,5,2013,06,20
113,Pleasant stay friendly welcome,"Just got back from a three day stay. Very pleasant and friendly welcome from the receptionist from Leigh. Did not notice her name. Bit of chit chat warm towel to refresh on arrival.
May be me as I always feel a little uncormfotable in five star hotels(only occasionally di so here when other obviously well know guests were addressed by name). That isnt a complaint as it is good that they do this. Room was deluxe room with coffee machine on fifth floor. Pleasant room reasonable size good bathroom and products. Slight criticism was that it would be nice to have a complimentary bottle of water as the London Air seems so dry being used of the south west freshness.
Good breakfast (should be at the price) Five minute walk from Tube station and close to museums and royal albert hall.

Friendly staff alround with northern irish gentleman looking after bar and restaraunt happy to give tips on local eateries and how to get bargains in london pubs etc etc 

Very quiet and had three excellent nights sleep.Not sure I would stay again but that is down to  being a tight northerner. However very relaxing experience",5,2013,06,18
113,"Fantastic Service, Fantastic Hotel","I stayed here while in London on business recently and i was very impressed by this hotel. It was a nice evening and i had decided to walk to the hotel, when i arrived i was obviously a little flushed and the receptionist too the trouble to provide me with a refreshing towel as i was checking in. This set the tone for my stay and i wasn't disappointed. 

The room was a little small but well furnished and maintained, I didn't eat in the restaurant but i took a look at the menu and it looked tasty.

Overall The Kensington is a quality hotel that's worth visiting.",5,2013,06,16
113,Excellent stay in charming Townhouse Hotel,"My friend and I stayed there for one night as a Girls treat and had a great experience. From check in to check out everything was top notch! We had dinner in Aubrey Restaurant and loved the food and service. Alessandro the barman came personally to recommend a wine to go with our selected dishes. 
The rooms are very comfortable and stylish. We stayed in a suite with a four poster bed and a free standing bathtub. Lovely! After a good night sleep we decided to have Breakfast in bed. It was delivered on time, hot and with a smile. 
The staff at reception was always friendly and ready to assist you with anything you could have asked for. A special and personal touch was the doormen remembering our names as we left and returned to the Hotel. We did not have the chance to try the Afternoon Tea but will do so on our next stay which will hopefully be soon. Thank you Kensington Team for a great stay! We will be back!",5,2013,06,15
113,Excellent service!,"Kudos to The Kensington Hotel for excellent customer service! My son accidentally left a shirt in our hotel room. I emailed the hotel and the front office manager, Ms. Gillian O'Loughlin, promptly found the shirt. She is personally sending it to me. I will certainly visit the Kensington again. Five Stars!",5,2013,06,15
113,Excellent Stay,"I frequently stay here with work and I have never had a bad experience. Nice rooms, excellent food and good service. The hotel is only a 5 minute walk from the tube station and the location is ideal for central London.",5,2013,06,14
113,Great hotel,"I stayed at the Kensington for one night, having stayed there once before. I was given an upgrade to a much larger room. The staff were all very helpful, polite and went out of their way to make guests feel welcome. This hotel is such a welcome change from the bland, identikit hotels that one usually finds. It has a really relaxed atmosphere and gives really good value for money in a great location just a few minutes walk from South Ken tube. I would certainly stay here again. ",5,2013,06,14
113,Kensington style,"Please see review below! You will find it under tips for travellers. This was my second stay at the Kensington and will not be my last. Such an enjoyable experience! It was so easy to have breakfast available each day and ""room service"" for those nights when you are too exhausted to eat out. The rooms are very comfortable and quiet and the location of the hotel would suit any tourist's needs.",4,2013,06,14
113,Lovely Kensington hotel,"We recently stayed for 4 nights at the end of a 4 week overseas trip from Australia. We were keen to stay here again as we enjoyed it 18 months ago after it had just been refurbished. The leisurely London package works very well for us with the breakfast each day & the 3pm late checkout. Perfect before the 10pm long haul flight home. To be honest we felt our experience was still good but not quite as good as last time. ? The hotel has just got a little busy since then. Maybe last time we were generously given a much better room as when we were shown to our room on Sun 2nd we were very disappointed. Being an angular shape, with a king bed as requested there was not sufficient room to open 2 suitcases. We had a fair amount in the cases after travelling for 4 weeks! We hadn't come to London for 1 night which would have been okay. We were duly shown another room which was better but still small so we paid to upgrade. This room was a good size but on the first floor overlooked walls & pipes, consequently it had frosted glass in the bottom windows. Breakfast seemed a bit hectic as it is now confined to one room & the front area only. Personally I think it worked better as it was before especially when you mix guests with those just there for business meetings(often loudly mixed with mobile phone calls!) at the next table. The Staff are all very friendly & helpful & I recommended this hotel to many people after our last visit. The proviso this time would be check on the room first. Arriving on a Sunday at 3pm I think that we despite booking months before got the last one.",4,2013,06,11
113,Excellent customer service,We stayed at The Kensington for one night as we were going to a concert at the Albert Hall which is within easy walking distance. From the moment we entered the hotel the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We were given a free upgrade to a superior room and the bed was amazingly comfortable. The hotel itself was welcoming in every aspect and the breakfast was superb. Thank you and well done The Kensington! We will be back.,5,2013,06,09
113,Mixed bag and hard to truly recommend this place,"At first blush the hotel looks lovely - a charming house and wonderful decor. But the problems started almost immediately when i walked into a room the size of a prison cell. No desk, no drawers, a tiny bathroom and a totally claustrophobic feel. I asked the reception to move me to a different room and the second room was lovely - large, comfortable and it had a desk... but still no drawers. Not sure why this hotel doesn't think travelers need a place to unpack other than hang their clothes. The other problem was the sink was borderline clogged. Water takes forever to clear the sink so if you brush teeth you need to wait 5 mins before you can shave. Three times they came to unclog the sink but nothing changed. They finally told me they have ""slow pipes"". Really??? 
Breakfast was very nice and the gym is surprisingly large and useful for such a boutique hotel. Beds are comfortable and there's free wi-fi with good strength.
I should add that i was also asked if i want a newspaper in the morning and i said yes but it took three days for them to get my newspaper actually delivered to me. So clearly there's some issues with service as well.
In terms of location the hotel is a 5 minute walk to the underground. Taxis are a BIG issue - it took me between 15 and 25 minutes each morning to get a taxi and the hotel has no service to call a taxi for you and that is a serious problem as it made me constantly late to meetings.
Bottom line - there's a lot to like here but the lack of drawers which meant living out of my suitcase, and the ""slow pipes"" and the inability to get a taxi in the morning make it hard to give this hotel a strong review. 
I think there's better options in the west London area and i will probably explore those on my next visit.",3,2013,06,08
113,Felt like a Queen,"Great hotel, great location, but I also had a great room, beautiful bathroom , suppilies for afternoon tea in my room, great wi-fi, beautiful view, lovely bar and Resturant downstairs. I did book this hotel early through Hotels.com and my rate was pretty good, this together with getting such a nice hotel at a good price definitely made my time there awesome . I have learned one trick when traveling alone, book for two this way you don't get the revamped broom closet usually reserved for the solo guest.",5,2013,06,07
113,LOVED!,"I cannot say how much I loved this hotel! Although I have always wanted to visit London, I almost did not want to leave this hotel! 

We arrived on a very rainy Tuesday from Paris, and we were met with a remarkable bellman with umbrellas and helped us in with our luggage. I was amazed by the lobby and the beautiful detail put in to making it rich and welcoming. They even had candles lit to make it cozy and warm. We were greeted with hot towels and check in was fast and easy. We were escorted to our room (a superior room located on the 3rd floor) and given a brief tour of the hotel so we knew where to go for what. 

The room is beautiful and very clean. More than enough room to be comfortable and the bed was made with rich thread count sheets. The bathroom is well appointed and a very nice size. The double door closet has a motion activated light and dressing mirrors along with a stocked mini-fridge and coffee/tea products. 

All of the hotel employees remembered our names and our drinks. The staff were of the highest calibur and I was very impressed each and every one. 

I had tea in the amazing lobby every afternoon and came down before bed for chamomile tea. The tea service and lobby is luxury. We had dinner there and the food was top notch. 

The location is prime for the bus, tube and taxis. Walking around the corners finds great shopping and dining. 

Every night, we had turn down where we were welcomed in our room to soft lighting, music and very yummy truffles. 

I would recommend this hotel to everyone and can not say enough of how much I enjoyed our stay.",5,2013,06,06
113,"Lovely hotel, excellent location","My husband and I really enjoyed our 2-night stay at The Kensington. Everything - from the room's decor, size, amenities, ambience, overall service - can only be described as excellent. The staff - at all levels, from the porter to the concierge - deserve a special mention for the exemplary level of service provided. When I came back from my morning jog, the bellman was there with a bottle of water and a small towel for me. When I needed space in the mini bar for my own drinks and yogurt, housekeeping delivered another mini fridge to our room. The location is conveniently close to South Ken station, Hyde Park, Knightsbridge, etc., yet the neighbourhood is so pleasant and relatively quiet. We love this hotel and will definitely want to stay there again the next time we are in London!",5,2013,06,05
113,Fantastic hotel!,"Me and my girlfriend stayed at The Kensington Hotel for one night and had a fantastic stay. The room we were given was both spacious and stylish. All the amenities were lovely, the turndown service the hotel offers is a lovely touch. On the Sunday evening we dined in The Aubrey Restaurant, an experience I would recommend to all guests in the hotel. The quality of the food was superb and the prices were reasonable when you consider your location. Following dinner we were served fantastic cocktails in the hotels bar. Overall we had the perfect stay and on our next trip to London we will definitely be choosing the Kensington hotel again!",5,2013,06,04
113,A beautiful hotel,"Just had an amazing weekend with friends, would highly recommended this hotel to anybody. The hotel was immaculate and the staff were  friendly and very accommodating. The location is perfect and looking forward to staying there again.",5,2013,06,03
113,Very good stay and close to attractions but painfully small room...,"We know the area very well and love staying in West London. Our usual hotel (Ampersand) was fully booked but this seemed a good alternative as we found an offer that included full breakfast. As it happens the breakfast wasn't much to speak about - very hearty but no better than any average gastro pub.
Upon arrival first impressions are very good and the service is excellent - and gains the hotel its fourth star. From concierge, to reception to maid service there is a consistent adherence to excellence which is lovely to experience.
Sadly the room could not match this as we were placed in the tiniest of small box rooms, with a double bed barely squeezed in the room - leaving no room for all your Harrods shopping bags. The facilities were good though, just a shower but all beautifully sparkling. The mini fridge was a let-down - you couldn't use it as it was more like a vending machine for over priced cans of coke (get your refreshments across the street)
The bed was most comfy however, and made up for a lot. Our view was awful - just air vents and brick walls. But it was hard to stay cross with such a lovely bunch of people - and this goes to show you how important customer service really is.",4,2013,06,02
113,Best 1st Time,My fianc√© and I visited London for our first time and staying at the Kensington helped make this an awesome experience. The service was very good and the rooms were nice. The location is perfect and if you want a wonderful time in London this will enhance your stay.,5,2013,05,31
113,Great hotel for a special occasion in a prime location.,"Similar to another review on TripAdvisor we stayed in the Kensington for a special anniversary.  They looked after us beyond any expectation.  We received a double upgrade staying in a fab junior suite. Shiraz and chocolates in the suite and simply amazing service begining to end. Staff were helpful with queries on transport, places to eat and shows. The hotel is impeccably maintained and lives up to its high rating. We will return next time we are in London. ¬†",5,2013,05,29
113,what a way to spend our special occasion,"We have just arrived back from a night at the Kensington hotel to celebrate our wedding anniversary and my birthday. We were so impressed by the hotel, the staff were so warm and welcoming and went out of their way to help in any way that they could. We were upgraded to a suite which was a really wonderful room with a luxurious bathroom. The hotel had even left us a bottle of wine, chocolates and a fruit bowl to celebrate our occasion which made us feel really special. The hotel provided all the little extras that you could wish for including wonderful cosmetics and a great coffee maker in the rooms. We enjoyed wonderful cocktails at the bar and the breakfast was superb. I would definetly recommend friends to stay at this hotel and hope it is not too long untl we will be able to return again.",5,2013,05,27
113,A truly memorable experience,"My wife and I stayed at The Kensington Hotel in May 2012 and again in May 2013.  During our first visit, we reserved a Superior Room, which was decidedly on the small side.  For our second visit, we stayed in a fifth floor Studio Suite, which was a spacious and very comfortable accommodation.

Our first visit to The Kensington Hotel was less than what we expected.  However, we decided to stay there again, in large part because of a much appreciated outreach by Ansis Picka, the hotel‚Äôs Guest Relations Manager.

We are very glad that we decided to return.  The service at The Kensington Hotel was superb.  There was a noticeable and consistent emphasis on caring for guests which covered all aspects of our hotel experience.  For example, one concierge was extremely helpful in assisting with a day trip to Cambridge, while another concierge made a well-considered recommendation for a very good Indian restaurant in the neighborhood (Thali on Old Brompton Road).  Room service and the nightly turndown service were both outstanding.  The hosts and the servers for breakfast at the hotel were excellent.  Our request to have clothes laundered was handled immediately.  We appreciated receiving a hand-delivered weather report each evening for the following day.  Every employee we encountered was polite and attentive.  We also had several opportunities to interact with Mr. Picka, who helped make our stay a truly memorable experience.

The Kensington Hotel is in a nice neighborhood and is close to the South Kensington tube station, while also being within reasonable walking distance of the Royal Albert Hall, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Natural History Museum, Kensington Palace, Kensington Gardens, and much more.   

Our stay at The Kensington Hotel certainly contributed to a wonderful time in London‚Äîand, without any hesitation, we will stay at that hotel again during our next visit to London.",5,2013,05,27
113,Our third stay at the Kensington,"Our last break in London, we stayed elsewhere - and regretted it.  Back to the Kensington and its high standards and faultless service.  Its location is great for the myriad shops of Kensington and Chelsea, the V&A, Albert Hall and lovely carefree walking.  The hotel itself is beautifully maintained and spotless in all areas.  I don't know what or who is motivating the staff here but they do really seem to care for their guests and anticipate your every need.  Whatever their job, they are doing it professionally and with care.  Rooms are, as some say, not large but we are in central London and who wants to spend other than sleeping time in a hotel room.  The lounges offer such comfort, it is pleasant to read and have refreshments in any of them.  We do not hesitate to recommend this hotel and will certainly return.",5,2013,05,24
113,The Kensington Hotel,"From the street The Kensington Hotel has a very charming entrance in a rather quiet neighborhood.  The lobby is a bit garish with a bold red wall behind the front reception desk.  We arrived quite late at night and were very warmly welcomed.  After quickly settling in our very tiny room we went down to the bar where we had a nice late night snack and drinks.  The bar and sitting areas are very attractively traditional which we like very much.  Our room, as mentioned before, was very small...  It would have been nice if there had been a chair and bottled water...  plus, the shower was tiny...  From our room was a view of an architecturally attractive hotel across the street.  The location is a bit remote, however, we enjoy walking so it did not prevent us from reaching our desired locations mostly by foot.  Overall for London prices, it was probably a good value.",4,2013,05,24
113,Small room overwhelmed by world class service,"On a scale of 1 to 5 we would rate it a 10.
The room was small. Not one drawer in the room.
The service provided by the staff could not be better. We had some issues with something left at home and the staff did everything possible to help.
Location is superb. Breakfast was wonderful.
A special thank you to a concierge named Martyn, very very good. Whatever he makes, give him a raise.
Now if you could have made it rain less...",5,2013,05,23
113,Great hotel and convenient neighbourhood!,"Very helpful staff! We arrived early on a Sunday morning and hoped to be able to drop off our bags until check in. We were able to check in right away and also received a free upgrade of our room. The hotel was in a lovely neighbourhood and was close to lots of good restaurants, the subway and museums. Great spot!",5,2013,05,23
113,Perfect location for shopping in Kensington and Knightsbridge,"Beautiful hotel in Kensington, quite well located for shopping or sightseeing in Kensington and Knightsbridge.4 minutes walk from South Kensington tube station, but you can also walk to Kings Road in maximum 15 minutes.Rooms extremely small. We had booked a room with a double bed (for 2 adults), when we arrived we were told that we had got an upgrade. The room was beautiful and clean. The bed was maximum 1,60 meters wide, so a bit tight for us as we are used to a much larger bed.The first 2 nights we both woke up regularly as we had no space, and the mattress was really hard, but then we got used to it.The handrail in the bath that was installed to help you get into the bath was loose, so the first time I tried to climb into the bath to shower,I stumbled back, as I was holding the handrail in my hand. I laid the handrail next to the bath, hoping that it would get fixed the other day to avoid an accident, but no. unfortunately during our 3 night stay,I checked each time, but as I laid the handrail next to the bath to show that it was not attached to the wall and absolutely not safe, the staff just put it back to the wall,not caring that a guest who would really need to use it, might have an accident and get hurt.Breakfast was good, choice was classical. Staff in the lobby was lovely, always a 100% attentive.Bar staff were not so great, we always had to get up and go to the bar ourselves to order a drink...",4,2013,05,22
113,Superb,"I enjoyed my stay here tremendously, and the hotel keeps its promise of serving as your home in London. The rooms are small and could use a comfy chair, but the staff are all top notch and hit all their marks.The reception desk staff and bell captains were terrific, and the housekeeping was among the best I've ever seen. Location is perfect -- on several good Underground lines -- handy for midday stop-offs.  No deficiencies at all; anything lacking might better be ascribed to my own idiosyncrasies (the evening turn down service can rattle a sleep deprived, time-zone-challenged traveler). I had an extremely satisfying and restorative stay here. Among my best hotel stays ever.",4,2013,05,18
113,Lovely hotel in a great location,"My partner and I stayed here for a long weekend, and overall I was really pleased with our choice. The good points:

- The location is excellent - a short walk to the tube stop, or to several of London's major museums, and is quiet and attractive with lots of good places to eat. 
- With regard to the hotel itself, the reception, lounge, bar and dining areas are very chic and luxe, but without feeling too stuffy or pretentious. 
- Our room (on the fifth floor) was very quiet, clean, attractive and comfortable.
- The staff we encountered were very polite and friendly. 
- My partner's birthday was acknowledged with a card and fruit platter left in the room. 

However, there are a few little things that I think the hotel could improve on (and which are the reason for me giving 4/5 rather than 5/5):
- I had booked a superior double room, and although pleasant, it was perhaps smaller than I was expecting - the bathroom in particular was quite small.
- There was very little storage space for clothes in the room - about 6 hangers and no drawer space except a couple of baskets on a shelf (which for two of us just for a weekend was a bit limiting... think we would have struggled if we'd been staying for any longer!). The room would benefit from a small chest of drawers or something similar. 
- The breakfast was good, but I didn't feel that it was particularly good value for money (¬£21 per person for full English plus items from buffet) - there just wasn't a huge amount to the cooked breakfast, and it looked oddly stingy to us...! (eg. 1 small sausage, 1 small half tomato...)
- Also, minor point, but I felt that for the price (which is not extortionate for London, but not cheap either!) I might've expected a few more complementary items - eg. some free mini bar items, perhaps some more toiletry items...
- Finally, although the staff were really nice, for some reason it had been assumed that my boyfriend and I were married although I'd never indicated this - I was referred to as 'Mrs' at various points, and my boyfriend was referred to by my surname... which I found quite amusing! Although it didn't bother us enough to make an issue out of it, I guess it might be worth considering that some people might take offence to this...?! 

Despite these relatively minor points, we really enjoyed our stay, and would definitely return on future trips to London.",4,2013,05,15
113,Great hotel,"Coming all the way from New Zealand and after hours of flying, it was a relief to arrive at the Kensington Hotel and be warmly greeted, along with some hot towels to freshen ourselves while checking in. They even gave us a free upgrade, which was most welcome. Beautifully presented hotel. All the hotel staff were very friendly & accommodating.  Our daughter & niece arrived later to meet up with us, and we went to the bar to enjoy some of their award winning cocktails, which were a hit with the girls. Handy to the tube, and great restaurants in the area worth trying. (Make sure you visit the Italian restaurant Rocca). Would definitelly stay here again",5,2013,05,14
113,Worth the money,The staff at the Kensington is wonderful. Friendly and helpful.  We had daily breakfast included with our stay and it was excellent.  We had a basic room which is small but I think pretty typical for the area.  Common areas are quite nice as well.  I went slightly over my travel budget to stay at the Kensington because it got very good reviews and I wanted to make sure I was comfortable during my week in London.  I was very glad I did.,5,2013,05,14
113,"Perfect Place, People, and Price!","Do not hesitate to stay at the kensington hotel!  we were 2 first-timers to london, and this hotel was perfect in every way - location, the staff, and the price!  Concierges vincent and martyn were super helpful with advising us about tours, the tube, and walking directions.  yes, the rooms can be small - but that's european hotels in general.  the lobby is welcoming and has a wonderful scent.  the neighborhood was super fab - quiet and clean and near 2 tube stops on the yellow circle line, and walking distance to several streets with good restaurants and lively cafes, and also near the natural history museum.  we also walked to harrods - which really wasn't that fantastic a store but we did find a great restaurant near the store - brompton asian brasserie....we are planning on returning to london next year and will certainly book the kensington!  our room had a comfy king bed, and a large bathroom and was very quiet - facing out to the courtyard.  the price was amazing - 132 GBP per night.  every staff member was helpful and friendly!  the air conditioning was also very quiet - which is a pet peeve of mine - i really hate it when the AC switches on and off loudly all night.  we were very happy not to be staying at a 'chain' hotel like a marriott or a radisson - so give the kensington hotel a try!  you won't be disappointed!  it's absolutely LOVELY!",5,2013,05,12
113,Luxury...,"We booked this hotel via a luxury hotel website... And boy did it have the Wow factor. The seating and bar areas were not too ostentatious but were luxurious and inviting. the staff were excellent, especially reception and the porters who we dealt with a fair bit! They were on hand with a map and advice with what we should see and do!
We had dinner and cocktails which were lovely and there was a good selection of tipples on offer. breakfast was enormous and we ate in our room which was also great. The bedroom was furnished to a high standard but the bathroom wasn't as amazing as it could have been, although it still has a TV by the bath (not all channels worked) and his n hers sinks, heated mirrors etc.
The location of the hotel is fab and serves as a good base for exploring. Can't wait to go back and try some more cocktails - and of course, afternoon tea!!!!!!!!",5,2013,05,07
113,A real gem,"The Kensington Hotel part of the Doyle Collection is conveniently situated between South Ken Tube and the Natural History Museum. It is billed as a Town House Hotel and certainly oozes charm and character often missing in some of London's larger prestigious hotels. From the pleasantly perfumed reception dest to the beautifully appointed rooms this hotel feels special. The bar and restaurant area is wonderful. I only ate from the bar menu but the food was really good and very reasonably priced. The staff were able to accommodate me when I requested something which wasn't on the the menu too, which I always think is the mark of a good establishment! The gym facilities were good and usually quite which is a good thing! The overall service was of a level which would have embarrassed many of London's better known hotels. If I could level a criticism it would be that my room, though charming, was very small indeed and there was effectively no clothes storage apart from a tiny hanging wardrobe, shared with a folding suitcase rack (Though exactly where you were supposed to put this up I have no idea!). The bathroom, likewise, was tiny with only a shower and no bath (Though a high quality and perfectly good shower none the less!). I had booked a ""Superior Double"" so exactly what you get from a standard room I cannot imagine. For a single guest it was more than adequate. I think two guests would get in each other's way!",5,2013,05,05
113,Beware - Cleaning Staff Steals,"We stayed at The Kensington last week.  An otherwise nice stay was ruined because someone on the staff stole a diamond necklace out of our luggage.  The piece was hidden in a very discrete part of the luggage and would only have been found by someone conducting a complete search of our belongings.  The manager insisted that his staff would not have done such a thing, but the item was stolen.  I would not post a negative review of this nature unless we were absolutely certain.  We also filed a police report, but the staff denied it.  Unfortunately the culprit is still working there and I could not recommend staying at this hotel as a result.",1,2013,04,28
113,Delightful hotel in a beautiful part of London,"The common areas - bar and lounge, reception, restaurants - are inviting, elegant and cosy. Staff are attentive and friendly. The rooms are well appointed, though I missed a bedside clock and a long mirror in the room I stayed in. And if that is all I have to complain about then this is a very good hotel indeed! One certainly worth returning to and recommending.",4,2013,04,27
113,Great Hotel for Woman Traveling Solo,"I missed my Gatwick flight was was in a pinch about where to spend the night while I waited for the next flight.  My cabby suggested The Kensington Hotel.  I'm so glad he did.  I checked into the hotel with no reservation - was given a competitive rate - and immediate assistance re-booking my missed flight.  The staff were delightful and very helpful.  They suggested I visit Victoria & Albert Museum ... and then get a manicure around the corner from the hotel ... and make it back in time for tea.   I felt like I was dealing with family members.  
My room was elegant and airy and big - and not overly designed and quirky.  The bed was heavenly.  The downstairs lobby area is what a London hotel should look like ... it has many seating areas where you can tuck in with a book by a fireplace, have a cup of tea and/or meet friends.  It's filled with art and crystal and big furniture - and it's all newly up-dated - but again, it isn't quirky, edgy or precious.   Anyone will feel comfortable there ... including a single woman traveler who is stranded overnight.  It is the perfect London experience!   My only complaint is that there was little or no information about a hotel pool ... or any of the gym facilities.   Also, there was no information about check-out times in the room ... but really, I think I'm just reaching for something to critique here.",5,2013,04,27

113,Great find in South Kensington,"I've stayed at the The Kensington Hotel on a number of occasions for my work travel.  The staff is incredibly friendly, the rooms are fine on size (I've never had an issue), and the design of the hotel is both trendy and comfortable.  It‚Äôs become one of our London favorites.",5,2013,04,25
113,Brilliant Hotel,"We organised a conference in the hotel with a number of guests also staying at the hotel.

113,lovely stay for our Anniversary,"lovely hotel in a great spot for the Museums, and nice restaurants as well as any other needs you might have.close by. Short walk to the Tube from the Hotel. Best part of it  all was Martyn the concierge. He made our anniversary stay at the hotel very special. He is an absolute delight and there was nothing he wouldnt do to make our stay perfect in every way. The hotel should make sure to keep this gentleman employed there. A fine representative for a quality hotel. . Donna and Alan",5,2013,04,23
113,"Very well maintained hotel, excellent service",We stayed for 4 days. Great service and nice boutique hotel in great location. Pleasant atmosphere in the lounge and nice Gym. Stayed in Luxury studio definitely will recommend as its very spacious and nicely decorated.  Tried the afternoon tea great value for money and nice service.,5,2013,04,21
113,Home away from Home,"Truly a very warm & welcoming stay from the beginning till the end.I would recommend this hotel to any type of traveller who is looking for high quality comfort, good food, cleanliness, politeness, friendliness & professionalism from a hotel & it's staff. I stayed at The Kensington for a whole month between March to April 2013. Even though I've stayed at the hotel many other times with my family, they always welcome us back with the same warm welcome of the first time. The hotel is a lovely family & business hotel. The deluxe rooms & suites are spacious, clean & well decorated. I have three young children & they always enjoy staying here. Everything here is equal to any 5 star hotel I've stayed at before & I have stayed at many around the world. On this trip the staff were so kind & patient in doing their best to keep me in the same room even though my travel plans were always changing last minute & it was a busy period. Every request was answered with a quick yes & no problem plus a smile! The area is also great for eating out. Transportation is easy to access. Charming place to stay.",5,2013,04,21
113,"The staff could not have been more helpful, flexible or friendly","My wife and I stayed at the Hotel over our wedding weekend (just past).

For a variety of reasons, we had a number of last minute changes and the hotel took these in their stride. Everyone from reception staff, to door men to the two beverage and food people we worked with (Gareth and Amy) to restaurant staff and housekeeping combined professionalism, excellent customer service and genuine warmth and a desire to help us out. Having stayed in many hotels on business and pleasure worldwide, I would have to rate the Kensington Hotel's staff at the very top.

Nothing was too much trouble for them, from providing a rack to hang the wedding dress, to receiving and storing our cake, to cutting and serving this, to providing vases for bouquets, to looking after our other guests, to cooking us food out of room service hours and ironing clothes at very short notice. Weddings can be stressful events and the staff at the Kensington Hotel went several extra miles to reduce our worries and make us feel relaxed and looked after. 

I haven't at this point touched on the lovely suite we stayed in and the general high standard of the decoration, furniture and ambience of the hotel. If it was possible to give six stars, I would do that.",5,2013,04,21
113,Milk & cookies....,"Amazing 5 star treatment from the moment we arrived, we got help with our luggage coming in which is welcome when travelling with young family, staff acknowledged our name from start to finish. Elegant professional but very friendly service in the breakfast and bar. Each evening they left milk and cookies for our son which was amazing. Such thought and detail, so impressed. ",5,2013,04,20
113,"The hotel is great, but staff really make it excellent","Stayed 8 nights at the hotel and loved it. Ate in the bar, enjoyed drinks in the bar, used the conceirge service - everyone seems to love their job there.  It really is a refreshing change from many other hotels I've stayed at over the years.  Great location (near Kensington High Street Tube station) lots of great restaurants, cafe's, grab and go's in the area.  For snacks or treats there is a Waitrose, Tesco, Boots etc in the area.  This is a real gem in London.  I will return.",5,2013,04,19
113,Fantastic location and staff.,"My wife and I spent 8 nights at The Kensington Hotel. We arrived from Heathrow at 8am and left our luggage and went for a walk until our room was ready. Our room was fantastic. The staff, especially the gentlemen at the front door, were incredibly helpful. Someone, query the manager, was overwhelmingly helpful very early one morning with a problem I had with a new credit card, faxing Melbourne for me at no charge. On leaving to catch Eurostar to Paris for three nights, the Doorman asked if we would like to leave the suite cases we were planning to leave at St Pancras Station, at the hotel. Saved us ¬£49 and the trouble of dragging them through the Underground. Location fantastic. We are not extravagant people but felt this grand hotel was worth every ¬£ spent. Thanks for a great stay.",5,2013,04,19
113,Amazing Hotel,"Have stayed here 3 times  - every time has been equally was amazing. 

first occasion was my first weekend with my bf in 2009 so special weekend in itself - hotel has a luxurious feel without being pretencious. the staff always make you feel welcome and nothing is too much to ask. On the first 2 occasions we had a smaller room in what i think was in top of the building, nice size rooms especailly for london with all facilities needed, the bedding was luxurious too plus lovely baths . 
the 2nd occasion again in 2011 i had my birthday, the hotel left me a lovely fruit plate and sweets with happy brithday on it, a lovely touch ( along with weather report and turn down chocolates).

the 3rd occasion to stay was in december 2012, we stayed in a lovely suite, nespresso machine, four poster bed, huge room with a seating area, we were greeted with different teas in the cutest canteens and an evening treat at turn down - another lovely touch. The hotel is particularly magical at christmas the decorations are festive but not in your face, a lovely warm atmosphere,  perfect for  arriving back in the hotel for a drink after a busy day shopping, westend musical or even visting christmas markets. 
 - can honestly there is no where else i prefer though i am biased as my bf proposed sitting in the back reception room sitting by the fire right by the christmas tree so the hotel will always feel magical for us . 
the cocktails are amazing as are all the drinks, staff are always attentive but not intrusive, have enjoyed lunch a few times but not dinner yet - as there is an array of local restaurants to try. 
hope to be back for our minimoon  - by far my favourite hotel in the world",5,2013,04,19
113,7 star hotel masquerading as a 4/5 star hotel.,"Well, this was pleasant surprise for London hotels and I have stayed in a few! I am not going to repeat the many deserving accolades this hotel has already received on Trip Advisor but it stands comfortably alongside the best hotels in Europe. Two things stood out. The courtesy of the staff and the bedroom decor. One other thing that this hotel does not promote. Outside the front door is a bicycle stand from which you can rent a bicycle for ¬£2 per day with your credit card. Great way to get about.",5,2013,04,17
113,Excellent hotel experience,A hotel with ambience and style without being too pretentious. Very comfortable with quality furnishings made our stay relaxing in a great location. A ¬£10 black cab fare gets you to Victoria or Oxford Street. We did not have time to find the pool or gym but will next time.,5,2013,04,14
113,"Good hotel, great location","Recently stayed at this hotel. Location is really good for hyde park, Royal Albert Hall and museums and with two tube stations nearby getting around is easy. Lots of places to eat and drink in the surrounding area. We eat at Wildwood a really nice italian on Gloucester Road.
Welcome was very good, staff professional and attentive. Internally the hotel is very nice and food was generally excellent. We booked a superior room but felt that this was a little small for this class of room and lacked one or two basic facilities, such as adequate drawer space and an iron in the room, although this was available from housekeeping. Room was quiet and bed comfortable though. Overall enjoyed our stay here.",4,2013,04,12
113,The very Best,"We had a lovely stay at the Kensington Hotel.  This is our third visit to the hotel, it is a good bit larger than it was on our last visit, however, just as wonderful.... EVERYONE was super, the bellman at the beginning, the front desk, the concierge, the dining room...almost always eating in your hotel is a no no, not here, it was wonderful. The cocktail lounge and lobby operated so smoothly, you want for nothing and Mitchell, a wonderful Italian guy was great as the bar/lounge host.  Please give the hotel a try!!!",5,2013,04,12
113,Great hotel shame about management,"We have stated at the kensington a couple of times, the first time we had a recently painted tiny room with a broken shower door, this was rectified after I got paint on me! They dealt with it very well. Next booking - wanted to take advantage of their price match - they ignored it! After several phone calls to head office it was sorted. I then had another issue which prompted me to contact the hotel on another reservation -  email ignored, email to head office - ignored, letter to head office - ignored!!  Such a shame for a nice hotel with great staff that they are not backed up by their head office and that the hotel don't bother to answer emails. So I wouldn't support any business that has this attitude towards their customers. This review is based upon many experiences, and as I said it is a nice hotel with great staff. But their are many hotels in London that really do care! I sent an email recently to a hotel to say what a lovely stay we had on London (we are here a lot) response - they would pass this into their staff and a lovely thank you. -  don't expect that from the kensington!!",4,2013,04,11
113,A wonderful hotel and an excellent location!,"We chose this hotel because of the excellent location (proximity to several restaurants, South Kensington tube station, and the museums just north of it).  As with many international travellers, we arrived at 9 am and our rooms were not ready -- we knew this was a distinct possibility, so we did a little sight seeing to fill the time.  The staff was so apologetic that they upgraded one of our rooms.

The staff could not have been more helpful.  On Easter, they had an egg hunt for all the kids in the lobby with HUGE chocolate eggs to be found.  There were great places to eat (all sorts of food), and the South Kensington tube station has three lines that will take you just about anywhere you want to go without having to change trains.  There were only two drawbacks: (1) the size of the regular room is European -- not small, but not what we are used to in the US; and (2) there was very little drawer space to unpack clothing.  That being said, I would stay here again and again.",5,2013,04,11
113,Good London Location For Family Trip,"Irish hotel group The Doyle Collection has invested a lot of money in their London properties and it shows in the Kensington Hotel. The lobby/check in area at street level leads into two very large drawing rooms adorned with comfortable sofas and armchairs. The ambience invites guests to linger to read a paper or have a chat and a cup of tea, and they do. The dark, interior bar is well appointed and Martinis are a specialty.

We were on a family visit, taking two rooms, one of the kids and one for mum and dad. The Superior room for the folks was good - not enormously big but the bed was very comfortable. The kids'; room two doors down was dark and looked out onto the hotel's aircon system; presumably the hotel has 'ordinary' rooms with a better vista. The Kensington's staff are genuinely friendly and helpful and the breakfast was very good (try the waffles).

The Kensington is a five minute walk from South Kensington tube station, which is on the Picadilly line - handy if you're coming from Heathrow or going into the west end. Around the corner from the hotel on the Brompton Road are a range of restaurants that suit budget family dining, plus small supermarkets if you want to buy supplies. In the other direction, seven minutes away on foot, are a number of museums, including the superb Victoria & Albert (hint: book weeks in advance if you want to see the David Bowie exhibition).

Overall the Kensington Hotel is friendly and relaxing, the kind of place you wouldn't mind returning to, so long as the price is right.",5,2013,04,09
113,Excellent Hospitality!,"Lovely Hotel I would stay again in a heartbeat. The level of hospitality was superior, I felt very well taken care of. My room was small but I didn't mind at all, the view was of the Natural History museum which was gorgeous and my bed comfortable. Location was optimal as I was there on business and was perfect for going in between Notting Hill and Chelsea. The staff catered to all of my questions and requests without hesitation and the service at the restaurant, which we ate at every night was impeccable. Thank you to The Kensington for an outstanding stay.",5,2013,04,09
113,Location Location!,"Peter and i stayed here last year. You cant go wrong as its a great location. Walking distance to plenty of restaurants, cafes, shops and siteseeing attractions. Cosy rooms and a very relaxed foyer leading into a lounge and bar with open fires making it a typical English classic feel!  Staff are very helpful and you will be well taken care off!",4,2013,04,09
113,"Wonderful hotel, nice service",Stayed with my family in the hotel during Easter weekend and had a great time. Very close to all the museums and central London its a perfect place to stay while in London. The staff attitude is amazing and you can see genuinely they care for the customers. Liked the turn down service with tea and Easter egg hunt on Sunday. My son enjoyed the experience very much. Thanks,5,2013,04,07
113,best London experience we've had,"We love doing city trips and always manage our expectations when staying at a central hotel in a big city like London. However for once we were very positively surprised. The location of the hotel is obviously perfect. Nicely situated in the Kensington area, close to the tube and great for walking. (But it's also not too central, were it gets annoyingly busy, like Covent Garden.) Best area to stay in London.
The positive surprise came however that, compared to other hotels in this price category, the rooms are very nice and especially the staff is very friendly. We asked for a late check out, some help with restaurants and everyone was helpful and knowledgeable. Definitely recommend it for a weekend away!",5,2013,04,06
113,Nicest staff ever!,Stayed in hotel on Easter bank holiday weekend for my girlfriend's birthday. Had told hotel it was her birthday and a lovely card and fruit/chocolate plate was in the room when we got there. They also arranged to have flowers in the room at my request. Irina on reception was lovely and friendly to us on check-in and throughout our stay. Had beautiful meal in restaurant where James took great care of us. Would absolutely recommend the hotel to anyone and would love to return. Top marks all round!!,5,2013,04,06
113,"Chic, convenient, and great price!","I love the Kensington. I stay there every time I visit my daughter who lives in Chelsea. The Kensington is a wonderful hotel, the staff are super accommodating, and the rooms are lovely. I stay here probably 4 or 5 times a year and I never have had a bad stay. The Aubrey Doyle bar is really gorgeous and has an amazing mixologist, Allesandro. The food is also delicious. Make sure to order the brownie sundae!",5,2013,04,05
113,Excellent stay...,This was my second stay. On business this time. Great staff remembered my preference for room and arranged without asking. Nice to see the restaurant staff recognising and welcoming. Closer to tube station and not far fron central london its a great place to stay.,5,2013,04,04
113,"Relatively convenient, nice folks, pleasant stay","Had two superior rooms for a week.  Wonderfully welcoming staff, nice concierge. The rooms are small, but not necessarily small for London.  Not a great deal of storage.
Room noise was OK.  I think I'd request a room away from the elevator, as hall-walking was fairly creaky-sounding.  On the 4th floor, little exterior noise to speak of, even though we were on the street side. 
I loved the area.  Tube stop 400 yards away, seemed like a quite safe walk. We had dinner near the hotel (french, italian, and gastropub), and were very happy.  
I didn't use the restaurant, bar, or gym, but my wife was happy with the bar (but expensive).
The sitting room was large, had a fire and multiple newspapers, and comfy chairs and couches.",5,2013,04,04
113,Best experience,"One of the best experience .. Stayed there on a special day.. The staff's made it more memorable & one of the best experience .. Awesome location, excellent service... Afternoon tea was highly commendable ...highly recommended..",5,2013,04,03
113,"average, not 5*","pros :  location -close to south kensington subway st , walking distance to museums, harrods
           quiet
           cheap compared to other 5*
           lovely reception /dining area 
           very attentive staff

cons :   superior room(4th floor) room 414  very very small with an almost useless wardrobe (again very small) unless we paid for superior and got standard 

             wine stained carpet , not a good look for a 5* wanna be hotel 
             tried some sandwiches of the lounge menu , just average",3,2013,04,02
113,"Warm friendly luxury hotel walking distance from Harrods, Museums and Restaurants",Our second stay in 4 months - we love this hotel. Rooms are clean spacious and child friendly. Breakfast is beautiful and very filling. Food in general is of high standard and children are well looked after. Bar is beautiful I had a personalised cocktail made by the barman and on both occasions we spent a lot of time here. Staff are all brilliant Mischa had another fan stay with the Easter hunt being a treat for her. Looking to book another stay very soon. Thank you for another pleasant stay! Maisuria family ,5,2013,04,01
113,"Very good hotel, with a few minor points","Overall, the hotel was very good and a decent value for London. The atmosphere at the hotel was a very nice one in the common areas, especially in the evenings around the fireplace :-) 

Stayed in a superior room which was on the smallish side but clean and generally well-equipped. The only thing missing really that I needed was an iron / board, which could have been provided at a hotel of this standard. 

Breakfast and room service were a little on the pricier side and not worth it - much better options on Old Brompton road. Staff were friendly and welcoming (although there was no doorman when I arrived). South Ken / Gloucester road tubes are within a 5 - 10 minute walk. Would stay here again for a similar price...",4,2013,04,01
113,Nice hotel and great staff,"Stayed over Easter weekend. Nice cozy hotel with great staff. You can see every staff genuinely care for the customers. 
Concierge, Afternoon tea and cocktails in the bar are real plus. Will stay again when in London.",5,2013,03,31
113,We have been charmed,"Just returned from a 2 night break and this will now be our hotel of choice for future stays in London. It is ideally located, minutes away from South Kensington Tube station, the Natural History Museum, Science Museum and our favourite the Victoria & Albert Museum. We stayed in a standard room, small but perfectly formed with a very comfy bed and so wonderfully quiet. Breakfast was excellent and we definitely recommend the afternoon tea. What makes this hotel stand out above the rest are the staff, who are all charming professionals and made us feel very welcome. We‚Äôll be back.",5,2013,03,31
113,Great Hotel,"The Hotel is fantatstic, I spent 2 nights and I enjoyded a lot. All the staff couldn't have been more friendly and the location very near from South Kensington Tube station.
Don't hesitate to stay at this hotel if you travel to London!",5,2013,03,28
113,Hidden gem off the High Street,"What a fantastic way to finish off my milestone trip around the world. As a solo traveller I loved the friendly welcoming vibe of this hotel. having stayed in London a number of times arriving at the Kensington was like striking gold! Such a gorgeous lobby  and the bar and lounge area was so inviting after a long day out sight seeing. My room was large by London standards and so quiet. Waking up early and heading out for a run around Hyde Park was a treat. It was the perfect base for a stay in London - I will definitely go back to the Kensington,  but I hope that my hidden gem stays exactly as that. ",5,2013,03,27
113,Great hotel in London,"I stayed here for a week and it made the trip to London very comfortable. The standard double room is small but comfortable, shower was great. The room was warm and cozy despite the cold winter temps outside. The gym is really nice for a hotel gym. Overall I would stay here again.",4,2013,03,25
113,Great stay - Excellent staff,"Spent a night in The Kensington Hotel last weekend whilst attending a wedding in London. I don't generally write reviews on hotels but have to say I was really impressed by all the staff in the hotel - from the receptionist when we arrived, the concierge and restaurant staff, they couldn't have been more friendly or helpful. I hadn't stayed in the hotel since its refurbishment, and found the room (deluxe room) comfortable, quiet and well equipped. The location is fantastic, just a couple of minutes walk from South Kensington Underground, and there is lots to see and do in the local area. Will definitely return again and would recommend to anyone visiting London.",5,2013,03,25
113,Memorable and a pleasant stay!,"Have stayed few week before for two days conference stay. They made it memorable & pleasant stay for me.. After a long travel in the flight arrived in the hotel late in the evening.. After all lookin at me the staffs at the desks understood my tiredness and made me not to wait for my check In.. And also offered me options for quick dinner as well. Even booked a wake up cal the very next morning & when I come in the morning for a enquiry of cab service, it was done already ... Amazed!
And also the bar staffs were excellent in hospitality., the ambience of a hotel is definetly appreciated...",5,2013,03,23
113,Impeccable,"We had a great stay at The Kensington Hotel. The staff was impeccable; polite, well mannered, genuine, and considerate. They came knocking at our door during late evening just to see if everything was alright, and handed us chocolates right after. The rooms were well put together, elegant, and comfortable. You'll find plush pillows, a nice wall mounted flat screen, adequate tea and toiletry supplies, an umbrella, etc. I could rave about the shower for hours. Literally, I have never been under a more amazing (rain fall) shower head. I'm a tall guy, and good hotel showers are hard to come by. The water pressure and temperature control are just perfect. Also, a section of the large bathroom mirror is anti-fog, a nice surprise. 

We didn't visit the restaurant, but have heard good things about it. The decor of the hotel is also something to note. They did a great job of staying traditional with an edge of modern, without overdoing either style. All in all, a well put together hotel. I enjoyed its location very much as well, not too loud, and busy like you'd find with hotels near/on Cromwell Road. 

I'd be surprised if there were a better hotel for the price. In fact, I can speak from experience (habing stayed at multiple London hotels) when I say that you should go for this hotel. You won't regret it. ",5,2013,03,22
113,Fantastic Hotel,"From the moment we arrived at the Kensington Hotel, my wife and I knew the place was special.  A sleek modern lobby with welcoming staff greeted us and were immediately introduced to head concierge, Ward Giroux.  Mr. Giroux assisted us with daily restaurant reservations, places of interest and when Eurostar cancelled its train service, went above and beyond to make certain we were able to return and even upgraded our new room.  Kensington‚Äôs manager, Ansis Picka also deserves special mention.  His warm nature and pleasant smile was very much appreciated during our unexpected travel plans onto Paris.  I highly recommend the Kensington and plan on staying there on our next trip to London",5,2013,03,19
113,Fantastic value,"Fabulous value at a very high standard staff were attentive without being intrusive, breakfast was very good and the room was very comfortable with nice touches. In a good location near the underground to get around London very easily. It would be hard to find anything better for price.",5,2013,03,18
113,Amazing London Hotel,"We loved this hotel, it was beautiful, well located, good value and the service was impeccable.  The doorman apologised when he was about point two of a second slow in opening the door for me, and that pretty much summed up the rest of the experience.  Book!  Go!  Stay!",5,2013,03,18
113,Truly amazing!!,"We stayed here for two nights this weekend, from the moment we arrived the staff at this hotel make you feel special. They get to know your name quickly, their attention to detail is brilliant. The room was fantastic, so clean and very comfortable. The food was lovely both at breakfast and for lunch. We also tried the room service and again were not disappointed. There was a lovely young man from Dublin who seemed to run the restuarant at breakfast and lunch and he was a brilliant ambassador for the hotel, I sincerely hope he is there next time we visit because he made this vist very special as did Tomaz who sorted our luggage. From check in to check out it was brilliant and I have rarely had such a great experience!",5,2013,03,17
113,Great base for London,"This hotel is a great base for London. It is round the corner from South Kensington tube station so only 10 mins on the tube from the west end, but far enough away to be quiet. This means there is less noise and less hassle at the tube station and the local bars, cafe's  and restaurants are more relaxed. 

The rooms are tastefully decorated but very small which was a little disappointing. However, what sets this hotel apart are the staff. They were all very welcoming and very professional. We couldn't have asked for more. The bar and restaurant are top notch with a fantastic standard of food and cocktails.

We would definitely stay again.",5,2013,03,17
113,Perfect,"We've visited some really great 5 star hotels in London - The Langham, The Landmark and some of the Firmdales, but The Kensington outdoes them all!

The service here is amazing, this is my husband and I's 2nd stay at the hotel (we had our wedding reception here last year) and they make us feel like superstars every time!

We were delighted to have been upgraded to a suite, which had a separate living area. The room was beautifully decorated with two massive flat screen TV's, a large corner sofa in the living room and the most comfy four poster bed!

We had cocktails in the Aubrey Bar which were amazing, and having eaten in the restaurant before we can most certainly recommend the gorgeous food!

The hotel staff are so courteous and helpful with any requests - from directions to restaurant bookings, nothing is too much hassle!

But it is the little details that really make the Kensington stand out. The warm hand towels on arrival, the herbal tea in a flask and cake waiting for you when you return from your evening out, the chocs on your pillow, the bottled water on departure! They really do think of everything, brining a brighter smile to your stay with every special touch!

We can not recommend this hotel enough! Since we've had our wedding reception here we've recommended the hotel to lots of friends, brought friends over for drinks there and my husband has used it to host businesses colleagues for drinks. 

The hotel itself has such a luxurious, special feel - from the decor to the gorgeous candles they have burning in the lobby (of which I noted the make and scent and have treated myself to the same at home). This is such an individual hotel, although it is part of a small chain it by no means feels like a 'chain hotel'. Stylish, boutique and glamorous!  

If you are looking for a special place to host friends and family, have a romantic weekend or celebrate a special occasion in luxury surroundings, whilst being treated like star, The Kensington is for you! And with South Kensington tube on a few moments walk around the corner, Hyde Park at the top of the road and The National History Museum two streets away, the best of London is moments away for you to explore! 

Thank you to everyone, especially Karthik for organising, yet again, an amazing experience for my husband and I! 

We can't wait to see you all again! 

Thank you - Mr and Mrs Lawrence (nee Connors)

113,"Super location, comfortable rooms.","Having stayed in this hotel when it was Jury's, the update to The Kensington has definitely put it out there with some of the best in London.  It's not cheap yet not overpriced, but it's comfortable, professional and an absolute delight to stay in.  The staff are great - just ask the concierge.",5,2013,03,14
113,Perfect,"My husband and I recently stayed for 2 nights and were very impressed with every aspect of the hotel. The service was second to none, the hotel staff were friendly and helpful, the reception and lobby area was warm and welcoming - the furniture, artwork, lighting and beautiful  fireplaces created a lovely ambience. Breakfast superb. Room immaculate. Great location for tube stations and cycle hire. Could have stayed forever and would stay again without hesitation.",5,2013,03,12
113,Ideal,"We recently came back from a 4 day stay in London. I was working and brought my two teenagers with me. The suite was perfect for the three of us. The hotel staff were warm and friendly. The lobby and bar were cozy and perfect for relaxing at the end of the day. They were very good at helping me organize things for my kids to do during the day. The bathroom was gorgeous. The location is ideal, great shops and restaurants around and located very close to the tube. We will definitely be back.",5,2013,03,10
113,Lovely!,"Stayed in February for 5 nights and was delighted.

Great location, close to 2 tube stations, was able to check in to a temporary room as our flight from Australia arrived very early in the morning, lovely breakfast at the hotel.
Overall a very pleasant experience with great staff and would certainly stay there again.",5,2013,03,09
113,Another fantastic stay,"I have stayed in the Doyle Hotel Kensington several times in the last 2 years and it continues to provide everything I need for a short stay in the capital. Arriving early I was delighted to be able to check in and get to my room before an afternoon meeting. Having signed up for the GHA loyalty programme (recommended) my details were all in check and I had to do nothing more than sign. Staff were top of their game throughout and whether it was in the bar at the end of the day, in the restaurant for dinner for the first time (the scallops, seabass and lemon drizzle cake were all delicious and reasonably priced), at check-out next morning or even the email I received later on my day of departure, I felt like a valued guest and I will most certainly be back.

Free WIFI in the rooms and although it ran a little slow at times, I was able to work throughout the time I spent in the hotel. I had a superior room this time and the extra space was appreciated. Great bathroom too and no quibbles about the shower pressure!

Piccadilly line to Gloucester Road and a short 5 minute walk is easiest if you are coming on the Tube (direct from Heathrow too if you wish) but South Kensington station is only a short walk the other way too to navigate your way around. The concierge service are always on hand in reception and nothing ever appears to be too much bother for those guys. Overall the hotel is highly recommend for anyone visiting London for a few days and if you are Irish too, it seems like the obvious choice!",5,2013,03,08
113,Amazing property and service,"We we spent one night at the hotel with our 2 years old daughter and it was perfect!Check inn was quick and welcoming ,Staff was very friedly.The hotel room itself was  very luxurious we were really impresst from the fancy interior design and the extravagant  and large Bathroom.
Room service delivert great food and service. The bed was fantastic and we had a quiet and restful sleep. The lovely braeakfast in a very comfortable dining area gave us the right start for our shopping day. 
Many thanks to everybody the stay with you was a great experience ",5,2013,03,07
113,Hidden gem,"Such a find in London, this hotel is boutique, very nicely designed but most impressive is the five star staff, they make such an impact on my 1 night stay,  from concierge to the breakfast staff, they all remembered my name which was nice. I had a junior suite which was amazing, small highlight was a nespresso machine in the room. Will be using the Kensington hotel for all my future London visits ",5,2013,03,07
113,Visit to London,"I stayed there recently and was pleased with the attentive but discreet service. Very professional. I particularly enjoyed breakfast and again here the service and the staff were excellent. 
I will certainly return to this hotel.",4,2013,03,06
113,The Perfect Hotel,"I have high expectations of any hotel. I'm a bit of a nightmare to be honest (sorry hotel people, but I am). So when I knew I had a weekend stay for social reasons in London, a city I visit weekly with work, I knew I wanted to try somewhere new so it wouldn't feel like another work trip.   Yet I know how insanely picky I can be when it comes to hotel accommodation.  

Having stayed (& enjoyed my stay)  at another Doyle Collection hotel in London in the past (The Marylebone), I felt confident taking a chance on staying at another of their hotels, as fingers crossed, The Kensington would have similarly high standards as The Marylebone?

I chose to book their Leisurely London Break.  It offered, as part of the package, a ¬£10 room credit, full breakfast options and a late check out of 3pm. Worth the extra few pounds in my opinion. 

I arrived about 6.45pm and was greeted by a friendly receptionist who immediately offered me a hot towel for my hands (just what I needed after travelling on The Tube) and welcomed me to the hotel.  I was then informed I had a complimentary upgrade to a Junior Suite which was a wonderful surprise.  I have added photos so you can see why I was so pleased.

The Junior Suite was beautiful. A four poster bed but still modern (which I like). Lots of dark wood, shades of red and luxurious fabrics.  The mini bar was fantastic  (remember your ¬£10 room credit for the hotel and/or bar) and there was a coffee machine if you like coffee. Admittedly I am  perhaps the only person in the world who doesn't like coffee, however the rest of you will love it!    The hotel has free wifi too, so you can go online and show everyone how beautiful the hotel is ;-) 

The en suite bathroom had double doors and a separate bath on one side and a power shower on the other, with double washbasins. Bathrobes and slippers were provided, as were toiletries and a plentiful supply of fluffy white towels.

The turndown service went that little stage further than expected too. Chocolates on the pillows, plus a flask of Rooibos Tea and a couple of cakes were left in the room. 

The bed was incredibly comfortable and although I had a room that overlooked the main road, the hotel was quiet and I slept soundly. In fact I didn't get disturbed once. 

The next morning I went down for breakfast and the Irish gentleman on duty was very welcoming to me.  He was attentive to myself and to other guests, remembering all our names (impressive, as you will have noticed I have forgotten his name and I apologise for that ), and the rest of the breakfast team were also friendly and attentive too. The dark haired man serving me tea and who brought me my cooked breakfast kept checking I was OK and would bring over anything needed. No need to have to wait to catch someones attention as is often the case at other hotels.  Breakfast was relaxing and the porridge tasted sensational. Almost like a dessert. The continental selection was great too. 

Sadly I had to check out early and couldn't take full advantage of my late checkout but next time I return I shall.   I was handed a bottle of water as I checked out by yet another friendly member of the reception team, and as is always the case with any Doyle Hotel, the staff genuinely seem happy to work there and it shines through.      

I didn't get chance this time to go to the bar or restaurant or gym, but shall definitely plan a return trip so that I can.  The hotel is about a 5-10 minute walk from Gloucester Road Tube station (5 if you walk fast) and the main road it is on is surprisingly quiet. There are even Boris Bikes lined up outside for the more energetic. 

I highly recommend The Kensington to anyone wanting a luxurious and relaxing hotel stay. if you are here in London for work you'll find the free wifi and facilities make your life easier, and if you are here for leisure you'll be a equally thrilled.  I'm planning my next weekend away already.",5,2013,03,05
113,"Excellent service, great location","We chose the Kensington Hotel from offers by Secret Escapes since it had good reviews and it was an ideal location for touring central London. We had a superior room which we thought was a little on the small side but well equipped. Our only gripe about the room would be the pillows - too soft to give any real support. But all of that pales into insignificance when you take the service we received into account. We were superbly looked after by James when we had an afternoon tea (which was delicious and very filling - we took the last of the cakes back to our room) in front of the fire in the lounge, and at breakfast (the cooked options were very good. As with most hotels of this standard, be aware though that if not included in your room rate - ours was - the breakfast is very expensive). James was very friendly and helpful. When he found out it was both of our birthdays during our stay he arranged for a fruit and chocolate platter to be delivered to our room which was a very nice touch.

We discovered that the hotel is in a great location, just walking distance from museums and Harrods, and close to lots of restaurants, primarily on Old Brompton Road. We had a fabulous weekend and would thoroughly recommend the Kensington for its service and location.",4,2013,03,05
113,5-star service in a place that feels like home,"I commute to London every week and used to stay at the Four seasons in Mayfair but it got sterile and superficial after a while. I tried the Kensington Hotel and it was a completely new experience. Luxury with a personal touch. I bring the kids sometimes and they are taken care of like nowhere I have ever seen before (hot milk and cookies at the turn down service, a kitchen that will make whatever they ask for even if they have to run out and get it!). The concierge service holds very high standards (e.g. when my wife got sick, he had a doctor in the room within an hour on a Sunday morning in London!). The location is also perfect for the family with museums, restaurants and playgounds very close by. This is definitely a hidden gem!",5,2013,03,05
113,Excellent Afternoon Tea,"I had Afternoon tea in the hotel during the weekend and it was amazing. All the staff were very attentive. The quality of the food was excellent. Gareth the Restaurant and Bar Manager was very welcoming and friendly.  Staff explained our options to us and gave us plenty of refills of tea. James was also brilliant, offered to have special cocktails of our choice made, definitely come to this bar for cocktails made by Alessandro - they are superb! Will definitely be back and would recommend to anyone!",5,2013,03,04
113,Great Four Poster Bed,"On a recent trip to London I stayed at the Kensington Hotel London, which is part of the Doyle Hotel Collection. 
On arrival we were greeted by friendly efficient staff an experience similar to the other hotels in the Doyle Hotel Collection that I have stayed in. 

Before checking out our rooms we enjoyed  a lovely afternoon tea in an elegant  large lobby with really comfortable seating. We booked a Superior room and a Studio Suite. Both were large, bright and very comfortable offering expert amenities for the business traveller with a writing desk and free fast WiFi.  The suite boasted a luxurious evocative four poster bed in which you could enjoy- 'well I will leave that to your imagination' - a wonderful nights sleep of-course. 

I would highly recommend the Kensington Hotel London, it's luxurious, friendly, efficient, brilliant location and best of all excellent value for your 'buck'.

I have stayed in the other Doyle Hotel Collecton hotels and the standard of rooms, service and value have been excellent, thats why I maintain my loyalty to the group.",5,2013,03,04
113,Our search is over: best staff ever at The Kensington!,"What a truly fantastic stay we had last weekend at The Kensington Hotel. Initially I had booked a family room in another hotel not far from The Kensington only to discover the ice cold and dirty room we were appointed. As I headed out, my driver suggested to check into The Kensington hotel with my family and boy was he right. Our family room was really great to stay in with our boys and as it was on the top-floor nicely quiet as well. I haven‚Äôt seen the normal rooms but the family room was more then adequate to use for a family with 2 kids. I really can‚Äôt understand the criticism some reviewers have over here at Tripadvisor on the size of the rooms. You simply can not compare the size of rooms in expensive metropolitan areas like London, New York or Paris with large chain hotels in Idaho for instance.

But it‚Äôs not the hotel room which made me so wanting to write this review. It is the staff at The Kensington. These people are all trained so perfectly and come across truly interested. We feel it was one of the best experiences in hotels we ever had. And let me tell you that I have been at quite some hotels. From the always smiling and attentive doormen, concierge and reservations desk to the fantastic staff at the bar and the restaurant. These people made our stay an incredible one. In the woody bar with beautiful lighting fixtures we had great drinks. At the cosy fireplace we enjoyed our tea and in the morning we were greeted by the most fantastic maitre of all, James. He made sure our breakfast was perfect. Everybody knew our name from the very first moment but they remembered our choices of the last visit etc. James alone I would give 6 stars!

So do yourself a favour next time when you visit London. Do not hesitate and book yourself a room at the perfectly situated Kensington Hotel and use their services. You will not be disappointed. We will come back for sure. Our search in London has ended. Thanks Ross, Lorna, James and all others we have forgotten to mention.",5,2013,03,04
113,A delightful visit,"From the time we arrived at the front door, the staff were so welcoming; check-in was a pleasure, and we had a lovely modern room with all the amenities. It is clear that the highest standards are are in play, and there are nice public rooms to relax and read the papers. We are looking forward to our next visit.",5,2013,03,03
113,Whats not to love! Feels like coming home to luxury in a busy city.,"Love this place, stayed here recently on a business trip, but was also connecting with some friends in tee city. Its perfect for both. You are greeted with the wonderful aroma of expensive scented candles in both this Doyle property and their sister Hotel The Marleybone (5 star) the smell is distinctive. The architecture here at the kensington is stunning, its such a wonderful building. Hand in hand with that is smaller rooms and hallways then the Marleybone which was originally a 60's or 70's build i imagine where the rooms are larger.But you get a lot of character with the Kensington. The room i was in was not small by any london standard, perfectly formed as they say.

The lovely James greeted us as we strolled through the lobby, so friendly yet professional, he made sure to take care of us during our whole trip, another memorable member of staff was the multitalented Jimmy, the concierge and bar man and door man; he is a  super character. Nothing was a problem for any of the staff. Its these 5 star touches from these members of staff that make The Kensington so special. You feel like you are in a 5 star hotel , even though its a 4 star. The Doyle experience and attention to customers needs in their hotels is very noticeable compared to other hotels.

After a crazy day or night in London city it is a pleasure to come back to such an atmospheric and peaceful oasis, having said that we spent one night in their bar with friends and it was buzzy and very enjoyable.

This is a perfect location though, so many great places around here to enjoy. This does not feel like just another hotel, its interior designed perfectly, the rooms are refurbished with all amenities but its done in a tasteful and warm way that you feel immediately settled in, in understated luxury. Class.

Needless to say I will be back!¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†",5,2013,03,01
113,Excellent boutique hotel,"The Kensington Hotel has opulent style and excellent service.  All of the staff are extremely courteous and over a multiple night stay I felt very at home and welcome.  The d√©cor is beautiful with lots of reference to fashion and the quality of the food is excellent.  
An overall 10/10 in a fabulous part of town.",5,2013,03,01
113,"A Hallmark of Style, Comfort, and Service","The Kensington Hotel is the perfect mix of style, comfort, and service. This is a boutique hotel and just the right size. The elevators, public spaces, and rooms are easily accessible and do not require a substantial amount of walking to get from one point to another-imprtant when traveling with older and younger folks.The public lounges are well appointed, comfortable, and perfect for reading the morning papers, afternoon tea and evening cocktails. Unlike large luxury hotels, the Kensington is on the small side with a staff that wants to know you. It is a well trained and efficient staff. Whether James or Alladin serving cocktails, Otabek swiftly transferring bags or hailing a cab, we never encountered a staff member who did not provide top notch service and always with a smile and courtesy. Afternoon tea, cocktails, and meals are of the highest quality.
The studio suites are well appointed and comfortable. The bathrooms are modern, roomy, and well appointed with walk in showers, separate tubs, and double sinks.   
This was an eleven day family holiday and we could not have made a better hotel choice. Subsequent to our departure we arrived Heathrow to find our flight had been cancelled. I telephoned the hotel and remarkably was told to return, our former rooms would again be made available, and the rates unchanged. The front desk could not have been more accommodating. All in all we were very comfortable  and well treated. There is no reason to search for an alternative hotel in London.",5,2013,02,28
113,wonderful boutique hotel,"This is a terrific small luxury hotel in one of the best locations in London. The rooms are lovely, the food, especially the breakfast is delicious, the cocktails are outstanding but the thing that stands out is the personalised and attentive service. Stay here for business or pleasure, you will be very well looked after.

I stayed in a deluxe room, which was well appointed with very comfortable bed and beautiful soft linnen. The cocierge showed me the family room in response to a request from me as my family might be joining me for my next trip; these are spacious and again well appointed.

The location, close to South Kensington tube station (which is on 3 lines so close to everything and can be accessed directly from Heathrow on the Piccadilly line), walking distance to Kings Road and great museums and in a very classy part of London.

The price also for the quality of service was very competitive.",5,2013,02,26
113,Service & Style cocktail,"This hotel is just perfect: stylish, attentive staff, great service, good food, nicely decorated rooms and the best cocktails in London! 
Just one thing, the standard rooms are really small, not suitable for two guests, especially the bathroom is ... well ... miniscule. Walking in and out of it requires an olympic medal in gymnastics. 
But as the hotel is a member of the GHA, only ten nights per calendar year get you free upgrades already, forever removing you out of standard room territory.",5,2013,02,25
113,Elegant hotel makes you feel very special,"Great hotel, perfect location for London museums and Royal Albert Hall, short walking distance, local shops , delis & cafes just around the corner in South Kensington.
Rooms are beautifully decorated and smell divine, Lavendar scented toiletries, and nice comfy bed very relaxing.
We were made to feel most welcome and special by all the staff. Would definately recommend this hotel and stay again.",5,2013,02,25
113,The Kensington Hotel - Afternoon Tea and Hotel Stay,"The girls and I booked a girly weekend to London for my friend Lauren‚Äôs birthday and stayed at the Kensington Hotel for 1 night.  The hotel was absolutely gorgeous, had a very luxurious feel and relaxed vibe.  Hotel staff were polite and helpful, catering after your every need. 

I travel often and most hotels are all the same, The Kensington Hotel however seemed more personal in every way from d√©cor to service.  The hotel room itself was very spacious, gorgeous bathroom and great four-poster bed. 

During our stay we also had afternoon tea at the hotel.  Again, service was fabulous.  Unlimited assortment of teas, course of sandwiches, scones and cakes.  Couldn‚Äôt fault a thing. 

Thank you so much to the Kensington Hotel, we all had a wonderful time! N",5,2013,02,22
113,Perfect Afternoon Tea....,"3 friends & I visited this hotel last week for afternoon Tea. The hotel is gorgeous, unique & in a great location. The service was outstanding & food was great. We got a choice of about 15 teas to choose from and a selection of sandwiches to start followed by a sorbet and then a choice of cakes & scones - we didnt leave hungary thats for sure. We all really enjoyed our afternoon here, perfect for a Sunday afternoon treat or a special occasion!! ill definately be going back & will hopefully stay the night next time, this hotel is beautiful.",5,2013,02,22
113,"A Boutique, Chic Hotel - Lovely staff and Delicious afternoon Tea!","My friends and I stayed at The Kensington Hotel last week to celebrate moving to London. The hotel made us feel fabulous! It was a luxury experience from start to finish. The staff could not of done more for us.
What we loved about the hotel was the unique furniture and pieces of art which made every section of the hotel unique. It just oozed 'cool'.
If you choose to stay at the hotel make sure you book in for their afternoon tea. It was so yummy and the selection of desserts still makes my mouth water.
This is a really nice hotel. I recommend it for every kind of trip. Whether that be business a special occasion or just because!",5,2013,02,22
113,Fantastic Hotel,"My 17 year old daughter and I just returned from a 4 night stay at the Kensington Hotel.  The property is beautiful and well located.  We used the underground throughout our stay, and it was just a short walk to the station from the hotel.  The concierge team (Ward and Vincent) were extremely helpful and went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of.  We had a spacious, nicely decorated room with a large bathroom.  The continental breakfast was perfect and the dining area was welcoming and pleasant.  I highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting the London area.",5,2013,02,21
113,An Amazing Christmas Experience,"We stayed with our 10 month old during Christmas and the hotel was perfect for what we wanted.  

The Christmas Tree was fantastic with a little rocking horse for our little girl and she was encharted by the lights.  Staff on the door, reception and bar are all friendly and help creat a good atmosphere.

Rooms are not massive but have enough space for a travel cot and they are spotless and very comfortable (bathrooms very nice). 

Location excellent for Hyde Park and the Winter Wonderland and would definately stay again.

Only drawback is there is not car park however the door staff top up the meters outside which is a great touch.",5,2013,02,21

113,Beautiful hotel with top quality service.,I recently stayed here with friends and we had a very enjoyable stay.The staff were very welcoming and helpful. The decor of the hotel is fab!The open fire really made it feel like a home away from home. I would highly recommend having afternoon tea here. It was nicest I have ever had. This hotel really gives you value for your money therefore I would give it 10/10.,5,2013,02,13
113,I will be back,"I stayed at The Kensington on a recent trip to London and had a wonderful experience. From the moment I walked through the doors I received a warm and friendly welcome from all the staff. The decor throughout the hotel is impressive and the attention to detail is evident everywhere. The room I stayed in was beautiful and the bed was so comfortable that I found it difficult to get up in the morning. But the thoughts of missing out on the delicious breakfast was always enough to do the trick. 

The atmosphere at The Kensington is cosy, relaxing and friendly. It truly is a home away from home and I will be back.",5,2013,02,12
113,Unforgettable experience,"It's been an unforgettable experience staying over here.. We stayed on a special day.. They made it very special and personalised service...

113,Absolutely fabulous,"From the moment we checked in, we were given a warm ""Irish"" welcome, and we were given an upgrade on our room.
We then into the bar, where a great waiter from Dublin looked after us very well.
We were then going out for dinner and as we were about to leave it was raining - we were given umbrella's !!
On returning to our room we were greeted with a dish of fruit and and a lovely bottle of red.
The room was superb , with a wonderful bathroom and great toiletries !!!
I will definitely be returning to this hotel and can't wait !!!",5,2013,02,09
113,Good weekend in London,"Amazing hotel, staff and service. Enjoyed the afternoon tea. Perfect to go with your family and relax. Breakfast was nice. Did not had the time to check dinner. Very helpful staff and has the genuine attitude to please you.",5,2013,02,09
113,A True 5 Star Experience,"Arriving at the Kensington with a very warm welcome, all the staff are extremely professional and friendly. Lucky enough to receive an early check in and room upgrade, this was a great start. The room was well furnished with quality facilities and a huge bed which provided a great nights sleep. An unfortunate and rare incident was upsetting but the proactive customer relations staff were quick to react. They over compensated for this mishap and we felt very satisfied. Dinner at Aubrey restaurant was another flawless experience. The food and drink was excellent and catered for dietary requirements. Constant touches throughout the stay made it extra special and look forward to our next stay.",5,2013,02,09
113,Great hotel and great staff,Stayed on business trip with colleagues. Amazing hotel. Nice cozy in feeling. Especially bar in the evening is nice. Liked the tea and cake in the evening. Would definitely stay in future if visiting London.,5,2013,02,09
113,Nice but far from town,"I recently stayed at this hotel.  Everything about it is above average, except the location.  If you want to do things in central London, then I would pass.  At 7 pm, it took me 25 minutes to go to Trafalgar Square...just not ideal for a nice night out.  Otherwise, service and staff are super good.  Rooms are noisy/walls are thin.....you will most definitely not sleep-in.",3,2013,02,08
113,Great stay at Kensington,Had a very good stay on my first wedding anniversary. The lobby was very welcoming and the staffs were fantastic and friendly. Room was excellent and bed was very comfortable. The food in the restaurant was amazing and the service was excellent. Highly recommend to all without any doubt.,5,2013,02,03
113,Superb 5 Star Experience,"I was attending an event in the Brompton Club and my friend and I decided to stay in the hotel. From arrival to our room everything was just great, effortless, impeccable and the attention to detail and design was 2nd to none. We went to Aubrey Bar for a cocktail and a snack and the staff were amazing. There was a guy behind the bar and he was excellent at cocktails and make bespoke cocktail individually tailored to our taste bud's. The Brompton club was great and the night ended back in Aubrey bar for some very very cocktails. Managed to have breakfast in the room the next morning and to be honest it was the best thing i ever imagined at 4am the night before. So in summary, great hotel, excellent staff, great attention to detail and design.",5,2013,02,02
113,"Superb, cozy hotel near V&A museum","This hotel is a jewel.  It is set in a beautiful, cozy building with loungy chairs and fireplaces in the common rooms and tea room.  The bedrooms can be small or large depending on the room.  It's location is excellent, at the heart of London's upscale Kensington district, a short walk from the Victoria & Albert and Natural History museums, and only a 10 minute walk to Harrod's.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,02,02
113,Couldn't fault it!,"Had a wonderful weekend break, staying at the Kensington. Fantastic location, friendly, welcoming & attentive staff. Spacious & well equipped rooms. Loved the TV in the bathroom! Thoroughly recommend and would come back again. Lovely breakfast, great cocktails. Was able to relax in the lounge area in front of the fire.",5,2013,02,02
113,Great service and super staff.,"After a disaster of a check in that was all my fault and not the hotels we settled into our weekend away from the teenagers!

We eventually settled on our third room that had a bath and no smell of newly painted walls! = asthma attack for the wife! Not a great start to our anniversary weekend away! However the team found us a wonderful room on the 5th floor.

Service at the bar was efficient but on both occasions crying and noisy children spoilt the whole experience. Why would you bring young kids to a boutique hotel such as this is beyond me! 

We have three teenagers and we never subjected them at a tender age on couples trying to enjoy themselves in a boutique hotel. It seems to me that the more disposable income people have it gives them an excuse to let their kids spoil the ambience in a place.

At one point I could easily have been in McDonalds on the kings Road.

A few couples having afternoon tea appeared to be totally hacked off and I'm not surprised.

However do not let that take away from what is a lovely hotel in a good location.

The staff, service and wanting to please attitude is a rare commodity in London.

113,Great welcome to London,"I booked this hotel after reading the TA reports and was not disappointed. From the moment the front door is opened for you all staff members are happy to help in any way. As we came in very early in the morning from Sydney our superior level room was not ready but we were offered the use of another standard room if we wished till our room was ready. We found the Kensington area around the hotel to be lovely to walk around in and lots of little cafes and restaurants nearby. Our room came with free wi fi and an ipad dock besides the bed - very handy. Whilst the room was not huge it certainly was ample for my husband and I. Our bed was really comfortable and all linens were very fresh. The lobby was another area that you always wanted to go to - it was lovely sitting by the fireplace there reading the papers. The hotel is near buses and the tube and only a short walk to V&A museum. There is a restaurant, bar and gym also. Would have to be one of the best hotels we have stayed at and we hope to come back again. Highly recommend.",5,2013,02,02
113,Nice place for afternoon tea,"Enjoyed a superb afternoon tea here just after it reopened following major refurbishment. The surroundings were sumptuous and the staff courteous which all made for a very enjoyable experience. The only reason I don't give it 5/5 is that I would have preferred it served on a 3 tier cake stand as that makes it feel more of an occasion for me, it was my birthday afterall..",4,2013,02,02
113,Home away from home,"I have stayed in this beautiful hotel couple of times and it never lets me down. Professional staff,amazing restaurant and great room service. Location is so handy that you can wall everywhere and its safe.  I really enjoyed the lobby and sitting by the fire place especially. Can't wait to return.",5,2013,02,01
113,Best ever....,I am a business man who travels different countries quite often and I can surely say that this is the best hotel stay ever. Staffs were friendly and ready to help you anytime and the hotel is located is located at very good location which is good if you want to see around London. This hotel is surely the best pick.,5,2013,01,29
113,Over my expectations,"Arrived to the hotel with my daughter who had turned ill, and was promptly helped by both the porter and the concierge (friendly, efficient, polite). The check in went very fast, and got a spacious, clean and calm room, modernly decorated. The concierge offered to help with any pharmacy runs for my daughter, and could help with directions, restaurant bookings (when looking online, a particular restaurant was full, but he managed to get me a table anyway! Impressive!) and any other requests I had as well. 
Upon arrival to the hotel room, there was a personal welcome note from the customer relationship manager, together with a cupcake and a fresh fruit plate and a complementary bottle of water (much appreciated - thanks again). When it was time for turn-down, my daughter and I were just on our way out so I asked them to come 5 minutes later. Surprisingly, they did!! I've requested this at other 5 star hotels, and then you simply don't get a turn down service. But here they went above and beyond my expectations by offering my sick daughter a lovely little (personalised!) teddy bear as well. 
The lounge / bar was also very nice (try the white hot chocolate with marshmallows - heavenly!), with fireplaces and a cozy atmosphere. The breakfast was the only disappointment - the selection of the buffet was so-so (some cereal for the children would have been nice for example, like Cheerio's or similar, as well as a larger selection of cheeses and jams and spreads for the bread, and porridge), but on the other hand you can order what you want from their breakfast menu as well, which I didn't. 

All in all a hotel I would definitely go back to, not least in part thanks to the lovely personnel who clearly have a genuine interest in serving their guests and making them feel welcome. I saw no disgruntled customers during my stay, and would have been surprised if there was, considering the effort put into by the personnel...

A warm recommendation!",5,2013,01,29
113,Really Homely and Good Location,"Stayed here for 4 nights just after Christmas with our two teenagers - suite and a double room. The rooms are all reasonable sizes and the beds are large and comfortable - but firm. We had  a suite on the top floor which is in the roof space and this gives it quirky angles but an overall nice and comfortable space. bathrooms are well equipped and large with good large powerful showers. The common areas are very pleasant and really good to watch the world go by in. The bar area is also very pleasant with a great range of cocktails and anything else you might want. The concierge was also very helpful and you are only 5 mins from the nearest tube on the Picadilly line which is a direct service to Heathrow. The main museums are also just on your doorstep - V&A, Natural History and Science. 

We had a few minor issues with making up our room (took a few calls to reception)and an overcharge at the bar in the final bill which was corrected, but these items would not detract from a very pleasant overall experience. Breakfast is a bit expensive so we opted for some of the local cafe's which have great variety and its nice to put some funds into these local operators when in an area.

Overall would return and would recomend",4,2013,01,29
113,First class service,"One of the things that makes for a good stay is the quality of the service and staff. From the moment we walked into the hotel till the time we left we received first class service from every member of staff we came into contact with. 
The room was clean and spacious though perhaps too warm at night despite turning the thermostat way down (the only negative part of our stay), dinner as excellent and very good value and the bar was a most welcoming area for pre and post dinner drinks. Will I stay there again - like a shot. Highly recommended.",5,2013,01,28
113,Superb staff operating in a fantastic setting,"I just had one night here, including dinner and breakfast, and from the moment I entered the lobby in the evening to the moment they cheerily bade me farewell in the morning there was not one fault to be found. 

Dinner was excellent, and the service fell into the perfect level of being attentive and ignoring us. Knowledgeable staff were able to make recommendations, which I love, and were great to talk to. The bed and room in general were of a very high standard, with a shower that I'll truly wish I could have installed at home. 

All in all a great place to stay and one where I hope and expect to return to.",5,2013,01,27
113,Happy & Can't ask for more,"We stayed here for a week and it was a pleasant and peaceful stay. The room was very spacious and it had plenty of place for my son to play around. The staffs were very friendly and made us feel like staying in Home.Almost all the places are easily accessible from here.over all, it was a good stay and i will surely come back and recommend this hotel for everyone.. !!",5,2013,01,27
113,Excellent Hotel in good location,"We stayed one night at this hotel. Helpful & friendly staff. Concierge & desk staff made us feel very welcome. We got upgrade to a better room without asking and this was a good size & very comfortable, clean & quiet. Our room was well furnished in a nice modern way. Fruit & mineral water left for us as a birthday gift was a nice touch and well appreciated. Lounge area very attractive and a nice place for sitting to read a paper with a coffee etc. Breakfast was very good with plenty of choice and good quality in an elegant setting. Attentive, helpful staff doing the serving and we did not feel under any pressure. Hotel is in a good location, 5 mins from South Kensington tube station and an easy walk to Hyde Park & the museums. A great location for this side of London. Our package gave us the benefit of a 3pm checkout which was great. We would highly recommend this hotel & would certainly visit again.",5,2013,01,27
113,Excellent 5 Star Hotel,"Arrived on business  and stayed just one night, checkin was quick and efficient with friendly staff. I was escorted to my room by a pleasant gentleman called Ross who was very polite indeed. The room was comfortable and had all the extra's i needed for my stay, I-Pod docking station was get addition to fast  charge your phone. I had a few meeting planned in the hotel which took place in the lounge area, with the back drop with am amazing open fire where else would you rather spend your afternoon having meeting? well in style in the Kensington Hotel. Staff were all great and anticipated each and every one of my needs, well priced and you do get what you pay for. 

Tips: 
Very close to south ken tube station
Very close to Harrods 
Hyde Park on your door step
Accessible by car

I have already planned my next visit into the city and cant wait to bring my wife to this perfect location in London.",5,2013,01,27
113,Clean and very near the tube station,Visited this hotel for 1 night after seeing Madonna at Hyde park London. The hotel was just a few tube stops away so was great to get back to.Room was nice and clean had no trouble with it or the size . Booked directly through the hotels own web page as came out cheaper than comparison sites. Man on reception was very nice.,4,2013,01,26
113,Comfortable stay in great location,"Nice boutique-sized hotel in South Kensington.  Rooms are nicely furnished (modern, not stuffy), with comfortable beds and attractive, modern marble bathrooms. They are a bit small (and can get a bit warm in the winter). The free wi-fi in the rooms works well.

Staff are pleasant and welcoming and the lobby lounge area features gas fireplaces and a comfortable atmosphere for chatting with friends.

The location is great for exploring the west end or really any part of London with South Kensington tube station having the Piccadilly, Circle, and District lines, which makes many locations a single seat ride away.  Also, Brompton Road (around the corner) has a number of nice restaurants (at a wide array of price levels) which makes eating easy.",4,2013,01,26
113,Excellent hotel,"Spent 3 nights here recently. Excellent hotel, good location near South Kensington tube station, museums, and Hyde Park. Rooms are quite small, but this is London, and very well furnished. I enjoyed the snacks in the room each night. Staff were friendly. I would also recommend the cocktail bar and the restaurant",5,2013,01,24
113,Perfect stay,"I stayed there for 7 nights. Remarkably low prices despite the great location. 
Corner of Queens Gate and Old Brompton Road.
Easy walk to South Kensington tube stop. Plenty of restaurants, post office, pub, bakery, Mailboxes Etc, FedEx, on Old Brompton Road.
All facilities in the hotel were excellent. Nice gym, bar, restaurant, beautiful sitting areas with fireplaces on the main floor. Excellent breakfast, buffet for 16 pounds, and buffet plus hot entree (such as omlete, pancakes, waffles, etc.) for 21 pounds.
Friendly helpful staff.
I can't say enough about what a great place this was to stay. Walk to V&A, Science Museum, Kensington Palace. You can walk to Harrods too, but it's a little far, so just take the tube one stop to Harrods.
Free WiFi throughout, but WiFi in the room usually didn't work. Good WiFi in the lobby, bar, and restaurant, and there are 2 computers with printers you can use on the main floor 'business center'.",5,2013,01,24
113,Excellent stay with my family in London,Had a family break in London and stayed over at the Hotel. Staff and service were excellent. Genuine warmth and care from throughout the people you interact with. The studio room had beautiful deco and very spacious. Enjoyed the cocktails. Good value for money.,5,2013,01,24
113,Great hotel,"Stayed for one night at the Kensington hotel, truly a great hotel, staff here really make the difference here, service seems seems simple here with a warm, genuine touch, well done to them. Would recommend this hotel to anyone ",5,2013,01,23
113,Pre Christmas break,"My wife and I spent three nights at the Kensington hotel before Christmas.
The hotel is lovely , the staff are uber attentive and the location is great if you want to explore London.
Property is not cheap here in this region of London and it is reflected in the size of the bedrooms.
We booked a superior room and while the decor was lovely it was VERY SMALL.
There was nowhere for us to store our luggage.(we came with one small piece each) and the bath was a half size bath.
Bar food was excellent and the lounges are very pleasant.
we thought that the breakfast was dissapointing. alot of pomp but very average food that cost ¬£20 +.
Overall this hotel offers a very good experience if you do not pay the rack rate !",3,2013,01,23
113,Relaxing weekend,"Just back from a lovely relaxing break.  We had booked a Superior room and were upgraded to a Deluxe room which had the same facilities but was a larger room.  Loved the decor in our room and around the whole hotel.  Spent most of Sunday in the hotel due to the poor weather, used the gym facilities and spent a lazy evening drinking amazing cocktails in the bar.  Friendly, helpful staff in ever area of the hotel.  Would definitely book The Kensington Hotel again.",5,2013,01,22
113,Best Hotel Experience!,"This hotel was truly remarkable. My team based in Denver travels all of the time, and this is the first time they have raved about a hotel. Great staff, very friendly, beautiful and clean, and a wonderful experience from check in to check out. This is a must stay when you are in London.",5,2013,01,21
113,Exquisite!,"A wonderful experience enjoyed by both myself and partner. Throughout our stay the staff were wonderful and could not do enough for us. We felt very welcomed from the start and the hotel is an exceptional standard with excellent proximities to everything you would want to do in London. The room itself was beautiful and quintessentially british, offering excellent comfort. We also found little extra's in the room were a nice touch. The Aubrey Restaurant which is part of the hotel had exquisite food with excellent value for money which left me constantly tipping as our service was second to none making us feel very valued as customers. 
The purpose of the trip was a trip to the Royal Albert Hall, so if your looking for a hotel when going to the Royal Albert Hall then there is no better than this. Will be making more booking's in the future!
Thanks for the wonderful experience!",5,2013,01,20
113,What a fantastic Hotel with great service and even better staff!!,"Great location for most London based activities without being in the mist of the downtown bustle. 
There is nothing about the hotel that we could fault. We heartily recommend it.
Thank you to all the staff who made us feel so very welcome.",5,2013,01,20
113,Quality with superb service,"The room was excellent and hotel generally was extremely well presented. However, it was the quality of the service and the general good nature of the staff that made the experience thoroughly enjoyable for my daughter and I.",5,2013,01,20
113,Our stay at The Kensington Hotel....,"40 years ago on January 13th we were married and enjoyed a lovely honeymoon in London.  We have never been back as a couple so we decided to treat ourselves and relive some precious memories.
We chose The Kensington Hotel for our stay and what a fabulous decision it turned out to be; the hotel is wonderful, the room fabulous and the staff - EVERY member of staff - were so delightful. The room we were given was very luxurious; so comfortable and warm. It had every facility we could want or need.  There were lots of little extras too...  the chocolates, the mini deserts, the flasks of jasmine and peppermint tea. 
The attention to detail and the obvious interest in customer satisfaction was second to none.

Full marks to everybody associated with the running of this hotel.  WE SHALL RETURN.

Ginette and Michael Stringer",5,2013,01,17
113,Great service and beautiful place,"We stayed at The Kensington Hotel for our company Xmas Party in 2012 and we had a great experience! We were around 70 people and the service was the highest to all of us!
The hotel is great and quiet. The restaurant has an very tasty menu and the food is excellent.

We now use TKH as one of our preferred partners for our clients and colleagues from abroad.

We all highly recommend The Kensington Hotel!",5,2013,01,16
113,The best hotel in London,"After many disappointing hotels inc - copthorne - old and looking worn , Hilton - very over priced for level of service and ritz again over priced and unwelcoming however I was over the moon with this hotel not one thing I could complain about ( which for me is very odd ) staff wonderful service amazing and the room well I wanted to move in plus location lovely and peaceful yet close enough to everything x would reccomend and will be making another booking very soon x ",5,2013,01,14
113,3 night stay,"My husband and I stayed here for three nights at the beginning of January. We had a large amount of luggage, and the hotel was very accomodating (stored it for several hours upon arrival and also for a full day on our departure). The staff were warm and helpful - even phoning when my husband left his sweater in the dining room! Gillian O'Loughlin also suggested a restaurant for us to dine in and made the reservation for us  - very helpful. We have stayed in the hotel before and had a lovely room which had a small seating area and a second tv which was great as our stay was longer than usual and (as mentioned) we had a lot of luggage! It is the hotel we choose for each of our stays in London and we look forward to our next visit.",5,2013,01,14
113,Excellent!,"Hi,
My wife treated me to a night at The Kensington Hotel as part of my 50th Birthday present. What a lovely hotel, the staff are extremely friendly and the room was very spacious, the Nespresso coffee machine was also a bonus. We had dinner in the hotel restaurant and (as a chef) I can highly recommend it, especially the Chateaubriand. The hotel is ideally located within easy walking distance from the South Kensington tube and we will definitely be going back. A brilliant hotel with a personal touch which is highly recommended.
Thank you Beneeta (on reception) for a warm welcome and and a friendly departure.",5,2013,01,13
113,We had a wonderful stay!,"So often hotels don't live up to the descriptions, photos or expectations , but The Kensington exceeded my expectations on every count. From the warm welcome, to the excellent food, the ambience and decor, to the genuine attitude of all the staff who seemed pleased to serve and meet our every need. We will definitely visit another Doyle hotel.",5,2013,01,13
113,The Hotel Where You Feel At Home,"Location is away frm crazy touristy west end however with just a short commute you can get there if you want, its a stones throw from Old Brompton Road with 2 supermarkets, a pharmacy, a luggage shop, lots of really nice restaurants, coffee shops, beauty salons, and on top of the street is the tube station.. It's also walking distance to the museums and to all other shops bars and amentities in the South Ken, as well as to Fulham Road, King's Road..
The lobby is very cozy with a very nice fireplace where you can sit and have tea in the afternoon in true English trandtion or you can order a drink from the bar as staff is really accommodating 
Staff is cheerful and helpful.. Housekeeping is neat they service the rooms twice a day and even if there is somehting missing like toothpaste or lotion they got them for me when I asked, room service is available round the clock and food is tasty.. theres free wifi in the rooms as well as a little business centre, and a gym, a nice bar/restaurant, even a massage therapist can be arranged for.. hotel management is really smart and try to develop personal relations with guests they even send a daily note with the weather for the next day and a little inspirational quote to the room every evening.. The hotel is not a cheap, but it is also not very pricy and you completely get your money's worth..The thing that can use some improvement is concierge service, even though they are very courteous and helpful they need to know a lot more about the city the events the places travel info and be able to book you into places and give you solid advice..",5,2013,01,13
113,Md Toni and guy Ireland  Alan Boyce,"Best Christmas I have had in years
First and foremost I have never posted a review ! But after my family and I stayed at the Kensington hotel over the Christmas period I felt it a must to post a review .
Myself and two children arrived in London boxing day armed with the kids nanny on toe ! Sorry (manny) on toe .
To my delight on my arrival I learned that this hotel was the sister hotel of the fab west bury hotel of gratfton street in Dublin.
A hard act to live up to ' wow was my first thoughts of how the hotel looked for this time of year fab Christmas tree and beautiful lights every were ! My kids delight and excitement was wonderful .
Greeted then by the most help full staff offered refreshments of which I have only been offered in Asian hotels ! Things could only get better ? 
Next on checking in the staff looked  at myself the kids and manny and then told me it was are lucky day and give me an upgrade to a suite knowing I had two young children and would most likely need the space !!! After hitting the  London sales  !!! Then are stay only got better concierge looked are every thing we asked , fab breakfasts and evening meals !!  So after long days on opened top buses and all things fun ,,, kids to bed it was time to meet my friends hotel bar then out to the bright lights !!! Didn't happen after hitting a few cocktails in the hotel bar my friends were happy to stay we're we were ,, main reasons the bar is fantastic and the bar staffs cocktails even better .
Five fab days in London treated like royals rested in the best of Julian christer beds .and rooms to match .On leaving I could see the GM behind reception I could only ask this man his name and thank him for a wonderful stay !!! So once again Vincent ,, Madison beau and I and of course manny Maurice thank you and will see you all soon !! Please thank all your wonderful staff once again and you should  be a very proud man . But then they say it only comes from the top .

Regards Alan Boyce",5,2013,01,12
113,A home away from home !,"I have stayed here many times, and have no desire to change. 
Location is second to none, walked to Harrods in 15 mins this am.
I'm literally just home having checked out 5 hours ago.
This hotel is luxury, without making a song and dance about it !
Understated, yet refined and comfortable, you can feel totally at home here.
Upon arrival, I was upgraded without fuss. The staff are wonderful, the concierge knowledgable, I almost always allow them choose my dining venues, never been let down.

Really, book it, and enjoy !",5,2013,01,11
113,The perfect place,"Again a not too big, not too expensive hotel in the nice area of London. Many shops and restaurants nearby and walking distance to Knightsbridge...
Perfect service, big room , ask for the 5th floor, huge bathroom with a tube and a shower.
Another place where I can feel at home, with the room service as a bonus!
The bar is fun and the small restaurant serves excellent food.
Perfect for the afternoon tea also, cosy and warm.
I will go back for sure.",4,2013,01,11
113,Complete Luxury,"Stayed at the Kensington Hotel for a mini shopping break. I have to say the service is top class yet personable. The concierge in particular were extremely helpful. We stayed in a Deluxe room which was just beautiful, especially the aromatherapy associates bathroom amenities and the nespesso coffee machine. Just what you need after a busy day of shopping! I would definitely recommend if you want a luxury hotel in the Kensington area. I have already booked to stay again! ",5,2013,01,10
113,"A first class, client friendly Hotel","We stayed two nights at the Kensington and we cannot speak highly enough of our experience. The Hotel is in an excellent location, was clean and very well presented. However, our main commendation is reserved for all the staff. Without exception they were friendly, helpful and efficient. They made our stay very special - thank you.
We will be back.",5,2013,01,10
113,AMAZING Hotel & Super service,"Having normally stayed on park lane I opted for Kensington on this occasion.  We checked into the hotel and from start to finish I have not one single complaint. The staff looked after us all as if we where in our own home, nothing was too much trouble. We had booked the suite for 5 days which is situated  on the first floor and believe me it it worth every penny. Possibly the best hotel in the Doyle Group. A special mention to Vincent who went above and beyond the call of duty, thank you. Beau & Maddie can't wait to go back and we will defiantly be staying in The Kensington.",5,2013,01,10
113,Christmas at the Kensington,"Never having spent Christmas away from home before It was with a level of trepedation that my partner and I decided to give it a go. What a great choice! The kensington hotel was our choice having stayed there back in the summer for a weekend break. On that occasion we opted for the lowest standard of room and albeit a little cramped it was well furnished and decorated. Being that on this occasion it was Christmas we decided to upgrade and for the little extra cost it was well worth it. Still the same high standard of room but with added space to make the stay a little more comfortable. The location of the hotel is well set being only a short walk to the tube station and many of the attractions in the area and parking is not too bad either due to a car park on the same road. As for our stay, well all I can say is that we had a wonderful time from the minute we arrived. Check in was efficient, the staff on the desk were friendly and extremely helpful. This runs throughout the hotel staff from room service to bar service and from porters to restaurant staff. In fact I would like to say that the atmosphere they create is what makes the difference. All in all we had a wonderful time is a very tasteful hotel. As regular visitors to London we will definitely make this hotel our first choice in the future.",5,2013,01,09
113,Beautiful Hotel,"We recently returned from a much needed two night Christmas break at The Kensington.
If you are looking for an elegant, sophisticated, intimate and relaxing hotel then look no further.
It is located near South Kensington, a beautiful part of London which has loads to offer for couples or families, and indeed would be an excellent location for business.
From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with friendly and helpful staff. From advice and information offered by the concierge, to the little tour from the receptionist, this hotel brings service to a new level.Little details like the hot towel offered at reception on arrival, to the cupcakes in the bedroom  and nespresso  machine and the bottle of water offered   for our journey home all added to our enjoyment. Our room was beautiful, quiet and very comfortable and the night time turndown & chocolates was a lovely touch.
The atmosphere in the hotel was wonderful and we had a great evening in the bar enjoying drinks with friends.  In the drawing rooms you can also have the most delicious afternoon tea and we sat back and watched the world go by. The food in the hotel is gorgeous with a particularly good offer for breakfast. If you don‚Äôt want to eat in the hotel, there are lots of lovely little restaurants and cafes nearby.  
We loved our stay at The Kensington and our only regret is that we hadn‚Äôt booked in for a few more nights. Thank you to all the staff who made our stay so enjoyable. We look forward to returning very soon.",5,2013,01,08
113,Great stay over Christmas,"Really enjoyed our time in this hotel over Christmas. This was the first time I have decided to stay away from home over Christmas and was initially not sure about spending it away.
My concerns were removed from the moment I checked into the Kensington. Staff were so friendly but what really made this experience for us was the staff in the lounge, bar and restaurant.
The lounge is the most decadent sirroundings with such a homely feel to it, we spent most of our time here. Service was seemless, relaxed and comfortable. Christmas day lunch was a highlight of the stay with phenominal food and more great service........would recommend this hotel to anyone, we are already planning to return next Christmas",5,2013,01,08
113,Our Expectations Were Exceeded.,"We stayed between Christmas and New Year for two nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. From the time our car door was opened on arrival to the smile on departure, everything was fantastic. The hotel has so much to offer and the staff on hand were more than able to meet our needs. The hotel is ideally located for business or pleasure, a couple of stops on the tube and you are in Oxford Street. The hotel offers a fantastic selection of food for all tastes and in the immediate area there are lots of choices for every type of dining. Atmosphere in and around the hotel was super. You could easily find a quiet corner around the lobby to sit and enjoy all the hotel has to offer or sit in the bar and be pampered by the fantastic staff. We will be back.",5,2013,01,08
113,Amazing experience,"We went there for a retreat from our otherwise hectic life and...everything was perfect!! First we were upgraded from a deluxe room to a suite. Then each time there was an issue (the remote did not match the TV and had problem accessing the WiFi), they were swift to correct the situation. Very helpful as well for our sightseeing: provided a map and clear directions.
Also they went the extra mile and offered a room for us to change and freshen up upon arrival since we came in early (9 AM) and our room was not ready!

Again we loved our stay and already recommended it around us and will definitely come back!",5,2013,01,07
113,Disappointing,"The description of the Deluxe Room on the hotel homepage did not match the reality. Went to the front desk to inform about circumstances and was asked if I would really need those amenities (which is a no go). After making my disappointment clear to them and being persistent on a solution they sent up a Nespresso machine to my room (one day after my complaint!!!) which did not work.
Further the mini bar was not refilled once during my stay, so one would have to order room service.
This is actually sad because the hotel would be really nice decor and location wise.",2,2013,01,06
113,Great Location,"I booked two rooms here for two nights between Christmas and the New year, we were already familiar with the location as we always stay in South Kensington when visiting London. The neighbourhood is quiet and safe and is serviced by both the South Kensington and Gloucester Road Tube Stations. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel and the Natural History, Science and V&A Museums are a 5 minute walk. We normally like to visit the Harrods sale and this only takes around 15 minutes to walk or its only one stop on the tube. The Staff at the Kensington are a credit to the hotel, offering a very polite, professional yet discreet level of service. The young lady on duty when we checked in on the afternoon of the 28th was very professional yet friendly and welcoming. The young man at Breakfast was also very professional explaining the Breakfast options available the English (Irish) breakfast is cooked to order and is only a ¬£5 supplement from the continental. The lobby, lounge and bar areas are superb and very welcoming in the winter with real fires and ornate fittings. The ambience is ideally suited for a memorable afternoon tea.  I had booked two Superior rooms with one for single occupancy and the facilities in the rooms are very good, the beds are very comfortable with quality sheets and pillows. If i was staying again i would upgrade to a larger room as the superior rooms are very small even by London Standards, the bathroom in our room was especially small. The superior rooms are very competitively priced for a hotel of this standard, which has to be taken into consideration when evaluating the size of the room. The Hotel underwent a total refurbishment a few years ago and given the quality of the public areas, i would have been tempted to knock some rooms through eliminating the really small rooms and increasing the price, as its the only area that lets the hotel down. I would strongly recommend this hotel, but if you can don't go for the lowest cost room as you may be disappointed with the size. We would like to thank all the staff at the Kensington Hotel for a very pleasant stay.",4,2013,01,06
113,Excellent hotel,"Stayed here on business, very friendly staff especially the bar staff. Luxurious hotel, very tastefully decorated and comfortable hotel rooms. Modern rooms and bathrooms. Exceeded my expectations and Would recommend",5,2013,01,04
113,Best,"Amazing atmosphere!
We have been to The Kensington Hotel for dinner and drinks with friends. First i was impressed by the luxurious and stylish decor of the lobby area. Sort of modern twist with glamorous classic mixed in perfect proportions!Dinner was excellent. Waiter was very attentive and delivered highest quality service. Food was so delicious and the portions were large. After dinner we stayed for few drinks in the Drawing rooms and Alessandro cocktails was a masterclass in cocktail science!!! Anyone in area, it's a must to pop in and sit back and simply enjoy a perfect cocktail!¬†All in all I can say it was a wonderful experience! 

Well done The Kensington team!",5,2013,01,04
113,Close to harrods and perfect for a short stop,"Arrived with my girlfriend, welcomed by a nice man. On checked we received a nice refreshing warm towel and we were escorted to our room which was a great unexpected service. It was late afternoon so we went straight to harrods to enjoy the sales. On returning to the hotel 6 hours later, loads of bags, shoes and everything else we could place our hand on we chilled on our room for a short while before dinner. We had some snacks in the lounge and were treated to some really nice cocktails. Alessandro in the bar was magic and to be honest he was the best we have ever experienced. Great hotel, staff and service, we will be back for a girlie weekend.",5,2013,01,04
113,Just perfect,"Stayed with my wife and daughter over new year and all I can say was amazing. Perfect location, ideal for my wife to shop in harrods while my daughter and I went to winter wonder land. The hotel was nice, warm welcoming and the staff were a delight. From arrival we were looked after and Vincent was a great with directions and looked after our dinner reservations. Our room was just perfect, fresh recently painted walls and doors, the bed linen and towels were all crisp and perfectly clean. We dined outside the hotel in Roca and had breakfast the next day in Audrey which was a delight. The staff and service was great we are already planning out next trip to south ken.",5,2013,01,04
113,A luxury hotel in a perfect location,"We stayed here on New Years Eve. We received a very nice welcome and check in was efficient yet friendly. Our room was fantastic...luxurious and perfectly equipped. After a long night on the embankment the bed was a delight...wonderful feather pillows! We didn't have breakfast, choosing instead to eat in one of the many cafes in south Kensington. 

This hotel is exactly what you expect from a five star hotel. We will definitely return as and when we stay in London. ",5,2013,01,04
113,Very London,"It was a fantastic stay for both me and my sister in this hotel: perfect location, room in mint colors (love the color that's why I'm mentioning it :)), welcoming staff, comfortable bed, nice and sophisticated interior, delicious breakfast and all those tiny details which you get in hotels like this - for example - weather forecast for next day on beautiful paper inside matching envelope...could you possibly wish for something more?  :)
Cozy for dark and cold autumn nights - soon to be Christmas time. We stayed only for 1 night, were meant to go out, but stayed in, enjoying the perfect (relaxing but festive) environment and each others company instead - it felt like celebration :)",5,2013,01,04
113,"Great location, Fantastic staff","Our first stay - wont be our last, From the moment we handed over the car keys the fantastic staff anticipated, adapted and delivered excellent service above and beyond anything we have experienced at a london hotel. We arrived before Christmas to do some shopping and enjoy an evening at the Royal Albert Hall. We both agreed the stay felt like we had been there 2 weeks instead of 2 nights. Concierge, Room Service, Restaurant Staff, in fact the whole team seemed to know exactly what we wanted and delivered with courtesy and pride. We can't wait to go back.",5,2013,01,04
113,Charming atmosphere,"We had booked the afternoon tea with champagne  with special remarks
for my wife's gluten free meal.
The atmosphere for the restaurant was charming with fireplace  and big sofas. 
The italian waitress was very kind and sympathic.
The sandwiches to start were very tasty and also the gluten free meal was
 noticed.  However when it was turn for the sweet cakes, the gluten free remark
had been forgotton, but the staff created immediately a substitute ( with the help
of the opposite groucery store ).
All things considered , we loved the afternoon.",4,2013,01,04
113,"Good location,great value for money","This is my second stay at the hotel.The rooms are classy,comfortable and good size for a london hotel.
The restaurant's ambience is lovely and the food is delicious.The staff have been extremely courteous and exceeded my expectations.",5,2013,01,03
113,"Super hotel, great location","Stayed three nights - excellent friendly professional service, a great breakfast, spotlessly clean although the bedrooms are a little small. 
The location is ideal - Hyde Park within walking distance.
We will be back!!!!",5,2013,01,03
113,The perfect gateway,"The experience my family and I just had after Christmas at The Kensington Hotel was just ideal considering the little time we had to enjoy ourselves and the city, not to mention shopping! The hotel has the most convenient location and at no point we had needed public transport, walked to Knightsbridge (my fav shopping spot!), Hyde park, the ice rink and did the Science Museum with the kids. The service and the staff friendliness was beyond our expectations, very warm and genuine - we all felt just like home... Well... with the little extra when it comes to the plush look and feel that made it even more special!
We have asked for an adjacent room for the kids and dairy free/celiac breakfast which was all taken care of. Most of the time on travel we find ourselves being repetitive, but the staff in this hotel seems always a step ahead of everything, we were just amazed!

This was the first time we stayed in a london hotel and will for sure make it our pied-a-terre for the future when we need it again, a seemless experience we have all truly enjoyed. Thank you to all the fantastic team! ",5,2013,01,03
113,Great hotel for our Christmas in London!,"Our family of four stayed at the Kensington for five days over Christmas last week.  The service couldn't have been better, and all of the meals including Christmas dinner were terrific.  The kids even received Christmas gifts from the hotel!  Vincent the concierge was wonderfully helpful in getting us dinner reservations.  The dining room staff made us feel at home every morning at breakfast.  The family room was great - very large with plenty of space for our 10 and 14 year old boys to stretch out a bit and watch some Top Gear.",5,2013,01,01
113,Phenomenal hotel with great value of money.,we have stayed in the hotel just right before the Christmas weekends...Phenomenal hotel with great value for money . The food in the restaurant was remarkable. The staff in the hotel were extremely helpful and delighted to assist us whenever needed with a great smile..special compliments to the restaurant staff..,5,2012,12,31
113,Excellent hotel,"Stayed in the Kensington Hotel during the summer, beautiful property, lounge areas are sublime with excellent service.
Very friendly and welcoming service from concierge and receptionist on arrival. The porter escorted me to the room with my luggage which was a nice touch.
Cocktails other bar in the evening were amazing, the bar tenders all have a little finesse with a personality.
The service in the restaurant was fantastic for a hotel restaurant, with really good menu choice.
Really nice touch on check out, the receptionist gave me a bottle of water to travel with, looking forward to my return visit next time in London",5,2012,12,30
113,Warm staying experience. Excellent decor and service.," Stayed for Christmas with family on Luxury studio. Beautiful and spacious room.My son 1 year old especially  enjoyed the extra space.  Had a nice Christmas present for my son from duty manager. Very thoughtful. Booked for Christmas day dinner and had nice experience. Love the fire place in the lounge with nice decor, perfect setting to relax and have a drink. Will stay again while in London.",5,2012,12,30
113,Very nice location & excellent staffs,I have stayed in this hotel as i was meeting my friends. The girl at the reception who checked me in was very professional and gave me all required information. The room was fantastic and beds were very comfortable. I had drinks in the bar and lunch in the restaurant with my 4 other friends as it was a birthday of my friend. The staffs at the bar & restaurants were fantastic & the service we recieved was just great. They went extramile & brought a birthday cake with candles was just a gr8 surprise for all of us which i dont see in all hotels. Could not find a fault anywhere. I would like to say thanks to all staffs at The Kensington Hotel and will definitely come back. I highly recomend this hotel to everyone. Thanks once again.,5,2012,12,29
113,"Great Location, Fantastic Staff!!!","We visited the hotel in November for a spot of shopping before Christmas, this was our second stay at the Kensington and the service just keeps getting better and better.We were just spoilt rotten from beginning to end. It was the small touches that made our stay so special, from the welcome we received in the lobby upon arrival to the lovely turn down service each night. Breakfast was fantastic also, the buffet was displayed so nicely and there was such a huge selection.
The Kensington is our Hotel of choice in London and we look forward to returning again soon.",5,2012,12,28
113,One of the best hotel bars & service in London,"I am a visitor from New Zealand and working at nearby Imperial College until February 2013. I enjoy relaxing in hotel bars rather than street bars or pubs. Although I am not a guest, I frequently visit the bar after a busy days work to have a couple of Chardonnays and a bite to eat. The atmosphere is sublime, the music is  easy-listening and low-key and above all the bar staff are easily the best I have encountered in London! They are extremely welcoming and cheerful everyday! Even when the bar and lounge areas are busy they will always stop for a short or long chat. I would particularly like to mention James, one of the bar managers as he always makes me feel comfortable and at home when I visit after a sometimes fraught days work. The four Italian bartenders are just about the funniest and  curtious guys I've had the pleasure to be served by. I would heartily recommend this hotel and bar due to its wonderful service and perfect relaxing atmosphere!
Clive",5,2012,12,27
113,"""WoW"" real service by real staff!","An ideal location for, site seeing, shopping, the girls and cocktails. We checked in early morning and meet a young gentleman called Ross who kindly took our bags. We were invited in for breakfast as our rooms were not ready, a nice touch and breakfast was amazing. We hit the shops hard and arrived ack to the hotel early evening. We checked in and the rooms were amazing with great views of the tree lined avenue outside. We went for cocktails in Aubrey and Alexandro looked after us with a lot of charm and the cocktails were amazing. We went out or dinner in Mayfair and arrived back for a delightful cocktail before bed. Over all an making say and was a pity we had to leave so early the next day. Well worth a visit!",5,2012,12,24
113,Love it!,"I don't know how I've missed out on staying at The Kensington over my past few years of regular stops in London, but I decided to try this hotel following a discerning colleague's recommendation.

I was not disappointed: I'd been staying at other London 5* hotels the week before on a business trip, but The Kensington stood out from the rest! 

The refurbishments may be new, but the level of service is underpinned by old-school professionalism with a modern twist. I was already stressed out with jet-lag and juggling my work with family commitments the weekend I stayed, and the staff took everything in their stride.

The decor was just the right balance between grand elegance and homely cosiness. I loved the interior design with modern feature-walls and quality furnishings (which was a major relief after a recent stay at an Ikea-furniture-tries-to-be-hip 5* hotel!). I especially liked the generous spacing of the downstairs drawing rooms just off the lobby, and would definitely hope to spend more time there on my next visit.

I stayed in a superior king room overlooking the back: I would have liked the bathroom to be a bit bigger, but the room dimensions are to-be-expected of London hotels. The room had a warmly ambience (more to do with the interior design, not just the central heating) which made it a welcome sanctuary from the 2oC London winter.

I'm definitely a new fan of The Kensington and have already booked my next stay.

Well done to the Management and Housekeeping team for doing a sterling job! ",5,2012,12,23
113,Great Location,"The Kensington Hotel is located very close to South Kensington tube and the area is well served with coffee shops, Waitrose, restaurants etc. very close to the Natural History Museum, V&A and a 10 min stroll to Harrods. The staff were excellent, attentive and friendly. Our room was a standard room but much larger than others we have been allocated elsewhere at hotels in London, in a similar price range. Two armchairs meant both of us could sit in comfort - so often hotels provide only one, meaning one of us has to sit on the bed or on a desk chair. I was pleased to see a Nespresso coffee maker in the room.Having used Nespresso at home for over 10 years, the quality of a cup of in-room coffee is far superior to those little stick sachets of instant coffee. 

The hotel was extremely quiet at night. Carpeted corridors meant no loud footsteps and the quality and cleanliness of the public areas was first class. Although we always stay somewhere different on our shortbreaks to London we would certainly consider a return to The Kensington. The per night room rate without breakfast was ¬£147. Booked through Mr & Mrs Smith.",5,2012,12,23
113,Christmas dream come true,"I booked this hotel as I planned to take my wife to The Royal Albert Hall for a Christmas concert. This was a long time dream of hers. The hotel is within a 10 minute walk. Our two night booking also allowed us the time to ""do"" some shops and try and become a litle more cultured with a museum visit or two.
The hotel is perfectly placed for all these things. 

The hotel is advertised as being ""London's Finest Townhouse"" and the staff go out of their way to try and live up to the billing. The hotel was immaculately clean as were the staff - something sadly lacking in many hotel staff these days. Staff were to a man (and woman) polite, professional and attentive without being intrusive. Nothing was too much trouble right down to a couple of bottles of water for the journey home.

Our daughter had booked us a High tea as a surprise for our first day but unbeknown to us had arrived at the hotel to join us. The hotel staff were happy to ""hide her"" until we were seated at a table set for two and brought her to join us as we were about to order. It was obvious that they just got pleasure seing the pleasure we got from this wonderful surprise. The High Tea was first class.

I have stayed in a number of hotels in Europe, North America and Canada but have never stopped in one where I have been looked after as well as this. The reception area, dining areas and our room were immaculate. The staff were first rate and without fuss went that ""extra mile"", something which is missing in many similar establishments today.

I cannot rate this hotel and its staff highly enough. A return is in the offing and this review is well deserved. Thank you for making our Christmas dream come true!",5,2012,12,22
113,Excellent hotel.,"My first visit to London was made memorable, the hotel was boutique and beautiful, breakfast was excellent, bell service was very helpful and the room was comfortable and cosy. The location was simply great. Spent my spare time just by walking in nearby places. i will definitely come back on my next visit to London.",5,2012,12,22
113,Martyn and front desk staff are tops,"I recently stayed for 5 nights for a business and sightseeing trip and staff were flexible about allowing us to check in early. Martyn, the doorman and concierge, was helpful and friendly and the best part of the experience at the Kensington Hotel. The location and neighborhood is a big plus.The menu is a bit esoteric for daily consumption and the room service charges steep, however, we soon learned the neighborhood spots for more casual meals. The bartender Lorenzo, was also gracious and friendly. Our room had high ceilings and lots of hot water.
The fitness room was very well equipped. I had read other Yelp communications on this hotel which suggested milk and cookies  and hot mulled wine every night so was expecting  more in  terms of amenities. I found that only executive level rooms ..suites..receive evening amenities. Mulled wine was available a couple of night during our stay.",4,2012,12,22
113,London Made Easy,"The Kensington was such an easy stay.  I wasn't that into my first room, so I asked if it would be possible to switch to an equal but different room, which they did immediately and I loved my next room.  The staff was awesome and so nice and helpful, the location is great, and the whole overall experience was effortless and easy.  I knew nothing about the Kensington before I got there (only what I had read online), but it worked out really well.  The staff is probably my favorite part about it- all nice, kind, and helpful.",5,2012,12,21
113,"Really high quality, helpful staff","I've been to london for 2 days, stayed for 1 night at Kensington Hotel. The whole experience was great. Kind welcome, polite and helpful staff, room was nice and comfortable. Maybe a bit small, but had everything we needed.

Bathroom is clean and pretty and bed very comfortable.

Definitely a good hotel, worth its price.",4,2012,12,21
113,Afternoon tea,"The Kensington Hotel is quiet, charming and convenient. Service is first rate. The menu selections were healthy. We stayed 3 days, and the staff at the front desk and in the dining room greeted us by name from Day 1. That was a very nice personal touch. I have booked champagne afternoon tea at Aubrey Restaurant for myself and my husband to celebrate the birth of our son. Staff explained the deal for afternoon tea: a pot of tea of your choice, finger sandwiches (including cucumber, smoked salmon, and egg mayo), a fat scone with clotted cream and strawberry jam, plus selection of the delicious cakes. The baking is tip-top. The staff were excellent, extremely friendly , helpful and attentive. We were very impressed with their service. The hotel itself is stunning! The room we were in was beautiful and the presentation and quality of the food was also excellent.
I am delighted to have this opportunity to convey my thanks  to the staff at the Kensington. They were truly professional and made our stay comfortable and relaxing at the end of a very stressful week. We hope to see them again soon.",5,2012,12,20
113,A stunning hotel,"We have just returned from a fabulous trip to the Kensington hotel. The decor was elegant, and the customer service was exemplary. It was the personal touches such as giving us a complimentary upgrade on our room as it was my husbands birthday and leaving a plate of fruit and a personalised note in our room which meant so much. Staff were extremely friendly and dedicated to making our stay as enjoyable as possible. I am sure that not many other 5 star London hotels could rival this in terms of customer care, value for money and personalised touches. A truly amazing stay...we will be back. Thank you very much to Ross and his team-Anna and Craig Barr",5,2012,12,20
113,Amazing holiday at the Kensington!,Last Christmas I had the opportunity to stay at The Kensington Hotel for Christmas and had a wonderful experience! The staff was very welcoming and accommodating and the room was absolutely beautiful. The dinner served on Christmas Day offered great selection and the holiday decor was perfect! I had a great Christmas at the hotel.,5,2012,12,20
113,Afternoon tea,"I chose the Hotel as  a venue for a cosy afternoon tea  based on some of the reveiws.I wasn't disappointed. We were met by Vince one of the concierge team  who was polite friendly and distinguished.
The layout of the rooms are ideal for creating a traditional London  christmas feel with a modern twist . The furniture is comfortable and positioned to allow enough privacy whilst people watching! The real fires and Christmas trees were perfect on a cold winters day . We had a champagne tea which also included a mulled wine granita , an unusual addition but complemented the warmed scones that were served in a crisp linen cloth.
As we left the hotel we were offered a mug of warm mulled wine to help us on our way. Perfect !",5,2012,12,20
113,the perfect hotel for business trips,If you are looking for something different in London you should stay in this hotel.  The hotel is only a short walk from the South Kensington tube station and is very comfortable.  The staff are excellent and make you feel at home from the minute you walk in the door. The lounge is very comfortable and very useful for business meetings.  Well worth a try.,5,2012,12,20
113,Lovely hotel,"Stayed in the Kensington for 5 nights while in London for work.  As other posters have mentioned:

Pros:
Hotel is lovely
Front desk staff very helpful
Turn down service a nice touch
Comfy bed and pillows
Room was very clean and tidy, but also very small
Hotel breakfast is really good - particularly the vegetaria option and the porridge
5 minute walk to South Kensington Tube Station
Abundance of resturants/cafes just outside the hotel (Burgers, Pub, Lebanese, Japanese, Thai, Indian etc)
Waitrose and Tesco Express 2 minutes away from hotel
V&A Museum 5 mins from hotel

Cons:
Small rooms, no desk to put laptop and work documents etc on

Would definately stay again.",4,2012,12,20
113,Excellent again ....,"This was my second stay and it was a good if not better then the first time . From the moment you are greeted upon arrival by the doorman, you are treated to lesson in how to care for a customer . It is truly a great place to stay . ",5,2012,12,19
113,Amazing and just what we needed,"We arrived at the steps of the hotel to be greeted by Ward a very friendly gentleman. Our check in was quick and the hot towel was a great touch. We were escorted to our room by a young gentleman, pleasant, nicely dressed and efficient. Our room was on the 1st floor, bright and clean, high ceilings and looked like a nice pad to relax. We did not get to enjoy to restaurant, bar or gym, we went shopping for most of the day and arrived back late. The hotel was busy but a nice gentleman found us a nice table in the lounge for a night cap. 
Overall we enjoyed our stay and will be back in the new year.",5,2012,12,19
113,Absolutely amazing,"My husband and I booked this hotel on recommendation by a friend. I wanted something more central but as The Kensington is only a short walk to the tube it was no problem getting around at all. It was our wedding anniversary and this hotel perfectly suited us. Coffee machine in the room, tv at the end of the bath. Very stylish and cosy hotel. Wonderful selection of wines. Affordable. Great breakfast. Lovely Christmas Tree. The staff couldn't do enough for you. After my run I walked in to the lobby and a lady on reception handed me my room key and a bottle of water without even being asked! Now that's what you call great, personal service. I would definately stay here again. We stayed at The Savoy in March and although it too was amazing, the service was much better at the Kensington and better value for money. ",5,2012,12,18
113,"A good, not great, experience","We enjoyed several things about this hotel, including the location and its proximity to the tube station (5 min walk), as well as the Natural History Museum and other lovely tourist sites. We appreciated the amazing service given by the concierges, all of whom went above and beyond to give us great restaurant recommendations, hail taxis, make appointments, and generally be of service. We loved the mulled wine that greeted us every evening. Be warned: the hotel food is way overpriced and only so-so. Our room had a lovely view, but was tiny and had no dresser drawers so for the 5 days we were there, it was a crazy mess of luggage and clothes. We had to ask several times for face cloths that were never replaced each day, and our internet was slooooow so they finally put in a router which helped immensely. Overall, we were pleased but not blown away by the hotel.",4,2012,12,18
113,Second visit as good as the first one!,This is my second visit to the Aubrey in The Kensington Hotel. The first occasion was for Afternoon Tea in the cosy fireplace lounge and we had such a lovely time. The food was excellent and there was enough to feed us for 24 hours! This time we booked into the restaurant with my cousin and his wife since they were staying in a hotel nearby. The first thing my cousin's wife said when she walked in is that they should have stayed there instead! We ate baby lemon sole with lobster mousse and caviar and champagne sauce. It was amazing! The Barman also surprised us with lovely welcome cocktails - they even remember to do a non-alcoholic one as when I booked I mentioned I was pregnant.,5,2012,12,18
113,home from home,"A genuine home from home for me..

Gorgeous, stylish and comfortable surroundings together with the genuine warmth of all the staff at the Kensington make every stay a pleasure and as a result i'm a regular visitor.

couldn't recommend this place highly enough",5,2012,12,18
113,"Ok, but not nearly as nice as her sister","Stayed at the Kensington for a night before we left London, as we had gone down for a couple days in Bordeaux and wanted to be relatively close to Heathrow for morning flights.  I was kind of disappointed - especially after experiencing the wonderful Bloomsbury just a couple days before.  

The pros were the great location - again, nearer Heathrow than a lot of Central London and just around the corner from the South Kensington and Gloucester Road tubes - as well as the beautifully laid out lounge area and the front desk/concierge staff.  

The cons were the decor that was a bit dated and the uneven floors in the hallways, but mostly the horrible service in the bar.  It was the polar opposite of the Bloomsbury, where they were the best combination of local bar treatment with high class service.  We walked in and were handed a menu by the waitress.  She said that the bar was closing, but that the lounge was all night.  We took a seat on one of the comfortable couches and waited for our order to be taken.  30 minutes later, I was dozing off and my girlfriend went over to the bar to get our order taken.  Another 5-10 minutes after that, we had 2 rather poorly made drinks and the bartender disappeared to make drinks for his friends that had walked in.  Completely unacceptable.  

To their credit, the duty manager the next morning was very apologetic and took the drinks off our bill.  It was a kind gesture and he was both genuine and professional about it.  I rate the service as poor because of the terrible bar service, but the rest was perfectly acceptable and pleasant.

They also seemed to have a bit of an IT problem and it took quite some time to deal with the bill.  

All in all, I would stay at the Bloomsbury over the Kensington if you are doing Doyle/GHA.  Actually, I'd stay at the Bloomsbury anyway.",3,2012,12,17
113,Good staff,"Great staff and a pleasant welcome on arrival, all very helpful trying to make your stay a pleasant experience. A bit crafty in not including VAT on the website, is this legal? The bedroom although clean and well furnished was a little on the small side. Breakfast was quite nice but should be at ¬£21.",4,2012,12,13
113,Not every room the same,"We stayed here for two nights in December on a visit to family and to attend a sporting event. We were attracted by reviews and  that the hotel is well located for the a number of museums. The outside of the hotel promised a lot - an impressive building  - and, on entering, we were similarly impressed by the look and quality of the public areas. Reception staff and the porter who took our bags to our room were both pleasant and knowledgeable. However, the room we were allocated (on the third floor) was very small, with an ill-fitting worn carpet and a shower that leaked onto the bathroom floor (no matter which way you positioned the door). In brief, the room was somewhat past its best and did not live up to the rest of the hotel. More disappointment when, on checking out, we were presented with an inaccurate account which took staff some ten minutes to rectify.",3,2012,12,13
113,Not only a great hotel - judging by the reviews - but also a wonderful space for a company function/event,"I helped to organise my company's holiday party which took place last week.  It was a great success!  Not only were our surroundings lovely and tastefully decorated but the level of service offered by Karthik and his team at The Kensington Hotel was brilliant.  What really made the difference was the attention to detail and the degree to which Karthik went over and above our expectations:  taking great care to ensure the special diets and allergies were catered for and ensuring that there were staff on hand at all times to cater for us.  The kitchen equally produced 3 course meals for over 75 guests that were very well presented and several notches above what I was expecting from a large catered event (based on other experiences!).  My pre-planning was made easier by Karthik who prompted us on everything we would need to decide on in good time, and he was a joy to work with.  The set-ups and room clears for the dancing afterwards also happened effortlessly.  Bravo!  My colleagues have already asked if we will go back next year!",5,2012,12,12
113,Be careful of room allocation,"I booked the Kensington Hotel as a belated Wedding present for my husband combined with tickets to see his favourate band in London.  Having read the reviews I had no doubts that this hotel would live up to its expectaions, however upon making the reservation I emailed the Hotel to let them know that this was a Wedding Gift and therefore would like to make it as special as possibletherefore if there was any possibility of upgrading our room I would be most interested.   I recieved a lovely email in response acknowledging my requests and assuring me that the hotel would do its upmost to accomodate us if possible.  On arrival at the hotel we were very impressed,  the reception and lounge area were very welcoming and as grand as we had seen on the website so we had no reason to doubt that the rooms would not be of the same standard.  Our check in was dealt with by a receptionist new to the role (according to her), but she was very pleasant.  I mentioned to her the fact that I had already emailed the hotel regarding the fact it was a Wedding present and asked if there would be any chance of upgrading.  She Checked in the back room with the manager but due to how busy the Hotel was she said that unfortunately there was no chance of upgrading.  We accepted that and then took the room that had been allocated to us all the time thinking that whatever room we had would be luxurious anyway considering we were in a 5 star Hotel....How wrong we were!.  We were allocated room Number 405 and all i can decribe it as is a small attic room with a double bed cramped into it.  The paintwork on the wall was filthy and there was part of the floor along the skirting board that had sunken by about an inch therefore exposing a great hole.  The carpet was grubby and the tiny bathroom looked like it had been given the once over but certainly not to 5 star standards..I was devastated.  After 10 minutes of deliberating over it I decided to compain.  I approached a receptionist who had been at the desk when we checked in and who had prompted the girl that had served us originally and told her to allocate us room 405.  I expressed my disappointment at the room we had been given and stated that the standard of it was by no means acceptable for a 5 star hotel.  She promptly apologised and without any deliberation said that she could up grade us to a studio suite (complimentary) and took me to the room to show me.  This room was lovely, much more to the standard I had been expecting in the first place with a 4 poster bed and large bathroom so we accepted.  From this point on we had a lovely stay at the hotel but I just feel that the initial experience of it could have been made so much better and under no circumstances should anyone paying the prices at the Kensington Hotel be allocated a shabby substandard room like Number 405.  I have to therefore base my rating on what we first saw as i think something should be done to improve this aspect of the hotel...other than that we had a lovely stay.",3,2012,12,12
113,Home from home,"It's somewhat strange writing a review of a hotel that has become a home from home over the last good number of years. I spend about 50 nights a year in London and at that level I simply couldn't afford the time shopping around for each trip particularly where the quality became random. So I needed to settle on somewhere regular. Nowhere could be more welcoming than The Kensington.

Oddly I used to stay there quite often when it was Jury's Kensington. The transformation from that hotel to the Doyle Collection Kensington was nothing but amazing. Anyone who remembers it as the 'old' hotel needs to come and take a look.

As a regular traveller I look for hotels that are intimate, have a welcoming feeling about them and where I feel a sense of attachment when I walk through the door. For me this hotel delivers on all fronts. From the chaps at the front door to the welcome at reception and the guys behind the bar I have always felt at home. 

Next in importance is comfort. Sure, a nominal number of the rooms are small, that's a regular issue in major city hotels. However throughout the Kensington the level of comfort and the quality of furnishings is one of the best I have come across. As I write I look around my room and I have soft velvety furnishings, deep cotton towels, an iPod dock, slippers, robes, complementary mineral water, odd coloured cookies and plenty of power sockets etc. The small things like the turn down service with chocs and weather forecast notes just add to the overall good feeling. 

Free wifi is a big plus. I still cannot believe how many so called premium hotels charge for this service. Here it's easy, no annoying vouchers needed. 

This is a fine, luxurious hotel that attracts both a business and touristy set. There is also a definite celebrity element here but it's played down by the hotel. 

My view is its still a hidden gem of luxury. 

",5,2012,12,11
113,"It's just so pleasant, sort of old school modern.","Great hotel, in a great location at a good price, we have stayed here a few times because it ticks all our boxes, it's not boutique, very pleasant & helpful staff (never met a grumpy one yet!!)  good size beds, good hotel bar & social areas, nice little touches such as a flask of tea relaxing blends (changing nightly) placed in your room with a small cake, nice toiletries.",4,2012,12,10
113,An elegant treat,"I usually stay at this hotel when I am in London. I always feel welcome as if I was going back home. Staff is very professional and caring. The bar and living room are really nice, actually very elegant and cosy especially in winter when the the fires are on. I usually invite my friends for a drink or for dinner. Food is fresh, good and well presented. 
I usually stay in a studio suite as the superior rooms are a bit too small. 503 is my favourite room, it is not big, but has everything you need and it is beautiful with a four poster bed, two comfortable red velvet armchair. spacious bathroom with tub and shower. 
I love when at night, coming back after a long day, I am welcomed with a hot tea and a cake to help sleeping well. The bed are super comfortable. I love this hotel and they always thrieve to make my stay wonderful. Location is so good. Close to SK tube and with lots of restaurant and bar at walking distance.",4,2012,12,10
113,Amazing service.....,"What a great hotel.  From the minute you arrive until the time you leave, there is nothing they could not do for you.  From the burning scented candles in reception, the warm towels whilst you wait to check in, the amazingly comfortable beds (yes you will need an alarm clock, as you will not wake up otherwise). The Aromatherapy Associates shower gel and shampoo are a must try...  stay here and you will not be disappointed. Yes the rooms are small, but as travelling for business, did not spend much time in them so was not a problem... but there were two great lounges downstairs should you want to relax.  Well done and look forward to coming back....",4,2012,12,06
113,Don't understand all the good reviews,"I don't really understand all the good reviews. I have stayed all over the world in hotels and this is in my opinion mediocre at best. The rooms are tiny, the bathrooms are even smaller. The carpets are old nd full of stains. The walls have stains too. I changed room twice and it was about the same in every room. The service is friendly and welcoming. The price is ok for London. None the less it is in my opinion quite far away from 4 1/2 tripadvisor stars",3,2012,12,05
113,Absolute Heaven... and then some!,"My wife & I stayed at the gorgeous Kensington Hotel last week as a treat as we had tickets to the The Human League concert at the Royal Albert Hall. We had planned to check-in together but alas the lure of a having the bedroom to herself and of course getting ready for the concert (jeans & t-shirt) meant that the lovely wife checked-in a good hour before I did.. From what I hear and we are quite critical of hotel standards and service; she had a DREAM check-in.. no 'in your face' staff or over eager concierge.. they left her be and provided that most comfortable level of service she has experienced in London.... I had the same when I checked-in also, and a hot towel to freshen my check-in experience (the little things that make it all worthwhile!). 
The room was amazing, we got upgraded to a lovely 4-poster bed room which just made the stay even more enjoyable. The bed was SOOOOOOO comfortable and the shower was powerful. After a quick drink in the bar (again the service was truly amazing) we shot off to the RAH. Upon our return we had a lovely welcome by the night manager and the team.
Having to shoot off for an early meeting, my wife fed back on the breakfast and check-out - one word 'EXCEPTIONAL' said it for me and I though she was still suffering from seeing her favourite band the night before! 
All in all, the hotel delivered above expectation fro 2 very fussy and demanding travellers and I don't believe I have ever given a hotel 5*, but the team at the Kensington Hotel truly deserve it!",5,2012,12,05
113,There is no second choice,"I just wrapped up a four-month stay in London on business and had the pleasure of staying at the Kensington Doyle the entire time.  

I understand that many of the rooms are quite tiny, but I stayed in the spacious #329 which was a perfect place to come ""home"" to after long days at work.  The four poster bed was very large and very comfortable.  Often in a hotel, the pillows are a weak link, but I rested soundly every night.  My room had three windows which I could open to let fresh air in!  So many hotels these days trap you inside with the recycled air, so this was a huge bonus for my sanity.  

The bathroom was also very spacious with an ""open"" shower and a large bath.  (I will say that while the shower design is very nice, because there is no door, the floor and bathmat often got quite wet)

The entire staff was always so incredibly helpful and nice and pleasant and welcoming from the guys at the front door to the wonderful women (and men) at the front desk as well as those at the restaurant in the morning and in the sitting rooms in the evening.  I can't say enough about them.

The location was perfect with plenty of restaurants nearby as well as two grocery markets just up the street.  The South Kensington Underground station is a short five minute walk so getting anywhere in the city was incredibly simple.  There is also a Barclay's bicycle rack just outside the door, so on nice days, having that convenience was a huge plus.  

The next time I am in London, I won't hesitate to book reservations at the Doyle, not only for a wonderful hotel, but to see my friends again.",5,2012,11,30
113,Excellent London Hotel,"I visit London at least once a quarter and after staying at several very expensive, so called ""5 Star "", hotels I now stay at The Kensington. Standard rooms are small and only suitable for single occupancy, but Superior and above are fine and the four-poster rooms superb. The showers are excellent with superb water pressure. The thing that sets the Kensington apart from all the other hotels though is the service. EVERYONE wants to help, which is very unusual in London. The Concierge are fantastic and have never failed to book me into a restaurant I have requested. The reception staff are very friendly and the barmen mix some excellent cocktails at reasonable prices (for London). Breakfast is superb with a great cold buffet and all hot food cooked to order (no nasty heat lamps). All the serving staff are attentive and eager to please but not in your face, which I like. All in all a real find and I would recommend it to anybody.",5,2012,11,29
113,Hotel and Bar,I stayed there in june - me and my girlfriend. Our stay was very pleasant. Rooms are not that big (which is usual for London) but everything was clean and the service was great. Michel and Alessandro - Bartenders - were fantastic. Every night we had a different drink before dinner.,4,2012,11,27
113,Fab one night stay,"Me and my boyfriend had a special day last Saturday and stayed at the Kensington Hotel. From the time we checked in to the time we checked out everything was amazing. The service was excellent, room was spacious and clean (loved the nespresso machine LOL) and food was very nice. The location is excellent for central London and lot of things to do within walking distance (we went to the winter wonderland on Sunday). The decoration of the hotel is very elegant, the lounge is very very cosy and in overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2012,11,26
113,Elegant!,"This is a beautiful hotel in the heart of south west London. I frequent it regularly and it feels like a home away from home. The Staff are wonderful and very accomodating. The Hotel itself is really elegant, open fires in the main reception rooms make for a perfect place to relax post a busy day. The bedrooms accrosss the board are great and very comfortable, whilst the suites excel. Food is excellent. I always have a lovely stay at The Kensington, and look forward to returning again.",5,2012,11,26
113,Great weekend stay,"Lovely room, great & helpful staff, excellent bed + linen, perfect location and very elegant drawing room.
Will return!

Rooms stocked with everything essential + excellent comfort. Best hotel bed I have experienced. Linens in very good quality. Espresso maker in Deluxe rooms, safe big enough for a laptop, good reading light and shower products well worth packing in your suitcase when going home. Great details such as salon quality hairdryer, good TV and complimentary turn-down service.",5,2012,11,24
113,Cosy and elegant,"I'm a regular visitor of Kensington Hotel lounge. 
I love that chic and elegant interior. Best seats are near the fire place. Once You got it- order white hot chocolate with mashmallows- that's the best thing You can think of on winter evening. It's mouth melting pleasure...quite pricey -5 pounds, but it's worth it !! It includes charming service that always makes You feel welcomed, even if You come for a cup of hot choclate..
Can't wait to visit them again...",5,2012,11,24
113,Great Location,"Stayed here for eight nights where the service was great, fantastic location close to a huge aray of resturants as well as two tube stations. The decor is fitting with the era and complimented with 2 open fire places which set the scene.",4,2012,11,24
113,Beautiful hotel in great area of London,High end interior and exterior.  Doorman very helpful without getting in the way.  Reception staff were very friendly and knowledgeable; check in was fast and easy.  Room was small but very nicely appointed with a very comfortable bed.  Climate control was very good in the room and the hotel was very quiet at night. Common areas were high end and new in appearance. Extremely nice hotel.,5,2012,11,23
113,Perfect stay at Kensington Hotel,"Value for money stay in a very nice hotel in London. From the reception to the breakfast, the staff was very helpful and knowledgeable. Small (standard) but confortable and well decorated room.
Free wifi in all the hotel.",5,2012,11,22
113,A beautiful hotel in lovely surroundings,"We stayed here for one night combining a theatre break and general London sight seeing trip. The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are amazing. A little small but to be expected in this tyle of hotel. The staff were very attentive, we arrived early and our room was not ready so were offered complimentary drinks in the lounge whilst we waited. We would definately return, although would not like to be on the side of the hotel where all the air conditioning units were. They were very noisy and did keep us awake.We should have called down to change rooms but it was late and we were tired from the day out.  Overall though a very lovely place to stay.",4,2012,11,21
113,Best chilled atmosphere !,"I had the pleasure of spending some time every week for the last 3 months at the Aubrey Bar and I  findit very enjoyable and relaxing.
The bar and floor staff are professional , attent and very welcoming,I definetly recommend the afternoon tea and the cocktails , both are amazing!
I hvn't try the food yet , but guests of the hotel suggest me to do it , it is apparently a real treat!",5,2012,11,20
113,Great Hotel Great Location!,"Stayed here with my daughter who attends University in England. Lovely hotel with all the amenities. Close to shopping and good access to the Tube. Staff were more than helpful always. Consierge services were excellent in getting us play tickets, transportation, directions, etc. Room was small by Canadian standards but exceptionally clean (and I'm a clean freak)and well appointed. Kennsington was a very nice district to stay in...lots of restaurants and shops and stores and of course close to Harrods! Will definitely stay here again next time.",5,2012,11,19
113,Travelling with a baby-great room and great service,"The location was good and the area was quiet and perfect for a baby and her trolley.It was a lot of nice cafes and restaurants around and the hotel is walking distance to Kings Road with great shopping.

When we arrived and the personell saw that I was travelling with a five months old baby they were so helpful.We got a big room facing the backyard.The service and the facilities were great-we are so happy with our stay.",5,2012,11,18
113,First class hotel with a first rate staff.,"My requirements for a hotel are a quiet room, a comfortable bed, and a healthy breakfast.  And I am probably the most dreaded guest for a hotel, having been an Executive Housekeeper for a major property in Washington DC. 

The Kensington Hotel is quiet, charming and convenient.  Service is first rate.  The menu selections were healthy.   I stayed a week, and the staff at the front desk and in the dining room greeted me by name from Day 1.  That was a very nice personal touch.

The Wi-Fi in the room was free, and there were two free computer terminals in an alcove off the elevator lobby that provided fast service.

The lobby and the dining room had a free selection of English, Irish and US newspapers for the taking.  That was a nice touch.

Housekeeping was superb.  The room was spotlessly clean as were the public rooms on the property.  The room was serviced twice a day, promptly and unobtrusively.

The hotel is convenient to the South Kensington underground station with practical stores (pharmacy, small restaurants, etc) nearby.

Two big pluses:  I wanted a taxi to Heathrow since I had a lot of luggage.  The concierge helpfully explained the least expensive way to get there by cab and then called one for me, saving me a significant amount of cab fare.  And on my return home, I found that I had left behind my address book.  I received a return e-mail from Reception within 24 hours of my contacting the hotel notifying me that it had been located and posted to me in the US.  That was service!

The Kensington Hotel is good value for money and a well run property!  Many thanks for a great stay.",5,2012,11,15
113,What a gem!!!!!!!,"We stayed here for one night to combine a concert at the Royal Albert Hall. We could not fault this hotel in anyway what so ever. Location was excellent, staff attentive but not over the top, room faultless and the afternoon tea sublime. We have always been so disappointed in London hotels but would not hesitate to return or recommend this one.",5,2012,11,13
113,Excellent hotel in heart of Kensington,"A lovely hotel, conveniently situated on Queensgate between Gloucester Road & South Kensington tube stations. Hotel lobby was immaculate & initial impression of staff upon arrival very good. Was greeted at the kerb & assistance offered with my suitcase (very welcome!) I arrived early and luckily they have a room ready for me. I appreciate it when a hotel lets you check in early if the room is ready. I understand that sometimes especially in small hotels that they have to wait for rooms to be cleaned, but it annoys me when hotels stick to their check in time no matter what. 

Room was clean & well appointed, nice flat screen TV. It was on the small size but then the hotel is a series of old townhouses that have been converted so I wasn‚Äôt expecting a large room.  Shower was great with a rain shower head, good water pressure. Was a very quiet room, no noise from the hallway or adjoining rooms either. Would gladly stay again.",4,2012,11,13
113,Cute little boutique hotel,"I stayed here on a Saturday night with my daughter during a weekend trip to London.
The staff were very friendly and helpful, asking if we knew how to get to various places and offering instructions. The hotel itself is very well situated, just a few minutes walk from South Kensington tube station. I would recommend using the tube, as if you aproach the hotel from the other end of Queen's Gate it is quite a long walk!
The interior is very nicely decorated, my only gripe was that our room was very small, with the bathroom being miniscule. My daughter and I are both very small so it was ok but anyone a bit bigger might feel rather claustrophobic. I completed an in-house survey and I was contacted and told that other rooms are larger so my advice would be to ask when booking.
We didn't use any other facilities except room service for an evening meal which was very good, but expensive when extras such as service and delivery charges were added. That said, if we had eaten out locally it would probably have cost more, and we were too tired after a busy day shopping and seeing exhibitions at the V&A to go out.",4,2012,11,13
113,"Beautiful hotel, service slightly rocky","We stayed for two nights in Room 309, on a half-price internet deal. At that price, considered it excellent value.

Welcome: Superb
When we arrived we were greeted by two doormen, a concierge and two receptionists. There's a desk in the lobby with what appeared to be an information service offering travel advice to a customer, and with complimentary tea and apples on offer (actually I'm not sure if the apples were meant for decoration or consumption, but I ate several and wasn't told off...). The receptionist checking us in offered hot towels, which was lovely! We were offered help with our luggage, (we were travelling light so couldn't take advantage of that without handing over my handbag) and a guide to show us to our room. A doorman came out with us to help hail a cab when we went out for the evening.

Room: Very good
The room was big and very well appointed; the bed was huge and thankfully did not have the ridiculous profusion of pillows often found in other hotels which stops you getting into bed. There was a light duvet and a thick blanket (a real blanket, not one of those strange bed-covers that only cover the bottom two feet of the bed and can't be used for warming the body), which was perfect as we could remove the blanket to stay cool at night. There was a large table with beautiful period armchairs where we ate breakfast and a large fitted wardrobe in the entryway. There was an umbrella for guests' use in the wardrobe, which (for any foreigners not yet acquainted with British weather) you will need. That was very thoughtful and useful. The carpet was delightfully thick and there were two full-length mirrors, one in the main bedroom area and one inside the wardrobe door. There was a very handy bank of plugs for charging all your devices.

The bathroom was decorated in marble and slate with under-floor heating, and was of very good proportions so that we could walk into it normally without the contortion act we've practiced in many other hotel bathrooms. Perfectly clean.

The room was nice and quiet. We went out to the theatre and came back to find chocolates on the pillow with a weather forecast and the breakfast menu, and slippers by the bed. That was great.

Little snags: 
- The view was abominable - a supremely ugly service courtyard with drainage pipes, air vents and a lot of brick wall. I didn't mind this at all but don't get this room if you like looking out the window.
- There was no hand-cream in the bathroom, which is pretty standard among hotel toiletries.
- Again, as in all hotels nowadays apparently, there was only one packet of biscuits in a double room. So cheap! I don't understand why hotels scrimp on biscuits of all things, which must cost about 30p.
- The mini-bar was rather ill-stocked, containing only water, OJ, cola, beer and nuts. I have seen better.
- There were no wine glasses in the room, nor was there a corkscrew.
- There was only one towel rail, so not enough for two bath-towels, two hand towels and two robes.
- The TV didn't work very well. The picture kept freezing and going into little squares for a few seconds.
- Initially there was a kettle in the room - on the second day a man came to remove the kettle and replace it with a Nespresso machine. The instructions provided were for a different model so I could only make the machine function intermittently. I asked for the kettle back, but the replacement was faulty and did not stop boiling once the water was heated, which was a safety hazard and also drenched the contents of the tea area and the adjoining wardrobe (ie, my clothes) with steam, which condensed and poured onto the carpet. The only way to switch it off was to plunge your hand into the steam to reach the plug at the back of the cupboard.

Service: Mixed
The hotel appeared convinced that there was only one of us, despite the evidence of our physical presence. We rang for wine glasses and only got one; we were only given one pair of slippers and chocolate on one pillow; the barman handed me a drinks menu but not my partner, even though he was sitting right next to me. Weird.

We were asked what paper we wanted when we checked in, then told that it was payable but free if we joined the loyalty program, which also entitled us to a free bottle of water (yay!). We signed up but never saw the water and did not receive the paper. When we rang down for it in the morning, only the news and sports sections of a multi-section paper were delivered, and without the weekend supplements.

Room service was also rather slow and erratic. I waited half an hour for some ice. I ordered ice twice, specifying 'a jug of ice'. The first time I got a glass of ice, the second an ice-bucket.  

That said, the staff were brilliantly friendly and had a lovely welcoming attitude. It was definitely a case of poor organisation, rather than poor service ethic.

Facilities: Excellent
There's gym, which is great if you've been sitting in a plane and eating dubious airline food, and aren't as lazy as I am. 

Two computers are available for patrons' use, in a fairly private place by the lifts.

The downstairs lounge is fantastically sumptuous, beautiful and comfortable; there are two rooms, in which food can be served and which offer newspapers and restful seating. There's an open fire. It really is just wonderful. 

We had cocktails and nibbles; the cocktail menu is extensive and inventive, although I'm sure they could sort out a standard martini or a Tom Collins without too much sweat, as well. I had a 'Silver Tire' (gin, Galliano, apple juice, garnished with an apple slice). It was perfectly mixed, if served a little bit warm for me. We didn't go into the bar itself but it looked extremely smart as well. We were too comfortable where we were to explore further! Afternoon teas were being served while we were there and they looked scrumptious. The petits fours were like works of art and came served on very nice silverware.

Little snags: We ordered some snacks and got chilli popcorn, wasabi peas and smoked salted almonds, which were fine but served in risibly small portions, especially for two people. ~4 pieces of popcorn, 12 peas, 7 nuts.

Small snacks aside, I plan on sneaking into this lounge just to hang out next time I'm in London. It is truly a lovely place to be.

We didn't eat at the hotel, so no comments there.

Location: Fantastic
A few minutes' walk from South Kensigton tube station, the Victoria and Albert design museum, the Natural History museum and loads of shops and restaurants. The Anglesea Arms on Selwood Terrace is a great and nearby pub.

Overall opinion: would definitely stay again, but only on another deal.",4,2012,11,12
113,"Chic, yes.  But can't get the basics right!","I just recently stayed at the Kensington while on a combined business/pleasure trip to London.  For the price paid, I can confidently say I was not impressed.  I had a litany of issues during my stay, and none were resolved satisfactorily.

First, the good things.  Location is well-situated, short walk to the Tube as well as the V&A.  Inside the hotel, the sitting areas on the ground floor are very comfortable - good for a quiet business meeting or a romantic chat by the fire.  Nice bar scene.

Chic boutique style of hotel as many others have noted - if you're into that, great.  Rooms are small, which can typically be expected for this type of style.

The problem is that they can't get the basics right of a hotel.  Service is subpar at best.  While the people are not rude in any way, they aren't very responsive.  

- I asked for a replacement luggage table for one that was broken - never showed, just gave up on it.  
- When I needed a second one a few days later, I called down and once again, told they would send one right up.  30 minutes later, nothing - had to go downstairs to front desk, acted like they had never fielded the call.
- TV didn't work and only got a quarter of the channels.  Queried the front desk who said they would send someone up.  Never showed.
- Internet service within the hotel was abysmal.  For someone on business, forget it if you're trying to get work done in the hotel as you won't be able to - even casual surfing of the web or checking e-mail, you'd swear you were on a dial-up modem.
- Last straw, on my last day, the heat broke during the day.  When I returned to the room after a day out to find it broken, I spoke with a manager.  No maintenance on duty at 9PM at night!  They did send up a space heater

After politely running down my list to both the night manager and to the day manager when I checked out (in response to how was my stay), I did receive an apology, but nothing more.  I didn't expect a free stay by any means, but some level of dispensation I don't think is too much to ask.

Definitely would not stay here again or recommend it to anyone.  You can do better with something much cheaper - it may not be ""chic"", but you'll get a proper hotel stay and proper service, which should be what you're paying all that money for.

Not so good:",2,2012,11,08
113,"Great Service, Location and Rooms","We stayed here for 3 nights over a weekend, looking to enjoy the city.  The proximity of the tube stations is a huge bonus for getting anywhere that's needed.  The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the room was very nice (except the faint odour of fresh paint).  A great experience in general, but may be too expensive for some.",5,2012,11,08
113,Great Location,"The Kensington Hotel is owned by an Irish hotel chain - hence the Irish accents all over the hotel from reception to bar! For the Irish - it appears to be a home away from home! its a really well located hotel for a quick weekend in London - only 5 minutes away from the V&A Museum, The Science Museum and a stones throw from South Ken Tube station. The room that I was in was very spacious with a very big bathroom which was a real treat. The reception rooms off the foyer are relaxed and welcoming and we even spotted  X Factor judge Louis Walsh in the corner having a bite to eat (although he seemed to spend most of it writing autographs and doing photos). its not the cheapest accommodation in South Kensignton - but i think it could be the nicest! My only complaint was i had booked a room call and it never came - cue to nearly missing an early flight!",4,2012,11,05
113,Excellent Stay,"This hotel is in walking distance to the South Kensington tube line and fairly close to the Gloucester line as well. We were visiting our daughter who is studying through BU this semester. Their houses and classrooms are about 5 blocks away. The lobby is cozy and elegant. We took advantage of the fireplace on more than one occasion as well as the drink and dessert service. Newspapers are always available. The staff is quite gracious and made our stay completely seemless. We were upgraded upon check in. The room and bathroom were clean and neat, robes and blow dryers were provided, which is a nice plus. I would say the rooms are pretty typical size wise for London and alot of other European countries where we have travelled. I would highly recomend this hotel in an elegant and safe part of London. Also...Visit Cafe Nero for coffee and Murielles for comfort food. Yum!",4,2012,11,02
113,fromm the sticks,"have stayed now three timesand always had excellent service with a calm and profesional manner.The staff are friendly and attentive.The area in South Kensington:Old Brompton Road;seems to have a ""villagey"" appeal but all the ""required"" stores.A short trip on the tube or taxis, and you are in the centre of everything!Local atractions such as Royal Albert Hall and museums are just a ""small"" walk away.Must have another city break there when i have saved up a""few"" pennies",5,2012,11,02
113,Excellent choice!,"Very very good option to stay at in London. I have stayed there with my husband for four nights. The rooms are very nice and clean. Very good acoutic as you can not here the corridors from inside the room and the hotel was sold out. Our room was very pretty and had a very nice window. Thenonly cons are that during the night there is little light inside the room and we had a lot of smell of fresh painting.
All of the staff were great and willing to help, I also used the laundry and was good too. You have computers at the loby were you can print or just check your emails.
The location es the best. Very near South Kensington subway stop and full of various restaurants around. I hughly recommend this hotel.",5,2012,11,02
113,An American in London,"This was our first time in London and our expectations were exceeded at the Kensington. From the greeting of the bellmen to the atmosphere in the bar; the Kensington is definitely somewhere you want to stay. Easy walking distance to the tube and close to London proper, we found it a convenient location. The rooms were sized well with many amenities. Having just came from Geneva (what a dump) our time in London was accentuated by the comfort, location and ambiance of the Kensington.",5,2012,10,29

113,Great Service,"Great two nights at the hotel. Staff are very friendly and hotel is very clean. Great location, less than 5 mins walk from South Kensington tube station.
I booked a Queen room which I thought meant the bed was bigger than a king but it was actually 1.5 double.",5,2012,10,28
113,Great Place! Awesome Location,"Stayed at the hotel with my wife in the month of September'2012. Booked online and got a standard room, but when we got there we found that the standard rooms were in some new wing (attached ) , and thye were tiny. Hence opted to change it to The Queens Gate room. wonderful rooms, big in size, and ample bathroom. 
The location was ideal for first timers like us, as it was minutes from south ken underground, and also very close to glouscter Tube station. Also walkable were the museum of national history, hyde park, V&A and Harrods was also not far. 
All in all a great choice.",4,2012,10,27
113,"Lovely hotel, excellent staff","Two nights weekend (Sat-Mon) here, a very pleasant and quite posh hotel, convenient for South Ken tube (5 mins).
Room was described as 'superior' but it was quite small. I don't know what the standard room would be like. Shower only, and would have preferred movable shower head instead of fixed. TV had plenty of channels, inc. Sky Sports, a bit jumpy on some (e.g. BBC1)
But those minor criticisms are nit-picking really, and on the whole we were delighted with our stay.
We got a good deal via Sunday Times offer, and for that price (just over GBP 100 per night) it was superb value.
Excellent standards throughout, lovely decor, rooms and public areas attractively done out. Helpful and pleasant staff. Breakfast was fine, GBP 20pp for hot choices, but we received a 20pc discount on this and on drinks in the bar.
Would gladly choose this hotel again or recommend it to anyone.",4,2012,10,25
113,Great Stay... Excellent!,"We spent a very-long weekend and treated ourselves to the Kensington Hotel. Extremely happy about our choice!
As family with two kids, our room was a double+single (+cot). Most probably it is also suited for guests with special mobility needs. 
The room was very spacious (allowing the kids to stretch themselves!), excellent beds, comfortable bathroom. (reading the hotel map we could noticed that not all the rooms are so big). Excellently maintained. Very clean and very well serviced.
Pleasant view on the neighbourhood roofs (and far away some London‚Äôs skyscrapers).
Appreciated the service by many representatives of the staff (door, reception, concierge, room‚Ä¶).
The hotel is excellently located in a quiet road, just some 300 meters from South Kensington underground station (and Gloucester road station is not far away). Shops and restaurants in the neighbourhood.",5,2012,10,24
113,Great weekend in London,"We just spent the weekend in London and I haven¬¥t stayed in this area before, it was lovely, very cosmopolitan with loads of lovely restaurants and wine bars. The Hotel was very nice and the staff very friendly. We ate in the Aubrey Restaurant with our family which was very good value and beautiful food. I would definatly recommend it. It¬¥s very close to South Kensington underground and one stop from Knightsbridge for Harrods and all the shops and very close to the theatres. The Hotel room was nice and clean but nothing special,the only criticism that I would have is that we left the hotel at 9 am the first day as we were on business and arrived back at 3.45pm to have a rest and found our room hadnt been made up. I wouldnt call it superior as advertised, very small  and the view was also very bad as we overlooked all the aircon units in the centre of the hotel, Infact we left the curtains closed the whole time. However  the down stairs lounge and eating areas are really nice and you feel like you are in a five star hotel and I would go back as we like the location and the staff and probably up grade to a nicer room next time.",4,2012,10,23
113,Great stay,"Just stayed for 5 nights. Really enjoyed the location and friendly staff. The hotel was well worth it. Just a short tube ride away from just about everything. After leaving London and arriving in Paris, the difference between each hotel is night and day when compared to the roomcharges each day. Overall, I'd recommend this hotel highly.",5,2012,10,22
113,"A nice hotel in a convenient, less touristy area","The hotel is conveniently located to the South Kensington and Gloucester tube stations. The good thing about these 2 stations is that they are on the Picadilly line, which goes direct to Heathrow for only ¬£2.90 (using an Oyster card). We mostly used the South Kensington station to get back to the hotel, and the walk from the station to the hotel was a nice one, with many cafes, restaurants and a qwik-e-marts like the Waitrose and Tesco along the way. The area is also convenient to various museums, many of which are free. It's not the most convenient as being right in the center of the city for some of the tourist attractions, but we enjoy being a little outside of the tourist areas in general, and the area had a lovely feeling to it. The South Kensington station interestingly felt a lot like a station in Tokyo (the Gotanda station) and getting around on the tube was easy to figure out. 

We reserved a deluxe double room, and we were able to check in early, as we had taken a direct morning train from York. The room was a very comfortable size, especially given that this was London and we had expected it to be on the smaller end. We did note from the hotel room layout on the back of the door, that some of the other rooms (probably the standard rooms) appeared to be a lot smaller. Our room was decorated in the fashion that I like, with nice wallpaper and traditional furnishings. The bed was supposed to be a king size, but it was actually two twins or doubles pushed together. This was actually fine for us and the beds were very comfortable. The window faced the back of the hotel and so it did not have a nice view, but the bottom of the window was opaque so it didn't bother us too much. By the window, there was a little table with two chairs that we used to sit at, and have tea in the mornings. 

The bathroom was a nice size, but it only had a shower (no tub). The shower floor was a black material that didn't appear to clean well, as it showed a white film in some areas. It also was lacking in places to hang towels; it only had one towel bar. The closet was roomy with nice removable hangers, and fancy bathrobes/slippers were provided. Complimentary teas and coffees plus biscuits were kept in the closet, and we found out too late that during turndown service they would have brought us bubbly water. 

However, they were very helpful and attentive when requested; we borrowed a DVD player and a DVD, requested more tea/biscuits, plates/utensils and also a bucket of ice, which they provided promptly. There was an odd issue that we experienced during our stay, with water running out around 10PM one night. I thought my husband wasn't operating the shower correctly but with a call to reception, found out their boiler was down. They apparently fixed it sometime between 3:30AM and the morning, which was a relief (I'm sure probably more for them, than even for us!).

We did not get breakfast there as it would have broken the bank and the hotel was convenient to some nice breakfast cafes; our particular favorite was Cafe Floris on Gloucester, where we got a full vegetarian breakfast with coffee for a good price (and you get a free croissant with your coffee!). 

Although it was pricey for our four night stay, if we were to visit London in the future, we would definitely stay here again.

113,"Perfect Hotel and Perfect Location ""WOW""","We stayed here last weekend to visit our Daughter and see George Michael at Earls Court. Our room was absolutely beautiful with a gorgeous 4-poster bed, huge chandelier, lovely view to Queens Gate over the front door. Chocolates, cake and water left at turn down.. and the bathroom! Wow! 2 basins, stand alone bath and the best power shower in London! Fantastic location too - minutes from South Kensington tube, or walking distance to Harrods and Knightsbridge shops/Hyde Park etc if you wish to avoid the crowds underground! We didnt take the hotel breakfast as there are lots of beautiful little Italian cafes nearby. We were able to avoid all the crowds trying to get home from Earls Court as well - just a 15 minute walk to hotel from this venue. (And a great kebab shop ""Bosphorous"" just across the road too). All the museums are on the doorstep and there's a great exhibition ""Ideas"" on at Christies. London at it's best! Free wifi too and excellent cocktails! And George Michael was amazing by the way :)",5,2012,10,18

Never before have I stayed in a hotel where the staff were so attentive, every request received with enthusiasm to please - and an afternoon tea to totally die for!!! 
Our bedroom featured a luxury bathroom up a seperate flight of stairs, really comfortable bed, quiet side location (room 335), mini bar, plenty of wardrobe space plus chocolates on the pillows after 'turn-down.'
I would also recommend taking up the ""Irish Welcome Pack"" when it's on offer as it includes full English breakfast, cheese board (it was delicious... and I don't normally eat cheese - which we had at about 11.30pm on return from the theatre) more chocolates and a cocktail each (which started at ¬£12.50 and went up and up...)
If you want a bit of pure luxury be sure to book into the Kensington Hotel, Queens Road, London.",5,2012,10,17
113,A little too small,"Our room was small, even by London standards. There was space on my bedside table for their phone or my book, but not both. There were only two small drawers and a small closet, which meant we had to live partly out of one suitcase. It was somewhat tricky getting out of the high and slippery bathtub in the small bathroom space. 

There was free wifi, but it was very slow.

In spite of the above limitations, we liked this hotel a lot. Our room was beautifully decorated, with quality furniture and bedding. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly. It's a great neighbourhood, close to buses and the tube, and there are good restaurants nearby. There are good public rooms on the main floor.

We would not stay here again without a larger room.",3,2012,10,16
113,A cosy retreat,"My husband selected this Hotel,after looking for a Hotel close to Earl's court, but close enough to Knightsbridge for some shopping too.
Having been recently reviewed in 'ELLE' magazine, I was sure it would be a good choice.

We stayed for just one night, Sunday, and were greeted warmly at check-in.
Our room was not ready, but to be expected when you arrive early,  our luggage was stored and headed off out.

The location of this Hotel is pretty perfect.
It's minutes from the tube, and situated conveniently close to restaurant and bars, but not in the thick of it.
A pleasant stroll up past the V & A Museum will soon have you in Knightsbridge, whilst in the other direction a 15 min brisk walk will have you at Earls court -There is of course the tube, for those in a rush!!

I loved the decor of the Hotel and the ambience.

Although not that cold at the weekend, this really would be a cosy retreat from a cold winters day!

Our room was thoughtfully decorated,and a decent size. My only disappointment from our whole stay was the tiny bathroom.
As we were there such a short time I can't say it caused a huge issue, but just not to have a bath available seemed such a shame to what was otherwise a perfect stay.

The rooms and all public areas were very clean and well maintained, and service was good.

We will return to this Hotel, but next time I will make sure I book a room with a larger bathroom!!!

This Hotel is best for Location, Ambience and overall high standards.",4,2012,10,16
113,Classy,"Excellent location - close to tube and also a short walk to attractions like the Royal Albert Hall.
Setting is 'old english' with style and charm.  Lots of old paintings and antiques. 
Food was also excellent but not cheap.  There are plenty of options just outside of the hotel.
Despite the central location there was no troublesome noise. 
Rooms are not large but perfectly adequate.
Service was first class - nothing was too much trouble and they would go out of their way to help.
The Irish PM was staying so that's an indication of how good it is.",5,2012,10,14
113,Gorgeous Hotel,I stayed in this hotel last weekend and it is absoloutly beautiful! The interior is stunning and the food was lovely. The staff were also extremely helpful and so friendly. I will certainly be returning!,5,2012,10,08
113,Pleasantly surpised!!,"Travelled to London for a quick business trip and Kensington provided the perfect accommodations. I looked forward to the full English breakfast each morning, I truly needed that boost to face my meetings each morning. Although I was on a business trip, I still found the time to take advantage of their full service fitness center, it was incredible. Service was exceptional and the location was exactly what we needed. True 5-star service, food, rooms and amenities. I will be back!!",5,2012,10,08
113,Another Great Stay,"Antoer great weekend at the Kensington. 

My wife and I found ourselves in London for another quick visit. 
This time, staff were at the door and welcomed us when our taxi pulled up. 
As we have gotten in an early flight and arrived at the hotel at 10 am, our room was not ready. But this was not a problem and the duty manager (Gillian?) arranged for our bags to be put in secure storage and put in our room when it was ready.  
As a result we were free to roam around with out our cumbersome bags. When we returned, our room was ready with our bags in place. Coats hanging in the wardrobe! 
The room as modern, very comfortable and equipped with a Nespresso machine. 

This is my second stay at the hotel and again I would recommend it. The only fault would be the bar staff. In the afternoon I had to wait for the bar to be attended which was not a big problem. But when we returned after dinner in the evening for a drink, the barman was not quite welcoming and we got the impression that we were interrupting his evening. But this is a fault I would have with most British bar staff. 

Overall a nice hotel I hope to return to",5,2012,10,08
113,Fantastic hotel in Kensinton,"We stayed on a saturday night in september and could not have been happier with our stay. The staff was professional, friendly and attentive to all our needs. The Hotel is so beautiful...a stunning boutique hotel located a few minute walk from the tube station. We had an incredible dinner at the restaurant, the food is really michelin star level ! We had drinks at the bar too to conclude a fantastic evening ! Next time, we must try their afternoon tea...sadly we did not have time !

We will definitely come back to The Kensington Hotel next time in London.",5,2012,10,08
113,Outstanding Hotel,"We spent two nights at the Kensington Hotel in late September.  I stumbled across it on Eexpedia and booked it based on the reviews.  I couldn't have asked for a better hotel.  The staff is friendly and professional and the property is beautiful.  Our room and bathroom were large, with all the amenities we could have wanted.  We were upgraded upon check-in which was a nice surprise.  It's in a beautiful area, a short walk from the V&A and Harrods.  I'd definitely stay there again.",5,2012,10,07
113,For the price: outstanding,"A double executive room booked through, I think, Octopus, was just ¬£130 and for that we got a small but lovely room with an outstanding bathroom, terrific service, complimentary papers, and the use of two lovely lounges and an excellent bar. One of the nicest hotel stays, anywhere, for some time and the nicest London hotel stay for some years. If you can get a room for less than ¬£150 in this excellently located hotel, just off the Brompton Rd: book it.",5,2012,10,06
113,A fortuitous find,"Outstanding hotel, quite outstanding. From the moment I walked in to be greeted by the concierge on that day, Jimmy, everything was excellent. Easy, polite and delightful but not obsequious staff, superb public area, lots of comfortable sofas and seats, terrific bar staff. Room thoughtfully and comfortably set up. Bathroom superb, even the shower was easy to use. I rang and asked for an iron and it was with me almost at once. I needed a razor - they found me one, no charge - and then having lost the TV remote control (heaven knows where), they found a new one quickly with no fuss. Bed is very comfortable, the TV is easy to use (hooray!) and the thoughtful touches abound. It will be I return to with my wife for our next London trip. And it all ends with a genuine smile from Jimmy (who is himself a star) - he is a critical member of the staff and i hope they appreciate him. But well done to all concerned. After the inflated egos of London hotel staff generally, who condescend to allow you to stay in their hotel, and the self-regarding disdain of managers this was a breath of freah air. I'll go back as soon as possible.",5,2012,10,05
113,"This hotel reminded of what good service should be all about , the customer !","I recently had the pleasure of staying in The Kensington Hotel with my wife for 2 nights at the end of September . The first person we met upon arrival was the concierge and his welcome was warm,friendly and very helpful. This was the first indication of how the staff were both charming & very professional in their dealing with their customers and happily this was replicated throughout our stay . Some staff that deserve special mention were the barman/ cocktail wizard Alexandro , me being awkward asked for a digestif cocktail after having the excellent Chateux Briand in the hotel restaurant followed by a wonderful bread and butter pudding , Alexandro took on the challenge and came up with an brilliant cocktail , he could not have been more friendly and helpful . I made another visit to the hotel bar just to see what new concoction he had for me and once again i was very impressed with his attention to customer satisfaction and the cocktail was cracking.While staying in the hotel we happened to meet the general manager Mr.Vincent O`Gorman , you can see that in this hotel the staff get their enthusiasm and professionalism from the top as he couldn't do enough to make our stay as enjoyable as possible , with some great advice of what to do on our short stay in London. Altogether a great experience was had in The Kensington Hotel and i will hopefully be back sooner rather than later.",5,2012,10,05
113,Wonderful vacation thanks to the Kensington Hotel!,"My mom and I just returned from staying at the Kensington hotel.  We were there 8 nights total and wish we could have stayed longer.  The rooms were good size, clean and stylish.  The entire hotel had a very modern, boutique appearance.  The concierge staff (Ward, Martyn and Ronnie) made sure every detail of our trip was memorable.  They were always so helpful and friendly.  I celebrated my birthday while there and they staff made me feel very special, all remembering it was my birthday when they passed by.  We were actually in contact with the concierge before our arrival and he layed out every detail of what we wanted to do and let us know the easiest way to do it (whether it be securing tickets before arrival, transportation, etc).  The entire staff at the Kensington Hotel seemed to bend over backwards for anything we needed and always did it with a smile.  There are not enough words to express how lovely this hotel and its staff were.  It is located in South Kensington which was a beautiful area - close to the tube, shopping, parks and great restaurants.  It is a great walking neighborhood.  This was our first trip to London and we are already talking about returning and definitely staying at The Kensington Hotel again.",5,2012,10,03
113,Making Birthday Memories Even More Special at the Doyle Collection Kensington Hotel,"My wife & I have been fortunate enough to stay at this fantastic hotel twice within a matter of months.Firstly in the summer during the Olympics & now at the end of Sept for my birthday.
Right before you ""click"" away, let me tell you the rooms, the cleanliness of the rooms, the area, the location from the tube,all brilliant, but what makes this hotel the best, the staff!

In London, with a turnover of how many number of guests nothing and I mean nothing is too much trouble. How many times have you been to a major or capital city hotel and felt like just another ""book in & check out?""Which is fine sometimes you even want that, but if you want a warm welcome, advice and offers of help without asking all for your benefit not the hotels, then this is the hotel for you.

Walk out for a days site seeing and all your questions are answered at the front desk, oh and the fruit and water to help you with your day trip is just offered not paid for not asked for just there.
Come in there is a roaring fire if you want or your  lovely room waiting.
I could go on and on, but I won't try it enjoy it and I guarantee you will go back!

P.s.from my wife ""just wear the slippers!""",5,2012,10,03
113,Good for business,"Spent 2 nights at the hotel while in town for business.  It was very nice, clean, comfortable. Great staff.  Concierge was very helpful.  It's close to Hyde Park so one morning I went out for a run, when I got back the doorman had a bottle of water and a towel waiting for me as soon as I came in.  The free internet throughout the hotel is a huge plus - you can have all your devices on it (phone, iPad, laptop etc.) at the same time.  Close to the Tube, so very easy to get around.

The bathroom was very spacious and very comfortable. Nice big showers - American-style.",5,2012,10,02
113,Great stay!,"Love this Hotel! Clean and elegant rooms, great service, friendly personal, located in good section of London, price was affordable. I would stay here again! The concierge was extremely helpful and helped us to make strain and taxi arrangements.",5,2012,10,02
113,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed for 1 night. Hotel is beautiful, the decor of the halls and reception is fantastic. Rooms are modern and comfortable, big flatscreen TV on the wall at the end of the bed. Staff are very polite. The hotel was situated in a good area, close to the tube station and restaurants and bars. Only problem was that there was an awful unexplained noise coming from above our room, not other people above us but maybe an air-con problem or something? It was not a noise to be slept through. We got too annoyed to sleep at about 3am and contacted reception who came to inspect the noise and typically it didn't happen when he was stood in our room! It didn't stop so we contacted him again and he offered us another room for the night just down the hall. This was very nice of him but we decided it would be too much effort to move all our belongings into another room at this time in the morning. He offered us a free late checkout which we took instead. The noise gradually stopped and we had a good nights sleep. Brilliant hotel, and would 100% stay again.",5,2012,09,30
113,Exquisite gem in Kensington,"We recently stayed in this lovely property .The welcome at the reception from Aurelie was warm and personalised  and immediately made us feel that we were home away from home. The rooms was spacious , luxurious and very tastefully decorated. 

Their famous afternoon tea was second to none and the gin and tonic sorbet was a very special touch to the menu.Gareth and Avinash from the Auberge Restaurant and the Bar were second to none in their hospitality.The 'his and her' chocolates at turndown was a very nice touch.
Staff in general were very courteous, friendly, proacttive and helpful with guests.The care and attention that we received throughout our stay made us feel really special. 

Finally we got a professional  and friendly checkout from Szilvia who helpfully offered to arrange a taxi in the pouring London rain.

I would  higly recommend this Hotel to all travellers and I am sure that you'll be back here again if you try it once!",5,2012,09,27
113,"Great rooms, great location and terrific staff","What more could you ask for in a hotel.  The rooms are beautifully decorated, incredibly clean and very comfortable.  I stayed here for business and was very impressed.  Reception and welcome were lovely and very efficient, the drawing room is peaceful, an ideal place to get some work done or meet for Afternoon Tea or drinks and there is also a bar.  My breakfast was excellent, a great choice, freshly cooked bacon and eggs and again charming staff.  I wouldn't hesitate to visit again or to recommend the hotel to anyone going to London.  I only hope I can stay there again soon.!",5,2012,09,27
113,Wonderful Hospitality,"We planned and booked to stay here for one night but we loved staying here so much that we extended our stay....that says it all. This hotel is in a very good location especially close to the Tube station, shopping and restaurants. The room was spacious (really spacious), nice and clean with a beautiful bath and shower. We loved the food, especially the desserts....delicious. The service all round from 'welcome to goodbye' was absolutely wonderful and they made us feel very special! I would highly recommend this hotel. You wont be disappointed!",5,2012,09,26
113,"""Delicious Food with Good Service""","It has great location, walking distance to kensington station, Lot of Embassies  are very near, very good quality Breakfast with various options, the staffs are very kind especially in Food & Beverage services .",5,2012,09,23
113,Excellent Location,"We reserved three rooms for our family. My husband and I had a lovely room that overlooked a quiet residential street. Our daughter's room was also nice. Unfortunately our son had a room on the front of the hotel and the construction noise was extremely loud. Otherwise, the staff and facility were very nice; the location excellent. We stayed for ten days for our daughter's graduation ceremonies and would return to this hotel again.",4,2012,09,20
113,Afternoon Tea,"I had afternoon tea with a friend recently at the hotel. Waiters were friendly,welcoming. The afternoon tea was lovely,very high quality and really loved the gin and tonic sorbet! Very easy to get to ,walking distance to south kensington tube. Would recommend.",4,2012,09,19
113,Always a great stay,I travel to London almost every week on business and use the Kensington each and every time.  The staff are warm and friendly and the hotel itself is very well kitted out.  The food and service is of a very high standard as you would expect of a hotel of this calibre.  The gym is very well equipped and the bedrooms are all finished to a very high standard.  I never think to look anywhere else because there is just no need.,5,2012,09,19
113,Excellent Service - Great Assistant Guest Relations Manager,"The Hotel has a great location, fairly close to the metro. The gym was also well equipped. Room-service worked fine. Mr. Ross Langan, besides speaking perfect Spanish was extremely helpful and help you out throughout your stay.
Definitely a great option in a very nice neighborhood",4,2012,09,17
113,Loved this hotel,"We stayed here for 5 nights in August, between Olympics , staff are lovely, location is perfect. Would stay again. No noise from outside the hotel. Can hear the hallway at times, not a deal breaker. The bar, and lounge areas are beautiful. Mac pc's for guests to use near the lobby. South Kensington is a lovely area, some quiet nice cafe and restaurants near the hotel, as we arrived late on our first night, this was very great, reception staff are very kind. ",5,2012,09,16
113,Nice but....,"A beautiful hotel. Really nice place to stay convenient and close to shops, transport, great restaurant. Fantastic staff can't say any negative about anyone from the moment we arrived.
Chocolates on the pillows each night. Fantastic bar and cocktails. 

But.... The bathroom was way to small .you struggled to move in it. The door didn't open right up without hitting the toilet. Only one person could use it at a time. We found this frustrating. The rooms where quite small overall.. I guess you always have to way all the pros and cons. We would have liked a little more space, after 3 nights we had had enough.",4,2012,09,11
113,Very small Room,"I stayed at the KH for one night, on a business trip. my room was very small, I could not access the desk beyong the bed without ""walking like an egyptian"", if you see what I mean ! 
The corridor was noisy, with fire-protection doors nereby (room 333 if I remember correctly)
Breakfast was decent, nothing extraordinary.
The staff, however, was very young but very helpful and positive in attitude.",3,2012,09,10
113,Fantastic made our Olympic break very special,"Staff extreamly freindly and helpfull , we arrived on an extreamly hot day we were greeted with cool towles and bottled water! the room was wonderfull very clean and tidy , noise was to a minimum.When we retured to our room our beds had been turned downa dn a weather report was on our pillow for the next daywhich was a lovely touch.The staff were always polite and helpfull.We were never made to feel just like another guest.The breakfast in the morning was out of this world everything you can think of was there the fruit was lovely and the mini muffins were excellent! We will be stopping here again.",5,2012,09,09
113,"Tiny room with no desk, but everything else makes up for it.","The location is very nice with a short walk up to Hyde park and a great selection of restaurants around the corner on Old Brompton street.
Internet is free with no voucher needed.  Just log in and clock the agreement.
My room has no desk, just a small table.  There are some power outlets near by including an American power outlet (but mine did not work).
I did have an interesting experience in my tiny shower.  The wonderful rain shower head has a lot of power, much more than the drain has.  the water filled up above the bottom of the door and when I exited the shower I flooded the bathroom.
The maids were very respectful of my privacy and my do not disturb sign.
I front desk was very helpful with places to exchange money, the nearest tube station and anything you can think of.
My bed was not the most comfortable, but it was still nice.

This hotel is quite good at handling large groups.  besides our group I saw a group a golfers and they were able to store their clubs for them.",4,2012,09,08
113,"Great Hotel, Great Location","Situated a few minutes walk from South Kensington tube and surrounded by some nice cafes and restaurants, this was a good choice for our 3 night stay. 

Firstly the staff were excellent giving friendly service with a smile. No problem when I asked to change rooms as the superior room we were given was to the rear of the hotel directly above the noisy kitchen extractor fans (found that I do tend to get crappy rooms when booking through 3rd party websites like Expedia). Room we ended up with was a bit on the small side but was bright and airy and the bed was very comfy, on the firm side but suited me perfectly. Slept like a log all 3 nights, so quiet. Room was spotless, great shower and nice little touches like the turndown service with chocolates left on the pillow.

Only really used the hotel as a base to sleep so didn't try the restaurant for evening meal or breakfast so cannot comment on the food. Cocktail bar looked really nice, but again did our drinking elsewhere.

Overall a really nice hotel, touch of luxury which we perhaps didn't expoit enough, e.g. the spa treatments and Aubrey restaurant and wouldn't hesitate recommending it to anyone.",4,2012,09,05
113,At last I have found the right one!!!,"After many trips and many trials, I have found a London Hotel that I like and that doesn't cost over 200 euros per night. Usually I found either very expensive ones, or very depressive ones. this time a friendly staff, good location, and good style.",4,2012,09,05
113,This is not a 5 star hotel,"We stayed in this hotel just over a week ago for one night . When we were shown our room we were amazed how small it was .The decor was tired and the carpets looked old ,definitely not as good as some of the 4 stars we have stayed in London. We asked to see another room (which unfortunately is getting a bit of a habit ) and ended up seeing 2 other rooms -both worse than the original and at an extra cost of ¬£40 for one night- so ended up staying in the original room .If we were staying for longer we would have checked out. The plus side was that the reception rooms and bar were very welcoming and the staff were also very nice.",3,2012,09,04
113,Friendly staff and a good location,"The Kensington Hotel is ideal for visits to the Royal Albert Hall and the museums. It is immaculate and elegantly furnished and the staff are very friendly and helpful. I can't enthuse quite as much as the other reviewers though. My room was on the small side with only one chair and very stuffy. The bathroom was fine and the bed very comfortable although I didn't get a chocolate brownie as part of the turn down service-or a cool towel and it was a very humid day! I also feel that ¬£255 for a room without breakfast is a bit pricey. I realise that property in Kensington is expensive but the room was no better than other London hotel rooms for half the price.
We also had tea in the lounge which was a very substantial tea and worth trying. They often habve a two for one offer which is worth looking out for. This is a comfortable hotel with friendly staff and a good place to stay for a special event",4,2012,09,01
113,Its just a good accomodation but not a best,"They callded themself as London's the finest town house. But I can't agree with them. Rooms are almost clean, furnitures are good, in room bar was good. But not the finest.

But some stains in the bath room, some of powernoutlet fallen out. Coffee maker in theroom does't work. Boxes of shoe clener did placed on the shoe box but not contained. 
Thats means, room services and cleaning staff doesn't work properly or as management team planned. Staff at reception are fine. 

Breakfast is fine but taste is not good as meal from nearelst fish and chips stand.

Everything is good but not the best.",3,2012,08,31
113,Couldn't ask for more,"I am bursting with praise for this fantastic hotel. Believe every word you read in the positive reviews - we spent two nights here and really couldn't have asked for more. The staff stand out as a highlight - we were given cool face towels upon arrival, which was a really nice touch on a hot, muggy day. Following that, an upgrade (yippeeeee!) and a wonderfully attentive porter made the check-in process utterly delightful. The furniture in the public areas is beautiful and there's a warm atmosphere, attention to detail is impressive, and the choice at breakfast is eye-poppingly generous  (though - and I hesitate to criticise at all but this really was the ONLY issue I had, which just shows how good the place is - avoid the eggs benedict if you're a stickler for perfect hollandaise - it was more like cheddar sauce, though it was still delicious). The overall experience is of a luxury hotel at a reasonable price for London. I recommend this place without hesitation! I only wish I'd known about the loyalty programme, as I'm sure I'll be returning.",5,2012,08,30
113,"The Kensington Hotel......gracious, elegant, welcoming...","Nothing attracts me more quickly to an hotel than a multi million pound refurbishment !!   Its website promises 'gracious townhouse living,  fusing classic elegance with subtle contemporary touches'.   And it delivers by the bucket full, it really does  !    A graceful hotel, the public areas are beautiful, the drawing rooms ambient, luxurious, impossible to leave..., the bar; intimate and comfortable.  
I can't tell you that our superior room matched the splendour of the public areas.  Smaller than expected,  with a cramped shower and toilet, it was nice, spotless, comfortable.   What distinguishes this from other hotels is the graciousness and the attentiveness of the staff. A lovely bunch of people offering high levels of service;  warm, helpful and discreet.  The only area in need of scrutiny in my experience was the bar.   I encountered far too many mistakes over several nights;  incorrect orders, incorrect bills, incorrect change..   unbecoming for a hotel which otherwise shines.    Great area, fabulous staff, gorgeous hotel, the Kensington is on my list of favourites.",5,2012,08,28
113,Really comfortable and friendly service,"We stayed here for one night and were upgraded into a superior double.  Really comfortable bed, lovely Aromatherapy spa products, good hair dryer and docking staying for our iphone with good speaker system.  The bar and reception staff were helpful and gave us all umbrellas as it was raining.  Didn't eat here so I cannot comment but did have the most delicious chocolate brownie and blackberries left as an evening treat at turndown service.  If that's anything to go by then I imagine the food is great!",4,2012,08,28
113,"Great location, staff and ambience","Close to South Kensington tube in an upmarket area. Plenty of local eateries including a bakery and a superb ice cream parlour and a short walk from the Natural History, Science and V&A museums. The public rooms are grand, welcoming and well used with adjacent bar and restaurant (not used). Two Appple pcs are provided for free internet access. Well equipped basement gym which was little used when we stayed. Our room was small but spotless and quiet, facing internally. Judging from the fire-map, most rooms are similar sized though some do appear very small. The bathroom was cramped but there was a full sized bath with shower over.
The staff were fantastic. All very friendly and attentive but without crossing that fine line to being over facing.
Also we got a great deal through Expedia.",5,2012,08,28
113,Quite a surprise...,"I have stayed in many hotels in Kensington and I have to say this was the best so far...
Upon arrival the concierge and reception staff make you feel so welcome and assist you in every way they can..
The rooms were spotless, comfortable and for the area and star rating the hotel has very affordable...
Due to business meetings I popped into the bar and the service and surroundings very comfortable and the restaurant served some delicious dishes...
I have stayed at Blakes which everyone raves about but when you pop to the Kensington the service and ambience is miles better than likes of their competitors in the area...
I will be re booking this week and look forward to staying many times in the future with them....",5,2012,08,26
113,Excellent Service in Hotel Restaurant,"My company has held large and small group and dinners at the Kensington Hotel Restaurant on a number of occasions over the last two years, and we have found the level of service and organisation of our events to be exemplary.  We also had afternoon tea there and it was delicious and excellent value. Our guests have always commented on the high quality of their food and service, as well as the stylish and comfortable hotel surroundings.  We have recommended the hotel to friends and associates who have stayed and had nothing but good things to say about it. The bar and restaurant are very relaxing and they serve great cocktails!

I would recommend the Kensington Hotel to anyone looking for a high quality hotel in this area of London.  My colleagues and I are looking forward to our next evening there.",5,2012,08,24
113,"""Take a Walk in Sunny South Kensington""","The Kensington Hotel is an excellent choice for your stay in London!  The hotel is stunningly beautiful and comfortable.  We stayed there for a good price for the quality and breakfast was included, which was delicious and nice to eat either in your room or in their lovely restaurant (Aubrey).  The location in South Kensington is perfect - the prettiest part of London that we saw and very upscale.  It's within a short walk to:  Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens and Palace, Natural History Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum, and Harrod's.  There are many good places to eat nearby and South Kensington Station is a 5 minute walk if you're using the tube.  

The one quirk we noticed is that room service kept getting things slightly wrong:  My husband ordered cereal and milk, but they brought cereal with no milk (this happened two days in a row).  He ordered coffee and I ordered tea, but they only brought one cup.  They double charged us once too, but it was taken care of immediately.  For charging a 6-pound service charge for room service, they should get it perfect every time.  

Other than that, we enthusiastically recommend The Kensington Hotel. :)",4,2012,08,23
113,Good quality very comfortable hotel,"We had a really good night's stay at this hotel when we attended an Olympic Games event recently.  The room was very clean, very comfortable, offered robes and slippers as well as the usual bathroom toiletries (decent ones); there was a turn down service with a copy of the next day's weather report made available which was a nice touch.
Check in was quick and efficient.  We made use of luggage storage the next day while we explored London- this was also dealt with quickly and courteously.  We were offered complimentary bottles of water to take out with us.
Breakfast was excellent with lots of choice of  tasty hot and cold food. We sampled full English and smoked salmon with scrambled egg- all good.  If anything, the coffee was a little weak for our taste but this is a minor point.  The only odd experience was being told we had a 15 minute wait to be seated for breakfast- something we've never come across in a hotel before.  However, when I asked for some coffee while we waited a table was quickly found and the wait turned out to be no more than three minutes :)
We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel- not at all noisy, quality bed linen and towels, a short walk to South Ken tube station, and a warm welcome on arrival/ return.",5,2012,08,17
113,Amazing room and good service,"I started using the Kensington last year. I have to say the treatment, rooms and service is topclass. I would recommend this to anyone. I always try to book this before any other hotel i London for business and pleasure. The products (shampoo, conditioner and shower gel) are nice too. In my opinio its the small things that matter and i believe The Kensington makes this all work really nice and smoothly. 

Breakfast is good and you can take a freah apple in the reception when leaving/entering. I always get a bottle of water when i tjeck out as well.",5,2012,08,17
113,4*s and well deserved,"We stayed at the hotel overnight when we attended the Olympics.  The hotel was chosen for us by the vendor of the Olympic package.  On arrival we were greeted by several helpful staff, each one offering a service with courteous and thoughtful efficiency.  We occupied a double bed in a room which was adeqaute in size and well-suited to our needs.  It was clean and pleasantly decorated and the double bed was comfortable with good quality linen.   Queen's Gate is very quiet so no noitceable traffic noise.

The bathroom was well supplied with an excellent shower and ample toiletries.  Towels were soft.

We both had a very good room service Caesar Salad and shared a bottle of good white wine.  Total cost c¬£50.

Breakfast was excellent.

We checked out at about 10am but left our suitcase in the store room until we were ready to leave London in the early afternoon.  Again, the staff were pleasant and helpful throughout - cold flannels in reception and free bottles of water to take out.",4,2012,08,14
113,A true gem in London,"I have stayed at The Kensington Hotel several times this year and I absolutely love it!

I used it for work and on vacation, by myself or with my two sons, I have booked weeks before or walked in and it has always perfect. It is also one of the best values in London! 

The hotel is very tastefully decorated. The design is a clever cross of traditional and modern and it's a very happy place. It truly has a great feel to it. The rooms are modern and very clean, some are quite spacious for London. It is also incredibly well located right in the heart of South Kensington. It has an excellent restaurant (Aubrey), an excellent breakfast, an excellent bar (and award winning Italian bartender) and an excellent High Tea! 

Yet, the best part of the hotel is the staff. I have found them to be friendly, incredibly helpful, professional, intelligent, remarkably knowledgeable and understanding. If you treat them respectfully, they will take good care of you. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough! It is as good as any Four Seasons or Mandarin I have stayed at. 

Actually, I really look forward to go back to London to stay at the Kensington Hotel. It's weird but I really feel happy when I am there. (Also try the two great pubs around the corner, Bumpkin for dinner and the Anglesea Arms for a drink!)",5,2012,08,14
113,London Hotel,"I have stayed at The Kensington Hotel on several occasions for both personal and work commitments.  In summary I just love the Hotel for the following reasons - Firstly the Interior, being in the design business myself it is very important to me that my surroundings are well designed and in the case of the Kensington - it does not disappoint.  Secondly the staff are very friendly, welcoming and are at hand to assist in all aspect of your stay in London.  Thirdly the location is just fantastic - a few minutes form South Kensington Tube station and a short hop by foot or by taxi to Knightsbridge.  

The food in the restaurant is always fantastic and beautifully presented and if you choose not to eat an evening meal there, you are not short of good restaurants within walking distance.

If I am traveling alone for work - I always feel at home there and a nice sense of security but above all I always look forward to going back to stay.

113,A review of the kensington against its sister hotels.,"This review is more aimed at people who have GHA status and have a choice between the Kensington, Marylebone and Bloomsbury.  I'm a GHA black member and have stayed numerous times at all three hotels within the last six weeks. What i can say as a GHA member is that the Kensington is head and shoulders above the other two with its personal touches. At the other two hotels, you are treated like a run of the mill guest, i have received no welcome card, had to ask for the GHA amenity all the time, which was generally nothing special. At the Kensington its the complete opposite, welcome card in the room and excellent chef inspired amenities... It doesn't take much but when the hotel is run this way, its a joy to stay there... The rooms are lovely and the suites are first class too. All in all, if you have a choice, this is the one to book.",5,2012,08,13
113,June 2012 6 nights,"We had a great stay and this beautiful hotel.  The staff were professional and attended to every need. We arrived a bit early and they bought us food and drinks in the bar while we waited 20 minutes for our room.  The room was extra spacious for what we expected in central London.  We stayed with two kids 11, and 6, who had ample room and were welcomed by the staff.  Our cost of $299 pounds per night included the breakfast (hot and from the buffet) each morning, which was excellent and a great deal.  Be sure to have some drinks from Alessandro in the bar - very interesting character!  We walked or bused almost everywhere from here and found the location perfect.",5,2012,08,10
113,This is a good 4* place to stay in West London,"My wife and I booked an Olympic Games break with Thomas Cook and this hotel was part of the package for a 1 night stay. It's just down Old Brompton Road, about 5 minutes walk from South Kensington tube station on Queens Gate. The room was nice, clean and comfortable. There was plenty of choice at breakfast and the hotel staff were helpful at all times. The hotel has a good TV service in the rooms and complimentary WiFi throughout. The Natural History museum is just a short distance up Queens Gate and Kensington Park and The Royal Albert Hall are about 15 minutes walk away at the top of Queens Gate.",4,2012,08,09
113,Beautiful Hotel,We recently stayed at the Kensington Hotel for a romantic few days away in London. The reception staff were so helpful. We were shown to our room and were given lots of information on what to do in London. Our room was stunning with breakfast in bed the next morning. The night porter was so lovely when we came back from the theatre for a drink. This beautiful boutique hotel boasts a gorgeous setting for any tourist looking for luxury in central London. I would recommend this hotel to any visitor looking to stay in the capital.,5,2012,08,05
113,I just adore this...,"Smiles all the way from arrival to departure, and that makes all the difference. It's the attention to detail to ensure that my stays are pleasurable makes me want to go back each time. I like the Kensington area with easy reach of the 'so much to do' option with in easy walking distance when I have the spare time.",5,2012,08,03
113,Great Location and Great Hotel,"Stayed at the Kensington Hotel for three nights in early July.  I couldn't have been more pleased.  Very nice hotel with kind of a hip vibe, and fantastic staff.  Hotel room and bathroom were plenty large - British and European hotel rooms simply aren't as large as we Americans are used to.  The room was clean and nicely furnished.  The bed was very comfortable.  The staff were all incredibly polite and helpful.  The bartenders were just great, and we ended up spending some time in the bar each night of our stay.

I don't know London well and was a bit concerned about the South Kensington location being too far removed from the sights we wanted to see.  First of all, the neighborhood is GREAT!  Very upscale, diverse, great restaurants within walking distance.  The Tube is about a five minute walk from the hotel, and it's maybe a 15 minute ride to Central London.  We did walk one day rather than take the Tube, and if you're in decent shape it's a long but very nice and interesting walk to the major tourist sights.  Several of the major museums are very close to the hotel.

Will definitely stay at the Kensington Hotel again on my next trip to London!",5,2012,08,02
113,Beautiful boutique hotel in a great location.,"I have just returned from a lovely stay at the Kensington Hotel to celebrate our wedding anniversary and to see the olympics. This is a beautiful hotel made even better by their fantastic staff. I have stayed ay a lot of hotels in London including Claridges and this far my favourite. I have never known such friendly attentive staff, it really makes a difference. I will definately be recommending this hotel to my customers and look forward to staying here again.",5,2012,07,30
113,Good hotel that could be better,"We stayed for four nights and were pleased that the rooms where on the larger size. The bathroom was very small which would have been fine except that the door would not close and the plug in the basin did not work. I raised these issues with the front desk on our first morning and was apologized to and told they would be fixed but not so. For one night it may not have mattered but for four it was just a niggle. 
The bar and the bartender, Alessandro were delightful but not so the breakfast. Ours was included but for this price point we would expect much better. The morning the pastries were stale was particularly notable.
The upside is that the staff were delightful particularly the porters and the location is hard to beat with south ken tube just down the street. 
We stayed at a different hotel at the same price point on our return to London and based on this experience would struggle to return to this hotel.",3,2012,07,27
113,Delightful Boutique Hotel,"This was our first trip to London.  We arrived on 7/14th for 5 nights.  Our travel agent booked our trip for us, and did a fine job picking out this hotel.  Being aware of the fact that I am rather fussy, he chose The Kensington for its reviews, location, and the fact that it was renovated. The staff was pleasant and attentive and went out of their way to meet our needs.  The first room they sent us to was near the elevator and not to my liking.  We went back down to the desk, and a staff member immediately took us to another room.  The room itself was clean and renovated, however, a bit small but not near an elevator.  We did stay in this room.  Having said that, I should have asked for a room with a street view as it was a bit dark.  The breakfast, which was included, was excellent with an assortment of pastries, cheeses, fruits, meats, etc.  Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed this hotel and would definitely return if and when we return to London. My husband also commented on all the luxury cars in this upscale neighborhood!",4,2012,07,26
113,Excellent staff,"We stayed for 3 nights in June. We were able to check in early- around 10 am- this was great, we were so tired from our flight. Our room was okay- small but clean. It had a small window and it was not possible to move the heavy curtains enough to get any natural light into the room. Apart from that, no complaints. I loved the chocolates and weather forecasts for the next day. The bath robes were useful since we didn't pack any.  The breakfast buffet was fine. The staff were, without exception, very pleasant and obliging. The concierge kindly confirmed our flight to Paris and printed boarding passes. The hotel is a 5 minute walk from the tube and very close to the V&A, the Natural History Museum and lots of restaurants. My husband was beside himself at the sight of so many luxury cars in the neighborhood!! We enjoyed our stay very much and would recommend to others.",5,2012,07,20
113,"Amazing intimate hotel in a fabulous
Location","We went to London to see a gig on the 12th July, and decided on the hotel Kensington due to the great online reviews. Despite being a little more than we wanted to pay, the hotel was in such a great location we booked 1 nights stay. As soon as we arrived, we were made to feel welcome and attended to without the service being overpowering. Unfortunately, the 1st room we were given was a real disappointment. The air con being located right by the window so it was very noisy and the room was smaller than we anticipated. My husband called the desk and explained the problem. They said they'd imeadiately move us to another room, and do we want someone to pack our bags for us!
I was thrilled with the 2nd room, it was exactly as I had hoped. If you are spending a couple of nights in London I would urge you to book this hotel. Perfect location( natural history museum/ Victoria & Albert/ Hyde park and Knightsbridge just minted away ) but more importantly a lovely, friendly, classy hotel. 10/10!",5,2012,07,18
113,Nice Place,"This is my second time at this asset and it continues to impress. The rooms are not huge, but are clean and modern. The staff is great and can give you tips about the area or help you with any other reasonable request. The hotel also offers a good breakfast (find a rate that gives it to you for a minimal charge). Not that we all want to be working when in London, but the hotel does offer free and reliable wi-fi. All-in-all a good experience and the hotel is located in a fantastic area with easy access to central London along with its own vibrant neighborhood. Rooms are very quiet and generally one should request a room with a view of the street (I found this has more light than the interior view).",4,2012,07,17
113,Great location not so wonderful hotel,"I will start with the good which is location, location, location. Close to South Kensington tube stop which is very well connected. We stayed here for Wimbledon, as a package deal and extended our stay because it was easier than to look for another place. I liked that it has free wifi, you can take an apple as you are leaving the hotel but these things don't really make up for other things such as a botched reservation or too much light at night.
The hotel lobby is very nice but the rooms are tiny! We had to suitcases and decided to upgrade our room because there really was no place to put the suitcases in the first room we had (Standard), we upgraded to a deluxe and that was fine. There were problems with the reservation because we had booked in two separate forms and they promised to integrate both reservations and did not so on the day of the end of the first reservation we were asked to leave the room we had upgraded to! No warning whatsoever, we were asked to do this right when we were ready to leave the hotel. The lady at reception was not particularly nice when we said the she had specifically told us she would take care of the reservation. We finally were able to keep the same room but it was a hassle.
Room amenities were inconsistent. We got water bottles and chocolates for turn down on some days and nothing on other days. 
There is no place to put folded clothes in the room and not much room to put your suitcase so it makes unpacking difficult.
The noise level was not terrible except for the first night (Thursday) when we could hear loud noise from outside the night club at 3 AM. Our room faced Old Brompton road.
There was too much light coming into the room (curtains are not great) and beside that there is a green light on the ceiling that lights up the entire room during the night and is probably related to the fire alarm but it makes it difficult to sleep!
Our first bathroom in the deluxe room was good but we did not get new soap after 3 days! 
If this hotel were rated 3 stars, I would believe it. It does not give any 5 star service except for the location it has. It is pretty to look at but not great to stay in.",3,2012,07,17
113,Good service an nice neighbourhood,"Very good hotel with impeccable service all around. We just spent five nights there and found the hotel one of the better ones in London (we have spending many hotel nights in London. The Hotel interior in the lounge is stylish with Asian artefacts and comfortable seatings, the Bar is very nice and inviting. The Restaurant ambience is nice, the food is average. We had a problem the first night with a light beamer facing the room which was corrected to our satisfaction. The room itself is modest in interior but the bahtroom is very nice (the shower pressure beats all Hotels in London I would assume - it is very strong but the pressure cannot be regulated - perhaps something for Mangement to have a look at). The hotel is very quite during the night which was very nice, located in a nice neighbourhood with lots of eateries in walking distance. Thanks to all staff looking after us.",4,2012,07,17
113,5 star service,"You can expect truly top class service at this hotel. All of the staff were both friendly and very attentive.

When a guy in our party returned from a jog, he was greeted by the doorman with a wet towel to cool him down and a bottle of water. We were also offered umbrellas on leaving the hotel if raining outside. These are just examples of the attention to detail that we experienced throughout our stay.

The hotel is just a short walk from South Kensington tube station which is on the Piccadilly line making for convenient access from/to Heathrow Airport. The hotel is in a very nice area.

The hotel is very comfortable and has been beautifully refurbished since we were last there.

Bumped into Ronan Keating the first evening we were there and saw Eddie Jordan the following morning in reception. If it's good enough for these guys..............

We would highly recommend this hotel if you want to treat yourself and be pampered.",5,2012,07,16
113,Amazing!,"One of the finest London hotel experiences I have ever had. The welcome was great, the room was more than I expected, and was turned down for when we returned in the evening. Complimentary brolly for the unexpected rain was also hugely appreciated. 

Thanks to all the staff!",5,2012,07,15
113,"Small room, big price","I'm surprised to read the negative reviews of bad service (of course, I like to start with the 1-star reviews so I'm sure there's many compliments)...especially Gillian at the front desk who was very helpful and charming.  And the young man who smiled and greeted me upon my return each night around midnight after another long day at work.  I was there for 19 nights for Wimbledon (17 on the company, 2 on me) and can only imagine there are larger rooms than #218.  No desk, no dresser (plus the carpet was drab and the walls a dull white) and like others here say, the bathroom is so small you can't fully open the door...and the shower so narrow I could touch both walls with my elbows at my sides.  (But I must rave about the shower head...10 inches across and great water pressure.)  That said, with my long days the #1 priority is the bed and bedding and it was top notch comfy.  This place costs a plenty and you must be paying for the common rooms near the bar/restaurant (neither of which I visited so can't comment).  They look like they're in a fancy private club.  (Of course, it was very odd that they chose to paint these rooms and the little area around the elevator/lift at this time and not before London's busiest summer.  Did not appreciate having to carefully maneuver around ladders and stepping on tarps first thing in the morning upon getting out of the elevator.)  I loved the neighborhood of South Kensington but would never pay to stay here.  I wish I had had the time to visit the free, if small, workout room.",3,2012,07,15
113,Exceptional elegance in the heart of Kensington,"Stayed here twice already and it my favorite hotel in London. Part of the Dole Collection, this is a chain that really pays attention to details and places an emphasis on professionalism and courtesy. Unlike many major chains whose customer service and corporate feel can come off cold and bothered at times, you will not get that here. The townhouse was renovated just a few years back and it is IMPRESSIVE. There are fireplaces in the sitting rooms downstairs and the feel is understated opulence. Exteremely comfortable, you'll see attendants moving about the public spaces, always dignified, never hurried, there if you need them yet diminutive in their presence. Check in is welcoming. The hotel restaurant is exceptional and the breakfast is traditional and AMAZING. The location is about 3 minutes from the Kensington stop and very convenient from Heathrow. The location is stupendous, away from the hustle and bustle of the more touristy areas but a stones throw from Kensington Gardens and Palace, the amazing Victoria and Albert and the Natural History Museum. There are great restaurants around every corner and coffee shops everywhere. Its just a beautiful neighborhood for strolling,and sightseeing. The rooms at the hotel are quite beautiful and the Superior rooms are worth the splurge as they are very large and have Nespresso machines. Our Superior was on the front with gorgeous floor to ceiling windows and a four poster bed. Lounging around there in our robes was just too cool. The bedding in both rooms is top notch. Make no mistake though, the smaller Deluxe rooms, while a bit smaller are still very elegant, and luxurious. The bathrooms are to die for and the soundproofing is bulletproof! Quiet as a morgue. Recently stayed at the Chancery Court (5 star) and while nice, it did not even come close to the Kensington. Have also stayed at the Back Bay Hotel in Boston (Doyle Collection too) and it too did not disappoint. The Kensington helped to make my visits to London very enjoyable and memorable. Kudos to them and many thanks.",5,2012,07,09
113,"Nice hotel, good location","We stayed at The Kensington Hotel for three days in late May. The room was nice, coffee maker and turn down service was a nice addition, and the location was close to the South Kensington Tube station. In addition, there are a ton of restaurants within a short walk. There is no parking available, although there is a pay lot around the corner (pricey at 41 pounds/day). The staff was very helpful and friendly with any request/question we had.",4,2012,07,09
113,loved!!,"We loved this hotel.  The location is great.  the staff is warm and friendly and extremely helpful booking reservations and general info.  The atmosphere is elegant and classy.
I would recommend it highly!",5,2012,07,07
113,Top Class Hotel,"Stayed for two nights on business in June,  I had a mini suite, with four poster bed and roll top bath and separate rain shower.  The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever had the pleasure to sleep in and the turn down service and little treats of cake, fruit tea and bedtime chocolate just made it all the more wonderful.  The staff are excellent, friendly and professional without being intrusive or fake.  The buffet breakfast was fantastic.",5,2012,07,07
113,Great night stop over,"We stayed at The Kensigton Hotel following a concert at Hammersmith Apollo.  Only 4 stops on the tube, which was a 5 minute walk away from the hotel.  The hotel itself was very lovely.  Good size rooms with a lovely rain shower and slippers and dressing gowns.  There is a very nice bar area with lots of different sections where you could hide away with a nice G & T.  We got a really good rate ¬£140 + VAT for the room, which I think for a high standard 4 star hotel in South Ken, was very good value.  Will definitely return.  By the way loved Kings Road and Fulham Road for the shops, which are all just a stroll away.",5,2012,07,03
113,Not fair,"I booked with booking.com and was given a room with no desk and barely enough room to turn round in. On the fire escape map it was clearly the smallest room. 

HavIng changed rooms so  had a desk I work from, I was very disappointed to find that on my return from a very expensive bar bill, my room had not received the usual turndown service - no biscuit or water. Thus us respir having seen the trolley by the lift.

Thisis a nice hotel that is cutting corners if you don't bpok direct. BEWARE",3,2012,07,02
113,What Five Star Is Made Of,"We stayed at The Kensington Hotel for my fianc√©e's birthday. It was booked at the very last minute and was literally one of the only hotels in London that was available. Luckily it was a lottery draw as the hotel is utterly excellent.

Unfortunately there isn't very much to say on the matter. If you go expecting four stars, you'll be amazed. If you go expecting five stars, you'll be amazed. The staff are extremely professional and helpful. Our room couldn't have been better and with the inclusion of one of the best showers I've ever used and turn-down service, this hotel hits every single target and more.

We didn't sample the breakfast as there's an Italian cafe in South Kensington that we usually go to. However one morning we walked through the hotel during breakfast and it looked incredible... we'll be changing this and opting for breakfast next time.

Finally I informed the hotel of the occasion and they arranged for a platter of fruit and macaroons in the bedroom (just after we arrived). It was an excellent gesture and was a great start to the weekend.

Needless to say, we'll be visiting again. And again. It's our London hotel now.",5,2012,07,01
113,Average rooms but a good location,"You get what you pay for in London and during Wimbledon we paid quite a lot for an average room with a very small bathroom!  However, this hotel is in a good location and has a good atmosphere in the public rooms, including the bar and the dining room.  Service was variable, from the excellent warm welcome and check out at Reception to the less warm attitude of the rather rushed bar staff and dining room staff.  We were also very unimpressed that the Housekeeping staff tried to come into the room three times from 0800 on the day we were checking out.  Yes, we could have put out the 'Do Not Disturb' sign but you do expect that Reception would tell Housekeeping when a room has been vacated and can be cleaned!",3,2012,06,29
113,Return visit to the Kensington,"Having had a fantastic stay in the Kensington two years ago a return visit was much anticipated and I was not disappointed.I am just back fro a two night stay and it  has lived up to my past experience. The hotel is beautifully decorated however the superior rooms are definitely extremely small, suited  more to one person rather two. The hotel itself may be a four star but the excellent staff make it a five star. The are helpful ,courteous and kind  from the reception (especially Elena and Gillain) to the hotel maintenance man...The Kensington is only ten minutes walk fron South Ken tube station  and surrounded by lovely restaurants and cafes also very central for your West End shows or plays.Planning my next trip already but will definitely upgrade room.",4,2012,06,21
113,1 Week Stay at the Kensington Hotel,"We have just returned from our June 2013, one week stay at the Kensington Hotel.  We were in London to visit our son who is a studying studying abroad for the summer in South Kensington.The location is excellent, two tube stations to choose from, many eateries close by on Brompton Road, Hyde Park just up the block for a great walk and great pubs just minutes from the hotel.  Our rooms were both ready for early check in as we had requested.Elena at the front desk checked us in and was friendly and helpful. I am a light sleeper and had a room overlooking the street which was a lovely view and not too noisy at all.  The bed and  linens were heavenly. Lovely toiletries and housekeeping fulfilled our every request for extra towels, tissues, etc. The concierges, Martin and Vincent were tremendous to work with  from reconfirming tours for us, to setting up car services, to choices and reservations for dining.  Ronnie, the bellman was so friendly assisting us with our every need asking what sights we had seen that day and what was on our planner next.  He made you feel quite at home.  We had a breakfast package with our rooms and the food was abundant and tasty.The sitting room off the lobby was the perfect place to wait for our son to meet us daily before we took off for the days of sightseeing.  The only complaint that I can think of was two of the days housekeeping did not make up our room but a simple phone call to the front desk and the matter was addressed promptly.  I can tell you that I was concerned about the hotel after reading many of the reviews here prior to going to London but all I can say is that our stay at the Kensington Hotel was delightful.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat.",4,2012,06,16
113,fair experience,"my husband and i spent two nights here, stopping by in london to see some friends.  the location of the hotel is quite nice, it is around the corner from some nice eateries and the neighbourhood is lush and green.  for us, checkin was pleasant and efficient although we were a little surprised that we were led through a bit of a 'rabbit warren' up and down some mini flights of stairs (there is a lift, but some of the rooms are still a bit wheel chair unfriendly, i would think).  granted, the property is old, which lends it some of its charm, but the layout is still unusual.  we stayed in the standard room for our two nights here - which means we had a view of the airconditioning, and that the room was indeed very cozy/small.  the shower, in particular is a bit tight and i am already a small asian woman.  however the room and bed were reasonably comfortable, and once you left it, the ambience of hotel was quite beautiful and the staff friendly.  i would consider returning here again, mostly for the location, but i will definitely upgrade to a bigger room.",4,2012,06,16
113,I would definitely go back. Nice hotel. Great Location.,"Although they made me wait two hours to check-in (and that is AFTER check-in time, by the way, I was not there early or anything) I was on vacation anyway, and not in a rush, which made it less of a hassle. After about 1.5 hours waiting they offered me a ""courtesy room"" for me to freshen up while my actual room became available. Nice touch. But still, this happens a lot from what I read here on Trip Advisor, so I was sort of ""mentally prepared"" for it. They ought to find a way to minimize this occurrence, though. It can be quite annoying.  

My husband and I were in London celebrating our anniversary (and, in reality, I sort of crashed a business trip of his - why not? It was our anniversary!). We stayed at a different hotel during his ""working days"" and then, I thought it would be nice to switch somewhere more ""posh"" for our actual anniversary weekend. It worked out perfectly. He was thrilled. And so was I. 

I took a Deluxe room after reading a tremendous amount of reviews dissuading me from trying a ""Superior"" room which is their lowest tier. The rooms are expensive, so I sort of wanted to stick to lower tier, but every review was right. My ""courtesy room"" was a ""Superior"" so I got to see it first hand. A ""superior"" room is tiny. It would definitely be hard for two people, plus luggage, to be there comfortably. Avoid it if you are not alone. 

One drawback is the terrible wi-fi signal: In and out. Never really fast, sometimes even non-existent. A little annoying if you are there on business...luckily we weren't...but keep that in mind in case you really need it. They do have two Apple computers in a little nook by the elevators in the lobby. And those are okay since they are ethernet connected. But if you have heavy work, gaming, or video watching to do in your room (on your computer or tablet device) beware of the wi-fi issue. 

They could do a better job at maintenance (the courtesy room, was a little shabby with lots of dings and scrapes on the walls) but our actual room when we finally got it, was lovely, very English, yet contemporary enough. It felt right. Although it was a low floor facing the main road with all the restaurants and bars, and, I assume, boisterous people on the street, we never had an issue with noise somehow....

The lobby was EVERYTHING. It is beautiful, stylish, and simply a room I loved to spend time in. Our actual room (a ""Deluxe"") was spacious, with a lovely bed and linens, a good, spacious, marble bathroom, a great shower... and good products from some brand that is now infiltrating a lot of the hotels i've been in lately (Aromatherapy Associates). It was also a nice touch that they had a Nespresso machine in the room. Overall, the hotel was very good. The service was, for the most part, very good. I did ask for a change of linens on our second night, and the maintenance people ignored my request somehow...but, again, we didn't care so much. But if you're a stickler for that stuff...I'm giving you the true details. 

The location is INCREDIBLE if  you want to be in the Kensigton/Chelsea area (which is how I would recommend to explore London...one to three neighborhoods at a time, don't try to do too much, especially if you only have a few days). This was not my first trip to London, so I knew what I wanted, and this hotel really did a nice job. I would stay there again. I loved the experience. The room was very good. The bed and linens were delicious. The location, shopping, and all fun things are just steps away. We were blessed with GREAT weather too, which makes a huge difference in London and simply improves the mood. But had it been raining torrentially the entire time, and we HAD to stay in the hotel for long periods of time, this would've been a great one to do that in. 

If you don't mind waiting a loooooooong time to actually check-in, go for it. (After 1.5 hours I started to get antsy...but by night time I had forgotten about it...and with all the complaints about this on Trip Advisor, I can only imagine they are trying to do something about it.) 

Added bonus: The lobby smells divine and the concierge is incredibly helpful. I had to come back to NY with some of those British ""Neom"" brand candles! 

Do it! It's a good hotel, you can walk around a really lovely, high-end neighborhood, go shopping, go to Chelsea, stroll in Hyde Park, go to Kensington Palace, have a cupcake at Hummingbird, Take the South Ken underground somewhere and have an adventure, and have  Afternoon Tea at the hotel. This place was very good. I'm a fan.",4,2012,06,14
113,An absolutely fabulous hotel,"I've been lucky enough to stay in this hotel a few times and the best things are the great service and location. It's a relatively small hotel but there are plenty of five star touches that make for a very pleasant stay. As with all London hotels, it can expensive during certain times but is definitely worth paying extra as the rooms are larger than other similar hotels that I've stayed in. You won't be disappointed.",5,2012,06,13
113,Great service,"Service was excellent, when I went for a run (Hyde park is very close by), I was welcomed back with a bottle of water and face washer. As I headed out shopping after checking out I was offered a bottle of water, I arrived during the jubilee and the concierge had printed a copy of the activities and map scheduled for the day. I have never experienced this level of care from hotel staff, and it wasn't always just the same people, I was there for four nights and it was different members of the team in each instance. Apart from a lovely hotel in a great location it is the service that I will remember and will definitely be what puts this gem at the top of my list of places to stay in London.",4,2012,06,13
113,Romantic break,"Myself and my boyfriend stayed here in Jan 2012. Hotel is very old world and romantic, relaxing, classic and elegant. everything you would want in a Romantic Break. We booked through booking.com and had emailed the hotel to see if we would need to pay a deposit in advance or was it ok to pay cash when we got there. we got a reply to say no deposit would be taken and we could pay cash on arrival. we had also emailed in advance to say we were celebrating 10 years together and if possible could we have a non smoking room with a view. when we arrived we were we we're greeted by a very friendly and professional concierge who came out to the taxi to take our bags and already had them on a trolley before we even got to the desk, fantastic service. When paying cash we were asked for a security deposit which was embarrassing as there was no mention of this in any email or confirmation we received. We got checked in and were told we got an upgraded room, which was great. when we got to the room we noticed that our room was overlooking fans or air on units outside our window, which were noisy at times but we stayed in that room.The room itself was gorgeous, absolute luxury and just what we needed after a very hectic end of 2011. Lounge area was fantastic, afternoon tea, papers, antique furniture and art work, very decadent indeed. When emailing about our 10 years together I had signed it off with both our names, on our 1st night we had received a fruit plate with a ""Happy 30 Wedding Anniversary"" which was addressed to me only..a nice little touch but we thought a little more detail could have been paid.........Pros: So close to Kensington tube station, Hyde Park, plenty of cafes etc in the area, staff are very professional and friendly.Hotel is fabulously decorated. Cons: price of vegetarian breakfast is expensive, fire alarm went off on both days even though it was scheduled for one of the days only, I know fire alarms are there for a reason but there was no explanation given on checkout, when in fact we had actually jumped out of bed and left our room in our night clothes, only to be told by the concierge on the corridor, not to worry, it's not an emergency, other people had come out of their rooms also.....had asked for a quite room and given a room over fans/air on........we would definitely return as it has so much to offer, we were so relaxed sitting in the Hotel, reading a paper, having a coffee after our busy days visiting all London has to offer.",4,2012,06,12
113,Wonderful holiday stay,"My husband and I spent Christmas/New Year's 2011 at The Kensington Hotel and absolutely loved our experience there.  We were celebrating numerous personal milestones, in addition to the holidays, and had notified the hotel of this fact; they kindly upgraded our room in recognition of our celebrations.  While the rooms and public spaces are lovely, the best part of The Kensington Hotel is the staff's attention to detail and willingness to go above and beyond to ensure that guests have a positive experience.  For example, during our stay, they provided us with a DVD player and access to the hotel fridge, in order to store cake and ice cream for a birthday celebration.  Actions like these and dozens of others (including nightly turndown service) made The Kensington Hotel something special.  While we had a couple of issues during out stay (housekeeping brushes left on our sink/near toiletries, some charges made in the incorrect currency, no fridge), these were small hiccups in a 10+ day stay and in no way would prevent our recommending the hotel or returning for another stay.  

Aside from the lovely rooms and amazing staff, the hotel's location is perfect: just a few blocks from the National History Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum, and South Kensington Station.  There is a small Waitrose just around the corner from the hotel, as well as a larger Waitrose and Sainsbury's just a few blocks away.  We're big walkers, and we were able to walk throughout Kensington and Chelsea using the hotel as a base.  In fact, we even walked from the hotel to Westminster on Christmas, when public transit was not running.  The hotel is also excellent from a public-transit standpoint.  South Kensington Station sees Piccadilly Line, District Line, and Circle Line trains, meaning that you can get anywhere in London using it as a base and can travel directly from Heathrow to the station and vice versa.

It's also worth noting how beautiful the hotel's shared spaces are.  Throughout our stay, there was a fire in the fireplace and room to sit and read or enjoy a coffee.  We're usually running around whenever we're in London, but the lobby space was tempting enough to keep us in for a few nights of coffee, hot chocolate, and reading!  

In short - The Kensington Hotel is a lovely, perfectly located  hotel with an excellent staff who went above and beyond to make our time there special.  I would definitely recommend it!",5,2012,06,10
113,one of the best hotels we have stayed in for the money,"We spent 5 nights in this hotel in May and think that value for money this is one of  the best hotel we have stayed in. We booked months in advance so got a good early bird rate that included a full Englisd breakfast.We had a double deluxe room that was a good size and well appointed.The public rooms in the hotel are delightful and make you want to sit and have a drink and enjoy the ambiance. Excellent breakfast.The staff at the hotel are the friendliest we have experienced without being overbearing.
The hotel is close to South Kensington tube and many well priced Italian restaurants 
We will definitely use this hotel next time we are in London if the price is right",5,2012,06,07
113,Excellent Customer Service,"This is the first time I have written a review on trip advisor, but I wanted to take the time to thank the staff for making my trip so memorable. 

I was due to propose to my girlfriend the weekend we stayed in london, and had asked the staff what can be done to help make our trip special. I was emailed back within 12hrs with a full range of things that they could do, I had champange and roses in the room for ¬£30 (which i thought was a good price as it was a big bottle of moet) - and also the concierge found a brilliant japanese resturant for us. 
I
My girlfriend is now my Fianc√© and we had a perfect time staying with the hotel. All the staff were polite and attentive. And a special thank you to Miss Pratt and Mr Giroux for all the help they gave me with my stay.",5,2012,06,06
113,Lovely hotel,"I stayed at this beautiful hotel couple of months ago when I first visited my friend in London. Best stay ever for sure. I loved the location, so close to Harrods, museums and restaurants. Tube was 5min away from the hotel.
I arrived early morning and they offered  to check in before 2pm which was great after long flight from US.
Staff was really friendly and helpful. It was my first time in London and they suggested the best places were to go and what to see.
My room was lovely, loved the bath and large TV,room service was great.

Defiantly coming back next year.",5,2012,06,05
113,A gem in London - Beautiful hotel,"This review is long over due! I stayed here with my partner for New Years Eve 2011 (or should i say 2012) and it was a wonderful stay! The hotel itself is beautiful and staff are welcoming and so accomodating. In terms of location, its brilliant. Surrounded by wonderful restaurants and bar's its fantastic. The rooms and spotless, clean & large. As a bonus we were called a day before our stay to be told we had been upgraded! Breakfast was delicious too.

I would highly recommend this hotel and am always looking for another opportunity to stay here again!",5,2012,06,03
113,excellent stuff,"i am happy to let others know that Kensington Hotel has amaizing stuff and I love love love the bathrooms. 

Perfect location, just walking distance from great shopping places.

Evening is great to enjoy the fire with a glass of wine..

Good luck for everyone who wants to have great place to stay in London",5,2012,05,31
113,Looks fantastic from the outside,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 night while we were working at a tradeshow at Olympia. All in all it was an okay stay, but as you will read below, not fantastic, especially for what you are paying.

When we arrived there was no one to help with bags, or open the door for us. We had to ask someone to help us out, and it took a few people to organise this! At 6 months pregnant I asked months previous to be put on a floor far away from the smoking floor (4th floor). When checking in we were put on the 5th floor....once I got into the room it was very small and when walking into the bathroom I realised that I couldn't actually walk into it!!! The bathroom door only opens a small amount so with a 6 month belly I wasn't going anywhere!!! And to be honest, even if you are just slightly bigger you wouldnt be able to fit either! I told reception who were very apologetic and very lovely, they then put me into a room on the 4th floor....when I went up to it I realised that it was the smoking floor and the smell was awful so I quickly went downstairs yet again.....the reception staff were lovely though and quickly found us a room on the 2nd room that was much better. Although we were next to a fire door and main thoroughfare so it was very noisy. 

The room was lovely but I do think that for the rating of the hotel and the price they charge some things are a little old. The towels for example are not at all luxurious, nor are the beds and bedding. Everything seemed a little old. The rooms are also not at all soundproof. I could hear someone dial a number on their phone outside our room, I could hear people walking upstairs and all in all this didn't provide a good nights sleep! When we returned from the show on the first day our room had not been serviced, not something you want to see after 10 hours out of the room! This was taken care of however that evening.  

The location is fantastic however, you are surrounded by lovely cafes etc and a short stroll to Fulham Road. 

The hotel does now represent good value for money unfortunately, and we were expecting something much more luxurious for this price. We may have been just unlucky however!",3,2012,05,21
113,"Great location, Great Accommodations","We stayed at the Kensington for four nights.  The location is great----a few minutes to the South Kensington tube station, lots of small stores and restaurants within walking distance.  The staff is very helpful and professional.  The hotel is luxurious and our room was neat, clean and nicely decorated.  There were two iMacs downstairs. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel but there is a mini market right across the street that had a good selection of breakfast pastries.  There is also a Pret a Manger a couple of blocks away near the Tube station.  That's a good place to get a fresh and reasonable meal.",4,2012,05,19
113,Charlies,We just stayed one night and thought the hotel was lovely.  Reception staff were very pleasant and even let us check in earlier than 2pm.   I found the room very small and was disappointed that the bed linen had seen better days.  It was clean and fresh but had holes in several places.  The pillow case had a cigarette burnhole on the frill.  The room was fine for 1 night but would not have like to stay longer.  The service at the bar was very efficient and it was very pleasant and comfortable sitting in the lounge.  We found a breakfast place within walking distance which cost about quarter the price.,4,2012,05,17
113,Luxury worth the price,"During a 3-day side trip to London we stayed at The Kensington Hotel for 3 nights, and it turned out to be a great choice. The Kensington Hotel is a 5-star luxury hotel in the same high-end category as, for example, Ritz-Carlton or Four Seasons hotels. Though by no means a budget choice, the price we paid was surprisingly reasonable compared to other hotels at the same service level, especially given the location. On the same vacation, we stayed at the Ritz in Paris, and we actually had some minor complaints there, despite paying a truly exorbitant nightly rate. In comparison to that, The Kensington Hotel cost only a fraction and provided a flawless and utterly enjoyable experience. We also had been lucky to come across a special deal that provided a free upgrade to a studio suite for the price of a regular room.
Our rooms were very spacious and had a contemporary design (if you indeed prefer the ""classic"" look with lots of antiques in the style of Ritz & Co., The Kensington Hotel might not completely match your taste).
The bathrooms, especially, were true works of art (again in a contemporary design). Notably, there is a flat-screen TV in the wall above the bathtub (we're not TV people, but we still thought that was pretty cool).
As expected, the rooms were flawlessly clean, and the nightly turn-down service even left nice little treats like peach ice tea or fresh cherry juice. The staff was always down-to-earth and helpful, especially the concierge. Conveniently, you can get tickets for the common attractions like the Tower, etc., right at the concierge, which saves a lot of waiting in line.
The location of The Kensington Hotel is also very convenient, with the Gloucester Road and South Kensington tube stations both just a few minutes away. Despite the central location our rooms were surprisingly quiet (however, I have to disclose that our rooms were on the highest floor, right under the roof, well away from the street noise, so the noise levels probably vary room by room).
One minor downside, though not an unusual one, is that the breakfast is not included in the price (unless you book a special package and essentially prepay for it). There is a generous breakfast buffet, and hot breakfast items are made to order. It's all delicious, but rather pricy. The breakfast area is very nice and cozy with lots of books and leather, so I recommend to try it at least once.
In summary, we had one of the most memorable hotel experiences at The Kensington Hotel in London, and it was well worth the price. I can fully recommend this exceptional hotel.",5,2012,05,16
113,"5 Star Prices, Great Service but Disappointing Rooms","This is a charming looking hotel built within a series of townhouses in South Kensington close to Hyde Park.  The public areas are sumptious and the staff are all extremely welcoming and helpful.  That said the rooms are disappointing in that they don't deliver the level of convenience you might expect in a property of this level.  We booked a superior room and the first room we were given was nicely decorated but had an odd triangular configuration that resulted in one side of the large bed being difficult to access.   The reception staff were very helpful and allowed us to check out three further rooms - all had issues and we settled on 429 on the 4th floor as it met most of our needs.  It had a large bathroom with heated floors a window and a tub shower as well as a hand held shower.  All sides of the queen side bed were easily accessible and the two windows could be opened and it was quiet and private.  Quibbles:  there was only one chair (there was plenty of room for more) only one luggage rack, no clock (why is that?),  a blow dryer but nowhere to plug it in near a mirror.  I had to unplug a bedside lamp.  We did get body lotion provided on asking - there was none in any of the four rooms we checked.  At 20 pounds the breakfast is way overpriced for what you get.",3,2012,05,14
113,"Lovely Hotel, Great Location, Small room","The Kensington Hotel is a lovely boutique hotel, just 5 minutes from the South Kensington Tube Station (Picadilly, Central & Distict Line), although if you have time it's more fun to take the 14 bus along Old Brompton Road,Hyde Park,Picadilly Circus to Oxford St. The surrounding area is beautiful and fun to explore-as well as the V&A & Natural History Museum, you can take a short stroll to the famous shopping street King's Road in Chelsea and pass St. Luke's Church on the way, where Dickens was married. The lounge areas and bar are beautifully and tastefully decorated and it is a pleasure to take afternoon tea there or read the papers in the morning. My only quibble was the size of the room, which wasn't big enough to unpack 2 cases, although well equipped with marble in the bathroom and a very comfortable bed. Next time, I would book a Deluxe for 2 people. Altogether, a very pleasant experience and we look forward to our next visit.",4,2012,05,10
113,Will not stay here again!,"We stayed in this hotel for 5 nights and had a terrible experience with payment and promises. To cut the story short we had an email confirmation for 185 pounds inclusive of breakfast but was told during check in that breakfast was not included. I wonder what inclusive meant. And was told that breakfast Can be purchased at 20 per head. 

After flying for 20 hrs we didn't want to argue and went o the room. The room was frightfully tiny and the shower had so little save I knocked my elbow twice. I am 48 kg and only 158cm. We are not tall and I shudder to think how anyone taller or bigger can manage. 

On the night before we checked out I found the email confirmation and called the front desk to share. The assistant manager Gillian was hostile and unfriendly and called me back to say she was confused. Well so am I. No efforts were made to show the hotels mistake and the blame was seemed to be put on us instead. She said the morning manager will take care. I asked her What that meant. I can even feel her rolling her eyes at me on the phone. I told her I did not want to explain the situation twice and before we caught our flight to Berlin. 

In the morning the operations manager Andrea kept on asking me these questions/ comments:
- did you not have time for breakfast? 
- did you knw what time breakfast was? 
- if you wanted breakfast so much we can provide at a charge

I am not sure what the confusion was since I had the confirmation in black and white. At one stage she even said this is strange and we can't honor that. Obviously reservations and front desk don't communicate!! Since it was suggested that bf was at 20 per pax I asked for a decent refund. I was again met with confused looks and hostility. Now she changed tact to say oh it costs 10 per pax, not 20 ( so that the refund is less). 

In short they don't honor email confirmations so beware. Even when shown evidence they say they can't honor that nor be held liable. Throughout it all, I was made to feel their hostility and no mention was made of the fact that I wasa customer and I stayed 5 nights and even had dinner at Aubrey. When asked about the size of the room she said oh European hotels are small. We have travelled all over Europe so don't give me that attitude or statement. 

All in all it left a supremely bad taste in our mouths and I will bring my 5 nights money somewhere else definitely. We travel to EU at least  3 times a year and have never been told email confirmations are not honored!!",1,2012,05,09
113,Really enjoyed our stay,"This was out first visit to The Kensington Hotel and we really enjoyed our visit. Rooms are bigger than usual and well appointed. 

The hotel has a bit of an ""old world"" feel but dont let that put you off. Great staff, particularly the guys at the bar who consistantly remembered what drinks we had ordered the previous evening.

Breakfast service was a bit slow but we were on holidays to no big deal.

Great location and we will come back",4,2012,05,06
113,Afternoon Tea,"My daughter and I booked afternoon tea at this hotel during a recent trip to London.  Tea was served in the lounge where there were plenty of comfortable chairs and sofas with a real fire burning brightly in the fireplace.  Tea consisted of an excellent selection of sandwiches, warm scones with delicious preserves and clotted cream, and seven cakes for us to share.  The gin and tonic sorbet was also a nice touch.  The only thing which let it down was the decaf coffee which we requested instead of tea  - very weak and tasteless.  

We spent a lovely relaxing few hours there.  The staff were helpful and friendly ensuring we had a nice time.

When we left we strolled back to South Kensington tube station via Old Brompton Road - spotting The Hummingbird Bakery on the way.  Of course, that resulted in a repeat trip to South Kensington another day for coffee and cake there too!",4,2012,05,06
113,Very nice,"Located very close to South Kensington Tube station,this hotel is really very nice.The lobby and the restaurant ( where the breakfast is served) are chic and cozy.The staff is friendly and efficient;we asked for an early check in ( 10 AM ) and they arranged that without any problem.
The only little "" minus"" is the room, quite small.
We'll definitely come back!",4,2012,05,02
113,Luxury at it's finest??,"I'm typing this review as I am sitting in the hotel lobby waiting for my room to be made up.  This is my second time staying at this hotel (in town for business purposes) and I have to admit, I am not impressed.  For what is billed as a 5 star, luxury type hotel, the customer service and the quality of the room I was given (on my initial visit) are very poor.  As you can see from the pictures I've posted, the initial room I was given had a huge water leak in the ceiling, directly above the bed.  When I called reception to inform them of this and to switch rooms, instead of sending up the porter, they send a maintenance man.  What?  While I was then awaiting for the porter to arrive, I began looking around the room and it was very sub-par.  Many black scrapes on the walls, I found an empty water bottle between the wall and the night table next to the bed.  Just not what I am expecting of a hotel this caliber.  I was then shown another room directly facing the street in which I could hear all street noise, cars, honking, etc.,  Not what I was looking for after a flight from New York.  They also had to put my suitcase basically in front of the door to the room because there was no where else to put it.  The television was also placed directly in front of the mirror in the room.  What is the point of that?  How do you use the mirror?  I am now here a second time and while I am patiently waiting in the lobby, minding my own business and working on my laptop, a hotel staff worker walked right up to me and basically yelled at me because I had a pastry and a latte from outside the hotel on the table next to me.  She had an incredibly accusatory tone and a bad attitude.  Not to mention, I'd been sitting here for nearly an hour already so I don't understand what the issue is.  I'm a guest of the hotel, not a random person off the street who's waiting to be seated for their brunch.  I'm not allowed to have a latte and a pastry after flying a red eye from New York while I am waiting for my room?  I really did not appreciate that.  She essentially took the bag with the pastry and the latte and threw them away.  She did bring me a complimentary latte then but the manner in which she approached me about the situation was totally unprofessional and I do not appreciate the accusatory tone.  This has now been 2 not so good experiences in a row at this hotel for me (and I haven't even gotten into my room this trip yet).  Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.  We have a corporate rate at this hotel but I will not be back.  Nor would I ever be able to recommend this hotel any longer to my clients when they are in town as well.  There are equally nice places, for equal price, with better rooms and more courteous staff.",2,2012,04,29
113,The Kensington-Boutique Luxury at its Finest,"This hotel has recently undergone a ¬£20m renovation and offers a unique townhouse experience better than even the comforts of home (I was pleasantly surprised to find an American plug in our room). The decor is stunning‚Äîfashionable and elegant, a place you wish you could afford to live until the end of time. We experienced two different rooms (they were so kind as to upgrade us the last night) and I highly recommend the Deluxe. While both spoil you with fine linens, bathrobes, complimentary wireless and a modern bathroom, the Superior room was a bit small (my only gripe), while the Deluxe room was ironically, superior. The Afternoon Tea looked sophisticated, booming and was unfortunately booked (make advanced reservations), but we did partake in the ‚ÄúGreat British Breakfast,‚Äù which, while a bit pricey (with the exchange rate), was the perfect way to begin our first morning. And while you never really need to leave, this is in fact, London. So, take a step out your door, you‚Äôre only moments from Hyde Park, Kensington Palace, Knightsbridge and tons of shopping and restaurants.",5,2012,04,27
113,Great hotel especially for leisure travellers,"Great location in South Kensington, courteous service and stylist decor are the key features of this hotel. Beautiful neighbourhood and short walk to the tube station and many of London's important museums. Staff was very professional and friendly. The lounge area is beautiful and cozy place to relax, read a book and meet friends. Near hotel is eclectic choice of restaurants. I was there for business but would not recommend it for travellers who need to work from their room since there was no desk (at least in the room I stayed in). Free wi-fi is available.

I have not used the restaurant and the gym so cannot comment on those.",4,2012,04,25
113,Loved the service,"A perfect hotel for a London trip including mainly shopping and some sight-seeing with teen-age daughter. We very much appreciated the friendly and extremely service-minded staff. The location couldn't be better. Such nice neighbourhood where people actually live, not only crowded with hotels and tourists. Close to underground, nice restaurants and walking distance to several shopping-areas like Kings Road. 
Our room was small but comfy enough if you don‚Äôt spend half day in your room. Most important it had free wifi that actually worked. We had ‚Äúfull English breakfast‚Äù included in our package (Leisurely London) but the breakfast buffet was quite enough with a lot to choose from. And tasty. 
The lounge area is very relaxing and beautifully decorated. All in all a very nice experience.",4,2012,04,23
113,Wonderful!,"This hotel is excellent. 
Stayed here for a few nights as I was in town for an exhibition. The room was definitely value for money and was light, clean and comfortable. It is a charming boutique hotel and the first thing I noticed is the impressive lounge area, with beautiful and elegant furniture. The fireplaces make the place feel nice and cosy. I didn‚Äôt expect this as you don‚Äôt see many photos of the impressive interiors on the hotel‚Äôs website.
As I was on a business trip it was great to have free wifi, often you have to pay extra for this and it‚Äôs pretty expensive. I would stay here again with family or friends, it has a real charm. The staff were all polite and attentive, they were happy to give me restaurant recommendations and help me get around the area. 
The location of this hotel is second to none. On your doorstep is Kensington which has lots of great shops and restaurants, plus it‚Äôs a short 5 min walk to South Ken tube station. Overall, I had a wonderful stay.",5,2012,04,15
113,Average,"Stayed here for a couple of a few nights at the end of March and overall the experience was fine ‚Äì nothing special ‚Äì with one reservation as you will see from the cons below.  This review is for room 518 (a superior queen) so won‚Äôt be representative of the whole hotel. I have tried to be a specific as possible and openly realize I have been a bit nit-picky.

Pros: Location ‚Äì 5 minute walk from South Kensington station in a great neighbourhood. Price was not bad (good deal) which made the size of the room not so bad.  It is small but it was well planned. As you walked in there was a wardrobe area separate from bed area that made it feel bigger ‚Äì enough place to park up a couple of bags.  Bathroom small but enough counter space and there is a portable trolley to store your toiletries.  Hotel provides nice toiletries. As everyone knows, for some reason in the UK there are no outlets to plug a hairdryer in it but one in the closet where a full length mirror is available so you are not necessarily bumping into your partner. Provide chocolates at bed time and there is big screen tv.  Also was checked in early when we arrived at 10 am.

Cons: 
1.The big con: We like to have a cool room at night to sleep in.  Second day there we turned on air conditioning‚Ä¶.came back to the room in the afternoon and it vaguely smelt like grease‚Ä¶went out for dinner and when we came back  it overwhelmingly smelt like grease.  In the am was awoken to an overpoweringly sickening smell of bacon.  It was then that we realized the vent for the kitchen is beside the intake for the air conditioning so we were circulating cold greasy air into our room.  The next two nights we left the windows open, which was better but you still got some of the kitchen smells. I have no idea what one would do in the summer because the room is on the top floor and in the eaves of the building. Did not complain about it because clearly there would be nothing they could have done during our stay(did not feel like moving rooms 2 days in ) but post it here as I know management reads reviews.

2.Annoying things: Inconsistent staff.  On check-in and check-out staff friendly, professional and polite.  However, struggled many times to open the door with hands full while doorman was somewhere else and waited 20 minutes before being served in the lounge.   Cleaning was spotty‚Ä¶please do not fold back the sheets to my bed and leave a dirty menu for breakfast. Replacement of towels was hit or miss ‚Äì no replacement of face clothes that were used. Iron and ironing board only upon request (though there is room in closet for one). The towel railing in the bathroom was loose, the knob on the shower came away and I struggled to get in and out of the tub (and it was a bit claustrophobic being in the eaves).  The bedside tables too close to the bed and because it is at the same level as the bed I banged my head rolling over on it one night 

3.Nit-picky things to note that I only point out because the place sells itself as an upscale hotel  - a Mr. and Mrs. Smith hotel - but in my opinion did not quite deliver.  A broken light  in our room went unfixed the whole time we were there.  There was a nice welcome letter when we arrived but for someone else. There is a high noon tea but we were served tea in horrible cafeteria style coffee cups as opposed to china cups for tea (ruining the experience). Very hard pillows. Nowhere to store your own items in the fridge.",3,2012,04,10
113,Afternoon Tea - AMAZING,"Few days ago went there with my friend to celebrate my birthday. As we had the 2 for 1 voucher, we paid half price, but would definitely pay a full price - the afternoon tea was simply amazing! The vegetarian sandwiches could be more interesting, but still really enjoyable! Desserts were the best I have ever had. And the service was really good - we spent there 4 hours just chatting and nobody gave us any kind of gesture to leave - really nice! Definitely will come again!",5,2012,04,10
113,Great Location,"The location of this hotel next to Old Brompton Road means there is a wide range of restaurants covering all sorts of  cuisines and price ranges. The Sth Kensington tube station is also very close and on a good line for getting to popular sites.

Similarly to other reviewers, we enjoyed the downstairs rooms, especially with the fire going on a chilly March day. The breakfast gets a bit boring after a few days as the range of the buffet is small and generally unvarying.

 Typically for London the room was small but clean and comfortable. There didn't seem to be anyway of controlling the room temperature but luckily the window could be opened to let in some fresh air and the street was quiet. One thing that really annoyed us was that the bar fridge had sealed compartments for each minibar item, which meant it was impossible to put anything of your own in it. The fresh milk that my wife loves to have with her tea had to go out on the window sill in the luckily very cool outside air.",4,2012,04,09
113,"OK, but no cigar","This is an ok hotel as a place to crash in London. It is not too expensive, ok rooms, in an older building, that is nice in the lobby, lounge and bar, but upstairs looks quite dated and tired. The rooms are ok, but not 5 star. The bathroom I had again was ok, but with a shower in the bath, and a leaking shower screen, it all felt a little tired. It can be noisy, with no sound insulation or glazing of the window in my room, and I doubt in the others, don't expect a peaceful night's sleep. Does the job, probably value for money, ok location for the museums.",3,2012,04,03
113,A gem... if you stay clear of the smokey floor,"This hotel is a gem. Cozy rooms but super well appointed. Clean, service and staff are phenomenal. Restaurant and room service very good. 

It is a non-smoking hotel. However on my second night I began to smell cigarette smoke filling my room. I called the front desk and was told that my floor the 4th floor was a smoking floor, even though the hotel advertises that it is nonsmoking. They apologized and offered a complimentary glass of wine, but really should tell guests this on check in. 

Other then this little hiccup, the place met my expectations. 

Also no on site parking, but if you park in front of the hotel at a metered space the valet will keep the meter full so you don't get a ticket.",5,2012,03,30
113,Excellent Hotel,"Quiet area, exceptional service.  Rooms are very European (very small by US standards) but well kept.  We did experience an annoying fire alarm one night for quite some time due to some moron leaving a shower on while they passed out drunk and which took a very long time to turn off which is why I give 4 stars instead of 5.  Staff are exceptionally friendly.  Tube station is only 2-3 blocks away.  Location is good for quiet area but is a ways from the happening parts of central London like Picadilly and Soho.  Hotel was expensive by US standards (around $350 per night, 220 pounds) but not by London standards.  I don't think there is a really nice hotel in London that is a good value - all the nicer hotels are expensive.",4,2012,03,21
113,Overwhelmed with the service,"We used The Kensington Hotel in February for our wedding day.

We got ready at the hotel, had our meal, hosted a drinks reception and stayed overnight, as did some of our guests.

We have been completely overwhelmed by the service and attention to detail from all the staff members we encountered. 

Upon arrival (we were early) we were shown straight up to our suite, which was beautiful. Light, bright and spacious with the most gorgeous bathroom, that included a plasma screen in the bath, and a very large, very comfortable, four poster bed (a stylish one, not tacky). We were very pleased with our room.

The food and service at dinner were both excellent and we received no end of compliments from guests about how delicious the food was. 

We had more guests arrive in the evening, where we used the drawing room for a drinks reception. The drawing room is a beautiful space, with open fireplaces and gorgeous decor, very romantic and elegant. The service again was outstanding, no one's drinks ran dry all evening, the staff were on top of everything.

When we returned to our room that evening we were greeted to a complimentary bottle of champagne, candle and rose petals over our bed with a lovely note too. This was such a special touch. 

Throughout the planning of our wedding day Kristin and Karthik were very professional and friendly, and made me feel completely confident about the event. They were brilliant. On the day, they were extremely helpful, as were all the staff, with a quick mention to the lovely door man who's name I didn't get, a really nice guy.

Even after the day the service didn't stop, as we had left a gift behind which was swiftly located and sent back to us by recorded mail, of which we greatly appreciate.

As you can probably tell by now we are so happy with The Kensington, it is in a great location, near to Hyde Park and South Kensington tube. We look forward to visiting them again soon and plan to stay on our anniversary (or before if we get the chance) :)

Thank you everyone at The Kensington for making our day so magical.",5,2012,03,21
113,Delightful!,"My family and I stayed in the Kensington in August, and what a wonderful experience! The lounge and reception area was absolutely beautiful. An early flight meant we arrived before check-in time, but the staff at the hotel did all they could to ensure that we got into our rooms as soon as possible. It sounds strange, but the entire hotel had the most wonderful smell all the time! It rained for most of the four days we were there but the close proxemity to S.Kensington tube station was ideal as well as the 'Kensington' umbrellas at the door of the hotel which we were free to take out with us each day. 

The breakfast was wonderful, we had lots of sightseeing planned which meant we couldn't relax and enjoy all the lovely things that breakfast had to offer. In fact, we didn't really get to appreciate the hotel fully because we were out and about for the most part. It's the kind of hotel that would really be more suited to a couples romantic weekend away rather than a family trip to London - only because you don't want to leave the wonderfully comfortable beds each morning to go sightseeing!

The staff were wonderful, and kept out luggage on the last day until we were leaving for an evening flight, also providing us all with bottled water for our onward journey. My sister was lucky enough to bump into a certain XFactor judge in the elevator which really sums up the exclusivity and luxury of this wonderful hotel!!!!",5,2012,03,06
113,My 5th stay at this lovely hotel.,"This was my 5th stay at this lovely hotel and hopefully not my last one!

Still my favourite hotel in London, considering location, value for money and comfort.

Can't wait to go back again!",5,2012,03,06
113,Superb,"The Kensington hotel is the best boutique hotel in London, and probably the best overall hotel in terms of ""value for money"".  The atmosphere is relaxed and charming and It's quiet easy to spot actors and celebrities walking through the hall. I would suggest to take a look at the breakfast hall, that is simply amazing for the ancient furniture , luxurious design and amazing food quality.
Staff is super kind, with a special mention to the helpful front desk team that satisfied all my needs.
Definitely a MUST place to stay in London.",5,2012,02,29
113,Heaven in South Kensington,"This hotel is a gem; we absolutely loved our stay here from start to finish. The staff is very friendly and welcoming and did everything they could to make our time with them wonderful. The atmosphere in the entire hotel is one of inviting elegance, from our immaculate room to the inviting fireplaces that greeted us each night as we came back from busy days of sightseeing . The Kensington's location is also perfect, being a short walk through a great neighborhood to the tube and wonderful shopping. We felt truly pampered and I can honestly say this is the only hotel we will stay at for all our future visits to amazing London!",5,2012,02,25
113,Perfect stay...,"Just enjoyed a perfect stay at this hotel. A very helpful staff, and a super clean, beautifully appointed room. Turndown desserts and hot tea added to the cozy yet luxurious atmosphere. The lobby lounge area is charming and cozy, with tea and light fare available day and night. Easy walk to South Kensington tube station. I won't stay anywhere else in London. Looking forward to going back soon.",5,2012,02,24
113,Good hotel but staff needs improvement,"Overall we had a nice stay at this hotel.  The location is great, rooms are lovely and the lobby/bar area has an inviting Victorian feel to it.  The staff, on the other hand, needs further training.  When we checked in I inquired about an upgrade as part of my Tablet Plus privileges, and was told my the front desk that no rooms in the upgrade category were available.  Found that hard to believe so after we settled in our room I went online and checked the hotel website and sure enough they were selling rooms from the upgrade category for the dates we were staying there.  I confronted the manager and was told the front desk person didn't want us to wait while they got one of these rooms ready so told us non were available.  Huh?  So lying to a customer is better than giving them the option to wait for a better room?  To their credit though, the situation was rectified immediately and we were transferred to an upgraded room.  The rest of the stay was enjoyable.

One thing to be aware of though is that due to the architecture of the building, the walls are quite thin so it can get loud outside the room at times.  So make sure to bring your earplugs...",3,2012,02,20
113,best hotel ever.,"I‚Äôve never written a review before, but I couldn't help letting you know that this is the most charming hotel I've ever seen. 
The lounge area is worthy of the Royal Family: fireplace, newspapers, gentle music, flowers and a quiet and cozy atmosphere. My room was perfectly clean and impeccable in every detail: magnificent furniture, unforgettable king size bed, huge restroom with warm towels and quality shampoo and body lotion. 
Never found such an excellent staff: welcoming, professional and always helpful. Room service is really fast and delicious. Free wifi has been a useful surprise. 
I suggest to include breakfast in your stay at Kensington Hotel because it is literally amazing: muffins and brioches are fresh every morning; cheese, ham and toasted bread are superb. Here I've drunk the best coffee of England (and the best caipiroska as well..in the evening of course). 
Every evening there are the next day's weather forecast and the ‚Äúgood night chocolate‚Äù (a little piece of paradise).  
The only imperfection is that while you're visiting London you can't wait to return to the hotel!!!",5,2012,02,15
113,5 Star Service,"Had a fabulous stay at this hotel. Stayed in a studio suite it was beautiful. Staff are the best hotel staff I have ever known. Expensive drinks, meals but worth it. Definitely get the continental bfast it's quality.  Lovely lounge areas, warm fires, nice windows to look out of. Good location for museums, Harrods but a tube or taxi for other things. Good amount of restaurants, not enough pubs wine bars. Better to drink in the hotel. All in all - lovely! ",4,2012,02,10
113,Great value,"I stayed 6 nights on a business trip last month.  Small, but comfortable room.   Attentive staff with a wonderful attitude.  Same day dry cleaning/laundry right on time.  Rock solid wireless internet both in the lobby and in my room -- skype worked without a hitch.  Short walk to the Gloucester Road and South Kensington Tube stations.  ¬£10 cab ride from Paddington.  Good restaurants within the surrounding blocks (I ate at Rocca twice -- nice place if you are eating alone).  Another great find on TripAdvisor!",5,2012,02,05
113,The luxurious face of staying in London,"Staying in London is an expensive and hit and miss affair. The staff, decor and food at the Kensington Hotel all conspire to make your stay as good as it can be. Yes, my room was tiny but this is London and everything I needed was provided from an enormous flat screen TV and a very comfortable bed was there - except a desk. I've never really understoon the turn down service principle but it was good to get 2 Lily O'Brien sweets and the waether forcast at the end of a long day. Breakfast offered a wide and delicious choice. Service was pleasant and efficient. Concierge and reception staff were equally well trained - nothing was too much. The decor is lovely - very special - a real historic feel while being very comfortable.",5,2012,02,05
113,WONDERFUL!,"I have stayed several times at the Doyle Collection hotels  and like them all.  The quality of service, cleanliness and comfort is always high.  However,  the Kensington is special.  The staff is extremely competent, professional, and extremely friendly.  I was fortunate to have an upgrade,  so the size of the room was more than adequate for a single traveler. I will stay their again for sure.",5,2012,02,05
113,Afternoon tea review,"It is difficult to rate this hotel as there were very positive but also negative elements to our trip there.
I booked champagne afternoon tea at The Kensington for my mum and me for her birthday. We went there before the theatre. 
The staff did not seem to have record of my booking when we arrived despite me calling to check the reservation.
The staff were excellent, extremely friendly , helpful and attentive. We were very impressed with their service. The hotel itself is stunning! The room we were in was beautiful and the presentation and quality of the food was also excellent.
I found it very strange however, that they did not provide napkins until we asked for them, and we had to use the same plate and cutlery for the sandwiches, scones and cakes which, considering the amount we spent, was not acceptable.
It was a lovbely experience and great service but they seem to fall down on very simple things.",3,2012,02,03
113,"Immaculate hotel,super service","Great experience , hots towels at check in, lovely rooms well fitted, really helpful staff who were almost falling over themselves to cater for all ones needs. Good location. Parked in car park listed on the website which is a short two minute walk away- expensive ¬£35 for overnight but not untypical of London. It is not run by the hotel. Nice touch on check out was to offer a bottle of water for onward journey. Would definitely stay there again.",5,2012,02,02
113,Nice hotel with good staff - Value for money,"I had been travelling London for couple of times in the past, this is my 1st time with The Kensington and which is my best stay ever.

After a 13-hr flight, we landed at 5am on 26 Dec and was informed that the airport express and underground services were suspended due to the protest of the workers. So we headed for bus to the city.

Upon arrival at The Kensington Hotel, the hotel staff came out to welcome us and gave a hand for loading-off our baggages from the taxi.

It was 7am so I didn't expect we could get a room but leave the baggages at the lobby. Surprisingly, the frontdesk lady informed that our room is ready and we can settle down right away! 

We were brought to a room on 3/F which was nicely decorated and spacious (comparing with other hotel rooms in UK), most importantly - clean!

Just a weak point to note - the walls are thin enough for us to hear any sound outside the door - no matter someone is walking pass or housekeeping service is carrying out next door.

Overall we are happy with our stay at The Kensington and would definitely come back in our next visit to London!",4,2012,02,02
113,Wonderful staff!,"I stayed at The Kensington Hotel for 2 nights from Jan 18-20th. It was my first business trip to London and I could not have been made more welcome.  On arrival at reception I was met by a lovely porter who relieved me of my luggage with a big smile...and then I was offered a warm hand towel to freshen up while checking in! What lovely touches...other hotels take note, it's the small things that make the difference!  Since I had contacted the hotel after booking and let them know it was my first trip, I was given a complimentary upgrade which was lovely...I had requested a room overlooking the street but the room I was given was an interior room with not much of a view...but the room was so lovely otherwise with a gorgeous en-suite and dressing area that I didn't mind at all and I was already feeling spoiled so I didn't feel it necessary to mention it! But the next morning I received a call from Chiara (Guest Services) apologising for the lack of view and offering to move me to another room! Now that is customer service! I turned down the offer as I was so comfortable and had made myself at home!  On my first night back in the room there was a beautiful fruit plate along with some macaroons and chocolates awaiting me, together with a lovely note from Ansis(Guest Services) Lovely touch!  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to spend time in London...you're a 5min walk from South Kensington tube station...although on my first morning I walked all the way to Marble Arch as the weather was so nice! I will most certainly be returning to The Kensington Hotel, maybe next time for a weekend away rather than business!!",5,2012,01,30
113,Convenient and comfortable,"We stayed there for a total of 5 nights. Location was wonderful, only 5 mins walk to South Kensington underground station. Quite a number of affordable restaurants nearby. Staff was nice and helpful. Lobby was classy. Room was clean with sufficient space to move around. Services were wonderful, fresh apples, chocolates, soft towels/slippers, free wifi...Good choice for staying over there on vacation.",5,2012,01,30
113,Watch out for the rip off,I had a good idea what i was getting but When checking out watch your bill. I was charged for a breakfast that I didn't have and when I told them they practically accused me of lying. Next they explained that the price advertised was ex VAT. I signed and left and then realized that they had converted the bill to euro taking another couple of percent.  Take take take. Never again. ,2,2012,01,29
113,"Convenient, classy hotel","I stayed here recently for a business trip and very much enjoyed this classy hotel for a 4 day stay. The service there is top notch - from the chocolates in your room at night, to the helpful concierge and to the bottle of water offered upon departure. The hotel itself is situation on a quiet street but is close to a lot of great restaurants, stores and attractions. Although you can easily hail a cab in front of the hotel, the South Kensington tube station is just a 5 minute walk away. Apparently there are a few hotels called ""The Kensington"" so you will need to state the address for the cab driver to find it.

The hotel is nicely appointed which carries into the rooms. The standard rooms are on the small side but it served my purposes. If you have the means, upgrade to a deluxe if you need more space. I've traveled to Europe several times and have noticed the lack of an alarm clock, the staple of the American hotel (along with the Gideon's Bible apparently). However, in this hotel you will notice the large flat-screen TV has the time on the lower left corner. I think you can set an alarm here but you can always call to have a wake-up call (which is done by a real person and not a machine so make sure to respond when they call you). My room overlooked the main street which made for good people watching. One of the things that is missing from the room is a desk from which to do work or eat in. There probably isn't space for one in a room that size but it would have been nice.

A few on the nice amenities are:
 - the gym in the basement. It's small but with most of the expected equipment
 - free wireless internet which is essential for a business trip
 - computer with printer in the lobby. Great for printing out your boarding pass (and free)
 - breakfast. I think it depends on your reservation but mine came with continental breakfast which was generous and a great way to start the day

This was my first stay at this boutique hotel and I hope to return on my next trip to London!",4,2012,01,28
113,No change from last review - still a great little hotel,"I travelled to London again recently and was once more housed in the Kensington Hotel for a three week period, checking in and out every week, so saw a total of three different rooms of similar standard - this makes a total of 30 nights over the past 3 or 4 months.

Please also note this is my second review of this hotel - check my other reviews for my thoughts on my first stay.

I have to say I really like this hotel. I think the service is excellent and the cleanliness second to none. There are a myriad of nice touches that they offer, from a refreshing towel at check-in, to free wifi in all parts of the hotel, free newspapers in the morning, to an offer of a free bottle of water on check-out. 

I think the hotel management should receive praise for this type of service which make the hotel stand out from its competition. It's these small things that really count when it comes to service provision in my view, and The Kensington does it really very well.

I do however feel that on occasion the rooms let themselves down in some respects.

Whilst the rooms are large (again I stayed in an executive room), furnished with verve and taste, and the bed extremely comfortale, I wonder quite how The Kensington can pitch itself to business travellers like myself, when they do not provide a desk in the room. I have rarely stayed at a hotel of this price and calibre and not had a desk in the room where I can work. There was certainly space for a desk in the room - so why not include one?

You might think that this is limited to my room, or perhaps was an oversight, but all three rooms I stayed in during my trip were all differently furnished, and all of them lacked a desk. Unimpressive if you are a business traveller. Oddly, on my first 3 week visit, there was a desk in every room...

I would like to sum up that I think this is a charming hotel, with large comfortable rooms, fantastic service, and well located in South Kensington. The hotel delivers a pretty personalised service, which for the calibre of hotel is actually relatiavely rare.

113,Comrortable and considerate,"I arrived at the Kensington at 11pm after a plane trip from Sweden for a 3 night stay.  As soon as I arrived my bag was taken by the courteous  porter, Martin. Quiet and warm foyer, greeted by reception and requested a wake up call in morning as I was on a tour the next day. Room and bathroom clean, the bed was so comfortable , linen white and fresh. Problem-next morn, no wake up call, plus wasn't notified of the tour person coming to collect me. Reception called the tour company(premium) and a lovely tour man Len drove me to the tower of London so didn't miss the tour! Arrived back at hotel that afternoon spoke to Vanessa and Ansis (managers) who were aware of the morning scenario, apologised and indulged me in a complimentary dinner. This restored my enjoyment of this hotel. Next day another tour, received wake up call, great tour, back to a warm hotel, delicious food and a very large comfortable bed! All areas of staff are professional and courteous. Would stay here again.",4,2012,01,24
113,Perfect Weekend Stay,"Myself and my boyfriend stayed at the Kensington Hotel London at the weekend and we enjoyed it so much that we felt compelled to write a review on Trip Advisor.  We arrived from Dublin earlier in the day and checked in at 11am to which we were told that our room was ready! we were delighted... we were also upgraded which was a great surprise for us and especially as it was my boyfriend's birthday.. we left our luggage up and went out and about and when we arrived back to our room we found a beautiful fruit plate with ""happy birthday"" written in chocolate on it. A lovely touch.  The room itself was so clean, comfortable, spacious and quiet. The bathroom was gorgeous with major attention to detail. We only stayed for one night unfortunately as we were heading home the next day and we were sad to leave the hotel - very rare in my experience.  The next day upon checking out we had a late flight so we could leave our luggage with the hotel for safe keeping and when we came to collect it the staff were so nice and said ""welcome back"" with lovely smiles - seriously we felt as though we were their only customers and they were very genuine.  This hotel is in a fantastic location just a few minutes walk to the main museums and many beautiful cafes and restaurants surround it - if you are looking for a really lovely Indian restaurant we would recommend ""Thali"" which was recommended to us from the very helfpful concierge. From our weekend trip away we have promised to visit again in April. Really looking forward to it already.",5,2012,01,23
113,"Classy Boutique Hotel, in the Heart of Kensington.","Partner and myself needed a break to clear january blues, bit hassled after work had mislaid passport at airport dreadful traffic in Dublin... and we arrived. The front desk was an oasis of peace and courtesy, gave us heated travel towels whilst waiting to check in and on we go.

The hotel is beautiful, full of antique furtniture, wonderful paintings, beautiful library serving as the 'Aubrey' restaurant. The bar manager and staff were excellent knew their drinks but be careful of pushing the most expensive drinks on customers. Also disappointed as this hotel belongs to the Doyle Collection didn't see an Irish Whiskey in sight at bar !

Room was smallish but classic bed and furniture, bath and shower alittle high to access for older clients with mobility problems

Had evening food which was adequate and breakfast the following morning was very good.
What made our weekend was the personal attention of staff, nothing was too much for them, we were always greeted and made feel at home.

The hotel is central for tubes and buses and has a wide selection of cafes, pubs and restaurants on its doorstep. A must for the Weary Traveller looking for a 'Pick Me Up.'
We Will Be Back !!!",5,2012,01,22
113,Wonderful,We enjoyed our 3 day stay while visiting the sights and sounds of London. Excellent facilities as would be expected. The service is second to none and it is within easy reach of attractions.,5,2012,01,22
113,Perfect Upscale Classic Hotel,"I love this charming classic five star hotel. Perfect towels and bed linens, elegant relaxed perfectly appointed sitting areas, old world charm‚Ä¶ When I arrived everything went wrong. I had no heat, my key cards would not work and the robe was missing its sash tie. I went to the desk three times and politely complained because nothing had yet happened. I am never disrespectful no matter how disappointed I might be. The most professional and courteous woman, Vanessa Kunze said‚Äù well that is enough of that‚Äù and they move me to a beautiful room. Problems occur but what matters is what is done about them. If the Doyle Collection people are as professional as their hotels look, the next property will be managed by Ms. Kunze. I will stay here every time I stay in London. Also the location is great from Heathrow. Simply jump on the Piccadilly Tube and get off at South Kensington. It is perfect for a romantic weekend in London. Of and go see War Horse!  And eat dinner at the Harwood Arms. Perfect Gastro Pub food‚Ä¶ You will never say English food isn‚Äôt world class food again‚Ä¶",5,2012,01,19
113,I love this place,"I stay at The Kensington every time I need to stay in London and I love it. The staff are wonderful, friendly and helpful. The bar and lounge are beautiful and the rooms are smart and furnished beautifully. My only gripe is that the pillows are too hard for my liking. Classy, boutique and personal. ",5,2012,01,14
113,The Kensington Hotel,I spent two nights at the hotel in June 2010 and was most impressed. The staff were very friendly and efficient. I liked the nice touch of a chocolate delivered to my room each night.,5,2012,01,11
113,staff couldnt do enough for you :),"Me and my boyfriend stayed here for one night for new years eve. We arrived way before check in about 10am just to drop off our bags, however our room was actually ready and we were allowed the keys then. it was great to be able to check in so early especially after a long journey.
The Superior room was a little on the smaller side but this is London you cant expect huge rooms. it was beautifully decorated and the marble bathroom was lovely. 
The concierge couldnt do enough for you , from taking your bags, hailing taxis and covering you with his brolly in the rain. All done with a smile. 
To be honest all the staff were great very friendly and polite definatly 5* service.
Even when we had checked out at 11am they took our bags to a secure room so we could explore London, and when we came to collect them we still had 5* service even though we had paid and checked out hours before.

The location of this hotel was great 5 minute walk from South Kensington Station, and in such a quiet location again rare for London.

i would definatly recommend this hotel to all, and hope to get to stay here again very soon.",5,2012,01,06
113,Very nice hotel and staff...!,"I went to London for a special event and was advised to stay at the kensigton hotel by a friend. That was a very good choice, because the hotel is very beautiful, very well located and the staff is lovely...it made my long weekend with my husband a very nice one and we were happy to come back to our room and enjoy a tea before going to bed.
Thank you to the reception ladies that were smily and very friendly and also to the F&B team, not to forget the very friendly doorman...Keep up the good work, we will for sure come back very soon again.",5,2012,01,06
113,Classy and Comfortable,"This was our first visit to London.  We were looking for a place to stay that would have the character expected in London.  The Kensington turned out to be exactly as we would have expected.  The staff was polite, friendly and helpful.  The rooms and public spaces were modern but still had the feeling that we were in London, not the USA.  The location was great.  It was a short walk to the Kensington Station, then a short ride to anywhere.  While walking to the tube station, explore the neighborhood!  There are lots of interesting places to eat , drink and shop.",5,2012,01,05
113,Wonderful stay - helpful staff,We stayed here with our three klids in two rooms. It is a very nice property. Not quite 5 star but all of 4. The location was good with lots of restaurants within walking distance. Breakfast was included in our rate and it was very good - they even brough hot chocolate for the kids as part of it. The conceirge was great. He helped us buy the tickets to the Tower of London in advance and suggested a show (Wizard of Oz) and secured tickets for it as well. Buying tickets in advance is a great idea. Overall a very nice stay.,4,2012,01,05
113,Charming stay,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay at the Kensington hotel.  This was our first visit to London.  This hotel is very conveniently located near the South Kensington underground stop, which has three different train lines.  We stayed in room 206.  There wasn't much of a view.  The room was charming, cozy and clean.  We had a large window and a spacious bathroom.  There seemed to be a problem with the electrical wiring as some of the lights we're flickering on and off.  We were not too concerned as we did not spend too much time in our room for.  The staff here was friendly and very helpful.  Our iPhone charger was not working properly and the hotel manager offered his personal one for us to use for the time being.  They offered us an hour later check out which was timed well with our flight time.  The surrounding area of the hotel has quite a few restaurants and convenience stores which was great for picking up bottles or water and snacks for the room.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay and we most likely come here again.",4,2012,01,03
113,Excellent service lovely hotel,I stayed over Christmas with family 2 small children the staff were excellent looking after the kids with books and colour pencils. Rooms are fantastic very clean nothing was to much trouble. Lovely location away from the hussle and bustle . Dino & Adrianne thank you for looking after us.,5,2012,01,03
113,Great Location,"I spent 4 nights here on my recent trip to London and it was wonderful. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly throughout my stay. The hotel is out of the hustle and bustle and located in a lovely neighborhood with easy access to the tube and within walking distance of great shopping, Kensington Park/Palace, and wonderful restaurants. We had a Junior suite which was lovely and spacious for London and a great bathroom, minimal closet space so pack light.  It's an old building so a bit noisy in the hallways but most people were respectful and quiet. Great experience!",5,2012,01,03
113,An elegant five-star experience at the right price,"Where you can pay too much money for a sub-standard experience in cities like London and Paris, The Kensington was a wonderful stay over Christmas and a very reasonable price. The decor is elegant and sophisticated, as others have noted, and retains a cozy townhouse feel. Staff are highly service-minded and clearly care about making your stay as pleasant as possible.

Being very close to South Kensington tube, transport in to the centre to go to the department stores, theatres and attractions was very easy. And, for a sensitive sleeper such as myself, its location away from main roads and noise was attractive - a nice quiet night's sleep.

Whilst the gym is not huge, it had everything I needed to get a good CrossFit-style workout - a decent number of well-serviced modern machines, ample open floor space with mats and, importantly, free weights.",5,2012,01,02
113,Excellent for everything. Highly recommended!!,"We stayed 2 nights for new years eve 2011. Elegant decor, very friendly and helpful staff. Beautiful rooms. Perfect central location. 5 mins from natural history museum. Everything you want from a hotel. I will be staying here again, whenever we come to London.",5,2012,01,01
113,Wonderful experience,"The staff go out of their way to make you feel special at this hotel - they cannot do enough for you to make it a pleasant stay.  We had a wonderful time here over the Christmas holiday - the food was fantastic, the service was first class and the room we had was very spacious.  The decor is sleek and comfortable.  I would definitely dine and stay at this hotel again. A great location too.",5,2011,12,31
113,Quiet and off the beaten path,"Very nice, sophisticated, classy. Close by some eclectic eateries. Not close by shopping if you're looking for piccadilly trafalgar square or the super touristy places. Quiet on a weekday. Excellent service, nice bar, polite bartenders, just not in the mix of high energy hubbub.",4,2011,12,29
113,Finally a fine London hotel against a decent price,I find must hotels in London quite overpriced given the size/quality of the rooms and the service offered. This hotel compares very well with its competitors in the same price category. Staff is friendly. The breakfast is done well. Hotel lobby with log fire is very comfortable. Location is good. Not too far away from Knightsbridge. South Kensington station is a five minute walk away.,5,2011,12,23
113,Perfect place to stay in London,"I chose this hotel because I wanted to stay in the South Kensington area. What a good choice I've made! The hotel personnel is very helpful and welcoming. The concierge welcomed me and helped with my luggage at first arrival outside of the main gate. Special thanks to Marc from front desk... He fixed immediately some requests I had (like sending someone to break my luggage's lock; change my room etc). 
The room is cozy and nicely decorated. The marble bathrooms are good. The toiletries are fantastic! I would never forget the smell of the shampoo :)
The lobby makes you feel at home and you can have an afternoon tea, read in front of the fire place.. such a lovely atmosphere...
The hotel is almost one block to the South Kensington tube station. 
I would recommend to ask for rooms away from the fans which are outside of the hotel which make lots of noise (that was the only disappointing part of my stay) twenty-four hour a day.
I would definitely stay at the same hotel in my next stay.",4,2011,12,22
113,Stylish hotel in a convenient location,"I knew this hotel would be a good choice from the minute I walked in. Everything was as it was suppose to be. The hotel was elegantly furnished and very clean. The staff is friendly and always there to help. I especially loved the weather reports we received each evening for the following day since the weather in London changes a lot. The location was great, I love this part of London because it's quiet and safe. Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a stylish and quiet place to stay in  such an exciting city as London can be.",5,2011,12,17
113,Hard to fault.....,"Reception
As soon as I appeared at the doors, I was welcomed by the porter and my bags taken. At the desk I  was initially offered a room at the front of the building, overlooking Queensgate, but as soon as I explained that I was working nearby and needed a quiet room to ensure a good night‚Äôs sleep, I was  offered one on the fifth and highest floor. This  proved very quiet even though it overlooked the road.
Room
I was escorted to the room ‚Äì a studio suite ‚Äì and shown its major features and controls.  I knew that the room came with a four-poster bed but this was surprisingly small: I also find it hard to understand what advantage a dark rectangular wooden structure arising from the four corners  of the bed is supposed to provide. In my opinion it served only to make the room seem smaller. Furniture was limited to two wooden armchairs ‚Äì comfortable enough ‚Äì two small round tables and a large modern desk. The very large wall- mounted flat screen TV rather dominated the room and was angled for best viewing from the bed rather than the seating area. There was an excellent choice of channels and free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel. There was also an excellent coffee-making machine.
The bed linen was of good quality. The AC performed excellently during the night  without discernible noise so I slept well throughout my stay. It was surprising to find that it was difficult to warm the room during the afternoon however: despite turning the thermostat up to 24C, it remained cold until early evening when warm air finally began to issue. I have noticed before that some London hotels seem to turn off the heating during the day even in winter ‚Äì presumably on the basis that the rooms are then largely unoccupied.
The bathroom was excellent: spacious and modern. There was a large tub at one end and a splendid walk-in shower with rain-head at the other.  In between was  the WC and two wash-hand basins. The markings on the single lever taps were difficult to reconcile with the temperature of the water though ‚Äì experiment and patience were required to achieve the desired blend.
The room was serviced during the morning to an excellent standard.
The Bar & Room Service
The transformation from Jury‚Äôs Kensington to The Kensington obviously involved a major remodelling of the public rooms so that what was the bar is now a large and very comfortable lounge area and a new large bar has appeared to the rear of that area. Both are staffed by a young, friendly and efficient team. On the second night of my stay, a welcome reception for guests saw champagne flowing freely and so many canap√©s on offer that I did not need a meal later ‚Äì I doubt that this is a weekly event however.
As my business involved a substantial lunch every day, I did not sample the restaurant but the room service menu provided excellent light snacks which appeared reasonably promptly.
Checkout
As with all my dealings at the front desk, this was handled promptly and pleasantly.The prices were of course fairly high but not unusually or unjustifiably so given the excellent overall standard of the hotel. 
Overall
Pluses: excellent location and service, welcoming and comfortable ambience, very quiet room and reasonable value. 
Minuses: Very few. Room cold during the day. Four-poster not to my taste - but it might please others, of course.",5,2011,12,10
113,"Quiet & elegant hotel, but rooms a little small","Pros:  quiet & safe area with shops/restaurants very near by; proximity to museums (V&A, etc.); proximity to South Kensington tube (10 minutes walk); elegant decor; efficient service

Cons:  Room & bathroom a little small (typical for London but as I was traveling for work, it would have been nice to have a desk); walls are thin; tube not as close as I would like",4,2011,12,04
113,Style and Service in Kensington,"Stayed here for 5 nights recently and loved this hotel. It is stylish and elegant without being stuffy, and the staff are very pleasant, helpful and professional in their attitude. As an example, on a busy Friday night, returning late from dining out, my husband found the bar extremely busy, and was about to give up on his night cap, when one of the staff noticed us leaving the bar area empty handed. He  proceeded to tell us that he would get the drink on our behalf, which he did immediately .He could have easily let us leave the area and we would have been none the wiser, - thank you.   The breakfasts were delicious with a good choice of both continental and cooked food, and the general ambience made us feel we wanted to linger. The bedroom, although on the small side, was clean, comfortable and extremely well appointed. Loved the turn down service and chocs. Would definitely recommend and will stay again on our next trip to London.",4,2011,12,04
113,Fantastic stay!,"We loved The Kensington Hotel! We stayed for six nights and had a wonderful time. The room was elegant, quiet and comfortable. We came back to the room each evening to shower and get ready to go to the theater and when we returned late, our bed was turned down and all of our wet towels were replaced. Each night we also got a bottle of water, a tiny dessert and chocolates. The dessert was different each night. One evening we even got a thermos of tea. The staff was friendly and helpful and we loved the location. It's a short walk to the South Kensington tube station. We highly recommend staying here.",5,2011,12,01
113,Wonderful stay!,"My boyfriend and I recently enjoyed a wonderful stay at The Kensington. We visited London for my birthday weekend, and our stay was thoroughly enjoyable. The staff were helpful and courteous without being intrusive, and couldn't do enough to ensure that our stay was memorable. The bar is definitely worth a visit- and the cocktails are just gorgeous! Definitely go to this hotel.",5,2011,12,01
113,"Only came for tea this time, next time will stay!","My daughter and I were in London over Thanksgiving week and chose the Kensington for our afternoon tea experience. We could not have been happier. Service was great, holiday decor was up and lovely, and the food was divine. We had a delightful conversation with Vanessa, the Asst. Guest Relations Manager, and based on our experience in the restaurant and with her wonderful hospitality, this is where we will stay on future trips to London.",5,2011,11,30
113,All Fur and no Knickers and a mugging in the bar!,"On the recommendation of a business colleague I stayed at this hotel last Thursday and Friday 25th November to conduct business with clients in the immediate area. My first issue would be the suggested parking arrangements which were overly priced at ¬£98 for 2 nights for the privilege of parking in a gravel pit.

Secondly, after my Thursday meetings with clients I came back to the hotel bar and ordered 3 or 4 brandies. I was extremely shocked to be handed a bill at my hotel door for circa ¬£500 as I had not been approached in the bar to sign for my drinks. It would seem the barman had been serving me the good stuff without telling me of this scenario. Naturally I was extremely angered as I felt the bar man had clearly taken advantage of my request for brandy. Not acceptable. I complained to both the evening desk and when I checked out however I was told nothing could be done. I noted that my signature was not confirmed during each brandy!

Breakfast in Bed was ordered on Friday morning but didn't arrive and I ordered a copy of the times for both days but never received them. 

Finally, I was late for my 3pm Friday meeting as the electrics kept fusing in my room, (Ever tried to iron a shirt with a cold iron?)And the telephone had to be replaced as it was faulty, hence I was ringing the desk on my mobile phone.",2,2011,11,28
113,"Charm and sophistication, I just love this hotel.","Understated charm, exquisite decor, log fires. cocktails mixed and served with style, I recommend this hotel, Piccadilly line from Heathrow straight to South Kensington tube also a bonus, rooms just perfect and quiet. And the staff are friendly and helpfull. I just couldn't fault it...",5,2011,11,25
113,Big disappointment after last time we stayed,Arrived very late on Thursday night for a 4night stay. Greeted by a me receptionist who wasn't very friendly. Bar was closed and we asked if we could have a drink so receptionist told us to take a seat and he would send the concierge over to take our order. Concierge came over and asked what we wanted. My husband asked for a lager and I asked what type of red wine they had to which he replied they only had Rioja and no other option. So we ordered what we were pretty much told we were having and he took 25 minutes to return...having arrived late from the airport and train station we were not impresed with the wait. Our room stunk of cigarette smoke and having recently given up smoking this was unpleasant. We had chosen a superior room as we were disappointed with the size of the standard rooms we previously stayed in but this was not very much better and we had no window-just a frosted glass pane which appeared to over look drains and pipes etc... Unfortunately we won't be returning which I am sad about as I previously ranted and raved about how much I liked the hotel....it is also a little overpriced!   ,3,2011,11,24
113,"Disappointing, unorganized, sloppy","We sayed at this hotel after a long reasearch. Upon arrival I went to take a shower and the robe i found neatly folded in the closet was litterally covered in human hair! Never seen anything like it. We found more hair on the bed and a very kind lady from house keeping manged to change our room. The next room was bigger, but the sink was clogged and the light above the sink itself was shot. Upon checking out, they told us that their computer system was down so we couldn't see how much we were charged.They promised to send us an email with the total amount once the probelm was fixed, but 3 days later we are still waiting!",2,2011,11,24
113,1st class Hotel,"My wife and I stayed at the Kensington for three nights in October 2011. It was a wonderful experience.  The staff were most friendly, professional and efficient.  We had visited London in 2008 and stayed the other side of Hyde Park (Sussex Gardens), however the location of the Kensington is much better.  Only a five min walk to the tube and lots of shops nearby in Kensington High street.  Our room was cosy, clean and had all the features that could be expected.  The bar was our afternoon/evening post-sightseeing treat and the lounge a great spot to relax.  I'd be happy to rate the the Kensington 9.5 out of 10 and it would certainly be my first choice on our next visit (hopefully 2013!)",5,2011,11,22
113,A welcome return to The Kensington Hotel,"I had stayed in The Kensington Hotel a few times before, mostly because of the location, which is my favourite area of London, and the Irish connection, turning a blind eye to the dated, overly-priced but clean surroundings. Since, I have stayed in other hotels mostly in Marylebone and Holborn, but I stayed there in late June and am so glad I gave it another turn. Looooove the new look of the place and loved my stay; from the welcoming and efficient staff on arrival, the surprisingly fabulous superior room and bathroom with turndown service, the still excellent location and the many great eateries around the corner on Old Brompton Road especially the Italian and the Scandanavian (Madsen) restaurants. Oh, and we met some rockstars staying there that were playing Hyde Park that weekend!! I am due a return trip to London early New Year and it will be my first choice.",5,2011,11,20
113,Nice weekend away to London,"I stayed at the hotel for a weekend with my wife 
It was is in a central and interesting part of London  easily accessible to airport and central London via the Tube. 
I found the staff pleasant especially the night ported who had a cup of coffee waiting for us at a 5 am check out. Who had also call the car service to make sure that they would be there on time. 
The hotel itself is surrounded by reasonably priced restaurants and pubs",5,2011,11,14
113,Very happy we picked The Kensington for a week in London!,"After weeks of research, I selected The Kensington for a first time in London stay. We arrived on November 4th after an overnight flight and from the minute we stepped aboard it was clear we made a perfect pick. Great check-in (early), clean rooms, filling hot breakfast, attentive and competent service. Only a block to the South Ken Tube station where you can get one of three lines around the city. We used the Tube the entire time on a 7 day TravelCard, even from/to Heathrow (and we are a couple of 50 year olds who advise anyone to skip the expensive taxis and go Tube!) Free wifi and expresso in rooms along with twice daily turn down. Yep - this was good living! 

In selecting the hotel, I was looking for some great ""English ambiance"", i.e. I don't want to fly 4,000 miles to stay in a hotel that looks like a million other hotels in any big city worldwide. The Kensington has that ""pinch me I am in London"" feel  - lots of cozy fireplace nooks and a warm and inviting breakfast space. My husband and I ate one night at the on site restaurant, Aubrey, enjoying a wonderful meal and a nice bottle of wine in a candlelit room. There are quite a few smaller, neighborhood places within a block or two - lots of choices there. 

Our room was not huge, but comfortable and well appointed. Bathroom clean and spacious (I am nuts about a clean hotel bathroom and no complaints.) I read one review before I left that said the room was noisy as it was located near or on top of an adjacent club. I think we may have had that same room and I have to say we didn't hear a peep. True story - one night as we returned to the hotel we saw the club doors open for business and my husband had no idea we had been sleeping right on top of it for the past 6 nights. Never heard it. The window has the old panes, but then a ""storm window"" (I know Americans know what that is) which kept out the noise. 

I have never saluted an employee of any hotel by name before in a TripAdvisor review, but Martyn at the Concierge desk deserves it. Martyn did a great job! We had never been to London and he was so helpful - gracious and accomodating. I never got the feel we were being steered to the tourist traps that are sometimes the ""push"" spots of other hotel concierge desks. 

Honestly - this was a special birthday trip so I was willing to spend a bit on a room. London is a freaky-expensive city - probably more so since our American dollars don't seem to go as far as they used to. However,  I think the Kensington delivered on all counts and made the experience worth every cent.",5,2011,11,14
113,Second time around was great,"We first stayed at this hotel in July when we chose the location as convenient to get to Wimbledon for the lawn tennis championships. The hotel is an easy walk from South Kensington station and there are plenty of restaurants, coffee shops and a couple of convenience stores including a lovely little Waitrose. We had a standard room which was fine, nothing to complain about except the bathroom which was very strangely up a flight of steps. This was not the best place to access the facilities and proved to be a real nuisance. We did not receive a turndown service and all in all it was a very disappointing stay. I contacted the hotel and explained how let down we were after expecting such high standards and their customer service was excellent. After several emails I was offered a complimentary up-grade on my next stay which was in September. We took the leisurely London rate which included breakfast and a ¬£15 credit for food or beverage. Our room was much better this time, we had a junior suite with a 4 poster bed, the room was large and well furnished and we had complimentary water and a fruit plate. The bathroom was huge with his and hers sinks, a bath tub with tv and a walk in shower. When we returned in the evening we had rose petals all over the bed which looked very pretty, a flask of iced mango tea and some cakes. We had breakfast at the hotel which was a bit ordinary and the service was slow but there was plenty to eat but I thought the restaurant was very dull. Whilst I would recommend this hotel for it's location I would say it is slightly pretentious and I have stayed in better hotels in London for the price. I would however commend their after care customer service so thank you to Anstis for all your help.",4,2011,11,14
113,ADORED this hotel and it's location!,"My partner and I came to Brighton for (her) work and decided to spend a couple of days in London...first time for both of us. Everyone told us that we should stay in South Kensington...and boy were they right! We loved this hotel - the location, the bar, the room, the delightful bath products....couldn't have been better unless we could have extended our stay! Go to the Hummingbird Bakery and pick up a treat, and if you like Indian, please hit the Indian restaurant right by Kensington station (5 minute walk) - best Indian I've EVER had.
Enjoy this wonderful spot!",5,2011,11,13
113,"good value, not sure about 5-star rating","the hotel boasts a 5-star rating, but was closer in overall quality to the 4-star standard for London.  However, as the price was also closer to that for a 4-star property, many people may still feel it is good value.  The hotel is very well renovated and well furnished, but the rooms are quite small, on a par with 3-star hotels in terms of size, and someone who doesn't want to compromise may be disappointed.  Like any property on a main road, expect noise if you want to sleep with the window open, however, it is definitely well located for those people who appreciate this part of London.  The staff were generally helpful and polite and there were no unexpected charges on checking out.",3,2011,11,10
113,Beautiful Kensington Hotel,"This is a beautiful area of London, I always prefer to stay outside the city centre as it is too touristy and overcrowded. It is extremely well connected though as most places in London are. Fabulous restaurants and bakeries and beautiful Kensington shops. I recommend Rocca (the italian round the corner) and having a drink in the hotel bar, the cocktails are great and it is so relaxing to sit in the sumptuous sofas. 

The hotel in itself is in a prime position, and the lobby and bar areas are gorgeous. The rooms aren't big, quite small but it is London so I wasn't expecting anything else. Space is used wisely though and you get a very comfortable big bed which is great. The space in the bathroom is used greatly too so all in all a comfortable room and lovely decor. Great big flat screen too. We had a lovely view over old brompton road which was just lovely.
Breakfast was great, the breakfast room is gorgeous and there was so much choice, go for the whole hog if you can as the cooked breakfasts are great.

The only criticism I would have is that the rooms aren't exactly sound proofed and it can be quite noisy, the TV from the next room could be heard quite loudly. And that compared to other hotels, when asking for hangers it took ages. We did have an incident at break fast where we were told that we didn't have breakfast included in quite an insistent manner, when clearly we knew we did and the staff at reception had told us that as well so that was just a little annoying. Other than that though, no major issues.

Staff were lovely and friendly too which is always great. 

All in all a great stay and would definitely recommend it!",4,2011,11,01
113,Below average,"Few weeks ago i stayed in this hotel over weekend.
At check in i was given a room where air condition couldn't be turned off, it was blowing constantly and i realized i would not be able to have a good night sleep with this constant noise.
I called the reception, told them that because of the noise i would like to change the room. There were two more rooms available in hotel, i picked one.
Second room was similar but without noise. It had some other issues.
1. Refrigerator was constantly working and because i could not turned it off or disconnect it from electricity (build into the closet). I noticed that shelf above refrigerator and all closet was very hot, it was obviously overheating. When i went for dinner i asked at the reception to check this, they did nothing.
2. If you take a look at pictures* i attached, you will see how ""clean"" and old was the bathroom, shower if im more precise. They say hotel was renovated recently, looking at this i would say they picked very poor materials.

Bed was very comfortable and breakfast was very tasteful with wide selection of different dishes.

Room rate was 225 GBP without breakfast (25 GBP).

I would not recommend this hotel. For 250 GBP you can find many other choices.

*Sorry for bad picture quality, they were taken with my phone.",3,2011,10,26
113,wonderful,"My wife and I stayed at the Kensington in late September and absolutely loved it.  Convenient location a couple of blocks from the tube in a very nice area.  The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful too.

The one drawback was our room was small for a superior and the bathroom was tiny.  However, it's not like we hung out there during the day so it wasn't too big of a deal.  The lobby area has two large and very nice lounge areas where one could could relax as well.  There are a number of good restaurants within easy walking distance.

Perhaps the best part was the bar.  There are two great bartenders there from Italy--Alissandro and Michel.  Not only was their mixology top-notch, but they were just great to visit with as they worked.  Both were extremely professional and funny as well.  We had a couple of drinks with them every evening before turning in and they were a highlight of the hotel.  If I lived in the neighborhood--I would probably come by the bar a couple times a week.

All in all it was a great stay.  We look forward to coming back.",4,2011,10,07
113,Business Trip - 1 night stay,"I always stay at the Kensington, however this time I was in one of the suites, room 123,  which was a fabulous expereince. As always the service and food was excellent and the staff go out of their way to ensure that every detail is catered for in terms of service.",5,2011,10,07
113,Really very good,"I have just returned to Singapore after staying for 3 weeks here on business in September.

This was my first time staying at The Kensington. It is usually fully booked when I come to London and therefore I have to stay at the Jumeriah on Lowndes Street in Knightsbridge.

The rooms are really quite spacious by London standards in my view (I was staying in an Executive type room on an upper floor), and the entire hotel has been newly renovated. The bathrooms in particular are very large, with heated floors and good quality toiletries. There was a bath and a seperate ""raindrop"" shower cubicle.

The bed is really very comfortable and the TV has a large selection of channels on offer.

The laundry service is quick and very well priced. I don't think I have ever stayed in a hotel that offered such cheap laundry and dry cleaning. In addition, there is free wi-fi (well, it was for me, so I assume that it is for everyone), which is a nice touch.

One issue I had is that the room service menu is somewhat thin. As I was working in the office until gone 11pm for quite a few nights, to come back to the room and find that the only items on offer are cold and warm sandwiches or a bowl of chilli and rice didnt exactly inspire me all that much. I appreciate they can't have a chef on standby 24 hours a day, but I would have thought they could have a little more variety of hot dishes.

Service is generally excellent throughout the hotel, from reception to housekeeping, from porters to waiters. They were all very friendly, and seemed to actually have good memories, which isn't something I find too many hotels are that good at.

The location is also very good with a wide selection of bars and restaurants around the hotel (not that I got to go to many of them given my work schedule), and the proximity to South Kensington tube was also a bonus.

In addition to the poor room service menu there are a few other gripes:

The keycards are pretty useless. I often went up to my room and inserted the card, only for it to be rejected. This happened about 7 or 8 times in total over the three weeks, which was irritating to say the least. I eventually ended up just getting it rechecked at the front desk before heading upstairs.

Second, I was in room 504 and the shower just didnt drain properly. I dont take long showers, but when I finished the floor was at least an inch deep, meaning if you opened the door to the shower, it just flooded the bathroom (all teh way to teh main room carpet). I mentioned this a few times to the front desk, but there was enver an improvement.

Overall though this is a great littel hotel and the bad is much outweighed by the good.

Recommended.",4,2011,10,07
113,Definitely my favorite hotel!,"This has been my 4th stay at the Kensington Hotel and in the meantime it feels almost like home from home! No other hotel in any other big city like Paris or New York in this price category in which I have stayed has matched up to it so far!

It is small enough to still be personal, it is beautifully decorated, the beds are comfortable and the location is perfect. If you are looking for a real small gem in London, then this is the place to stay.

I will definitely return to the Kensington Hotel next time I visit my son in London!",5,2011,10,04
113,A Little Gem In LOndon,"Having been in London a few times and generally finding the quality of the hotels to their ratings not matching. This hotel is a must to stay in London.

Situated in Sth Kensington the moment my wife and i saw the hotel we knew we would not be disappointed. The service from reception was great and the staff could not do enough for us.

The rooms are of good quality and the showers were great.

Breakfast was everything you could ask for with a lot to choose from.

The decor of the hotel was great.

The hotel is located a short walk from Sth Kensington station and is a short ride into downtown London. Great little restaurants around.

This hotel is a definite if you want quality at a an affordable price.",5,2011,10,03
113,Gorgeous Hotel,"Excellent service, great food and beautiful rooms.  The Kensington Hotel is in a great location, with easy access to some of London's best shopping and some great restaurants.  The front desk, concierge and restaurant staff are extremely efficient, professional and friendly.  The rooms are luxurious and comfortable with great beds.  I highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a highly-personalized, luxurious experience in London - perfect for leisure or business.  The free wi-fi works perfectly throughout the hotel.",5,2011,09,26
113,Pretty good all round but pricey,"I stayed here for one night on business but it definitely didn't feel like a staid corporate business hotel.  Location was excellent, check-in fast and friendly and I really liked the decor in the public areas.  The room itself was fine but a bit small; definitely a city hotel sized room.  The view out the front was nice and there was no issue with noise.  Bathroom was fine, modern and clean and a big plus for me was the excellent proper full-size hairdryer.  

It was only on checkout when I heard another guest ask about the gym that I realised there was one there, so I can't report on that.  A lovely touch on check-out was the offer of a bottle of water and an apple for my onward trip. 

All of this seemed to come at a price though; the rate negotiated by my employer seemed to me to be pretty steep and while I enjoyed my stay I'm not sure I could justify the full price if I was looking for a London hotel for pleasure.",4,2011,09,21
113,Dissapointing in some ways,"I recently spent one night at the recently-revamped Kensington Hotel (formerly the Jurys Kensington Hotel) in London. While the hotel has some pluses, I was let down in a number of ways, to the point where I'll be unlikely to return, particularly for business travel.

Pros: Fantastic location - easy walking distance to both South Kensington and Gloucester Road tube stations, museum row (V&A, Science Museum, etc), Hyde Park, and a dazzling array of restaurants/cafes/bars/shops. Some of the renovations have been executed quite well (nice lobby and bar areas, a staggering number of channels on the big flat-screen TV in the room, comfy bed, great shower). 

Cons: I stayed in the ""superior"" category room, which is either the lowest or second-lowest category (not sure which). Unlike every other 4 and 5 star hotel I've stayed in, only a ""small minority"" (manager's words) of rooms in this category actually have a desk! I suppose that's alright if you're visiting purely for leisure. But I booked this hotel through my company's corporate travel website, expressly for business travel, and was kind of shocked to discover that the first room I was offered had no desk. In 2011 I don't really consider this to be a special amenity, for any class of room at a 4 or 5-star hotel. When I returned to the front desk to request a different room, the front desk person seemed kind of put off that I was disappointed with the first room offered. After first informing me that she didn't have any rooms in my category with a desk, she offered me an upgrade to a ""deluxe"" room at a full rate. Under the circumstances, I would've expected at least a discount, if not a complimentary upgrade, since they were unable to accomodate a basic request within my category. After I declined that, the manager then appeared and magically found me a room in my category with a desk. Altogether, it was more complicated than it should've been.

Also, while some of the renovation work was nice, it felt incomplete. Many parts of the hotel and room still felt surprisingly dusty and outdated. This included the ""lounge"" part of the lobby, and many of the details in the rooms (for instance, mouldings with chipped paint, unadorned room with no artwork on the wall, etc). And in another blow to the business traveller, the in-room wi-fi, while complimentary, was slow at best and shaky at worst (I lost my connection at one point and couldn't get it back for over an hour). 

Lastly, for reasons that are unclear to me, when I went down to the bar to have a drink at 11:30 on a Saturday night (prime time, I would've thought), they had implemented this complicated system where I wasn't allowed to actually drink in the bar, but rather ordered in the bar, and then had to sit out in the lounge area of the lobby and have my drink brought to me there. Why couldn't I just sit in the bar if they were still serving?

Still, this hotel has some good things going for it, and I have had good experiences with the Doyle group generally (see my review of The Marylebone Hotel). But I'm afraid this hotel is not really set up business travelers, so unless I am passing through London on holiday, or can reliably get a desk with no addiditonal charge, I probably won't be back.",3,2011,09,20
113,Cozy boutique hotel in Kensington,"The Kensington Hotel is optimally located (in Kensington, a 7 minute walk from Hyde Park, around the corner from lots of restaurants) and is very quiet at the same time. The decor, especially in the lounge area, is beautiful, the service excellent, with cozy (i.e. small) rooms. The staff are very friendly and make you feel very welcome. They have a very nice and big gym as well. Breakfast is good and at GBP 15 for a buffet breakfast and GBP 20 for a cooked breakfast is expensive but reasonable for the standard of the hotel. I have stayed there a couple of times for business and look forward to my next stay next week.",5,2011,09,17
113,Simplicity with style in the heart of South Ken...,"I have been a fan of a number of hotels by the Doyle group but this one wins hands down.  It is such a well designed and fitted out hotel that it makes you feel at home, and it's within breathing distance to London shopping, parks and museums.  I really don't want to leave the hotel when I'm there.
The staff are great, the common areas are plentyful, the bar and the restaurant are of great quality.  Having breakfast is soothing and always makes me feel great for the rest of the day. Oh and there's a well fitted out gym for guests only.
I've stayed there three times over the past 6 months and the room sizes have varied but the standard of decor and cleanliness hasn't.
I will be using this hotel as my London base for all my business and leisure trips with my family in the future.",5,2011,09,14
113,Great Hotel and Great Staff,"Stayed here for the fist time last weekend.  Had a great experience.   Garreth Walsh the GM who has a great team working for him.   They made our experience so good  by making us feel so welcome.   The staff could not do enough to help.  The hotel is in a great location, very convenient.",5,2011,09,10
113,"Great hotel in a fantastic location, go ahead and treat yourself!","We had the pleasure of staying at The Kensington Hotel over the bank holiday weekend. The hotel has a lovely, very exclusive, townhouse feel, with many plush decorative features.

Our room was a junior suite and was extremely spacious indeed. The bed was super comfy. The only (small) let-downs in the room was the lack of an iron and ironing board, and the age-old problem of the hotel shower that leaks.

Service in the hotel was second to none. Breakfast was a continental buffet affair with plenty of delicious breads, pastries and cereals on offer. Hot items were available at an extra cost and were served swiftly, our egg dishes were cooked to perfection. We dined at the hotel one evening, and despite the restuarant being extremely quiet (at one point we were the only diners!), we did not feel self-concious and the waiting staff were very discreet. Our meals were both delicious and I would recommend taking the opportunity to dine here.

Probably the best aspect of the hotel, for us, was the bar/lounge. The atmopshere was very relaxing and the huge velvet settees so comfortable to sink in to. Again, service was fantastic with staff remembering what you'd ordered the night before, and a special mention goes to Alessandro who took the time to mix me a special cocktail according to my preferences (ok, so the cocktails cost ¬£12.50 each but it was a treat!).

After being so positive about the hotel, I do have to balance this out by saying that we were disturbed by noise from the next door private members club, music that played all night and didn't stop til 6am in the morning. However, reception staff were apologetic and said that if we'd called them during the night then they'd have attended to the sound problems.

Overall, this is a great hotel in a fantastic location, go ahead and treat yourself!",4,2011,09,05
113,Great value for a great location in London,"Given the hotel price levels in London, I was quite pleased to find the Kensington.  Not only is it a classy hotel, it is also located in a charming neighborhood.  My standard double room was rather small, but I suppose that is to be expected of London.
The breakfast was adequate, albeit rather pricey.  What I like the most was the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff.  They are always gracious and ready to help you.  It made my stay all the more pleasant.",4,2011,09,01
113,"Lovely hotel, great location, excellent service.","Stayed here for one night with my husband. Loved the location. Bedroom, although small, was spotlessly clean and well equipped. Staff were courteous and extremely helpful. Although we didn't eat in the restaurant it looked lovely and the menu sounded delicious. We would definitely come back again when we needed a place to stay in 
London. 

The only draw back is having to pay ¬£4.00 an hour to park the car near to the hotel.",5,2011,08,30
113,The best place we've stayed in London,"We stayed four days at the ""LEISURELY LONDON"" rate (includes full breakfast.
Staff were very helpfull and resolved a minor issue quickly without fuss.
Breakfast is excellent and large enough to last you till evening meal.
Great location - a short walk to South Kensington Tube.
Bike rentals right out front of the hotel.
Highly recommended.",5,2011,08,26
113,Great Hotel in a wonderful (non touristy) part of London,"My husband and I stayed at the Kensington with our 3 year old daughter from August 19th to August 23.  What a great hotel.  Understanding that London is an old city and many of the buildings are historical and they are limited with what renovations they can do - the room is small by American standards but more than comfortable.  We had a superior room with continental breakfast.  Our room was equipped with a King Bed and there was enough room to set up a twin size cot for my daughter.  There was a full closet, table and chairs.  Bathroom was small but efficient - heated tiles were a nice touch.  
Housekeeping was wonderful, they quickly exchanged a baby cot for a regular when we realized our daughter was too tall to fit comfortably - no extra charge.  They also brought us extra towels and ice as requested without much of a wait time.
The front desk staff and doorman were also first class.  They were always helpful and friendly.  The doorman even tagged our stroller for us and kept it in the luggage room.  Whenever anyone saw us approaching the front desk they would automatically go and get the stroller.  
The continental breakfast does not change much - variety of about 6 juices, coffee, tee, 4 types of basic cereal, plain yougurt that you can flavor with a variety of coulis and homemade granola, fresh cheeses, three types of bread, tons of fresh seasonal fruit and coldcuts.  
The south kensington tube station and a number of buses are a short walk down the road from the hotel - the key is to make a left out the door and another left.  You wont miss it.  We used it everyday to visit sites and family.  Highly recommend oyster card - we ended up spening about 20GBP each for our trip.
There are tons of restaurants to choose from - we were never disappointed with our dinner choice.  There is Thai, Indian, Moroccan, lots of Italian and one really good Pub on the way to the  tube.

Great hotel with wonderful staff and well kept spaces.",5,2011,08,23
113,Nearly Perfect Stay in Beautiful South Kensington,"I stayed at the Kensington Hotel for 5 nights at the end of June/beginning of July 2011. I booked a regular room, which although small and with no view, was well-appointed. The hotel itself is regal, well-groomed, and the staff are friendly, courteous, and considerate. The beds are extraordinarily comfortable, as were the robes, slippers, and other small touches such as the luxurious toiletries. There was a tasteful turn down service each night, as well. Plug-ins were located in useful places, so you could easily located and use them. These details make a difference!

The only thing missing was consistent housekeeping service (replacing used amenities was often overlooked- I went several days in a row with no refreshing of the coffee/tea-making facilities, as an example) and perhaps a more considerate eye to which furniture units functioned in the space (closet door not opening all the way due to it's proximity to the bed).

The location is excellent - take the tube straight from Heathrow to South Kensington, and the hotel is a 5 minute walk from the station. The station itself is easy to haul luggage around, too, as it's fairly close to the street level. The neighborhood is lovely and one I'd love to stay in again when I'm next in London.

Downsides (of which there were very few): The guest room doors don't shut quietly. I am a light sleeper, so this may not bother most people, but the sounds of the adjacent hotel rooms slammed shut rather than shutting gently, and I was jolted awake multiple times during my stay at very early morning hours from this. There was a hole in the ceiling by the entrance to my room with a bizarre buzzing noise emitting from it. After notifying the front desk during the morning, I found it had been repaired when I returned that evening, only for the buzzing to return later during my stay. My guess is that it was probably related to the air conditioning unit, and not something most people would experience at the hotel.

All in all, I would absolutely recommend this hotel! It's a gem in London!",4,2011,08,22
113,"Nice hotel, lovely neighborhood, good location.","We enjoyed our stay here and it was a beautiful hotel, albeit small. Staff were helpful and nice. It was close to good dining and the tube stop but in a nice neighborhood. The room and bathroom were lovely and modern and very clean. We were in the family room which doubles as the wheelchair room. This is fine but no bath tub. That's no problem but the drain didn't work well, so the bathroom easily flooded. The common areas were pretty and well appointed. I'd stay again, it was very nice.",4,2011,08,21
113,We'll be back!,"Our family of four (with 8- and 10-year old kids) from San Francisco loved this hotel for our 9-day stay!  They were accommodating to us even before we got there -- through emails -- to set up two inter-connecting rooms our own mini hallway (adjoining rooms are not easy to find in London), away from the elevator and they added a free rollaway bed).  They also helped arrange tour guides, car services for business, laundry service, and dinner reservations (Bumpkin around the corner with local, organic farm-fresh food was recommended and we went twice).  Alex and Ward, at the Consierge Desk, were fabulous ‚Äì and Ansis made sure we had everything we needed during our stay.  It was by far the best hotel staff we‚Äôve encountered on our many travels!

We loved the neighborhood and assortment of restaurants and street vendors, coffee, Tube Station, great little grocery store 50 feet away, and the staff always hailed cabs rain or shine.  Ice cream shop down one of the little streets to the left as you walk toward the Tube.  We could walk to Kensington Palace and museums and the park and it was just a quick cab to Harrods.

The rooms are nice and decent size for London (no tubs in our room if that‚Äôs important to you).  We also enjoyed the wonderful sitting rooms!  They were beautiful and comfy and perfect for reading and tea after running around touring.  And the Continental Breakfast was always easy and good and made it so simple when traveling with kids.  We met many friendly guests and the staff was always super!  The also-comfy bar has a master mixologist and made it a nice end of the day for me and my husband (we tried a couple of his amazing concoctions!)  We had dinner in the restaurant one night and it was also wonderful.

The kids said it was their favorite hotel.  We will absolutely be back!",5,2011,08,12
113,"Overall, an excellent hotel.","We stayed at this lovely hotel for 5 days.  The front desk was extremely helpful to us throughout our stay.  They were kind enough to give us a room earlier than normal check-in as we arrived early from our transatlantic flight, and we were exhausted.  The room they offered to us as a courtesy (as the one we reserved was not yet available) was on a smoking floor, which we normally would avoid.   We went to the room to see if it passed the sniff test, there was not a whiff of smoke to be discerned by my very picky nose.  We were grateful for their consideration.  The room was of an adequate size, and the bed was extraordinarily comfortable.  There was one comfy chair in the room.  The flatscreen and the WIFI functioned perfectly.  The bathroom was spotless.  My husband was disconcerted that there was no desk or table in the room that could be used for computer work, and we found that inconvenient.  Otherwise, we felt the service was of the highest quality, the room was very comfortable, and the location was superb.  Many charming restaurants in the area.  A short walk to Kensington Gardens and to the tube.   We are happy to recommend this hotel.",5,2011,08,09

113,avoid,"The hotel is amazing, i arrived Thursday mid morning and was helped inside and greeted and check in with no problems, the room was nice if a little small, everything was great. Until the evening at around 11.30 there was a low thump, this thumping noise get louder all night and it finally stopped at 4am. Friday was a right off for my meetings and then i was looking forward to a great weekend but again Friday and Saturday night the same thing thumping low noise all night like a construction site. And the reason is beacause in the basement is a massive night club with an enterance around the corner which is not mentioned by anyone working there as ""its not part of the hotel"" 
But the actual hotel itself is great, the staff are wonderful and service is excellant, but the noise is awful.",1,2011,08,05
113,Excellent Boutique Hotel,"Spent a week here and really loved it.  Clean, recemtly refurbished hotel less than 10 minutes from the S. Kensington Underground (Subway), and easy walking distance from the major London museums.  Staff is uniformly friendly and helpful.  We had a problem with our original room and were immediately switched to another.  Only negatives were the small rooms and minimal drawer space. Linens, however were excellent.  We worked with concierge, Ward G., for a few weeks before arriving to schedule some dining and theatre outings.  If I visited again, I'd request a room not so close to the elevator, since it could be a bit noisy.  Happy to recommend this hotel.",4,2011,08,02
113,An excellent property and staff,"Stayed the weekend and it's a perfect central location for getting to either end of town, walk to South Ken tube.  The interior is very modern and well updated. A small issue with the sink was fixed immediately. All staff, especially the front desk were very helpful, even with special (read P.I.T.A.) requests.  It has a very nice gym too, open 24/7.",5,2011,07,31
113,The whole family loved it!,"My two children, teen and tween, loved the location of this hotel, situated two blocks from two different tube stations. We could walk, train or bus to everything. Rooms were on the smaller size but my kids loved that they got the bigger room (accidentally).
Service was excellent. Clean and accommodating! We would definitely go back!",5,2011,07,28
113,"Great Staff, Beautiful Setting","The Kensington Hotel captures old London style with a modern polish.

The check-in process was a delight because:
1. Our party was greeted with three smiling faces behind the desk, eager to help. Ilaria  our check-in agent was particularly lovely.
2. We were offered refreshing towels to clean our faces after the transcontinental flight
3. Our room was ready prior to the official check-in

The room itself was very luxurious and functional. I really enjoyed the heated bathroom floor (yes, it was nice during this brisk London summer).

Also, everybody should stop by the hotel bar for a drink or a conversation with the bar tender. He always offers guests a great tasting libation or a friendly conversation.

I hope others get to enjoy this great London hotel!!!",5,2011,07,27
113,"Nice, inviting, but I was expecting a bit more.","In general, this is a nice property, particularly the lobby. But the rooms were showing signs of wear, and although very spacious, were a bit disappointing. My biggest complaint was service, however. We had a few people there who were wonderful, but probably 3/4 of the staff were indifferent or even rude. Alessandro the bartender was amazing, and the bellman who helped us at the end of the trip was also fantastic (I wish I had learned his name). 
For some reason, housekeeping seemed to think only one person was staying in our room. After the first night, one robe and one set of slippers were removed, the very lovely evening tea and sweets were only for one, one set of towels (which we called to remedy), etc. 
Great Internet service. This would probably be a better business than vacation hotel.
The location is wonderful, and we probably would stay here again. It just wasn't as nice as I had hoped it would be.",4,2011,07,27
113,Easy to recommend,"Great location - plenty of restaurants and a pleasant area with good underground connections.

Just make sure you get a nice room.  Initially I was given a pretty poor one (small, stained carpet, dark, stuffy) but spoke to the manager and changed for a much better one.  As with many hotels, I don't understand why they don't give you the best available room initially.

Good service, pleasant staff.  Would stay here again.",4,2011,07,27
113,Great service,"The service was great , staff was super courteous very efficient and  helpful (especially Rizwan at the reception who bent backward to assist us during our early morning check out) . We were a bit concerned since we had 6 children with us given it's a boutique hotel but i have to admit we didn't feel we were a nuisance at any time . 
The food was of very good quality but the breakfast buffet could have more variety .
The location is excellent for those who wish to do some sightseeing being so close to a couple of undergrounds and walking distance to a number of museums .A bit out of the way for shopping though.
Around the corner there's a number of good restaurants and some convenience stores which is always a plus .
The deluxe rooms are a bit small but by London standard they are adequate , the suites and family suites are perfect .
Couple of things that seperate it from being a perfect  hotel are the towels-some are a bit old - and in some rooms the carpets are slightly stained but overall acceptable .
We would definitely stay there again .",4,2011,07,22
113,Plush hotel with character and style,"Very nice hotel in good location, 3 minutes walk from South Ken tube. Seveal good restaurants on the doorstep. Room was well appointed with comfy bed and quality linen and toiletries. It was on the small side. Service was generally good apart from a few language issues with staff who struggled with requests for a specific drink and a breakfast order, their English seemed to be very limited. Would use the hotel again.",4,2011,07,22
113,Nice stay,"Nice hotel convenient to South Kensington station.  Typiclally small rooms, but well appointed.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  My only beef is that the laundry service was a bit pricey, but that's London.",4,2011,07,19

113,Luxurious and wonderful!,"Great hotel in a quiet section of London, but still easy to get to everything.  We walked in with no reservation after walking out of a horrible hotel that we were booked in by Liberty Travel.  The manager and staff at The Kensington were very friendly and accommodating, and constantly went out of their way to make sure our trip was memorable.  The bar and lounges were a great place to unwind after a long day of sightseeing.",5,2011,07,17
113,Stayed in November - and another great experience,"We were so excited to come back to London (once again with one of our daughters) and stay again at the KH.  I don't know if it was because we had just left a cramped, old Parisian hotel but we were so pleased with our rooms and the overall condition of the KH.

Our rooms were charming.  Obviously not spacious (this is London) but with nice, NEW bathrooms.  I was overwhelmed again with the wonderful, polite, efficient wervice.  

The continential breakfast was nice and we again (lushes that we are!) enjoyed the cosy gathering area downstairs for cocktails.  I was so pleased that our stay was aa s nice as the last time.  I'm thinking of staying in other Doyal Hotels when we visit other cities.

P.S.  Internet connections in the rooms!",5,2011,07,17
113,Fabulous hotel in the heart of South Kensington,"I just came back from a 3 day 2 night stay at this wonderful hotel. The staff are extremely pleasant and helpful. The hotel itself is just gorgeous. It recently underwent a huge renovation and the interior is elegant and cosmopolitan. Depending on your room, you may have a complimentary breakfast, which was the best 'free' breakfast I've ever had in all my travels. There was a huge selection of fresh fruit, fruit juices, granola, croissants, different kinds of cheese, yogurt, meat. Very, very enjoyable. After such a huge breakfast, you don't even need to eat lunch! The room was very quaint and pleasant and clean. It was slightly on the small side, but that is normal for UK and Europe. The bathroom was magnificent with heated tiles, rain shower, beautiful white and black marble. The hotel is in a great location, just a 5 min walk to the South Kensington tube and a 15-20 min walk to Harrods. The area around the hotel is peaceful and quiet and devoid of rowdy pubs. There is also free wifi in your room that is very quick. Downstairs, there is a small business area with two Apple computers and a printer to use. 

A very considerate thing the hotel has done is that they have put different electrical plug outlets in the rooms. Therefore, if you have a US appliance that you wish to use, you can just plug it in the wall and not use an adapter and worry about blowing out a fuse!

The only thing that detracted this hotel from receiving 5 stars is the fact that we got charged ¬£6 for a 5 minute phone call. There is nowhere in the room that informs you that you will be charged for making a local phone call. At the end of the stay, that was the only unpleasant surprise at check out. 

Other than that, I was extremely happy with my stay here and would definitely return to this hotel!",4,2011,07,16
113,"Great value, great service!","Didn't know what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised. Rooms are small (it's London) but well appointed. Great ""Rain Shower"" in the bathroom.

113,"Excellent hotel, service faultless","From reception through bar/restaurant and room servicing, faultless.  This hotel is to be recommended for its location and its professionalism.  It meets the needs of both business and pleasure customers, all staff are obviously proud of their jobs and it shines through.  The whole place offers every care and attention to their customers.  We will definitely return.",5,2011,07,15
113,Nice hotel but odd little drawbacks,"The hotel is very impressive, from the lobby onwards, the room was lovely, air-conditioned, quiet (at the back). Nice touches included the turn-down service with chocolates, and the free computer terminals opposite the lifts. However...  on the first night we arrived and I had a shower, only to find that the drain was blocked and the bathroom therefore flooded. (The super-modern showers include no rim at all to prevent any extra water leaking out.) This was after 10pm so although a man came up to clean the bathroom and give us new towels, maintenance were not there to unblock the shower (and therefore we couldn't take a shower) until after breakfast the next morning. All the staff were incredibly polite and friendly about this, but... still. The other rather weird thing was that one night we found a cleaner's cloth IN the bed, under the pillow with my partner's pyjamas.... a little off-putting. We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel as it was rather expensive, but there are lots of little coffee shops nearby - just don't try to find anything too early on a Saturday morning.",3,2011,07,13
113,Understated luxury at its finest,"My wife & I stayed at The Kensington after a friend's recommendation and we were not dissappointed in the slightest. The service was some of the finest we have had the pleasure of experiencing anywhere in the world. 
From a seamless check-in, to the arrival of the luggage, to room service and car parking it was trully A1.
The cocktail bar was full of character but not in the least gawdy, the bar team were helpful amusing and attentive. The location was slightly west of central but ideal for sight seeing, shows and shopping ahhhg!!! (my wife loves it!!)
It was quite clear that the team at the Kensington, whilst being well drilled were a team that had a passion for its clientele, many of whom appeared to be household names and yet they took it all in their stride just as another days work. 
We were made to feel most welcome and very special a quality sadly lacking in most hotels today. 
Is it a childrens hotel? It depends how well disciplined your children are... 
Is it a quality hotel? Most certainly it is. 
Would we stay there again? Without a shadow of a doubt . 
Is it pricey? In truth it depends what you are used to paying. It is good value? when you analyse the location the service and the sheer quality, its very good value. It was a great find and we will be back. 
Thanks and well done to all the team at the Kensington you made our short stay an absolute pleasure and restored our faith in true quality service with a smile.",5,2011,07,12
113,ANNIVERSARY TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT,"We booked to stay at this hotel for A place in the sun show and also our Wedding Anniversary. What a disappointment and the fact it was ruined by the whole experience.

It would not have been all that bad if the hotel had followed up by my Huband's email regarding our Anniversary and the fact they replied back and did nothing at all about it.

Did not find front staff all that friendly to be honest.

I did not know about the email until we arrived in our room and was totally shocked by the size of the room. My Husband told me it had been a surprise he had booked this hotel because of the rewiews and was expecting a far superior service. We always stay at anothr five star hotel and the service there is always excellent and totally above superior and we are made very welcome in every way.

There were no flowers, chocolates, or even a welcome drink to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  In fact the room was that small you really felt closed in. Every time you opened the wardroble door it hit the bed.

I went to reception to complain and was greeted by Andrea Doyle to whom I explained the situation and she aplogized and upgraded us to another room and 2 glasses of sparkling wine arrived with a plate of fruit. The only problem with this was it was only too late. The hotel had received prior notice of this occasion. It was an after thought. My Husband said he was popping out and I knew where he was going but I told him to wait until we arrived back home. The other hotel we stay at always leave's us a bonquet of flowers to take home and he felt very bad this had not happened and wanted me to have some flowers. (We will be going back to the other next year)

The next day we went down to breakfast and this was even worse. The staff here were very unfriendly and when the breakfast arrived it was sent back and yet again Andrea Doyle came to sort this out. We were refunded for the breakfast and she offered us a drink in the bar later on that afternoon when we sat down for a chat with her regarding our entire stay.
We did not enjoy our stay here, as on this occasion we were indeed celebrating our Wedding Anniversary and this went completely wrong. Either of us felt like celebrating as everything went wrong from start to finish.

We forwarded the email to Andrea and their response back to us. She clearly stated that there had been a mistake and a lack of communication between her staff and it should never have happened, but it did and this was a great shame.

We are not sure we will stay here again as did not feel welcome but other trip advisors recommend this hotel and you only speak as you find.

Thank you Andrea.",3,2011,07,10
113,Good - but be careful to book if you travel with children!,"The overall experience at The Kensington was good but I was really disappointed with the way that they have handled our booking.

We are a famliy of 5 (3 small children) and have specifically requested rooms close to one another.
I have confirmed the booking as well as the request twice telephonically.

The initial check-in process took very very long (I really got the impression that something went wrong.......) - and then they gave us rooms on completely different floors!!  
After we have asked them to please change that since we specifically asked for rooms close to one another they gave us rooms at complete opposite sides of the corridor!  Really really far from one another!

After all of that, the only solution that they could offer us is that we have to DOWNGRADE one of the rooms!!!  I find that very unprofessional - it is the first time a hotel expect  customers to downgrade rooms!!!  

I gave the Reception Manager all our documentation and he promised that he will come back to us - but never did!!  We had a second booking with the Hotel but after that experience we cancelled the second booking!!

Maybe my expectation was to high - but I didn't expect that from The Kensington since they are suppose to give exceptional service!!  

I find it really strange that you can expect your customers to downgrade rooms!!  When it was a mistake from the hotel!

But overall the hotel was good - but maybe this is not a hotel that you should book when travelling with younger children since you are definately not guaranteed rooms close to one another!",3,2011,07,08
113,Fabulous Hotel,We have just returned from a 2 night stay at this fabulous hotel. Everything is clean and fresh - the beds and linen are great!

Great location for Kensington attractions and overall a really nice area  to come back to after a hectic day in the City. We loved it! Thanks Lynn A.,5,2011,07,05
113,"Great Location, not much else.",The hotel is well located close to museums and a few metro stops to the shopping centre. The room we stayed in was very very small and the bathroom was beginning to look a little dated. Would go back but only if was getting a better deal as wasn't worth the money paid.,3,2011,07,02
113,An Excellent Hotel,"Stayed here for one night.Hotel is in great location close to Museums, shopping in Knightsbridge. Staff were consistently friendly,helpful and professional.I booked online through' Perfect Escapes' which entitled us to a room upgrade,breakfast,4.pm checkout and a free drink at the Bar! I had to ask for all these but there was no problem receiving them.I did not bother with the room upgrade,however the room we had, while perfectly comfortabl, was a bit on the small side so next time i'll go for a larger one.Interior of the hotel is very classy with large sitting areas and a great bar.The late checkout was handy as South Kensington station is only a five minute walk and the Piccadilly line took us straight to Heathrow for our evening flight.Beds were comfortable and hotel is quiet for a central location.Good value for the quality experience. I'd stay here again.",5,2011,06,27
113,LOVED staying here.,"This was a last minute booking following a fantastic, if tiring, road trip around Ireland.  I enjoyed 4 days of The Kensington....a beautiful hotel in my favourite London suburb. Service, food, ambience and price were all great.  A tiny whinge about how early the housekeeping staff knocked on my door each morning ....finally learnt to put up my Do Not Disturb sign though.  If you are tossing up between The Kensington and The Rembrandt......choose the former.  Am planning my next UK trip and it will definitely be The Kensington for me.",5,2011,06,23
113,Outstanding,"Me and my partner stayed in the Kensington for a week for the later part of our England trip. I love this area where a lot of foreign embassies and italian restaurants are located in this area. It is much more residential and we loved it. Located right next to South Kensington tube and V&A/Museum where it is accessible to all areas. We also saw some celebrities around the neighborhood!

We stayed in the deluxe room which is wonderful for two, the bathroom is so big where you can fit in one more bed in there. We are surprise to have so much space in London. Hotel check in was extremely fast, staff is also very helpful. The property was apparently renovated and maintained in a very good shape. It is our favorite English style yet extremely modern and convenient. 

Hotel's breakfast is also very good. Free Wi-Fi is also definitely a plus. 

The only minor I would say is probably the hotel bar downstairs. It is a very popular spot where it gets very crowded during the weekend. Plan to hang out later during the weekend to avoid the noise.",5,2011,06,14
113,An absolutely stunning hotel just completed a 20mil refit.,"If you want to be away from the tac of the west end yet central to some culture and great shopping then this hotel is a must. We stayed in a mini suite which was perfect for our requirements. Fantastic cocktails at good prices (¬£10-¬£15). Staff were excellent, all in all could not find fault.",5,2011,06,11
113,A haven in London,"Had a fantastic 5 days over Easter 2011.  The area at South Ken is a haven from the busy chaos of other more tourist parts of London but close enough to enjoy everything London has to offer.  Tube Station a few minutes walk, Harrods about 20 minutes walk, lots of great bars and restaurants .  The hotel itself is fantastic, rooms comfy and staff very friendly. Breakfast was nice but pricy. If you are a big eater it is worth it but if not walk around the corner to one of the many cafes in the area where you can get a light breakfast for a fraction of the price.  Special thanks to Alexandro in the bar who helped made out stay so much fun.",5,2011,06,07
113,"Comfortable, beautiful and charming","Its so easy to go wrong in London, but the Kensington is beautiful and has very comfortable sleeping quarters.  The parlor is delightful to sit and have a drink in with many comfy couches, fireplaces and tables.  *Love.

Like most places in London, don't expect the restaurant service to be terribly attentive, but all around its a great hotel.

It also has a large and well equipped gym",5,2011,06,04
113,Excellent Hotel,"Very comfortable hotel with a very professional staff and excellent rooms.  Bathroom was great as well with an awesome shower.  There are several elegant lounge rooms on the ground floor where you can relax and have a drink or coffee.  Bar area was nice as well.  The basement had a terrific gym which I used several times and had the place entirely to myself every time.  I bench pressed the entire stack one day  but alas, no one was there to witness it.  Anyway, the location of the hotel is also excellent as there are many good restaurants in the immediate area, the 3 museums close by, Hyde Park a 10 min walk up the street, and the South Kensington tube station just 3 or 4 blocks away.  The neighbourhood is much more calm than most West End locations, so it was a kind of relief to come home here in the evening.  My only regret from our trip here is that I didn't find time to get to the beautiful looking Drayton Arms pub up the street to get plastered on Guinness.",5,2011,05,24
113,Best hotel experience ever - treated like royalty,"My husband won a weekend in London and gave it to me and my daughter, aged 15 to use as a treat.  Included in the prize was a two night stay in the Kensington Hotel, transfers from and to Heathrow and tickets to the London Dungeons.  

I had been to London back in October and stayed at a five star hotel that I won't name here but was very let down by the service.  The staff definitely need to be retrained in customer service!  So I was a little worried about the fact that we weren't 'paying guests' in the Kensington, hoping that this wouldn't make a difference to the service.  I shouldn't have worried a bit.  From the moment we were picked up in Heathrow to the moment we were dropped back there, we were treated like royalty.  Our driver Jay was the nicest man and told us so much about London and the history of the hotel.  He even had my daughter's full attention which is not an easy feat!  

When we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted warmly by the reception staff even though they were busy.  It was only 10am and I assumed we would have to wait to check in to our room but that wasn't the case.  We were given a suite which I wasn't expecting but was delighted to accept and we could used it immediately.  Our bags were brought up by another very nice man who remembered my name every time I passed him that weekend.  

The suite was perfect, good size and fresh flowers.  There was tea/coffee making facilities, but not just any coffee machine - a nespresso machine!  All we were short was George Clooney himself.  In fact, that machine was the only glitch in the whole weekend.  There was a slight problem getting it to work.  So a phone call to reception was made and within ten minutes, we had a visit from another nice man from maintenance and our machine was working perfectly. 

As we had arrived so early we set out to make the most of the beautiful April sun.  I really hadn't checked the location of the hotel and decided to head toward a bus route.  We were pleasantly surprised to find the Natural History Museum around the corner!  So a half hour queue and we were looking at dinosaurs.  By the time we arrived back in the hotel that evening, we were exhausted from shopping and walking.  We decided to order room service.  We both ordered steaks which were cooked to perfection.  The veg were so fresh and delicious.  It was so relaxing.  Oh, forgot to mention the bathroom!  A wonderful free standing bath with plenty of hot water, separate shower, perfect.  

The most wonderful surprise was a knock on our door and we were given a flask of tea, a couple of pastries and a card with the weather forecast for the next day and a little description of the tea.  It was the perfect end to the perfect day.  I drifted off to sleep on the comfortable bed.  

Breakfast was delicious and the variety of choice of juices, pastries and cereals added to our stay.  We had another very busy day of being tourists ending with a wonderful time watching the Lion King show (Go See The Lion King!!!!).  On the second night we were again given a flask of tea but a different flavour.  Just a perfect touch and I really did sleep better.  

On check out we were treated with the same friendliness as we'd come to expect from the staff.  My daughter and I had such a positive experience at this hotel that I cannot wait to go back and share it with my husband.  I cannot say a negative word about it.",5,2011,05,17
113,simply the best,just back from a weekend in the Kensington Hotel. Everything was amazing. we were very happy with the location - its so close to south kensington station and the picadilly line takes you everywhere yet its also very handy for Heathrow. the hotel is really beautiful and the team are friendly and helpful. we did not eat in the hotel but had a great cocktail to start the night in the bar. We did have breakfast and it was one of the best. There is lots of choice but the amounts out are small so everyrging is so fresh. there is a great choice and the eggs benedict was top. All in all one of the better hotels to use as a bast to get around london.,5,2011,05,16
113,a truly great hotel,"I have to say from the moment i entered the hotel it was wonderful. The people and the service was what you expect from a good hotel but not often get it. The bedroom was lovely and my bed was the best thing so comfortable I didnt want to get out. Bathroom a bit small but doesnt need to be big.
Downstairs bar and living room was so relaxing and this is where I am now on free internet while waiting to take the train to the airport.
Will no doubt be back will all my sisters and again on my own for my relaxing weekend. it was just perfect. Thanks",5,2011,05,15
113,Fantastic Hotel with great service,"My wife and I had the privilege of staying at The Kensington Hotel, Doyle Group, 109-113 Queens‚Äô Gate, London SW& 5LR for nine days departing May 7, 2011.  We found the hotel charming, very clean and service oriented.  Our room was a Studio Suite which was large and the bathroom was done in black and white marble with a full size tub, walk in shower, double sink and a bidet and was luxurious.   The bed was very comfortable.  The hotel surprised us with a bouquet of a dozen red roses the first day of our stay.  Every evening we received a thermos of tea and a sweet treat.  The sitting area in the hotel was very pleasant and served quality food which was available throughout the day including a very nice restaurant.  The staff went out of their way to please and to make our stay very pleasant.  The concierge arranged for us to be picked up at the airport and to take us back upon our departure and enabled us to charge it to our room.  There is a safe in the room large enough for a lap top computer.  One day I inadvertently left the safe open and when we returned at the end of the day its contents were intact.
The hotel‚Äôs location is ideal with a short walk to South Kensington Station.  There are a large number of restaurants and services in the area including laundry, grocery stores, banks, money exchange, drug stores, deli, news stand and even a Starbucks.  We felt very comfortable in the area and enjoyed the local pub and several of the restaurants.  The Victoria and Albert Museum, The Museum of Natural History and the Science Museum were all within easy walking distant to the hotel.  
I had done much research on picking the best hotel at the best value and I could not have been happier.  I hope we have an opportunity to return.",5,2011,05,10
113,If you are looking for a fantastic hotel in London - look no further than the Kensington Hotel.,"We had a fantastic trip to London, my husband, 12 year old daughter and I, which was topped by the fact that we stayed at the luxurious Doyle Group Hotel - The Kensington !!
Everything from the welcome, to the friendly staff, the luxurious en-suite room and the wonderfully set out breakfast with a refreshingly different menu, made this long weekend one to remember !!",5,2011,05,10
113,This is a friendly hotel with a comfortable ambience,"We stayed in a deluxe room as previous reviews had criticised the room sizes. This room was spacious and well equipped. In particular the bathroom was impressive. Room was at the rear, so no view, but also no noise!
One small complaint; a ceiling bulb was not working, but this was quickly and pleasantly rectified. The restaurant was excellent, both for dinner and breakfast. The staff were very friendly courteous and attentive. A bit pricey, but worth it. Enjoyed our stay.",4,2011,05,09
113,Terrific Hotel,"I really enjoyed my stay at the Kensington Hotel.  I had a fabulous room - upgraded my room (I forget what the ""second level"" room is called - premium, maybe?). 

I had dinner in the restaurant - the food was top-notch.  

The only negative - the bartender at the lounge was almost absurdly, laughably inattentive.  He was so focused on the only other patron at the bar (both he and the patron spoke Italian) that other staff kept having to remind him that I was also at the bar.",4,2011,05,03
113,"Businesslike, but not worth the cost","Its a brisk, business like hotel, with nothing memorable about it. The Royal Garden Hotel, located close by, is a much better choice. The rooms are REALLY small, so much that you have to literally hop from the bed into the bathroom. Location is excellent, lots of good restaurants nearby but not as close to the tube as you would like it. There is also no major shopping district closeby, and Kensington High Street is a good distance away. At ¬£200 per night, with no breakfast included, it was a raw deal indeed. As I said, nothing to remember it by",4,2011,05,03
113,Lovely hotel at an excellent price,"We stayed at the Kensington for the Easter weekend, and we all found it definitely lovely. It is a very charming boutique hotel, in a nice location at a good price (I mean, this is London) for the service given. 
Rooms all clean and well mantained, soft beds, soft spotless towels, the hotel offers bathrobes, slippers, hot water heater and they even hand you a bottle of water as you check out. They have those fridges that charge you automatically when you pull out the drinks, which I hate, but at least this worked well (usually you get charged when you sneeze too close to the fridge).
Good wireless connection in the rooms, a Mac with printer on the ground floor  (you don't get charged for b/w prints) helps printing your boarding passes. There's always fruit or sweets in the hall.
We occupied 4 rooms, all nicely decorated. Room service and concierge, impeccable.
Note: some rooms and some bathrooms are SMALL. But very nice big showers. 
CONS: they could not offer us adjoining rooms, so we had to leave the kids in a separate room (else we would have needed to book a suite, but did not know) nearby. No big issue for us, but remember to get a suite if you travel with small children. 
We did not have breakfast in the hotel, instead we went to Le Pain Quotidien behind S. Kensington Tube station.",4,2011,04,26
113,Lovely gem,"I arrived at this hotel, straight from Heathrow, at about 7:25 in the morning, expecting to check my luggage and come back later to check in.  I looked (and felt) like a zombie.  They checked me in immediately, showed me where the breakfast room was, and were utterly gracious.  The public areas are beautifully decorated and this was like walking into the inside of a jewelbox.  The only downside is that the room was tiny with absolutely no view - but I really didn't care.  All I wanted was a soft bed, a nice bathoom, and a comfortable place to crash after my overnight flight.  I got all that and more.  I would definitely stay here again, even though it was something of a splurge.",5,2011,04,26
113,Excellent Hotel - Top Class Service,"Stayed here in May 2010 for 3 Nights with my Wife and two Kids. I  could not fault this hotel. Excellent Service, Food and Location. Ideally located for visiting Science and Natural History Museums. Close to transpost links into the center of London",5,2011,04,18
113,"Fantastic place to stay from start to finish, highly recommend it!!!!!","Checked in Friday evening with a young toddler in tow, greeted  at the desk with a warm welcome and was at once put at ease. Lovely comfortable room, tastefully decorated with all the extra touches. Perfect bed added to room for young child and plenty of extra towels etc. Have to say we loved the expresso machine in the room. Staff warm, friendly and refreshing, all meals at hotel were good quality and excellent selection. Location is deal for visiting London with small children and the staff definitely go the extra mile. Turn down in the evenings is fab.......... Highly recommend this London hotel !!!!!",5,2011,04,18
113,"Not stuffy, very pleasent indeed.","From the warm hand flannels on arriving to the bottled water for our journey when leaving, everything was just right. Friendly without being fussy, but also very proffesionally organised. So impressed this would be my first choice on any future visits to London.",5,2011,04,10
113,All around great!,"The hotel staff and service are excellent.  Our room was larger than expected for two beds, but we did upgrade as suggested by the hotel. Well worth the added cost!  The hotel is located just a couple of short blocks away from the So Kensington station - super convenient.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2011,04,07
113,Everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel,"First visit to hotel since 20 million pound transformation from the old Jurys Kensington Hotel.  This hotel is everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel.  From the welcoming reception staff, very helpful concierge and super efficient Duty Manager - nothing was a problem!  Large breakfast room with a very generous and varied breakfast fare.  Dinner in the Aubrey dining room was no less than you expect from a 'Michelin star' supervised kitchen.  The bedroom we had on the 2nd floor was luxurious with super modern bathroomand large flat screen tv.  The cocktail bar and lounge areas were first class and perfect after a day out in London.  The location of the hotel is very convenient for the South Kensington and Gloucester Road tube stations and many local cafes and bistros.",5,2011,04,05
113,Top design Perfect Location,We got off the South Kensington station from the Piccadilly line from Heathrow and walked about 3 blocks to the hotel.  It was the best location.  We never had to take a cab.  The place has been recently remodeled and is absolutely beautiful.  Very subtle but extremely elegant furnishings.  I loved the mohair chair in our room.  I had requested two beds and got a big one.  I did not ask for two because I was with my 18 year old daughter and we felt it was fine.  The only thing is WHO would design a bathroom without an electrical outlet for a dryer????  There was an outlet for a shaver but not for the hair dryer so the cord had to stretch across the hall into the bathroom.  Another little complaint is that I asked for 2 extra bath towels which were delivered immediately but the next day never got another set.  Also no washcloths one day.  The housekeepers should pay a little closer attention to details.  On the day we left I became invisible and could not get a cup of coffee.  The other two days the breakfast was fine but on the last day which we needed to hurry along Murphy's law took over and no coffee.  I think this area is great for tourists because it is safe and its close proximity to everything.,5,2011,04,04
113,Charming and luxurious boutique hotel,"My 23 year-old daughter and I stayed five nights at The Kensington Hotel during a recent trip to London.  We enjoyed the experience and were only somewhat disappointed in the size of the room.  We could barely walk around the queen size bed!  Still, the service was wonderful and the food in the hotel dining room was delicious.  The location was great - within walking distance to great restaurants and two tube stations.  We would definitely return for another stay at this hotel.",4,2011,04,04
113,Plush hotel with nice touches!!,"Hot towel on arrival, modern lobby, amazing large seating area off lobby adorned with beautiful furnishings, elaborate bar, nice restaurant. Very clean. Friendly helpful staff especially the concierges/porters. Room very very small(!!!) too cramped but clean and nice toiletries in rediculously small bathroom (door knocks into toilet in every room I have stayed) didn't deter us from staying repeatedly though! Great area...very close to south Kensington tube and lots if great shops, salons, restaurants and bars. I often travel to London for courses and thus is always my preferred hotel of choice....even if it requires a commute!    ",4,2011,03,31
113,Flawless,"three night stay most enjoyable. Lovely lobby rooms with soft music, fire places (it is still cool at night), unobtrusive staff.
took advantage of three-night special rate for suite 176 pounds plus VAT per night.  Spacious room (particularly for London), nightly turn down service, small but perfectly appointed shower bathroom",5,2011,03,31
113,quaint hotel in a beautiful location,"I took my mother to London for 4 days to celebrate her birthday. I chose The Kensington Hotel based on price 145 pounds and location (close to Kensington Gardens, the Underground and good restaurants). The hotel was recently beautifully rennovated. The lobby and bar is cozy and well designed, a nice palce to have tea or a cocktail or sit next to the fire and read a book. The only negative is that the rooms are very small, but this wasn't a issue for us since we spent most of our time outside of the hotel.",4,2011,03,24
113,Good deal for a comfortable stay,"Needed to stay in west London for business for 4 days, and after searching for  hours online for a hotel that was reasonably priced (I work for a small start-up) and didn't sound scary in the reviews, I was lucky to find the Kensington Hotel.  The room was excellent (I opted for the small junior suite since there was promotional deal if you were staying a few nights) and staff attentive and always happy to help with directions and all my needs.  The bathroom as spotless.  Accepting that you can spend a lot of money for a bad hotel as easily as a good one in London, I was happy that I wasn't disappointed.

The hotel has a great location, halfway between the Glouchester Rd and South Kensington Stations.  Plenty of restaurants in the neighborhood surrounding the hotel, and plenty of small and trendy shops in South Kensington and Chelsea.  I was able to walk to the Victoria & Albert  Museum, the Natural History Museum, and the National Army Museum, as well as a long pleasant walk to the Tate Museum.",5,2011,03,21
113,Exceptional Staff,"This is a really lovely hotel with very friendly, professional and helpful staff. There was a wonderful atmosphere of calm and a gorgeous smell that reminded me of being in a spa. Our room was spotlessly clean but a little on the small side with the end of the bed being very close to the wall. The shower was lovely as were the bathroom goodies which smelt delicious. Just 3 quibbles:- when we had just settled in to our room there was a knock and 2 other guests were being shown into our room, the pillows were rock hard  and the mini bar didn't open. Other than that it was excellent. Breakfast was a real treat with lots of choice and it was a nice touch to be given bottles of water when we checked out. I would like to stay at this hotel again. The position is ideal and very close to the tube at South Kensington.",4,2011,03,21
113,The perfect hotel to stay for business or pleasure,"I have stayed at the Kensington Hotel Serveral times but only now getting round to writing a review. For me as a woman traveling a lot I have become fussy in my old age. The Kensington is one london's hidden gems with professional friendly service from the moment you arrive to amazing rooms. I could go on and on about how good the Doyle Burger is but let's just say amazing. The hotel has a lovely gym but as it's a short run to Hyde park you should opt to take a jog through there if you have time. Over the last few trips to the Kensington Hotel I have visited Knightsbridge for the shops for late night shopping on a Thursday, Knightbridge is a short walk past The V&A and The Natural History Museam? All which are a stones throw from the hotel. The Albert Hall is also very close so if you are looking for comfort service and a central hotel this is the one to stay in what can I say I'm Irish and The Doyle Collection is an Irish Brand. If you are visiting on business or pleasure I think you go a long way to find as nice a hotel.",5,2011,03,15
113,Really lovely.,"I stayed there last week for one night,and having stayed there several times over recent years was delighted to find that their high standarts never waiver.You are greeted by most welcoming staff and shown to an elegant and spotless room.Whilst it is a large hotel it feels intimate and It is an oasis of calm in an exciting and vibrant city.",5,2011,03,12
113,Great Boutique Hotel in beautiful Kensington.,"I've just returned from a four night stay at The Kensington Hotel.  From the moment I walked through the doors in the lobby I knew I had found something really special.  My very first impression was how wonderful the lobby smelled.  Sounds crazy, but it was an excellent example of the hotel's attention to detail.  I was greeted warmly by the staff at the front desk.  Everyone we dealt with during our stay couldn't have been more friendly and helpful.  Everything in this hotel has been recently updated and they didn't miss a single detail.  The rooms are beautifully decorated and very comfortable-including well appointed bathrooms and very comfortable beds.  One of the best things, though, had to be the location.  It was my first time in London and choosing a neighborhood was very difficult.  Kensington is like an oasis in the heart of London away from all of the crazy crowds.  It's just quiet enough with some wonderful little cafes and bistros nearby (including an honest to goodness English Pub!).  The underground is just a five minute walk from the hotel and is on the main line for all of the important attractions which are within a few stops.    This hotel is such a homerun on every level.  Oh yeah-and there was free wifi!",5,2011,03,09
113,Peace and style - would go again,"Hi,

It has been said in the earlier reviews, beautiful, decored with style, peace and extremely friendly staff.

I was not impressed by the breakfast tough but everyone will find something to eat from the buffet anyway.

Against previous reviews, I did not like the heavy scent in the lobby and reception area. And that is because I have asthma. So, all fellow sufferers, be aware and bring your medicine with you... You will need it in your room also because of the carpets (in every hotel in London situation is the same tough).",5,2011,03,06
113,"good location, nice staff, yummy breakfast","I really enjoyed my stay at the Kensington Hotel. Particularly impressive was the standard of breakfast at the hotel, and the dining room was a beautiful and tranquuil environment in which to start in the day. Also, if you like visiting the gym while you're on holidays, the Kensington Hotel probably has one of the best set ups I've seen - new treadmills, excellent range of equipment etc. The only thing about the stay that irked me was the lack of a bar fridge - there was no where to store the goodies I'd bought from the Borough Market.

The Kensington Hotel is located within an easy walk from South Kensington Station, giving you access to London's best sites. The staff were friendly and always there to greet you with a smile - and an apple. I stayed in one of the small rooms, was fine for a solo traveller, and if you travel light, it's probably ok for a couple too. 

Overall, this was avery enjoyable experience.",4,2011,03,05
113,What a relief - travelling with kids can be hell but not at the Kensington!,"My husband, myself and 3 kids (ages 3, 6 and 9) descended at this hotel having fled from another cheaper but horrible hotel closeby. On arrival we were struck by a gorgeus lemon scent which was there every day so obviously not an accident in the kitchen. I was really appreciative of the hot towels on arrival as I really felt hot and grimy from a day of sight seeing. 

We found the staff very friendly and helpful and the kids thought the room was amazing. It was certainly big enough for a double bed, two singles (although one was an iron contraption which my son told me was very uncomfortable) and a cot. Apart from the 'iron rack' all were comfortable and beautifully presented. This was room 223 right opposite the lift and is obviously a disabled room as the bathroom was adapted - only one snag was that I found it tough to bathe the younger two as there was no bath and they are still young enough to be frightened of the big shower. We got over it without much brouhaha though as they were so entranced by the big screen tv on the wall and the space in the 'lobby' area inside the door where they could play undisturbed. 

All reviewers have said it has a great location and I second this. Really easy to get to the museums and straight tube ride to Victoria for Gatwick express - quite easy. Loads of nice eateries nearby even with kids - recommend Rocca. 

While breakfast not included the continental was more than adequete and the kids breakfast was only ¬£7.50 each. That works out about the same as a hurried smoothie and pastry etc in any local deli so well worth loading them up before hitting the museums etc.

Only one flaw and that was the DVD - there isnt one in the room and they dont have satelite movie system which is a pity. I know the staff could have brought up a DVD player which we appreciated but I just wanted to 'point and press' being a well harrassed mum!! Plenty of channels which made a welcome relief from the previous hotel which frankly at half the price of this one wasnt worth the money! You get what you pay for alright and in the Kensington they certainly deliver. Well done we will be back soon - its a pleasure to stay with you.",5,2011,02,28
113,Shoe Box is bigger,"Just checked in - after being assured by reservations that an upgrade would be possible, booked a superior room - be warned only superior in name.
Very over priced, have paid for upgrade previously, but being a return guest presumed (oh oh) that an upgrade would be given.
Much bigger rooms available at better prices elsewhere!!",2,2011,02,24
113,It keeps on getting better and better!,"This was my second stay at this hotel. This time I had booked a double room instead of a single one for about the same price and this is what I would recommend to all single travellers!

I can only praise this hotel, there is absolutely nothing I didn't like. In fact, I would love to keep this hotel as my own private secret..... My son is living in London and I will visit him regularily and I will stay in no other hotel than The Kensington. It is an absolute gem!

The location, the service, the cleanliness etc. are all top. The turndown service even tidies up the bathroom. 

Breakfast is sumptious and good.

I can't wait to return!",5,2011,02,14
113,Amazing weekend,My wife and I spent the weekend at the Kensington hotel.we absolutely loved our time there!!!! Hotel is so beautiful and the staff are very welcoming and attentive. We highly recommend this hotel.,5,2011,02,13
113,Perfect Hotel,"My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights last week.  The staff was friendly, accomodating, helpful, and professional. The hotel is beautiful, clean and comfortable. We didn't want to leave. There is a fireplace in the lobby, a gym, a great area with computers for use (free of charge) and the toiletries in the bathroom were great quality as well. The hotel bar is gorgeous with bartenders who really seem to enjoy thier proffession. Also there are wonderful restaurants within quick walking distance. A wonderful Spanish restaurant that the concierge recommended and a place called Bumpkin, just half a block away. The Tube is a very short walk, to get you to other areas in London.  I would not stay anywhere else in London.",5,2011,02,07
113,Beautiful rooms and lobby,"The service was great, having been taken up to the room by the manager, even though I was only in a Standard room.  Having said that, the room was more than just standard, with very elegant furnishings a large bathroom, with a rain shower and very good toiletries, a king size bed and tea and coffee making facilities (don't knock them, I wish more hotels provided this). 

Breakfast was lovely, but I did feel a bit rushed by some waiters.  The lounge is fantastic. Will definately return.",4,2011,02,01
113,"Great location, would recommend to anyone but...","I recently stayed at The Kensington for the weekend whilst my partner and I were in London to see a show at The RAH. 

The hotel was very clean, comfortable, stylish, upto date with free wi-fi for guests. 

The location is a 5 mins walk from south ken's tube station and about 10/15 mins from harrods. 

My only negative point is the price.  I booked this hotel months ago and was set to pay about ¬£260 for a deluxe room. When, the day before our stay when I was showing someone the hotel I noticed that the rates had been halved for the night we were to go!

In the end I got a suit for ¬£190 - which was a bargain.  I understand that a hotel would rather be full and sell empty rooms at a lower rate to get more business but such extreme discounts, ie a suit for ¬£190 from ¬£516 is extremely unfair in people who choose to book in advance. 

But overall, very good hotel with great location and i will definitely go again (I'm just going to book last minute).",5,2011,02,01
113,It's the little things that make a place memorable...,"I was in Kensington for a mixture of business and leisure. I didn't know where to stay in the area, so I googled ""hotel kensington"" and this is what popped up. I thought I'd take a chance, and I'm glad I did. 

I arrived at the hotel at about 8am one morning, pretty tired after a 25 hour flight, and soaked, walking from the Tube station 5 mins away through the pouring London rain! I expected to drop my bags and find a caf√© around the area, however my room was ready so I was able to check in immediately, which was fantastic. Seeing I was wet and cold, the receptionist kindly brought me a hot towel to freshen up - one of those little things. The valet/concierge was very courteous, and took my bags up to my room, and showed me inside and the facilities and features. 

The turn-down service was a nice touch at the end of a long day, and the bar staff were very welcoming. I didn't get the chance to sample the restaurant, so I can't comment on that. The room didn't include an iron and ironing board, but could be easily requested from reception. The glass screen which acted as the shower curtain sat slightly too high above the bath, so water leaked out and covered the floor to the toilet when showering. 

Checkout was a breeze, and the receptionist offered me a bottle of water for my onward journey - again, those little things. 

I look forward to staying here when I am in the area again.",4,2011,01,21
113,Wonderful Stay,"My wife and I had an absolutely wonderful stay here after Christmas and over the New Year.  The hotel is well staffed with helpful and friendly staff who go out of their way to make you feel at home.  Rooms are spacious and spotless.  The food here is gorgeous.

The hotel is situated near some great museums, Hyde park and the shopping district of Knightsbridge.  There is a tube station less than 5 mins walk away to wisk you around London.  There is a pletera of top class area around the area also.

Great staff. Loved it. Will be going back!",5,2011,01,04
113,"Wonderful staff, amazing service, great location","This hotel was absolutely wonderful.  I couldn't even wait to get home to write about it.  I'm currently sitting on the floor at Heathrow Airport after checking out of the hotel just a few hours ago.

First the hotel is located in South Kensington, but not where the Trip Advisor Map indicates.  It lies on Queen's Gate, I think at the intersection of Old Brompton.  The hotel is conveniently located only 2 blocks  away the South Kensington tube stop, 2 blocks away from the Natural History Museum, and the Victoria & Albert Museum, and about 4 or 5 blocks away from Hyde Park.  There's a bank two doors down the street, and around the corner are several ATMs, restaurants, bars, pubs, coffee shops, etc.  With plenty to see and do in the neighborhood, the Kensington Hotel lies in a great location.

According to their brochure, they have 5 different types of rooms.  They start with the Superior Room (350 GBP), move up to the Deluxe Room (390 GBP), then the Studio Suite (430 GBP), Luxury Studio Suite (540 GBP), and the Brompton Suite (2000 GBP).  These are only the listed prices, it is possible to get a much lower rate if you book directly with the hotel.  I was able to book the Studio Suite for over 60% off the listed price.  My flight arrived early in the morning and I went to the hotel to see if they could hold my bags while i went out to explore the city.  The staff at the front desk were absolutely wonderful.  They said that as it was still 6 in the morning, my Studio Suite was still occupied by the previous guests, and wouldn't be available until later in the afternoon.  But instead of just holding on to my bags, they put me up in a Superior Room for the day, until the Studio Suite was available.

The Superior Room is on the small side, but still larger (maybe 40% bigger) than other rooms I've stayed in when visiting Europe.  In the Superior Room you get a King sized bed, a work desk with outlets for British and American plugs, a dresser, a closet, a large flat screen TV, and a spacious bathroom.  The bathroom is about 1/3 the size of the rest of the room, and had a tub with a regular shower head, and a flexible shower head.  The tub had 4 knobs on the wall.  The bottom knob controls the temperature, the knob above that turns on the faucet in the tub, the knob above that turns on the flexible shower head, and the knob above that turns on the regular shower head.  There's also a sink with marble counter tops, a large mirror on the wall, and a small mirror on the counter top for shaving.  On the shelves by the mirror, they provide 4 tubes of hygiene products: shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and lotion.  They provide two towels, and two robes that are located in the bins found on the top shelf in the closet.  Also located in the closet are a safe, coffee machine, and minibar.  The minibar is specially designed to dispense drinks only and can't be used to cool drinks you purchase on your own.

The Studio Suite has all the same amenities, is about twice the size of a Superior Room, with a larger bathroom.  The Studio Suite I was given had a tub on one wall, and a standing shower on the opposite wall.

The staff here are attentive, and the service is top notch.  One evening, when I was headed out for a run in Hyde Park, the staff noticed I had a slight cold.  When I returned from my run, I found a thermos of jasmine tea waiting for me in my room.

Amenities include free Wifi throughout the hotel, a medium sized gym with treadmills, stationary bikes, free weights, and machines (but no bench presses), a business center consisting of an iMac and printer, and a restaurant & bar on the ground floor.  Breakfast is not included in the price of the room but can be had in the restaurant (25 GBP for a full English breakfast).

I only encountered two minor issues.  The first issue I had was with the wireless network, as I had difficulty getting on the internet in my room.  This problem was easily solved by the concierge, who can provided you with a cable, just plug it into the wall in front of your work desk.  The second issue I had was with the toilet paper, it was very rough.  This issue could probably be easily remedied by asking the front desk for another brand of toilet paper.  I didn't ask, but the staff at the front desk are so accommodating I have no date they would go out and get it for you.

I would most definitely recommend staying here.  This is the best hotel I've had the pleasure of staying in.  It had spacious rooms, attentive staff, and speedy service.  I've paid more at many other hotels, and received far less.  This hotel sets the bar.",5,2010,12,23
113,great location / very nice stay,"i stayed recently at kensignton hotel for 5 nights on my own,,,,,though the hotel is a bit pricey pefhaps for some it was definetly worth it. You see my birthday is Christmas Eve...and hard to get people to travel with me, go out to dinner etc etc...and this year was a big year birthday! so i decided to take myself to London as a gift to myself.  i booked a single room, though i was looking forward to a room with a bathtub....and only found out later that this category doesnt has a bathtub. i emailed the hotel and requested if available could i be switched to a room with a tub...there wasnt one at check in, but the front staff was able to manoever one around for me. Anis Picka / Assistant Guest manager was helpful on this,,,,,,and sent me a birthday fruit plate as well !! Ms Jung (?) at the front desk was also very pleasant and helpful. the hotel itself was superb.....I enjoyed the location immensely...walked just a few blocks each night to superb restaurants ( Bumpkin / Carluccis / Great Burger )  and went out for breakfast to Pret or CafeNero right around the corner as well. the tubes and buses are all right around the hotel area...as well as walking distance to Harrods / Musuems etc. Thehotels free wi-fi was especially useful also.  the hotel decor is great....as it is all recently done no dirty carpets or torn wallpaper etc  The individual room decor is spacious, comfortable and very attractive ( gorgeous embroidered curtains ! ) the room attentdants / housekeeping were high caliber and attentive / friendly . Only drawback...a surly asian front doorman / porter who cursed at me ( !!! ) for i am not sure what reason.....and if i was general manager i would sack him immeadiatly....especially as he is the ""front"" of the property.",5,2010,12,21
113,Fabulous Kensington location - Great Hotel for business or leisure!,I stayed with a business colleague a few days ago and found this hotel lives up to the positive prior reviews in TripAdvisor.  The free internet is great and the concierge staff was extremely helpful in navigating.  It is just a few blocks from the South Kensington underground station and is a few blocks from the Natural History Museum and the Victoria and Albert museum.  A real gem.,5,2010,12,09
113,Lovely Hotel but very SMALL,"i just came back from the kensington hotel for 3 nights with my husband.
The service was fabulous, great staff with warm welcoming upon arrival.  the staff even gave us warm regards when we are in the same elevator.

The room has all you need, great lighting, funtional bathroom, mini bar, closet.  However, it is way too small.

I requested for a higher floor room and was givin room 515, the queen bed is smaller than a full size, there are no leg room for even a single person to walk around.  i'm quite skinny but even i feel cramped in this room.

the sound proof is not so good, i hear the lady next door caugh, talk, watching tv, walking.
and the cleaning lady starts cleaning and slamming the door early in the morning. (7-8 A.M)

i asked for an upgrade the next day but it is 40 pounds per night.
i love the hotel lobby, decor and everything but the standard room is not worth the price, i paid almost 300 US dollar per night, with online booking, you pay around 20 or so for an upgrade, i would assume a superior room or anything else is better than a small standard.
i would stay in this hotel again, but not in the standard room for sure.",4,2010,12,07
113,Nice hotel but expensive,"Myself and my husband stayed here recently. It was a lovely cosy hotel with a great bar and somewhere nice to relax after a long day. We upgraded our room to a deluxe room with extra space but it was still very small, when we mentioned this to the receptionist she told us it much bigger than the basic room we had booked. I felt it was very overpriced for what we got. The breakfast was beautiful. we never had dinner here as there were lots off lovely restaurants and bars within a few minutes walk. The staff were very nice and helpful.",4,2010,12,02
113,Wonderful Service,"First off - I must warn other readers that the map shown on TA is wrong.  It is on Queens Gate Rd. NOT Kensington Road.  I was glad I looked at the Hotel's website and their map before I got off the tube.

Now for my review!  We stayed here and booked two rooms for ourselves and our daughter.  Check in time was not until after we arrived but we were exhausted from our trip over from the States - got in at 9:30 am.  They let us check in early.  However, the room was right next to the elevators and thus noisy (the elevator dings AND talks - announcing ""doors closing"").   Now for the good service part - they said they would clean up the next available room while we went to lunch and move our belongings to that room.  We were thrilled - it was super quiet and big - even by European standards!  

I loved the location - a nice street walking distance from the South Kensington tube stop, museums (V&A) and shopping.  We had alot of help form the people there finding good places to eat, hailing taxis, booking sightseeing trips, etc.

Our favorite thing about the hotel, though, was the wonderful rooms for gathering downstairs with cheery fireplaces and comfy sofas where we would meet for drinks or lunch.  The breakfast buffet was nice, as well.  We were trreated with courtesy at every contact with staff.

We look forward to returning to the KH in the Spring when we go back to visit our daughter.",5,2010,11,18
113,Wonderful Hotel; Gracious Receptionists,"After a bad experience at a nearby hotel, I found rooms here at the last minute and was very pleased. 
Hotel Staff/Receptionist in Lobby were very accommodating; the room was very comfortable.",5,2010,11,09
113,"Gorgeous hotel in a great location, the staff were wonderful","It makes such a difference to your experience if the staff in a hotel are friendly and helpful.  We had one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had.  We arrived after a very long flight to find the hotel didn't have our booking (turned out to be hotel error) but it didn't matter as they put us straight into a lovely room without making the slightest fuss and sorted it out lter .  The room was beautiful and well fitted, the bathroom rather small but functional.  

The lounge areas in the reception of the hotel were absolutely beautiful and I really enjoyed having a drink there.  Would definitely go back again.

Right near Albert Hall and the V&A and just a short trip to Knightsbridge meant the location was also fantastic.",5,2010,10,31
113,The best hotel experience we have ever had,"Lovely hotel, grand common rooms and lounges; warm and gracious staff, able to answer all inquiries. We upgraded from the basic room for the added space and the charge was good value. Beautiful bath and excellent housekeeping. Please open a Doyle hotel in New York!  
PS Super breakfasts

Thank you",5,2010,10,27
113,"Great location, service and ambiance...","Was in London for two nights - October 2010.  I like the South Kensington area but it's often hard to find a good hotel at a 'reasonable' price there.  The Kensington was great!  Great location (3 short blocks to the S. Ken. tube stn.), some good restaurants and even a Starbucks and Pret a Manger close by.

Check-in was very easy - even hot towel service at the front desk.  My standard (queen bed) room was not huge but perfect for one and would certainly fit two if you were friendly.  Super sheets/towels and very comfortable bed.  Great bathroom - tons of hot water.

Free wi/fi in the room although it was hard to connect and so I usually had to step into the hall - connect and then continue in the room.  

Staff were very friendly and helpful and in a couple of instances went beyond to make things work.  Did not try the very elegant bar / restaurant but it looked great.

I would certainly stay again....",4,2010,10,19
113,Beautiful hotel with ups and downs,"Ups: Perfect location between tubes ""Gloucester Road"" and ""South Kensington"". Shops and restaurants in the vicinity. Beautiful hotel lounges with open fireplace and antiques. Friendly staff. Window in the room opens partially. Free WiFi everywhere. My bed was very comfortable and the room spotlessly clean. Electrical kettle with coffee and tea in all rooms.

Downs: Room for single guest very small and facing very noisy extraction pipes in the backyard. No table or chair to sit on. My room got only cleaned at around 3.00/4.00 p.m, just when I came back from town to have a short rest.

Conclusion: Make sure you choose your room wisely! You have the choice of different categories. Don't go for the cheapest! I would have preferred a table and a chair in the room instead of the beautiful lounges downstairs. I felt almost sorry that I couldn't spend much time near the cosy fireplace since there was so much to see and to explore in London.",4,2010,10,05
113,Great Hotel and Great Staff,"A delightful hotel with truly exceptional staff.  This hotel made me feel special from the moment I walked in the door.  I was greeted by an assistant that graciously asked to take my luggage without being offended when I relayed that I would handle it myself.

The check in staff were professional and accommodating.  The spoke courteously and made me feel welcome immediately.  The hotel management understands that customer service is one of those commodities that goes a very long way.

My room was clean had everything I needed to be comfortable.  Free wifi , which was simple to acquire and always available is a great plus.  Most hotels in London charge $25.00.  

The dinning room staff was incredibly polite and did everything they could to ensure that dinner was satisfying.  I had a steak which was cooked perfectly.  The asparagus was cooked perfectly.  The have a traditional English tea in the late afternoon that was fully attended which means that the food was good.

I highly recommend this hotel for any business traveler.",5,2010,09,25
113,Perfect in everyway!,"Hotel is gorgeous, classy, and spotless; but comfortable and the staff is friendly and efficient.  I can't name all of the great staff, but you should all be proud of your great customer service. Location is great as well, around the corner on the left there is a great Italian Restaurant with reasonable rates (Rocco's) and further down the street on the left is a great pub and very reasonable rates--you know it's great when the staff at our hotel eats there.  Really safe area and right up the street is Kensington Park, great place to walk.  Had one issue with an inconsiderate neighbor above us who was so noisy, had to call front desk at 1:30 AM.  They took care of right away and even offered to move me to another room for the evening.  Couldn't have been nicer with this issue.   Sometimes we forget that older hotels don't have the sound proofing as the newer ones!    The price is well worth it!  Try staying here, you'll love it!",5,2010,09,23
113,Best place to stay in London,"This was the most expensive hotel on the offer from the travel agency.  After reading the Tripadvisor reviews, I decided to spend the money because I had a 14 month old baby and an elderly father traveling with me and wanted to be comfortable after a day of sight seeing.  When I book hotels, I usually read the terrible reviews first to see if the reviewers concerns also concern me or not.  Also, I check for the hotel responses to those reviews.  The not so good reviews had to do with loud business men, small room, and too much service, all of which did not bother me.  Also, the hotel's responses were not snarky, but very professional on every level, so I decided to book this hotel.  

Once I booked this hotel, I contacted the hotel and advised of my concerns and what was needed.  I received a prompt response regarding my needs.  Once I got to the hotel, the room that I was assigned to was not ready because  check in was at 2PM and we got to the hotel at noon.  The hotel gave us coffee and water while we waited.  We decided to take a walk and when we returned, our luggage was in our room.  I think the room was a superior deluxe room, looking out to the Old Brompton Road, and it was quiet.  AC worked very well.  Room was spacious enough to have a baby cot, etc.  Everything was super clean.  

Staff was amazingly nice, efficient, and kind.  Breakfast was a perfect way to start the day.  No problems at all.  

In reading the reviews, some have said that this hotel is close to High Street Kensington and Earl's Court.  This hotel is close to South Street Kensington tube stop.  When you walk out the hotel, make a left turn at the corner.  You will see the tube station straight ahead, a mere 3 minute walk, which was really important when there is a baby, stroller and an elderly father.  It has District, Circle and Piccadilly lines.  All are great lines for doing touristy things.  There is a Tesco Express to get water and snacks enroute to the tube station.  There are plenty of places to eat around the hotel and not at all touristy.  V&A and Natural History is a mere 5 minute walk from the hotel.  

I had a great time in London.  While I have been in London numerous times, this hotel was the best hotel, because the people who work here really try to make one's stay an enjoyable one.  When I was checking in, there was some disagreement with one of the guests and reception, and the guest relations manager (Andrea Doyle) swiftly defused tension and everyone was happy.  

Also, while this hotel may not seem like a family friendly hotel, as the decor is just too beautiful to be a child friendly hotel, I must say that the staff went out of their way to make sure that my baby had everything he needed while we stayed.  We actually saw several babies and some toddlers in the dining room.  

The hotel has a free internet and the gym is top notch.  

So, I would like to thank everyone who made our stay an enjoyable one.  When I visit London again, I will stay at this hotel.",5,2010,09,18
113,Gorgeous,"This hotel is drop dead gorgeous.  The deluxe king room looked like it was used for the hotel's promotional photos.   Most London flats should be as big as this.  The location is ideal. And the price seemed surprisingly reasonable.   Nothing, however, is perfect, and the issues at  The Kensington all came down to ones of lapses in service; one bath towel for two people, toiletries not replenished even after leaving a note specifically requesting them.   The dining room seemed to be run by amateurs with breakfast a particularly painful experience waiting, waiting, waiting even for a coffee.  The servers seemed particularly harried.  Then, one day, there was an entirely new crew in the morning and everything was fine.  The old guard came back the next day and the chaos resumed.  The food at an afternoon tea was rather gruesome even though the pricing was not meaningfully less than at any of London's famous hotels.  This was redeemed by a really tremendous dinner one evening.

The bottom line: If you can live without the full on pomp and service of some of the grand dames, you're in for a real treat.",4,2010,09,16
113,"Quality hotel, quality location","Have just had two great sleeps at the Kensington Hotel!  I'd stay here again for the location alone but that's not the only positive - the staff are genuine, friendly and helpful; the public rooms are beautiful; the cocktails are delicious; and the rooms are small but perfectly formed.  This was a great base for two London novices and we'll definitely stay again for a treat.",4,2010,09,06
113,A fab find,"Having had a supeb stay at the K+K George in April, I wasn't all that keen to try another hotel in London but the reviews on Tripadvisor, together with the excellent rate ofered was irrisistable.
I am so pleased we stayed at this beautiful, centrally-located hotel. The decor in the reception rooms is fantastic - just as it looks on the website.
We stayed in a superiordeluxe room which was beautifully appointed, and had all the necessary amenties as well as some additional touches that make it eally special, such as the robes and slippers.
As per most London hotels the room was rather tiny - but as we werre out all day it was not a problem at all for us. Some of the more expensive rooms are much bigger.
The location in South Kensington is perfect for most central activities and its great to say somewhere peaceful if you have been amongst the hordes of other tourists. I will defiinitely stay here again.",5,2010,09,05
113,Excellent!,"In great location, the hotel is in a wonderful buiding. I had a meeting all day close to the hotel and went there in the morning to check in. My room was not yet available - which is totally fine at 8am - by the time I got back in the evening, my suitcase was waiting for me in my room, with lots of little goodies. I am used to stay in good hotels, but I was surprised about the level of attention paid here.
Had a lovely room with nice views. Breakfast is good. Staff is very friendly, knowledgable and helpful.
Can only recommend this place!",5,2010,09,04
113,Perfect Kensington Location,"We booked at the last moment and got  a tiny, but comfortable and well equipped room, facing a white wall. No view, but no road noise. The aircon was quiet and efficient. The bathroom had a good shower and a non-mist mirror. (why don't all hotels provide this?)The hotel has big, welcoming lounges with comfortable setees - ideal for afternoon tea on a wet day- and a friendly bar/cocktail lounge with an expert barman. Breakfast was lavish and relaxed. The staff throughout the hotel are international, well trained and helpful. The location is ideal for visiting the museums and the Albert Hall and it's a short ride or a 15 minute brisk  walk to Harrods. There are parking meters right outside the door and if you arrice after 6.30 pm, parking is free till 8.30 the next morning. Next time we stay, we'll be sure to ask for a larger room at the time of booking. I first class, sensibly priced hotel.",4,2010,08,24
113,Nice clean hotel in great location!,"We stayed in the Kensington hotel for 3 nights during February. Nice hotel with a great breakfast. Rooms were very small, but clean and sufficient.

113,Enjoyed our stay in a first rate hotel in a great location,"Juat spent the weekend in the Kensington and we were more than satisfied with the hotel, especially the service provided by the staff who were really helpful lots of small touches which really showed care about the customer and service they offer. The location is perfect for the museums, Knightsbridge and central London and Portobello Rd. Lots of good places to eat nearby too. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.",5,2010,08,11
113,Excellent Hotel,This Hotel is truly beautiful since it was refurbished. The Rooms and Service are 5 Star all the way. The Staff are all so friendly and efficient .... I will stay nowhere else in Future ..... Martin Fennelly - Dublin,5,2010,08,03
113,Brilliant Hotel in Kensington.......,"My Partner booked this hotel as a surprise and I was over the moon especially with our room which I'm sure was a superior. The decor was kind of Egyptian with beautiful drapes and a queen size bed!  The ensuite large with a bath and a large walk in shower with a huge shower head it was absolute luxury!  My Partner was pleased because he had an expresso coffee machine in the cupboard so he could have a decent cup of coffee.
It's a fabulous location right in the centre of Kensington within walking distance of Harrods and South Kensington underground station. We didn't actually eat there so I can't comment on the food served, but the Staff were very helpful and professional.",5,2010,08,01
113,"Excellent location, friendly staff and a really comfortable stay","Hello,

This hotel is in exceptional condidition. Please do select a delux room - it is worth it. By London standards the room size is ok.

The location is excellent.

113,Exceptional Service,"Having checked out yesterday, I would like to commend Frithjof Baumgartner, Operations Manager, for his exceptional emphasis on personal service, which extends down to every busboy and porter.  They were happy to store luggage for us, to deal with an excessive amount of luggage to be transported in and out of the hotel, and were efficient at finding for us reasonably priced theater tickets that were excellent seats.  Every aspect represented wonderful attention to detail, and the best of personal service.",5,2010,07,12
113,A fantastic find,"As far as London townhouse/boutique hotels are concerned for me the Kensington has it all,
The location is great if you want to be in SW London (it is a little bit inconvenient if you are working in the city because the circle line is famously slow and unreliable). There are lots of shops , cafes, restuarants . And very few chains (you do have a starbucks and a pret) which is always nice.
The hotel was recently refurbished in a very classic British with a twist. It does not try to be modern but it does classic well.Food and beverage (I tried room servce and afternoon tea in the lobby) are fantastic and decent value for mpney.
But the best part of this hotelid the friendly, smiling, patient, competent staff.. It's my second stay and there will be a third because they make your liffe fantastic.",5,2010,07,06
113,A home away from home,"My daughter and I stayed here for two weeks in June and were very happy and pleased with all elements of our stay.  I had made an emergency trip to London to see my daughter and had to book a hotel fast.  I used trip advisor as a quick tool to secure a room before I flew to Heathrow.
The hotel is a couple of blocks from the South Kensington underground station which is very convenient for getting around London, and back and forth to Heathrow.  The hotel is situated in a great residential neighborhood with many small restaurants and cafes.  We loved the cafe around the corner called La Bottega.  They had superb cappucinos and croissants and other breakfast items.  We had a few meals at the hotel and they were very good.  Expensive, but very good.
The hotel has many nice sized rooms after you go through the lobby area.  These areas are great for making phone calls or doing business on your laptop.  The hotel has FREE wi-fi, which was a huge consideration when I booked my stay.  My laptop also worked in my hotel room too.  There was also a nice sitting area with two computers for guests' use.
The bar and lounge area was very nice and relaxing.  They had many chairs at the bar, but also had nice, comfortable chairs and couches in private seating arrangements.  The bartenders were just the right ""mix"" as they were friendly, but not overbearing or intrusive.
The exercise facilities were absolutely the best I have ever encountered.  The equipment was new and worked well.  Many multiples of popular machines and several sets of free weights.  Very, very nice.
The concierge was extremely helpful at suggesting day trips within and outside London that were wonderful.  We visited Salisbury Cathedral, Windsor Castle, Greenwich, Kew Gardens and Richmond, and Cambridge.  All very accessible on the underground, or the overground with a transfer at Kings Cross station.  We decided to visit Edinburgh, Scotland for a few days and didn't need all our luggage.  The hotel stored our excess baggage for us until our return to the hotel before we flew home.  I was so impressed that they offered to do that for us.
Lastly, I want to focus on the hotel rooms.  The bed was very comfortable with nice, crisp linens, and very nice pillows.  The bathroom had great water pressure, and nice toiletries supplied by the hotel.  The towels were plush and oversized: very nice.  A great touch were the terrycloth bathrobes.  The room was on the small size, but aren't all hotel rooms on the small size in Europe?  I felt a little cramped, but we had enough room for our luggage on a nice long bench and ample closet space for my daughter and me.  Two women have a lot of clothes for two weeks!
I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone, and I would definitely return should I travel to London again.  Thanks again to everyone at The Kensington Hotel for a superb stay.",5,2010,06,29
113,Overall good but with some disappointments,"Check-in was very friendly and informative and the public areas of the hotel are excellent - very comfortable bar for example.  Our room was on the small side and it was the little things that were disappointing - a bedside light didn't work, neither did the scales in the bathroom,  the shower leaked all over the floor and the newspaper we requested wasn't delivered.
We would definitely try the hotel again despite these problems.",4,2010,06,28
113,Great location & immediate help when I needed it,"All the positive comments in other reviews re the great location and environment  are correct.  I accidentally left items in the room safe  -  including my passport - when I checked out. I realised within an hour of leaving and called the hotel. I would like to put on record how impressed I was by the efficient and kind  way it was dealt with. They checked the safe immediately and  called me back, the Manager even  gave me his mobile number in case I was worried (which I was, as well as embarassed). I returned to collect my things personally, but they were happy to make arrangements for me for frowarding had that not been possible.  Many thanks to the hotel for the honesty and assistance.",5,2010,06,26

113,"The first experience was great, the second was miserable.","This is the second time I use this hotel. 

The first time, I travelled with my wife and kids and hence I splurged for the upgrade.  The room was spectacular.  The staff is great.

The second time, I was alone so I figured I would go back to this hotel.  I was hoping to rewarded for my loyalty, instead I was given a tiny tiny tiny room.  It was so small that I had to leave the room to change my mind.  It was quiet claustrophobic.

I believe that this hotel is great if you upgrade to a superior room however the standard rooms are not worth the money you pay.  There are better deals in the city.

113,Excellent service in a great location,"We recently stayed at the Kensington Hotel and were really impressed with the service and location. On arrival we were given a room that was next to the extract flue at the back of the hotel and it was very noisy. We rang reception and they immediately transferred us to a much better room at the front of the hotel. The staff were attentive but not overbearing. We ordered room service breakfast which was excellent. All in all I would say that it is very good value for a London hotel, in a great location, just a 5 minute walk from the nearest tube station and in a very nice road just next to the Natural History Museum.",5,2010,06,13
113,Overall A good Stay,"On my latest monthly weekend away with the girls, we stayed at this lovely Hotel. I have decided to start writing reviews on all the great propertys we stay in as the UK does have some truely great finds!!! The hotel was clean and fresh, location fantastic, service also great. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay!",4,2010,05,26
113,Great Staff; Great Location; Very Comfortable Stay,"I enjoyed my stay at The Kensington.

The hotel staff is terrific -- extremely accomodating, helpful and pleasant.  I can't say enough good things about the staff!

I particularly liked the public front parlors/lounge area -- a comfortable place to sit and work or relax.

There are two computers and a printer in an alcove off the lobby, next to the elevators, for guests to use.  Very convenient and useful.

Since the hotel is a combination of the three residences, the rooms can vary in size and shape.  I had a very nice, spacious room.  I did see two rooms, however, on the relatively small side.",4,2010,05,20
113,Wonderful Stay,"Stayed here in February and we were highly impressed.  Wonderful decor, very friendly and informative staff.  Very close to Earls Court and easy access to all major sites and places of interest.   A little on the expensive side but worth it for a short stay (and a birthday treat!)",5,2010,04,17
113,Great location; great staff; excellent food!,"My husband travels to London often and stays at The Kensington Hotel (as a matter of fact, there now!).  Our kids (ages 8 & 10) and I accompanied him in January, attaching vacation time to his business trip. This hotel is in a great location, walking distance to Earl's Court subway station and walking distance to several museums (free entrance to London museums!)
The spacious room we stayed at had 2 comfortable queen sized beds, a sofa, tv, desk, closet, & small table in the middle of the room -- try to fit all that in any other standard hotel room.  The bathroom area had a double sink, toilet, tub and a separate glass-enclosed shower area.  
The breakfast that was included in the room was delicious -- a selection of cold foods/hot foods/pastries...even made-to-order eggs & waffles, a kid-favorite.  Drinks were also plentiful:  selection of juices/teas/coffees and even smoothies.  We got our fill and began to walk the city.
The hotel was not cheap; we usually stay in less expensive hotels but decided to splurge and  not move hotels since my husband was going to be working for a portion of the time we were there.  We're glad we stayed in the hotel; there were a lot of restaurants of all price ranges to walk to from the hotel.  We would stay here again!",5,2010,04,12
113,Fantastic Stay!,"From check-in to check-out, our stay was superb.  
I travelled with my 4 friends for a girls weekend and all of us thoroughly enjoyed it. We had two lovely rooms with comfy beds, and they were quiet spacious too which was a bonus!   Breakfast definitely deserves a mention as it was delicious, a great choice to choose from and the fresh smoothies were a nice treat.
 I would like to express a big thank you to the staff, we felt very much looked after in every way.  I would definitely return to the Kensington Hotel, with easy access to the South kensington tube station with it being just around the corner, It's the perfect location!",5,2010,03,31
113,"Wonderful Service, Incredible Brownies","I have been meaning to write this review for a long time, however, the habit is for people to rage against things they don't like and not rave about things they do. I plan to correct that.

I stayed in this hotel on the night of my wedding. We were warmly greeted by the front desk staff and offered champagne. We had themost wonderful glass of champagne and the tastiest brownies i think i have ever eaten. The room was extremely comfortable, the bathroom excuisite. For us the breakfast was a little pricey, but i would imagine it's standard for quality-London hotels. The warm fire in the winter was extremely welcome indeed.",4,2010,03,18
113,Fabulous stay in this luxurious hotel,"We stayed at The Kensington Hotel for our wedding night and although the whole experience was not cheap, it certainly made for a really special and glamorous stay. We managed to book a 3 nights for the price of 2 deal in a suite which is a beautiful large room. Even this was expensive so we would not have been able to afford it at full price. However, we had a fantastic time. We had a room on the first floor which was beautiful with a four poster bed & floor to ceiling windows all round. The room and the rest of the hotel was beautifully decorated and feels incredibly luxurious. The separate bathroom was big & had a free standing bath with a flat screen tv at one end so you could watch tv whilst in the bath - how decadent! It also had 2 sinks (1 each!), a separate shower & a separate toilet.

We were very well looked after in the hotel, the management put a complimentary plate of petit fours & a bottle of Moet in our room for after the ceremony which was so nice to come back to after our wedding day. We also invited a lot of our friends back to the hotel bar where we drank & partied until 1am. Some of our friends were a wee bit drunk by then and getting a bit loud but the hotel were very understanding and just looked after us. (probably because we were spending so much on alcohol!)

Breakfast was good and big - you can either have it in your room or in the restaurant, we did both and they were equally as good. Its also a great location with the Kings Road nearby and walking distance to Hyde Park and all the museums (V&A, natural history & science) at South kensington.

The only downside was that there is some traffic noise in the rooms as its on a main road so bring your ear plugs just in case! 

All in all we had a lovely stay and would recommend this hotel for a special occasion - if you can afford it that is!!",5,2010,03,15
113,My home in London from now on!!,"Stayed here one night recently whilst attending a get together in nearby Hammersmith. This place is fantastic, they've done an amazing job refurbishing the entire hotel and coupled with the charming service this really is the only place to stay for me when in London. Breakfast is great  and then there's so much to do on your doorstep, can't recommend the place highly enough. Will be back again and again!!",5,2010,02,24
113,Great Hotel and Location with well appointed rooms and polite staff,Spent one week here and its got all the mod cons. Rooms are great and bathrooms are very well designed. There was a slight noise upstairs from another room but apart from that the stay was excellent. Restaurant in the morning was not busy and the service was attentive. Nice foyer and meeting area where you can conduct meetings and there is a free internet computer with printer available just outside the lifts. Taxis out the front in the morning and great restaurants and pubs near by. Free internet in room made it very easy to get on web...,4,2010,02,18
113,Kensington Hotel is plush and comfortable for whole family,"We stayed at the wonderful Kensington Hotel for 5 nights recently with our two young daughters (6 & 8) and had an incredible experience - the staff went out of their way to ensure our stay was comfortable and easy. The rooms are spacious and well designed, and the bathrooms with their heated floor tiles and huge walk in showers were a great surprise.  Even the shampoo and soap was top-level.

The lobby and lounge areas are very well designed, filled with comfortable furniture and a warm fire in the fireplace - very cozy for tea on a rainy afternoon. Food in the restaurant was quite good, and service was quick and easy.  The kids particularly liked the breakfast bar, complete with cereals, fruits, pastries and more.

When we ventured out for sightseeing, the doorman always found us a cab with a smile and even handed us a loaner umbrella when needed.  Plus, the hotel is located very close to museums, parks, pubs, restaurants, cool neighborhood shopping and of course the So. Kensington tube station.

We can't wait to go back!",5,2010,02,18
113,Fabulous Hotel,"We have just returned from the wonderful  Kensington Hotel. From the moment we arrived  with a warm welcome from Alex and Adam to our departure it was such a pleasant experience. The family room that we had was luxurious, nice touches like the turn down service with little chocolates in the room were greatly appreciated. We had a beautiful meal in the restaurant and our two children aged 7 and 10 were also well catered for.
The location is quiet and just a few minutes walk to the underground!",5,2010,02,17
113,Great Location,"We stayed in January and were very impressed by this property. The Hotel has been fully refurbished and offers good sized rooms in a great location. The rooms are very well appointed, be mindful of the view as some of the rooms do not face the very elegant street at the front of the Hotel. Breakfast is a mixture of Buffet & table service, which is good with a varied selection of products. The staff are friendly and helpful especially the Concierge. South Kensington Tube station is a 5 min walk from the Hotel and there are many local restaurants in the locality.",5,2010,02,17
113,Ticked all the Boxes,"great Hotel - rooms are average size for London, but well appointed all the same. Had a deluxe with nespresso Coffee machine which is a nice touch. Staff are excellent from the moment they open your taxi door. Good breakfast",5,2010,02,13
113,Five Star Service; sadly only a three star hotel with one star rooms,"Stayed here on a treat weekend for an event at the Albert Hall. Never Again. 

First let me state that the staff here are wonderful: friendly, accommodating, helpful and polite. But sadly the place is way overpriced and too up its own [---]! 
I really don't expect to pay nigh-on two week's salary for a 2-night stay and be put in a broom cupboard sized room. This is what lets the Kensington down. The rooms are way too small. We could have a suite elsewhere for what we paid here. No room for 2 people to move in the bedroom, no room to even fully open the bathroom door, no room for one case, let alone two. It is a liberty! 

Public areas are lovely, all leather armchairs and open fire. Though we did see a couple of strops from guests as the bar staff didn't know how to mix certain drinks; a Kir looking like a Ribena for example.

We had a load of minor niggles: room too small, no bath tub, air con not working, mini bar locked and un-unlockable, safe bust etc etc.... All were handled with charm and politeness and offers of comp this and comp that but the upshot was we were crammed in a closet on a romantic weekend away and were offered the chance to upgrade to a bigger room at +60 quid a night , which would have taken our nightly rate close to 300 quid. To cap it all my rate included a 25 quid credit ""to spend in the hotel""; on check out I was told it only applied to food, not drinks so we ""wasted"" 15 quid of our credit. I was discounted a tenner off my room service order which (i) took 20 mins longer than announced and (ii) was 66% wrong (3 items but two incorrect -- wrong colour bread for the sarnies -- stale by the way --  and wrong drinks). 

Location isn't as near the RAH as they claim as Queens Gate is a LOOOONNNNG street. Nigh on a mile I'd say!

To recap. location: ok; staff: wonderful; value for money: zero",2,2010,01,25
113,Style In The City,"Super Stylish Hotel.
Have not stayed here pre renovations so cant offer a comparison, but would definitely reccomend the hotel now. 
Clean, Stylish, freindly staff, uber comfortable beds and a good brekkie.
Location is perfect for a weekend break - you can get into the shopping and the middle of everything in minutes but it's in a nice location in a good neighbourhood. 
Okay its a city hotel so the rooms are not massive and the rates will match the quality but for a treat its worth it!. I'd reccommend it for couples or business travellers.",5,2010,01,20
113,Awesome!,"We just returned from our annual trip to London. We decided to stay in Kensington after staying at the Mandarin Oriental last year. We spent five nights then returned for two more after a quick trip to Paris. Both experiences were stellar...the rooms were amazing, the service great, and the ambience warm and inviting. While there are always small things for us spoiled US folks that could make this even better (room service was tasty but got our order wrong twice, the internet was slow...yadda yadda yadda, I would absolutely give this hotel glowing remarks. While I told my wife I would love to keep this our secret, it is a great little boutique hotel that is first class. It is near the South Kensington tube, has great walking access to so many great areas, and some cute places to eat nearby. Our Paris hotel on the other hand failed miserably compared to being spoiled at the Kensington. Hope you enjoy it as much as we did...and we have much to compare it to all over London!",5,2010,01,04
113,"Great location, 5 star ambiance, room a bit of a let down","Even-though I live in London stayed here for a family function, 
Location is perfect for a visit, museums nearby , central london a walk away and the charms of Chelsea and Kensington on your doorstep.
The bar and lobby area was really cosy and welcoming, Great atmosphere and staff are really attentive. Breakfast was superb.
Free wifi a plus, Imacs available + printing facilities also an added bonus.

Now onto the room, unfortunately for me this was a bit of a let down.
It really was tiny, comfortable bed, bathroom again small but well equipped.

Comparing rooms with others staying at the same time I really saw a contrast in room sizes/styles. If i was here again I would ask to see a selection of available rooms and choose the biggest!!

All in all had a great stay,",4,2009,12,19
113,5 star,"I stayed here in its pervious life and I cannot get over the hotel as it now is. What a transformation. Staff were friendly and attentive. Ward is exactly what a concierge should be like, professional and knowledgeable. It was also a pleasant surprise to see such great management presence about the lobby and bar area. Both the General Manager Garreth and Deputy General Manager Gearoid were visible and interacted freely with guests. Something that other hotels could learn from.

The room was fantastic. Large seperate shower. Large plasma TV 42"". Nespresso machine. VERY comfortable bed. Everything that I needed after a busy day.

Breakfast was very impressive with no expense spared on presentation and quality. Fantastic selection also. Bar was also very nice with plenty of space. I did not have dinner so cannot  comment.

I would highly recommend this for both business and city breaks.",5,2009,12,10
113,Charming atmosphere,"Long weekend stay in december 2009. Superior rooms are quite small but recently and nicely refurbished. Equipped with comfortable bed, large HDTV (with connections for PC, cameras, camcorder etc), hairdryer, minibar, reading lights etcetera.
Bathroom was very clean with relatively large shower and a nice set of soap, shower gel, lotions and so on. Acoustic isolation from the corridor and the next rooms is not perfect but absolutely acceptable, especially when taking into account the historical building.
We stayed at the top floor with view on Queen's Gate and recommend to ask for the same.
Location is great for visiting the Natural History and Victoria and Albert Museums that are  five minutes walk away. Underground service is available at South Kensington station: tree minutes walk (Piccadilly, Circle and District lines).",4,2009,12,09
113,Seemed more like a business hotel...lots of loud business men,"Stayed for 5 nights and well the room was nice, only problem with the room was the lighting was VERY poor for applying makeup! Overall, the hotel was busy with business men especially in the late afternoon.  The sofas were packed with very loud men and I was forced to take a ""hallway"" seat that lead to the elevators and restaurant for my afternoon tea which was not a very relaxing event!  Have stayed in much nicer hotels in London before (Hotel 41).  Ward and I believe Ronnie were VERY helpful...much appreciated for them!

Had booked the hotel with Luxury Links and it took the hotel 5 days to confirm my reservation.  I needed to make flight reservations quickly as the price was rising everyday.  Contacted the hotel 3 times and they said they were working on it...and would confirm at some point.  Contacted Luxury Links and was told to go ahead with flight reservations and hopefully everything would be okay for my dates.   

Would I stay again, No.  I think there are far better hotels in London!",3,2009,12,01
113,GREAT SERVICE AND LOCATION,"Myself and partner said for two nights in this hotel in October.  Having stayed in most of the surrounding hotels previously we had looked forwarding to staying in the refurbished Doyle Kensington.  On arrival the staff at reception were friendly and efficient, our room on the 2nd floor was small but well appointed with a luxurious bathroom.  The breakfast we had delivered to our room on both mornings arrived on time and of a very high standard.   We found the staff in the lobby bar to be friendly and attentive and the food available was fresh and delicious.  We would like to give a particular mention to our concierge (unfortunately we did not get his name), he was extremely helpful in organising our luggage and taxi on departure and also a mention to Maud for making our visit comfortable and enjoyable.  I would recommend this hotel for anyone visiting London not only for the accomodation on offer but for the excellent location.",4,2009,11,30
113,Nice Stay,"I stayed here after Royal Courts/Paddington Apt let me down (see my review).  We were here for one night. The location of this is right by Earl's Court Tube - about an 8 min walk. The location is safe & can be pretty quiet at night. The staff was friendly & hospitable. Since we called last minute, we were able to find a pretty cheap rate. The hotel room was decent, a bit small but it was do-able. They also offer complimentary breakfast. It was an okay hotel, no fuss.  I would stay here again or around the area.",4,2009,11,21
113,Disappointing,"My husband chose The Kensington Hotel based upon reviews by respondents of TripAdvisor. We've done it before and have been extremely happy. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable. We had a supreme room which added an area with 2 chairs and a small table. Unfortunately, there was no lighting over 1/2 the area and  it was too dark to see anything if one sat in the chairs. One of the chairs was broken anyway and if you didn't sit perfectly still and in the middle, it leaned all the way to the floor. 
The bedspread/duvet had some kind of a dried-on mess that was unpleasant to look at. We called down to housekeeping in order to get a new blanket and they brought us one that did not appear very clean. At this point I walked down to the front desk and spoke with the manager on duty and before I made it back up to my room, housekeeping had brought us a brand new, freshly laundered bedspread. Great - very apologetic - in fact too apologetic in that they disturbed us several times over the next couple of hours while they checked to make sure everything had been taken care of.
The carpeting on the floor needed to be cleaned. There were many spots/stains and I was very happy that the hotel had provided slippers to wear. 
I was disappointed.",3,2009,11,21
113,"great hotel,great staff,really gives you a homey feeling.","Just returned from 7nights in london at the kensington hotel.I could not find anything to complain about..The staff were fantastic ,friendly helpful and always at your service.The hotel was in great condition and the rooms neat and tidy.I will certainly be staying there my next time into london.My wife didn,t want to leave.Special thanks to the concierge lady ,i,m sorry can,t remember her name and Leah,who works the lounge.great job to all you can be proud of your service and dedication.I know i,m a facility manager in canada.paul and kelly child.",5,2009,11,16
113,FAB London Hotel,"I have just returned from a fantastic European trip and London certainly was a highlight.

My partner and I stayed at the Kensington Hotel, part of the Doyle Collection. The property is absolutely stunning, after speaking with the reception team we learned how the Hotel has just undergone an extensive renovation project, and  you could see the quality in both the product and staff.

I am not sure how many bedrooms there were but it felt very homely & comfortable, whilst still very luxurious & elegant. Our bedroom was located on the 5th floor, being on a higher floor and in London we expected a small poky bedroom. To our delight the room was very spacious, tastefully decorated, and with an extremely comfortable four poster bed‚Ä¶a real treat!
We ate in the restaurant each morning for breakfast, the selection from the cold buffet was very good, and all hot food is made to order, they even had daily smoothie shots ‚Äì very cute.
As the weather wasn‚Äôt always perfect we did try the restaurant one evening for dinner, again the food was delicious and we found the staff to be very professional & knowledgeable. 
The bar speaks for itself, very chic!

Not only was the Hotel a delight, it was superbly located. Walking distance to all Museums and the trendy shops and restaurants of Chelsea.

We would highly recommend the property, and we will certainly stay again.",5,2009,11,16
113,EXCELLENT,"Stayed at The Kensington for 4 nights recently with my wife. The hotel is in a top location in South Kensington close to 2 tube stations and Kensington Gardens.
The standard rooms are very clean and well appointed, great beds and shower. Not very big rooms I must say but overall an excellent hotel to which I would not hesitate coming back.",5,2009,11,12
113,"clean, boutiquey, close to subway.","the colorful and classy fixtures and furnishings were all fairly new during my stay.  i liked my room and i had comfortable stay.  the staff was very nice and accomodating even though i still had to wait despite a prior requested early check-in.  the daily breakfast in the hotel was good and refreshed.
the location of the hotel was a few minutes walk from the subway.",4,2009,11,02
113,Lovely Hotel in a great location,"We stayed at The Kensington Hotel for 3 nights recently and were very impressed with it.  We arrived before normal check in time and the reception and porter staff could not have been more helpful and accommodating offering us coffee etc while we waited for a room to be ready.  There was one particular porter - wish we got his name - who was excellent.  When we first arrived outside the hotel,  he was there immediately,  opening the door of our cab and welcoming us to the Hotel.  The next day we were going out for a walk and as soon as he saw us in the lobby, he greeted us by name and offered assistance - very impressive.  
The room was a good size and very quiet and comfortable. There was no iron in the room but when we rang for one - housekeeping delivered it really promptly.
Breakfast was good - both foodwise and service.  The only area where the service wasn't up to the same levels as the rest of the hotel was with the staff in the bar which was a shame, as it had been almost perfect until then - it's not that it was bad, it just wasn't good either.  
On the whole though, we thought this was a fantastic place to stay.  A beautiful hotel, tastefully furnished, handy to the South Kensington Tube, museums, etc and good value for London.",5,2009,10,28
113,excellent hotel,"This hotel totally lived up to its reviews. We stayed for four nights and then came back for two more on another leg of our trip. The first time they upgraded us to a suite and the room was large and the bathroom was spectacular. The second room was quite nice and spacious though the bathroom was small but nice. The service was excellent, the place was spotless and we loved the location. It was really close to tube stations and the restaurants in the neighborhood  were wonderful. The price was really reasonable and the price/quality ratio is spectacular. We would definitely stay there again!",5,2009,10,27
113,Lovely hotel in a lovely area - with fantastic staff,"Just a brief note to feedback on our recent stay at The Kensington Hotel:

My overall summary is that The Kensington is a lovely hotel, in a lovely area - with fantastic staff and service.

It is the latter that make the difference and as an organisation the Doyle group should be proud of the Kensington staff. 

I would particularly single out the Concierge (I did not note her name, but she could not have been more helpful or more pleasant) and the reception/portering staff.

There were one or two problems with our stay and I will mention them here, but this is not a complaint:  the deluxe room we booked was definitely not as portrayed on the website: it was smaller, there was no coffee machine (as advertised), no robes in the room (as advertised), insufficient supplies of coffee/tea/milk/soap and shower gel etc. 

The latter, particularly, let the hotel down - it is the little things which, in my experience, distinguish between top-end hotels and guests should not have to ring reception for toiletries, milk etc.

With the exception of the room dimensions and absent coffee machine, all of the above were dealt with extremely efficiently by the excellent staff. (As mentioned above, this is not a complaint.)

With a little extra effort, the Kensington really could distinguish itself.

Would I stay again? Yes.

Will we stay again? Yes.",4,2009,10,27
113,lovely hotel. we will be back,"Good points
1. Location - Kensington is a fab location with park and museums nearby and tube stop within walking distance of hotel for easy access around city
2. hotel very clean and beautifully refurbished
3. rooms slightly on small side but very comfy and had everything needed - robes, slippers, good hairdryer, t and coffee making facilities, safe, wall mounted flat screen tv, umbrella etc
4. bar and lounge areas very relaxing and plenty of chairs/sofas 
5. very pleasant staff
6. free internet access in lobby area
7. ate breakfast only in hotel. food fabulous
8. nibbles served with drinks in bar - a nice touch

bad points
1. 20 minute wait for coffee in bar on sunday evening (around 9pm) . Seemed to be very slow between kitchen and bar. Bar drinks quicker to be served
2. noise - we had 2 rooms, one close to lifts and other further down corridor. The occupants of further room had no noise issues at all. Room near noted paper thin walls, could hear tv in next room very late at night, and could hear other guests knocking on doors and doors opening and closing on corridor. Might need some more sound proofing fitted. Luckily the guests staying in hotel are not inclined to be late night noisy revellers and noise, while it did wake us up, didnt interfere with enjoyment of facility. 
3. Rooms inclined to be on small size and bathrooms very small but again nicely finished. 
A note of CAUTION for anyone with any mobility problems. One of our bathrooms would not have suited anyone without full mobility. The shower was an 'over the bath' type. The shower screen was over half the bath width leaving the access to the bath very tight. This coupled with quite a high side on the bath would make it impossible for someone with back problems to use the bath or shower. by contrast the second room had no bath but had a double shower with a waterfall showerhead which was fantastic. Check out the bathroom in your assigned room suits your needs.

overall a definite recommendation and we will use this hotel again",5,2009,10,27
113,I just had to write about it..,"just returned from a great weekend in London. I have visited this site many times in the past to make hotel choices for my trips. this is the first time I contribute to this site and I must say, I just had to write about Kensington Hotel. Arrived late and Brian at reception went out of his way to find us a great room. The hotel has just been refurbished, everybody is very attentive and genuinely seems to enjoy working there. the buffet breakfast is everything one could wish for and the lobby and fireplaces are inviting to lounge around. just too bad the hotel is in London with so much to do, otherwise I would have simply moved in! Nancy the concierge is most enthusiastic about providing any and all help and support one may need to make one's stay most enjoyable .. AND just down the street from the hotel there is one of the finer pubs in London, just ask her!",5,2009,10,26
113,Absolutely delightful hotel and excellent value,"Having originally booked in to the Sheraton Park Towers at about four times the cost and been utterly disappointed in every regard we decided to jump ship and spend the rest of our stay at Kensington Hotel (a further 5 nights). We were upgraded to a suite - which I would highly recommend as the bathroom was the best I have ever seen in London! Unlike well known hotel chains this one had a really warm, relaxing, personable touch and we quickly felt at home. Having experienced endless hotels in London previously, I am content that I have now found the ultimate, best value for money, hotel in the whole of London. Room service was also refreshingly of high standard and good value.",5,2009,10,22
113,Elegant with good service,The room + breakfast + ¬£30 to spend at the hotel cost ¬£150 from Travelzoo which was excellent value for two (I was just one though). The food was excellent and the staff friendly. The room was spacious. I would recommend staying here if you can get a good deal.,5,2009,10,20
113,Good location and price but staff service levels need improving,I recommend this hotel but they desperately need more staff in the dining room and better training of all staff.  In general they need more people and the front of the house staff are aware of this as several staff members asked me to write this review as their central management in UK and Ireland were not giving them enough resources to do the job properly.,3,2009,10,17
113,Beautiful Hotel with Fantastic Staff,"Fabulous rooms which have an amazing room scent!
The staff are all really polite, professional and nothing was too much trouble, always offering assistance with being requested and with a smile !
Lovely bar, very relaxed with a great range of brands.
Look forward to visiting again.",5,2009,10,14
113,"Decadent yet modern surroundings, charming....",Gorgeous hotel in centre of South Kensington. Staff were charming and polite. Room recently refurbished with lovely mix of modern yet decadent furnishings with great attention to detail. Enjoyed the room service. Fabulous bathroom with freestanding bath. Really cool bar.,5,2009,10,13
113,"excellent stay ,,classic boutique hotel","stayed here last month ,after they completed their renovation and whilst i was a fan of the property previoulsy it was getting a little tired. however its like walking into a new hotel with the service and atmosphere of an established businesss excellent could fault it,as a coffee drinker i found the coffee machines in the rooms an exfellent addition.",5,2009,10,13
113,Great location and decor - pity about the facilities and service,"Stayed here for 3 nights for a city break. Location and decor are great however the service, particularly housekeeping was less than up to standard. Was in a double room and daily had to ask for additional items e.g. only one bath towel for two people, toiletries not replenished etc.  Rooms are small and badly appointed compared to hotels of a similar rating. No iron in room and had almost a two hour wait to get one. Bathroom floor remained stained for the length of our stay. 
Have payed a lot less and received better levels of service.  Its a pity because the location and structure are very good.",3,2009,10,11
113,"Great Hotel, Great Breakfast","Stayed for one saturday night in the Kensington Hotel.  Rooms more really nice and what surprised me the most were tailored for women.  Decoration was excellent, hair dryer was big enough, womens magazines etc etc.  This meant that my spouse really enjoyed her stay and had nothing to complain about which made my stay even better!

Breakfast the next morning was excellent with fresh fruit, breads, cheeses and a hot menu also. The location is perfect if you want to explore the South Kensington and Knightsbridge region.  You can walk to Hyde park Knightsbridge in about ten to fifteen minutes.  

Well deffinitely stay again.",5,2009,10,08
113,Great hotel in super location,Just back from three night stay. Our room was rather small but beautifully turned out. The staff / service was exceptional and you could not beat the location. Well done to all concerned.,5,2009,10,07
113,Lovely Hotel in Nice Location,"We were here two nights and had a wonderful stay.
The check in was quick and the room was clean and roomy with a nice coffee maker. 
Breakfast was part of the room and their coffee at the lounge was made just right. 
Afternoon tea was part of the room rates, but we were able to discount part of the room rate if we opted to turn down the afternoon tea. 
Another perk from the hotel was the unlimited internet connection from our hotel room. 
This is the hotel that I would definitely return to when back in London.",5,2009,10,04
113,Good for the rate we paid,"We stayed here under the Daily Telegraph Short Break Scheme on a rate that was advertised as 50% of the normal tariff.  We had two types of room, a standard room and a deluxe room which were located on the second floor.  The standard room was big enough for single occupancy but would have been small if used as a double (the Bathroom was smaller than those I have experienced in budget hotels.  The deluxe had a bigger floor area and the bathroom was over double the size of that in the room opposite. The main fixtures were similar in both rooms with the deluxe having a few extra touches (although a full length mirror was noted by my Mother as something that was missing).  There were a few minor gripes with the fixture and fittings in both rooms and a few touches that were missing when compared with other hotels of a similar standard.  Overall, the hotel represents good value for money for the rate we received (I would expect more if I paid the full rate) and is ideally located close to the Museums and Tube Station.",5,2009,09,29
113,Absolutely lovely hotel!,"Stayed for two nights on a combined business/pleasure trip. The location close to Earls court  exhibiton center was one of the criteria for choosing this hotel, and the good reviews and high ranking made the choise even easier.
We got a room without proper windows at first, and immediately asked for a change. Another room was available and prepared in an hour.  I think the room with no windows (only two small openings with shutters and no view) probably should be sold at a very much lower price and with proper information. I think very few would be comfortable here, but some may be happy to pay less for an otherwise acceptable room on the 1st floor) Only an advise, because the stay in itself was perfect. Newly beautifully refubished, the colours and furnishings are exquisite and creates a warm and welcoming environment. Taxi had barely stopped before the doorman had picked our suitcases up with a smile and a welcome. Breakfast, oh, breakfast! My only regret was that I could not eat as much as I desired of all these delicacies. Coffee probably the best I have ever got in a hotel. I'm extremely sensitive about my coffe, and very few hotels pass ""the test"" for me. (We travel quite a bit) The head waiter (?) was all smiles, realxed helpfulness (remembered our name the second day and the hotel was packed) and a little well-placed humour. All these tings are often underrated, but adds up to form  your mood for the day. We got ready for the day happy and smiling, and in no need for lunch!
Bed was so good I tended to want to go home early! A down filled duvet light as a cloud instead of the sheet &blanket. Heavenly. Stay here!",5,2009,09,29
113,A winner,"Excellent and very responsive staff.  Great location.  Clean rooms, though a bit small.  Luckily we got a free upgrade to the suite.  Really was a perfect home base for our stay in London.  I recommend it HIGHLY to everyone.  And i think because it was just reopened or something, we got an extremely good rate.

Stay at this hotel and you'll be happy!",5,2009,09,28
113,"Lovely airy hotel with friendly, helpful staff, great rooms, breakfast and bar service",We stayed at the Hotel on the occasion of our son's wedding and everyone had a great time and commented on what a lovely hotel it is.  Wonderfully comfortable with up market bathrooms and we were made to feel really welcome.,5,2009,09,19
113,Seriously let down by poor service,"My sister and I stayed here for one night while on family business in London on 12 Sept 09. We booked on the basis of great ratings on Tripadvisor from previous guests as we needed somewhere relaxing. The hotel is well located close to South Kensington underground which is served by the Piccadilly and District Lines. It is a pleasant 10 minute stroll to Kensington High street, We arrived on an early flight and went to the hotel to drop off luggage and ask whether an early check in was a possibility. The welcome by the lady concierge was warm and an encouraging start.  However, our optimism was short lived as our request for an early check in seemed to flummox the receptionist on duty (we didn't consider this to be an unusual request for a hotel of this calibre). We were made to feel that this presented a problem as she said she had to find us a different room which could be prepared for us before the published check-in time of 2pm. In the end we decided to return at 2pm only to find that the room type we requested was not in fact what we had been allocated and again the point that this was our fault because of our early check in request was emphasised. It was on our return at 9pm when the room was at last to our specification, and then the bed throws and cushions were 'stored' on the floor for turn-down and the cups we had used earlier had not been refreshed. This gave the room a very untidy feel. Decor was bland with no pictures on the walls. We found the staff on duty at breakfast to be unfriendly with at least one extremely abrupt and inappropriate comment from a member of staff which left us feeling again uncomfortable. This is a lovely hotel with spacious relaxation areas for guests as well as free internet access. We booked through an online booking agency which offered us a very competitive rate and we genuinely felt that the service offered by key staff at this hotel was second rate (perhaps as a result of how we had booked), as was the room we found ourselves occupying. The staff we encountered at the Kensington would greatly benefit from customer service training perhaps shadowing their contempoaries in the Westbury Hotel in Dublin. The Kensington Hotel is seriously let down by poor service which left us feeling sorry we had booked. We informed the hotel of our concerns through their customer satisfaction survey and currently await their response.",3,2009,09,16
113,food under cooked - staff did not care,Having stayed before i was looking forward to visiting again - breakfast was a disaster - ordered cooked breakfast - black pudding was cold raw and uncooked in the centre - staff grudgingly took it back - on check out the bill was wrong and they had excluded the ¬£25 credit forr food and drink that they both advertise and promote,1,2009,09,14
113,A fantastic hotel with superb service,"Our wedding party have just spent the weekend here, and I simply can't recommend it enough. This hotel combines the luxury of something much more expensive with the personal service of something much smaller.

We came to them late one Friday night a few weeks before our wedding after another venue (booked months earlier) had let us down badly. We instantly felt comforted by the atmosphere of the hotel and its staff and this feeling grew over our subsequent dealings with them over the course of the next few weeks leading up to the stay itself. We were given personal points of contact, though all the staff in the hotel we had dealings with were excellent and seemed genuinely friendly. This was a view mirrored by all our guests. In fact, we found it so difficult to leave that we extended our stay for a further night.

We've come away from our wedding with some amazing memories, and the Kensington Hotel is indelibly part of that of that experience.",5,2009,09,14
113,"Excellent hotel, superb bed, great breakfast","Booked very much at the last minute, but managed to secure a superior king size room for ¬£190 plus VAT including breakfast for 2 people.   Room was on the 4th floor and with windows onto a quiet side street.  The room was certainly large by London standards, spotlessly clean and well equipped.  There is a mini bar which you can't use as a personal fridge which was a very minor irritation.  There should have been bathrobes - and these were missing, but we couldn't be bothered to phone reception and ask for some.  The bathroom was large with underfloor heating and nice toiletries.  There was a large plasma screen tv in the bedroom and supposedly free wifi, although we didn't manage to get our i-touch to find the network, despite phoning reception for help. I suspect our room might have been too far away from the router.   The bed was really comfy with a feather duvet and feather pilows.   An excellent night's sleep was ensured! 
We walked to the Albert Hall for a Prom concert in the evening and came back to the hotel for dinner.  The restaurant food was excellent, but the wine was a bit pricey. 
Breakfast was superb.  Lots of choice including imaginative healthy options and a good range of cooked choices in addition to the ""full english"".  Service was polite and friendly.
The hotel is in between South Kensington and Gloucester Road tubes, and we think South Ken was marginally closer.  
In short, a great find and we would certainly stay again.",5,2009,09,10
113,Great hotel in a fantastic location. Represents excellent value.,"Like the previous reviewer, my wife and I took the 3 nights for 2 offer. I understand the hotel has just been refurbished, and we found it was clean and fresh. The room we had wasn't what you would call large, but for the price you pay, and the location (South Kensington tube station is around 400 yards away) you couldn't get any better. The facilities in the room were excellent (I was able to watch the football on Sky Sports on a new wall mounted LCD TV). The staff were brilliant, and always attentive and keen to assist. I would definitely stay here again, and recommend it to anyone else wanting to stay in west London.",5,2009,09,08
113,"exquisite, luxury, comfort all under the same roof","Myself and my partner did the 3 for 2 nights deal. I must say, we have stayed in several hotels and boutiques in London and the Kensington is at the high end of our scale. Young but fantastic staff, very helpful and extremely polite. A bit out of the mainstream shopping, but very close to Harrods and Harvey Nichols. I would recommend this hotel to everyone. We had a joyous stay and will definitely return in the future.",5,2009,09,01
113,Fantastic in every way!,"My husband and I spent five nights at this beautiful hotel in South Ken in mid August. We highly recommend it. We had a great package deal for the hotel from Luxury Link which included full breakfast every morning among other lovely treats. Our stay was great from beginning to end. Reception staff very friendly and helpful. Our room was a delight - the hotel is recently renovated so the rooms are first class, very modern, stylish, spacious and comfortable. Luxurious actually!  Bed, extremely comfortable, lovely bed linens. Oh, wonderful bath products! So much so that I asked for a few extra samples for packing in my bags! The only downside I can think of is there is no iron/ironing board in the room. We had to call for one and it took ages for them to provide it. Breakfast at the hotel every morning was a wonderful way to start the day- so much choice and service was excellent! Dining room is beautiful! We had dinner our last night at the hotel and that was great too. We also spent time at the bar having drinks  - great atmosphere. Concierge was very helpful in getting us tickets to a couple of shows and just generally a pleasure to deal with. The location of the hotel is fab! You are in the middle of it all. South Ken tube station a five minute walk away, world class museums in every direction and some great restaurants in the immediate vicinity - you are spoilt for choice in that respect.  I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would return in a heartbeat! Part of what made it so special apart were the staff. Not the cold British politeness that  is so typical of folks in London. Rather, we found them to be genuinely warm  (they smiled!) and hospitable. Special mention must be made of Giselle. She was fantastic and made us feel really welcome.  We'll be back!",5,2009,08,28
113,Excellent Hotel / Excellent Staff,"Me and my significant other stayed here for 3 nights in the summer.  We decided to take a trip to London for her birthday and had a great time.  

The Hotel
The hotel is excellent and the staff are there for your every need, they really cannot do enough for you.  The location was great as we wanted the visit the parks which were very nice and the tube is 5 mins walk.  The hotel has two computers which are located by the lift and are free to use which is another added bonus.  The hotel has a very nice clean and quality feel about it and there are small thoughtful things I liked about it such as, helping yourself to a fresh apple on the way out and being greeted each time you approach the main doors.  Excellent!  

The Restaurant & Bar
We had continental breakfast each morning which was all very nice, we would also take a few cereal bars away if we were heading out!  Everything was extremely fresh and the service was faultless.  We had dinner in the restaurant one evening, the meal and the service was excellent.  The bar area is extremely relaxing and is the perfect place to enjoy a drink. 

The Rooms
Our room was very spacious and had a large LCD TV with various channels.  The finish to the room was great, nice quality carpets, shutter blinds at the window, an excellent bathroom with shower and air con which worked brilliant.  There was a safe in the room for which there is no additional charge.",5,2009,08,27
113,Unique fantastic Gem!,"I stayed here with my husband for one night - a babyfree 24 hrs! The hotel is just such a delight - the decor is amazing, whoever is responsible for that - wow. Rooms are equally good, clearly top quality furniture and fabrics throughout. Location is spot on in the best part of London. We are definantly staying again.",5,2009,08,20
113,Fantastic Hotel,"We stayed in the Kensington Hotel with our two young children after finding their 3 nights for the price of 2 deal on the internet. We wanted somewhere nice to stay in a good location and this hotel did not disappoint. The hotel has been recently refurbished to a very high standard. All public areas were spotless and incredibly stylish. The bedroom (which was a family room) was  a good size (for London)  and the bedlinen and curtains were clearly top quality. The beds were really comfortable and the en-suite shower room had a really powerful shower in it. The service we received from the staff was fantastic from start to finish - they really couldn't have been more helpful and were clearly very well-trained. Breakfast was great with a lovely selection of fresh fruit, cereal, home made muffins/flapjacks, pastries, fresh juices, breads,cheese and meat and also a lovely selection of cooked options. In terms of location, the hotel is at the bottom end of Queens Gate (about 15 mins walk from Kensington Gardens) and is really handy for the Natural History Museum and the V&A.   We would definitely return to this hotel next time we visit London so long as they keep doing special rates.",5,2009,07,29
113,Gorgeous Hotel,Stayed at the Kensington on their 3 night package (3 nights for 1 deal). Room was big for London and still smelt new. It is very close to South Kensington Tube Station which is great.  Only downside was the air conditioning. It wasn't working in our room. We mentioned it to the manager at the desk and she was very helpful and accommodating.,5,2009,07,06
113,If you want relative luxury in London at affordable prices this is it!,"Stayed for one night at the Kensington Hotel last week, we were going to see a concert at the Royal Albert Hall. Really enjoyed our one night stay there. The hotel has had a ¬£20m refurbishment and it shows. The bar is decorated in 1930s decor, and is wonderful to sit in and relax with a late night drink or two.
The staff at the hotel are all very polite and go that little bit further in making the stay as nice as possible. As soon as we arrived at the hotel and checked in the concierge explained we could drink in the bar in the afternoon and watch the tennis on their widescreen TV. 
We had a superior room with a very comfortable bed, clean sheets, soft carpet under foot, mini bar, plasma screen TV. The shower in the bathroom is amazing, one of those huge pod showers with a slate floor. There was a speaker in the bathroom so you could listen to whatever was on the TV at the time. 
The only disadvantages was outside our window was some workmen hammering and drilling, till 1730, we had arrived at 1530. I did speak to reception and the lady told me they were working till 1730 and that would be it, however they did start again at 0845 next morning when she said they had finished. To be honest they werent that noisy in the morning and they stopped for an hour and we were checking out at 1030 so it wasnt a major problem. If we had been staying longer and the work was continuing then we would have asked to move rooms, I get the impression that it wouldnt have been a problem. This room didnt have a great view as you can imagine and the room wasnt massive but it was a good enough size for two people and we could have stayed there longer. 
We also had breakfast brought to our room at no extra charge, a continental, which was part of the price and very nice it was too. The area around the hotel is great for choices of places to eat and its only 5-7 min walk from South ken tube, and 3 of londons best museums are also 5 mins away. Would definitely go back there again.",4,2009,07,05
113,Superb hotel,"As we booked this on Travel Zoo with the re-opening special we had a fantastic rate and comparatively low expectations. Our room ‚Äì the King size Deluxe - was massive. The promised king size bed with lots of space for a table and chairs, plenty of space for luggage. Also a good size bathroom and best of all, double glazed windows so ‚Äì despite the fact we were only on the first floor ‚Äì no traffic noise. Fantastic breakfast spread ‚Äì lots of choices of fresh fruit, smoked salmon, cold cuts and pastries plus the expected toast and cereals. Also enjoyed a wonderful meal in the hotel restaurant, great food and fantastic service.",5,2009,06,14
113,A very nice hotel.,"We got 3 nights for the price of 2 nights, so it was a pretty good deal.  We had a Superior room with a king bed.  The room was nice, and the bed was very comfortable.  There wasn't a tub which wasn't a problem for us.  The shower was very nice.  The view was bad but since we didn't spend a lot of time in our room, it was fine.",5,2009,05,30
113,Highly recommend this hotel for Shopping/Concert weekend!,"The kensington hotel has amazing rooms! Our room was gorgeous, its furnishings made the room feel more luxurious, bed was amazing to sleep in. Breakfast was well worth it, had continental breakfast, everything was fresh and nicely displayed, the dinning area had a nice relaxing atmosphere. Everything about it was appealing.
Shops are very close by and the tube is just around the corner. Ideal location for the shopaholic! Hyde park is not too far away either.
The staff were warm and welcoming and very helpful! Really liked the extra touch of a complementary bottle of water for the guests upon check out.
Overall great hotel.
Will definately stay there again!",5,2009,05,27
113,Top Notch,"Very well located central to tube station Rates are good too. Rooms bright, stylish and open. Beds are superb and hard to get up out of for all the good reasons. dinning room is superb with un-intrusive service. bar and lounge also worth a look. 
Cant wait for my next passing through kensington.",5,2009,05,27
113,Good Weekend in London,"My husband and I stayed at the Kensington Hotel, South Kensington  for two nights during May.  The hotel is very easy to find and only a few stops from London Paddington on the underground.  Our room was lovely (the whole hotel has recently had a 20 million pound renovation) very comfy beds, plasma screen TV, very nice bathrooms - all the usual facilities you would expect from a luxury hotel in London.  We had drinks at the bar/lounge on both evenings the staff were very efficient on both occasions.  Breakfast was wonderful both the service and standard of food were exceptional, I have already recommended friends and family to stay at the hotel when they next visit London.",4,2009,05,21
113,Highly recommended,"The friendliness and attention to detail by the entire staff made the highest marks.  The hotel is open, airy and beautifully renovated through out.  Some rooms are quite small as expected in London.  Larger rooms are available. This was a great value to us at 110 GBP per night under a TRAVELZOO promotion.  Neighboorhood is quiet and upscaled. About. three blocks walk to Kensington South tube station. Markets, post office and pharmacy on Brompton. A few good restaurants in the area but more in Gloucester if on foot.   You will enjoy your stay!",5,2009,05,09
113,Ask to see the room,"We booked this hotel as we noticed it was being completely redone on our last visit. There was a special opening rate but as a result, we believe we got one of the least desirable rooms in the hotel. 
The room was located directly over the dumpster which was still being used for the renovation and was much smaller than many of the other rooms we saw. Worst of all, there were 3 steps up to the bathroom!
In addition, they are still working through the kinks ie. no towel bars in the bathroom, no hooks for robes and a ""frosted"" glass door such that you can see the other person while they are taking care of bathroom business!
On the other hand, the location is wonderful and the lobby/bar is fabulous as well.
The concierge and staff were extremely kind,helpful and apologetic.
We would recommend this hotel but caution to book a deluxe room and make sure there are no steps to the bathroom.",4,2009,05,07
113,You can smell the newness!,"I stayed here for two nights in April 2009.This hotel was previously Jury's Kensington and has recently re-opened following a major refurbishment. I had stayed in the old Jury's hotel many times and was eager to see what it was like after the refubishment and I was very impressed. Like the previous reviewer I was allowed check in early. On entering the my room I could 'smell the newness' of the furniture. The room and,particularly the bathroom, were rather small. Among the room furnishings is a large LCD TV, in room safe, mini bar and very comfortable bed. The food and service in the restaurant was excellent and the cocktail bar is very good also. All staff were very pleasant and friendly. Free internet access is also available. Gideons have not yet got around to putting bibles in the rooms  (for the benefit of Christian travellers). Overall  I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel for the business and leisure traveller.",5,2009,04,30
113,Very Good Stay,"Stayed here for one night. They let us check in early at about 10am and the staff were very helpful. The room was fairly small but clean and bright. Very comforatable bed. The hotel has only recently opened but the staff were very professional in dealing with all matters. One of the best things was that the food in the restaurant was very good value and of good quality. 2 people starter and main, ¬£40 !!! I will be back if i can find another offer like we had.......",5,2009,04,28
113,Loved it.,The best hotel and the best service! Especially Mr. Giorgio's. The perfect rooms and the super rich breakfast. Dinner was super excellent! But I was impressed by the service so good. All very helpful and friendly,5,2024,10,16
113,Highly recommended luxury hotel,"The hotel is very centrally located in beautiful surroundings and is very tastefully and stylishly British, but not overloading, and decorated to match the architecture of the house. All staff are perfectly trained, extremely friendly and very service-oriented.  The breakfast that was fortunately served was excellent and beautifully arranged. . Special requests were gladly considered. At the reception there were no waiting times and you were treated very appreciatively. The 
We felt very comfortable during our 4-day stay and can absolutely recommend the place. However, I would like to make two negative points. We didn't like the fact that the only small window in our deluxe room consisted of a frosted glass pane that concealed the view of an unsightly backyard shaft. This lack of views does not justify the high room rate. 
The final invoice automatically included a ‚Äúvoluntary tip‚Äù of 5 percent calculated on the total room price, which you are not obliged to pay. This is a unique and annoying procedure for us.",5,2024,09,25
113,"Beautiful house, miserable service","Beautiful house - so all the positives have been mentioned. The rooms look nice, but nothing works: problems with the electricity, hot water fails. Fire alarm goes off for no reason, shower doesn't drain... The room is cold and rushed. The worst is the breakfast: on the first day we waited 40 minutes, on the second over an hour for something to eat, not even bread... then we leave. But the hotel is full of external brunch guests. Miserable! Staff is very friendly, so 2 instead of 1 point",2,2023,11,25
113,Perfect weekend,Service and courtesy at the highest level. Cleanliness and order. Of note is George's Concierge service who helped us with courtesy and a smile. Excellent location in a quiet and elegant area. Metro station within walking distance and shops for all tastes,5,2023,09,03

113,"The Kensington, la ciliegina sulla torta","Basta svoltare l‚Äôangolo, che da Old Brompton Road immette su Queen‚Äôs Gate, per sentirsi subito catapultati in un‚Äôaltra realt√† e lasciarsi cos√¨ alle spalle il caos cittadino, tipico del  centro di Londra. Quella in cui sorge il The Kensington √®, infatti, forse, una delle zone pi√π tranquille ed affascinanti della citt√†, ma che, grazie alla posizione strategica, nonch√© alla moltitudine di servizi in offerti, consente in poco tempo di raggiungere le principali attrattive della splendida capitale.                                                                                                                          Elegante e raffinato, dallo stile tipicamente british, devo ammettere che questo hotel di lusso ha contribuito a rendere il mio soggiorno londinese ancora pi√π piacevole. Quello offerto dal The Kensington √®, infatti, un servizio impeccabile sotto molteplici punti di vista. I caminetti accessi, i fiori sempre freschi e l‚Äôarredamento di classe donano alle zone comuni una magica atmosfera, che riempie e scalda il cuore. Lo stesso vale anche per le camere ampie, pulite e ordinate, che, con uno stile impeccabile, ti accolgono come in un caldo e profumato abbraccio dopo una lunga giornata. Inutile dire che la colazione √® ottima e varia, adatta davvero a tutti i gusti (mia figlia ed io abbiamo scelto quella inglese e tutt‚Äôora sogniamo le uova alla benedict ed il french toast‚Ä¶!!!).                                                                                                                                                         Last but not least, un ringraziamento particolare a tutto il personale sempre accogliente e disponibile, ma mai invadente, pronto a soddisfare ogni richiesta con un sorriso (in tal senso, ci tengo a dedicare un ringraziamento speciale a Leandro, che da ben due anni ci accoglie calorosamente facendoci sentire come a casa).

113,Soggiorno gluten free lussuoso," Prima volta a Londra ed avendo una figlia celiaca e parlando poco l'inglese ero abbastanza preoccupato invece appena ricevuti i sorrisi e la cortesia del personale al check-in ho capito di essere nell' hotel ideale. Grazie anche alla presenza di personale italiano il problema della lingua √® stato subito superato, ma la cortesia e disponibilit√† ricevuta al momento della colazione mi ha piacevolmente sorpreso; infatti appena comunicato che avevamo bisogno di colazione gluten free √® venuta la responsabile di sala Barbara che si √® messa a disposizione proponendoci il loro men√π senza glutine e le varianti possibili. Essendo rimasti entusiasti della colazione alla sera abbiamo voluto provare i piatti della tradizione inglese rigorosamente GF, il fish&chips e l'agnello...deliziosi.
Dopo cena d'obbligo nelle raffinate sale illuminate da luce soffuse con sottofondo musicale dove, la presenza del caminetto acceso (anche in estate) rende l'atmosfera unica. Qui approfittare della grande scelta di cocktail e distillati del bar serviti al tavolo da Joao un came
riere brasiliano che impersona alla perfezione quei maggiordomi inglesi raffinati e riservati che si vedono nei film.
A questo punto dopo una lunga e frenetica giornata siete proprio  nel posto giusto, fuori il tempo scorre veloce ma voi siete al the Kensington e state gustando la vita.

113,Musicalbesuch London vom 17.09. bis 19.09,"Einer Empfehlung folgend haben wir f√ºr unseren Kurztrip 3 Tage London dieses Hotel gew√§hlt und sind nicht entt√§uscht worden. Das Haus hat einen eigent√ºmlichen Charme, den versteht auszuspielen. Angenehmer Empfang an der Rezeption, toller Service in der Lobby. Die Zimmer sind sauber und ordentlich eingerichtet, TV, Free WiFi sind vorhanden, genau wie die Minibar mit Kaffeemaschine und Safe.
Das Fr√ºhst√ºck wird in einer Art Bibliothek eingenommen, das Fr√ºhst√ºck ist gehaltvoll und bietet f√ºr jeden Geschmack etwas an.
Das Hotel bietet einen Pre-Theater Service, d.h. da das Restaurant erst um 18:00 Uhr √∂ffnet, kann man f√ºr 20 bis 25 Pounds ein 2 oder 3 G√§nge-Men√º vor der Vorstellung zu sich nehmen.
Die Hotelbar ist kuschelig und gut ausgestattet. 
Das Hoteleigene Restaurant, was wir auch besuchten zum Abendessen bietet eine ausrechende Speisenkarte und eine gepflegte Weinkarte. Wir k√∂nnen den Merlot empfehlen und frischen Lachs.

Wir werden wieder kommen!",5,2018,08,28
113,Sehr sch√∂nes Hotel,"Sehr sehr sch√∂nes Hotel mit tollem Flair ! 

Gegend: 
Das Hotel liegt im Stadtteil Kensington, somit in der gehobensten Ecke Londons. Direkt um die Ecke des Hotels sind zwei Underground Stations, und viele kleine gem√ºtliche Restaurants, die aufjedenfall zum Essen einladen.

Service: 
Alle im Hotel sind super nett, es fing schon an als unsere Koffer aufs Zimmer gebracht wurden, uns ein Regenschirm gehalten wurde, wenn es geregnet hat, ebenfalls wurden wir jeden Abend gefragt, ob wir ein Taxi ben√∂tigen. Zweimal am Tag kam der Zimmerservice und fragte uns, ob wir noch etwas ben√∂tigen. Der Service war klasse !

Zimmer:
Wir hatten ein kleines 24 Quadratmeter gro√ües Zimmer, zur Stra√üe hinaus. Das Zimmer war ausreichend f√ºr zwei Personen, zwar sehr klein, aber f√ºr eine St√§dtereise ideal. Von der Stra√üe h√∂rte man kein L√§rm nachts, wenn man das Fenster zu hatte. 

Essen:
Wir haben das Hotel ohne Fr√ºhst√ºck gebucht, da es uns zu teuer war, denn um au√üerdem waren um den Hotel herum, kleine B√§cker, wo man morgens fr√ºhst√ºcken konnte. Einen Morgen haben wir im Hotel gefr√ºhst√ºckt, die Preise sind nat√ºrlich hoch, aber das Fr√ºhst√ºck schmeckt aufjedenfall. 

Einmal waren wir auch im Hotel Abendessen, wovon ich eher abrate, etwas irritierend war n√§mlich die Speisekarte, die im Hotel Zimmer lag, man dachte, dass w√§re die Speisekarte f√ºr das Hotel Restaurant, allerdings stellte sich heraus, dass es die Speisekarte war, die zum Zimmerservice geh√∂rte. Im Hotelrestaurant ist toller Service, die Serviette bekommt man direkt auf den Scho√ü gelegt. Allerdings sind die Preise nicht nachvollziehbar, f√ºr zwei Pommes, zwei Ceaser Salads, eine Cola und ein Glas Wein  mussten wir um die 50 Pfund bezahlen. Die Speisekarte war meiner Meinung nach, auch nicht f√ºr jeden etwas!

",5,2018,05,20
113,Very British!,"Hier stimmt einfach alles. Sch√∂ne Zimmer, guter Service, Toplage, gutes Essen, zentral und ruhig. London zum Geniessen.

Wozu ist man denn in London ;‚Äì)",5,2018,04,17
113,Personal muy atento y amable,"El edificio es digno de ver, muy al estilo Londinense, completamente se integra con el resto de edificaciones de la calle.

Especial menci√≥n a George, que nos ameniz√≥ con sus charlas y su buen humor. Las habitaciones eran un poco peque√±as, con poco espacio libre, y los pasillos ya acusaban los a√±os.

Cuenta con un estupendo lobby. La habitaci√≥n es amplia, con una muy buena cama, dispone de frigobar, caja de seguridad, Nespresso y pava el√©ctrica. El lugar de guardado es correcto, al igual que el ba√±o.
Como detalles (MINIMOS) que no nos gustaron, consideramos que al ba√±o le faltaban ""herrajes"" para colgar las toallas y que al sector donde estaba la habitaci√≥n que nos toc√≥ en suerte, se llegaba luego de transitar unos pocos escalones (inc√≥modo para el movimiento de valijas). 
La atenci√≥n recibida fue excelente. Queremos destacar a Carlos, persona que se encarg√≥ de solucionar todas nuestras inquietudes (incluyendo un malentendido con la mercader√≠a del frigobar).

113,Very British! Very Good!,"Wir waren f√ºr einen Kurztripp in London und haben uns als Bleibe f√ºr das Hotel ‚ÄûThe Kensington‚Äú entschieden. Dies liegt in einer ruhigen Stra√üe im Stadtteil Kensington unweit der U-Bahnhaltestelle ‚ÄûSouth Kensintgon‚Äú und daher ist es gut √∂ffentlich zu erreichen.

Das Hotel selbst ist ein sch√∂nes kleines Boutique Hotel. Das Personal ist freundlich und zuvorkommend und das Hotel bietet ein wunderbares ‚Äûbritisches‚Äú Ambiente. In der Lounge und im Restaurant sind Kamine vorhanden, welche mit einem (Gas-)Feuer eine gem√ºtliche Stimmung verbreiten. Die Einrichtung ist stimmig und wirkt wertig.

Der sehr gute Afternoon Tea kann leider nur bei vorheriger Reservierung genommen werden. 

Unser Zimmer war etwas klein, aber sch√∂n eingerichtet und mit einem ordentlichen Bad versehen. Hier w√§re etwas mehr Platz sch√∂n, aber f√ºr ein Wochenende ist der Raum ausreichend gro√ü.

113,ELEGANZA A SOUTH KENSIGTON,"L'hotel The Kensington si trova a South Kensigton, uno dei quartieri residenziali pi√π eleganti e belli della citt√†, a pochi minuti dall'omonima stazione del Tube.
La posizione √® ottima: si √® in un quartiere bello, elegante, che offre bei negozi, ristoranti di ogni livello e pub tipici e grazie alla metropolitana si arriva in ogni punto interessante di Londra in pochi minuti.
L'hotel √® piuttosto elegante, bella lobby con doorman di giorno, bellissimi spazi comuni.
I servizi di reception sono perfetti: personale gentilissimo, disponibile ed abbiamo incontrato anche 2 o 3 persone dello staff italiane e questo pu√≤ aiutare chi abbia difficolt√† con l'inglese.
La colazione √® stupenda, con buffet ricchissimo e menu √† la carte, con preparazione di ottimo livello (consiglio i pancakes).
Anche il ristorante √® buono.
L'unica ragione per la quale non di 5 stelle √® la stanza: bella, con vista sul Queen's Gate, pulitissima, con ottimo servizio di pulizia (passano una seconda volta fra le 19 e le 21 per sistemare ancora la stanza se si vuole), connessione internet rapida e stabile, bagno pulito. Ma piccola, a fatica in due ci si gira, l'armadio √® piccolo al punto che non sapevamo dove sistemare i vestiti (ed abbiamo viaggiato con solo due trolley piccoli da bagaglio a mano per 3 giorni e mezzo di soggiorno) e la scrivania non consente di lavorare comodamente.
Prezzo non basso ma il rapporto qualit√†/prezzo √® molto buono dato che ci si trova a Londra in uno dei quartieri pi√π belli ed eleganti della citt√†.
Consiglio quindi l'hotel The Kensington a chi cerchi un bell'hotel elegante in quartiere di alto livello e che... non debba passare troppo tempo in stanza!",4,2017,12,05

Stock mit den sch√∂nen Toile de Jouy Tapeten. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck sollte man unbedingt hier genie√üen - alles schmeckt herrlich und die Auswahl an frischen Produkten ist gro√üartig. Ich liebte den French Toast mit Feigen aus der K√ºche.
Lounge, Restaurant/Fr√ºhst√ºcksraum sind sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet - zeitgen√∂ssisch modern und trotzdem behaglich. Abends sollte man unbedingt die Bar besuchen: die Cocktails sind wirklich fein.

Personale cortese e sempre sorridente.
Unico neo (ma non la ritengo una colpa del hotel o del personale) √® il bagno molto piccolo, capisco che a Londra √® difficile avere spazi grandi ma qui c'√® proprio un problema di arredamento che rende il bagno un po' scomodo.

113,Bellissimo!,"√à un bellissimo hotel, arredato con molto gusto in uno dei quartieri pi√π belli di Londra. A piedi da Harrods e dal museo di Storia Naturale. Grazie in particolare a George, che con la sus simpat√≠a ed i buonissimi consigli sui ristoranti ha reso la nostra vacanza molto piacevole. Ritorneremo!",5,2017,03,29
113,excelente ubicacion,"Muy buena ubicaci√≥n junto al museo de ciencias naturales en un barrio tranquilo pero con bastantes restaurantes y comercios a un paso. La estaci√≥n de metro de South Kensington esta muy cerquita.
 Muy bien el personal en especial Marrasa, espa√±ola que nos ayudo en todo lo que necesitamos y nos hizo mas f√°cil la estancia. Por poner un pero las habitaciones eran algo peque√±as. Volveremos.",5,2017,03,14
113,Perfetto con un piccolo neo,"Albergo perfetto, zona bellissima. Si √® immersi nella Londra pi√π bella, in albergo sembra di essere nel 1800 come ambientazione ma con tutti i confort moderni. Bello. Piccolo neo la colazione n√® ho viste di migliori.",5,2017,02,19
113,"Maravilloso, tanto en calidad como en trato","Nos alojamos en este hotel el primer fin de semana de este mes y solamente tengo buenas palabras para describir nuestra estancia. 
Nunca me hab√≠a sucedido que desde la agencia de viajes no confirmaran nuestra estancia. Al llegar, no exist√≠a reserva a nuestro nombre y lo que pod√≠a haberse convertido en algo bochornoso y una cuasi tragedia, los trabajadores del hotel lo convirtieron en una simple an√©cdota. Su capacidad resolutiva fue asombrosa. Desde la agencia no nos resolv√≠an el problema y sin embargo el hotel nos proporcion√≥ una habitaci√≥n mejor que la reservada, nos facilitaron mientras tanto las bebidas que necesit√°ramos, haci√©ndonos sentir c√≥modos desde el primer momento. Nos invitaron el √∫ltimo d√≠a a un afternoon tea y nuestro desayuno fue a la carta durante todo el fin de semana. Todo ello para revertir un error del que ni siquiera ellos eran responsables. 
Un gran hotel no solamente se mide por la comodidad de las instalaciones, por lo cuidadas que est√©n o el variado desayuno que tengan. A veces es m√°s importante el trato que se da al cliente, m√°s a√∫n cuando suceden estas cosas.
El Kensington Hotel es totalmente recomendable por su trato, su buen hacer, sus instalaciones, su variad√≠simo desayuno, su perfecta ubicaci√≥n (zona tranquila, hay una estaci√≥n de metro a un minuto andando y tiendas de todo tipo alrededor, adem√°s de la zona de museos justo en la calle de al lado)
Gracias a Nicol√°s, Cristina, Vincenzo, todo el personal de recepci√≥n, camareros y dem√°s personal por su exquisito trato en todo momento. 
Repetiremos la visita, esperamos que muy pronto.",5,2017,02,13
113,Excelente hotel. muy recomendado.,"Desde la agencia de viajes (carrefour viajes le√≥n) nos hicieron todo tipo de malas jugadas desde un inicio. como por ejemplo no reservarnos el hotel. una vez llegamos al hotel nos dijeron que no ten√≠amos reserva pero se pusieron a trabajar r√°pidamente para solucionarlo. llamando al tour-operador y a la agencia (los cuales se desentendieron) pronto consiguieron solucionar todo y no solo eso, sino que nos dieron una habitaci√≥n mejor, nos regalaron el desayuno a la carta el tiempo que estuvimos all√≠, nos invitaron a un afternoon tea de lujo a las tres personas que √≠bamos y se mostraron resolutivos y muy profesionales en todo momento.  

Sin duda volver√© a este hotel siempre que vaya a Londres y se lo recomendar√© a todo el mundo. Pero desde luego no dejar√© de hablar mal de Carrefour viajes quienes no solo hicieron mal la contrataci√≥n del hotel, sino todo lo dem√°s.",5,2017,02,13
113,Molto accogliente,"Ottimo hotel molto accogliente e con parti comuni ampie, accoglienti e molto ben arredate. Bello il ristorante dove viene servita un ottima colazione. Piacevole il bar per un bicchiere durante una pausa. La sera ottima illuminazione soffusa. Le camere sono piccole - in linea con la media londinese - ma ben arredate e confortevoli
Ben posizionato nel bel quartiere di South Kensington dista 10 minuti a piedi dal metro' ",5,2017,02,11
113,Meraviglia delle meraviglie!!,"Ho soggiornato qui la settimana prima di Natale con il mio fidanzato ed √® stato un sogno! L'hotel √® magnifico e si trova a 100mt dalla stazione di South Kensington (2minuti a piedi), la zona a mio parere √® una delle pi√π belle di Londra, ricca di ristorantini, bar e attrazioni ( musei e teatri..). Ho prenotato una Camera standard al primo piano ed aveva ogni comfort (prese corrente europee, set di cortesia completo, frigobar ben assortito, bollitore, macchina caff√® nespresso, ...). Prima colazione molto buona, room service ottimale e aperitivi eccezionali nella hall. Ringrazio tutto lo staff, in particolare Elisa della reception che ha saputo soddisfare ogni singola esigenza. 
Ritorneremo sicuramente.",5,2016,12,29
113,Molto piacevole,"Ambiente molto piacevole, con camini negli ambienti comuni. Stanze piccole ma molto confortevoli, c'√® addirittura la Nespresso per un buon caff√® appena svegli! Colazione ottima, con ogni scelta. Personale estremamente attento e molto gentile. Ci torner√≤ sicuramente.",5,2016,11,25
113,Klassisches Boutique Hotel in Kensington mit guter Lage,"Das Hotel selbst befindet sich in 4min Gehdistanz von der Tube-Station South Kensington (u.a.Picadilly Line vom Flughafen Heathrow (ca 40min direkt)). In unmittelbare N√§he befindet sich das Natural History Museum, Royal Albert Hall, Victoria and Albert Museum, Science Museum und nicht zu vergessen der Hyde Park. Von der Lage gibt es nichts auszusetzen. Mitunter einer der besten Lagen f√ºr London, sei das bez√ºglich der Wohnqualit√§t, aber auch der Anbindung in die Stadt. Die Picadilly Line kann tags√ºber manchmal sehr voll sein auf der Strecke.
Das Hotel selbst liegt direkt an der Queen's Gate. Die Freundlichkeit des Personals war sehr zuvorkommend und famili√§r. Es wurde immer gefragt, wie es einem geht. Fast schon asiatische Zust√§nde. Sehr positiv. Die Zimmer selbst sind eher klein gehalten, bedingt durch die Bauweise dieses Altbaus. Das Hotel befindet sich selbst in einem alten Reihenhaus in Kensington, was dazu f√ºhrt, dass die Zimmer zum Teil einen interessanten Grundriss haben, oder die G√§nge zu den Zimmer zum Teil mit Treppen unterbrochen sind und eng sind. Dies kann als Charme bezeichnet werden, mit gr√∂sseren Koffern, kann es jedoch etwas schwerf√§llig werden. Zum Gl√ºck waren wir nur mit Handgep√§ck unterwegs. Jedoch ist das Personal freundlich und hilfsbereit. Unser zweites Zimmer (das erste befand sich im 1. Stock Richtung Innenhof, direkt im Eck mit Blick auf AC und ohne Sonnenlicht) war klein, aber fein. Bequemes Kingsize Bett mit Wandschrank, Sessel, u.a. Das Bad jedoch war sehr sehr klein, bedingt durch die Bauweise. So dass es dazu f√ºhrte, dass man die Badezimmert√ºre nur bedingt √∂ffnen konnte, weil die Toilettensch√ºssel im Weg war. Aber die Ausstattung selbst vom Bad war einwandfrei, wenn auch etwas eng. 
Der administrative Prozess (Check-in, Check-out) lief ohne Probleme. Das Hotel selbst hat noch ein Restaurant, wo morgens Fr√ºhst√ºck serviert wird. Welches wir jedoch terminbedingt nicht probierten. Deshalb kann √ºber die Gastronomie keine Aussage getroffen werden.
Zusammenfassend w√ºrde ich dieses Hotel als ein kleines Schmuckst√ºck in perfekter Lage bezeichnen im alten Herrenhausstil, nicht moderig, jedoch f√ºr meinen Geschmack mit einem eher mittleren Preis-Leistungsverh√§ltnis und kleinen R√§umen. F√ºr Familien denke ich, ist das Hotel ungeeignet, trotz der tollen Lage zu den Museen. Es gibt weitere Hotels in der unmittelbaren Umgebung, zB gerade vis-a-vis, welche auch zu pr√ºfen sind.",4,2016,11,24
113,Meraviglioso,"Hotel sicuramente non economico ma che vale il costo della camera. Personale gentilissimo (ringrazio Elisa ed Anna) √® disponibile. Camera pulita seppure con moquette, non grandissima ma negli standard di Londra! In camera oltre al classico bollitore trovate la Nespresso. In bagno potete trovare alcuni prodotti davvero buoni. Colazione ottima nei bellissimi saloni dell'hotel. Metropolitana raggiungibile in pochissimi minuti a piedi. Segnalo che anche se non avete con voi un adattatore vicino alla TV potete inserire anche le prese italiane. 
Spero di tornarci presto!",5,2016,11,02

El lobby y el sal√≥n desayunador son exquisitos (aunque en nuestro paquete el desayuno no estaba incluido). La habitaci√≥n era muy hermosa, aunque un tanto peque√±a, y la cama era quiz√°s demasiado blanda. Al margen de eso, todo fant√°stico. Todo el personal, super eficiente y amable! Excelente la idea de incluir ""complimentary"" Nespresso en la habitaci√≥n. La ubicaci√≥n, inmejorable. South Kensington es una zona super bien ubicada, y el barrio es precioso!

113,Old Fusion,"un gran bell'albergo il The Kensington in Queen's Gate a Londra SW7 5LP.
In una vecchia casa londinese, vive la realt√† di quest'albergo, raffinata e moderna.
Gi√† dall'accoglienza del Bell Boy, s'intuisce che anche il resto non sar√† da meno. Mai abbandonato, durante le pratiche d'ingresso; viene offerta la tovaglietta umida,per dar ristoro al viaggiatore.
Con la chiave elettronica in mano, si sale ai piano, passando in quelle che sono le sale relax e che nel pomeriggio si trasformano in sopraffine sale da Th√®.
Corridoi stretti, tipici delle case inglesi, corrono verso le stanze. Queste sono eleganti e ben fornite, immancabile il bollitore con selezione di th√® e caff√®, quest'ultimo in cialde da inserire nella macchina del caff√® elettrica, anch'essa in dotazione.
Bagno pulito e ben corredato, manca il bid√©t, un classico, ma la doccia √® ad un braccio dal water.
Hotel silenzioso e tranquillo,per quanto South Kensington sia molto ben vissuto e trafficato.
Ottimo il bar che da la possibilit√† anche di fast meal, ma per un pasto normale c'√® il Town House, il ristorante che offre piatti fusion con varie sorprese della tradizione inglese.
Voglio chiudere questo mio excursus, raccontando della simpatia e della cordialit√† del personale, giovane e rapido. tra i receptionist potrei citare la signorina Lisa , o Sam, o Jamie... ma non voglio, perch√© sono tutti all'altezza: bravi, simpatici e puntuali !
Il resto lo fa Londra, con le sue attrazioni ludiche e culturali.

Das erste Zimmer was wir bekommen haben war F√ºr zwei Personen etwas zu klein (in London normal!) 
Wir haben aber ein gratis upgrade in eine bessere Zimmerkategorie bekommen Was wir auch sehr nett fanden....  Zimmer sauber und sehr individuell eingerichtet alles vorhanden was man ben√∂tigt...
A la Carte und Buffet zum Fr√ºhst√ºck.  
Fr√ºhst√ºck Buffet Sehr lecker, frisch und eine gute Qualit√§t, leider jeden Tag das Gleiche...aber in der Umgebung gibt es einige nette Lokale und die sorgen f√ºr noch mehr Abwechslung!!!

Camere non spaziosissime (come sempre s Londra) ma gradevoli e con un grande letto comodissimo.",5,2016,03,29
113,Tolles Hotel in gigantischer Lage mit erstklassigem Service,"The Kensington ist sehr sch√∂n gelegen, rund 500m von der Tube Station South Kensington (Picadlly, Circle und District Line - direkte Anbindung an Heathrow via Picadilly Line) entfernt umgeben von den f√ºr den Stadtteil so typischen wei√üen Reihenh√§usern. Das V&A, das Scienc Museem und die Royal Albert Hall sind zu Fu√ü erreichbar, genauso der Kensington Palace inkl. Kensington Gardens/Park und Hyde Park. Einige kleinere Restaurants befinden sich in direkter Nachbarschaft, genauso ein kleiner Supermarkt. Ansonsten ist die Gegend eher ruhig, das Nachtleben findet in London definitiv anderswo statt.
Absolut fantastisch ist der Service und die Freundlichkeit der Mitarbeiter, sowohl an der Rezeption als auch im Rest des Hauses. Bei meiner Ankunft gab es einige Schwierigkeiten mit der Buchung (Reiseveranstalter hatte was verbummelt....) Das Hotel hat diese Situation super gel√∂st, sodass ich selbst kaum etwas davon mitbekommen habe.

Die Auswahl beim Fr√ºhst√ºck ist so wie sie sein soll. Neben einem h√ºbschen Continental Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffett zaubert die K√ºche alles was das Full English Breakfast Herz begehrt.

113,Mi hogar en Londres,"Esa es la sensacion que tuvimos en el Kensington : nos sentimos como en casa.
Los hoteles pueden ser mas grandes o mas peque√±os, antiguos o modernos, con mayor o menor numero de comodidades.... Pero cuando en un hotel te hacen sentirte como si estuvieras en tu casa.... Es lo mas dificil de conseguir y lo que mas apreciamos. 
Por supuesto que volver√© todas las veces que vaya a Londres ya que ademas su situacion es inmejorable.

113,Un p√≥ delusa,"Voglio iniziare questa recensione facendo i miei complimenti a tutto il personale di sala: efficiente, professionale, cortese al massimo. Sono tutti giovanissimi √® molto preparati. Bravi ragazzi.
Purtroppo questo hotel mi ha delusa per altro. Al nostro arrivo la struttura sembrava effettivamente quello che ci aspettavamo, ma la sorpresa √® arrivata una vola giunti in camera. Una ""deluxe superior"" strettissima, con un soffitto bassissimo e claustrofobico, collocata alla fine di una serie di porte e scale(sembrava scendere in uno scantinato), maleodorante e con un bagno minuscolo, dove da sola nn riuscivo a muovermi. Naturalmente ho chiesto subito la sostituzione della camera, e soprattutto se realmente mi era stata assegnata una superior, perch√© quella non poteva nemmeno essere una standard.
Dopo qualche minuto di chiacchiere, per miracolo si sono accorti che c'era un'altra deluxe disponibile, al secondo piano con vista sulla strada principale, che stranamente durante il check-in era sfuggita a chi ci aveva accolto. Bha, trattamento discutibile che mi ha lasciato davvero interdetta. Fortuna che il nostro soggiorno, nella nuova camera, sia proseguito nel modo migliore.",3,2016,01,11
113,Intimo,L'hotel in buona posizione (a piedi si raggiunge Harrods). Il personale √® molto accogliente. L'unico difetto sono le camere le quali sono decisamente piccole. Il prezzo che abbiamo speso mi sembra eccessivo per quello che offrono.,4,2016,01,08
113,"Ottime atmosfera e parti comuni, camere minuscole ","Posizione magnifica defilata dal caos del centro in elegante quartiere residenziale. Graziosa atmosfera dei salotti della hall con camini accesi e ottima colazione. Le camere sedicenti ""superior"" in effetti sono le entry level e sono minuscole, con bagno minuscolo ovviamente senza bidet. Assegnata camera con unica finestra oscurata e sigillata, sostituita solo dopo vive rimostranze! Sgradevole scricchiolio notturno dei pavimenti e fastidiosi rumori e TV accese dalle camere attigue.",4,2016,01,06
113,Accogliente Atmosfera e professionalit√†,"Le parti comuni sono molto belle e curate nei dettagli. Gli addobbi natalizi eleganti .
Personale gentile e professionale.

Nel pomeriggio all'ingresso vi offriranno dei dolcetti deliziosi e una sorta di vino caldo dolce molto piacevole.
Nel complesso una bella esperienza.",4,2016,01,01

Mi piace molto perch√© √® situato nel centro di Londra e questo ti  aiuta per poterti muovere meglio.

113,Hotel da consigliare a occhi chiusi (occhio al prezzo),"Ci sono stato in un inizio estate. Siamo in una zona di Londra borghese, residenziale per eccellenza, sicurissima, abbastanza trafficata, ma non troppo. L'albergo rispecchia la prima impressione: la struttura - seppur un po' datata - √®  di grande impatto e offre la possibilit√† di un soggiorno ideale in camere belle e spaziose. Anche la prima colazione √® sicuramente a livello dell'albergo. Servizio reception: possono tendere - com'√® accaduto a me - a scambiarvi con il titolare di un'altra camera e addebitarvi in conto un'ordinazione che.....voi non avete mai fatto. All'apparenza gentili e disponibili nel risolvere la situazione a vostro favore (e ci mancherebbe!), anche se la loro reazione - credo - avrebbe dovuto essere ancora pi√π professionale.
In ogni caso - a parte il disguido che ha coinvolto soltanto me - √® un hotel da consigliare a occhi chiusi (naturalmente, √® quasi ovvio sottolinearlo: le tariffe non sono popolarissime....).",4,2015,08,28

Cuenta con un secador de pelo profesional. El lcd tiene salida hdmi y usb, la cr√≠tica con respecto a esto es que no funcionaba ninguna de las dos entradas.
En el desayuno hab√≠a facturas, panes de diferentes clases, variedades de jugos. Los huevos, el tocino, las tostadas y alguna que otra cosa mas se pedian por carta, tiene costo salvo para los que tienen contratado el desayuno buffet. 
En la recepci√≥n siempre dispuestos a ayudarnos. Pidan el mapa para poder moverse sin dificultad, en el mismo tambi√©n est√° el mapa de la red de metros. Nosotros nos alojamos en el piso 5 y el wifi era super veloz

Situato in una zona ben servita, ci sono ristoranti, supermercati, farmacie, bar, ecc..vicino al museo di storia naturale, camminando si arriva in un quarto d'ora da harrods o ad hide park.  E' un tipico albergo stile inglese, ben isolato e quindi senza rumori, abbastanza pulito, il personale gentile, soprattutto Victoria sempre disponibile e precisa, anche il ristorante italiano √® ottimo, unici difetti il parquet scricchiola sotto i piedi, il lavandino aveva 2 rubinetti e quindi era impossibile miscelare l'acqua, per accedere alla camera, situata al secondo piano, una volta arrivato al pianerottolo con l'ascensore, dovevo scendere dei gradini scomode quando si hanno le valigie.

113,Ein bisschen Ruhe in der Stadt London!,"Wir waren an letzt Silvester  da und wollten eigentlich zuerst in das Sheraton. Unsere Reiseleitung machte jedoch ein Fehler sodass wir uns dann f√ºr das Kensington entschieden hatten. 
Und es war TOP!

Das Personal war √ºberall sehr freundlich, wir waren schnell in der Stadt und das Fr√ºhst√ºck sowie die ""Tea- Time"" waren exzellent! 

Wenn ich nach London reise, w√ºrde ich immer wieder in das Kensington Hotel, weil es in der Zimmern √§usserst leise, sauber und ger√§umig war. Man ist sehr schnell in der Stadt (mit dem Taxi) und mit der Tube (relativ) schnell am Flughafen. Aber man kann nicht alles haben ;-)

Das Fr√ºhst√ºck war nicht inbegriffen und sehr teuer, aber f√ºr Fr√ºhst√ºcksliebhaber alle Mal den Preis Wert! F√ºr diejenigen die ausser einem Kaffe nicht viel brauchen gibt es noch eine Lobby welche ebenfalls Kaffe oder Tee serviert oder gleich um die Ecke ein Starbucks!

√úbrigens in der Hotelbar hatte ich den besten ""Passion Fruit Martini"" auf der ganzen Welt! Unbedingt Probieren- Sehr zu empfehlen!",5,2014,12,12

113,Che meraviglia!,"Hotel situato nel quartiere, stupendo, dal quale prende il nome. Vecchio stabile recentemente e sapientemente ritrutturato, molto elegante. Camere molto ben disposte ed arredate, un tantino piccole, considerato il livello dell'albergo, ma dotate di tutti i confort. Da buoni Inglesi, in camera anche un grande ombrello, che per fortuna non ci √® servito. Gli spazi comuni  sono eleganti ed il personale √® decisamente professionale, preparato e cortese. Alla reception tre addetti, multilingue, ti ricevono sempre con il sorriso sulle labbra. Che dire di Elisa che ci ha accolti in italiano e facendoci chiacchierare ha scoperto che eravamo in viaggio per festeggiare l'anniversario di matrimonio. Sorpesa: la sera dell'anniversario ci hanno fatto trovare dei dolci auguri in camera e ci hanno offerto due coppe di champagne al luonge bar dell'Hotel. Ottima la colazione continentale, ed ottime le due cene nel ristorante dell'hotel. Da citare il bar, con il responsabile (bolognese, bravo Alessandro) campione e specializzato in cocktails, di una professionalit√† e cortesia uniche. E' stato un soggiorno decisamente piacevole; se torneremo a Londra sappiamo gi√† dove soggiornare.",5,2014,09,16

Purtroppo la mia camera (la 334) era orrenda , piccola , e con affaccio sui motori dell aria condizionata. INACCETTABILE. Questo per√≤ me lo aspettavo avendo preso una offerta last minute.... ci passo quindi sopra. Quello su cui proprio non passo sopra √® la poca cortesia del personale: poco sorridente (anzi quasi scocciato), poco disponibile , e zero efficiente. Per un 5 stelle su questa cosa non ci passo sopra.  Continuo a pensare che gli hotel di Londra sono troppo cari per quello che realmente valgono e il kensington hotel fa parte della categoria.... Non so se ci tornerei",2,2014,09,06
113,ottima posizione e ambienti di charme,"Staff disponibile, camere di charme ( anche se, al solito per londra, molto piccole), ambienti confortevoli.

113,5 stelle piacevole ma molto basico,"L'albergo √® situato a South Kensington, quartiere molto elegante, a pochi passi dalla metropolitana. 
Non √® il mio primo soggiorno in questo albergo, e malgrado sia globalmente soddisfatto ci sono sempre alcuni difetti che riappaiono.
Punti forti sono la posizione (come gi√† detto il Kensington √® in un quartiere molto bello) e le parti comuni (bella hall, saloni molto grandi e sale della colazione recentemente ridecorate). Per quel che √® degli aspetti negativi cominciamo dalle camere: la dimensione (le camere piccole sono davvero, davvero piccole, promettono 16 m2 ma nel calcolo dev'essere compreso anche il bagno e una parte del corridoio adiacente), la decorazione (standardizzata), e la manutenzione (un lenzuolo era bucato, sul copriletto c'era una macchia, l'aerazione del bagno non funzionava e lo scarico del lavandino faceva fatica a scorrere). Altri punti negativi sono il concierge, inutile, e la colazione, molto povera per un albergo di questo livello.",4,2014,08,04
113,Comodo e pulito,"Situato  in un punto molto comodo per vedere bene Londra, a due passi dalle vie dello shipping e ben servito dalla metro. E' una scoperta per gli standard qualitativi londinesi. Stanze pulitissime anche se un po' caro. Ma ne vale la pena",5,2014,07,18

Sie sind gerne f√ºr Ihre G√§ste da. W√ºnsche werden erf√ºllt, so konnte z.B. ich mein Zimmer innerhalb von k√ºrzester Zeit upgraden lassen, obwohl im Haus sehr viel Betrieb war. Mein Respekt! 
Warum ich nicht die volle Punktzahl gegeben habe.........liegt  nur an dem sichtbaren Alter einzelner Einrichtungsgegenst√§nde, das Bad und die Sideboards m√ºssten mal erneuert oder aber √ºberarbeitet werden.

113,GREAT EXPERIENCE,"Hotel in stile Regency, molto elegante, con una sobriet√† tipicamente inglese, situato in Queen's Gate zona Kensington, 200 metri dalla fermata di South Kensington. 
Interno egualmente in stile Regency, senza eccessi e con molta luce: spazi publici,lobby bar ristorante e sala lettura, molto ampi e ben curati. Servizio straordinario, sia alla reception che al concierge e al servizio in camera. Grande cura nell'ospitalit√† (giornali, complimentary gifts, ...) ottimo il bar ed eccellente la colazione, sia l'inglese che la continentale. Camere molto curate nell'arredamento  e fornite di tutti i confort tradizionali (dalle ciabattine al bollitore ). Prezzo della camera e del breakfast molto equilibrato e sicuramente inferiore al valore del servizio offerto. Unico rilevo negativo : la dimensione delle camere, limitata anche se lo spazio √® sfruttato in maniera molto efficiente.",5,2013,09,29
113,un soggiorno abbastanza buono,"Siamo stati ospiti del ""The Kensington Hotel"" di Londra ( Queen's Gate) per sei giorni; √® stata un'esperienza abbastanza piacevole, anzitutto per l'ottima posizione dell'Hotel ubicato in uno dei quartieri pi√π raffinati ed eleganti di Londra, a pochi passi dalla importante Stazione di ""South Kensington"", dal Museo delle Scienze Naturali, e dai magazzini ""Harrods"". 
Gli ambienti comuni sono molto belli e ricreano abbastanza bene l'atmosfera ""old England"";
il personale √® molto gentile e premuroso, ma nella  ""hall"" non si trova un addetto che parli italiano;per fortuna molti dei camerieri sono ragazzi italiani; la colazione continentale √® abbastanza buona, ma non eccezionale per un ""5 stelle""; le camere sono piuttosto piccole ma confortevoli; mentre molto deludenti i servizi igienici, in quanto veramente  angusti e piuttosto scomodi.
Non √® prevista la visione  di un canale in lingua italiana, mentre √® possibile seguire persino la TV tunisina; alla nostra richiesta di poter seguire un canale italiano, il personale della ""Hall"" ha risposto che era impossibile sintonizzarsi.
In definitiva, un hotel senz'altro consigliabile, ma vale ""mezza stella"" in meno.",4,2013,09,02
113,Buona accoglienza,"Vicino alla metro e buona location per visitare Londra. La struttura √® piacevole, complessivamente nella media, ma da ripetere.

Camere non grandi ma particolarmente confortevoli, dotate di tutti i comfort:accappatoio e ciabattine, bollitore con caff√® e tea. Coccolati da "" cookies and milk"" abbiamo trascorso un piacevolissimo soggiorno. 
Consigliato alle famiglie ed a chi cerca l'alta qualit√† del servizio. Un pensiero affettuoso al personale del l'albergo estremamente gentile e premuroso. Ci ritorneremo!",5,2013,08,21
113,"sch√∂nes, gem√ºtliches und zentralgelegenes Hotel","Das Hotel hat eine gute zentrale Lage. Die n√§chste U-Bahnstation ist in 5 Min Fu√üweg erreichbar. Mit der U-Bahn ist man in wenigen Minuten im Herzen Londons. Das Rezeptionspersonal war sehr freundlich und stand f√ºr alle Fragen kompetent zur Verf√ºgung. Unser Zimmer war sehr sauber und ruhig. Pubs, Restaurants, Geldautomaten sowie Einkaufsm√∂glichkeiten findet man direkt um die Ecke. Da die √úbernachtung im Zusammenhang eines Preisausschreibens war kann ich zum √úbernachtungspreis leider nichts sagen. Die Leistungen sowie der Service waren aber Top! (abends war das Bett aufgeschlagen und Hausschuhe standen davor; auf dem Kissen lag der Wetterbericht f√ºr den n√§chsten Tag sowie Schokolade)",5,2013,07,05
113,Muy Amables,"Estamos alojados en el hotel, la atenci√≥n es excelente, la gente que trabaja aqu√≠ es muy amable. La habitaci√≥n es MUY chica sin lugar para guardar nuestras cosas. No tienen rampa para subir el cochecito del bebe y hay que cargarlo por las escaleras, casi siempre hay alguien que nos ayuda pero no es muy c√≥modo.
Todo lo dem√°s muy bien.",4,2013,07,02
113,Lo consiglio,"Un ottimo hotel per vistare Londra o per viaggi di lavoro. Mi sono fermata solo due notti, ma ho trovato un buon rapporto qualit√†/prezzo e una buona combinazione di location, servizi e accoglienza del personale.",4,2013,06,30
113,Fantastico hotel en pleno Kennsigton,"Un estupendo hotel con un servicio fantastico. He estado varias veces y siempre nos han atendido divinamente. La decoraci√≥n es una mezcla entre cl√°sico y moderno muy lograda. El edificio y la calle donde esta situado son tipicamente londinenses. Me encantan los salones y el bar. Hay habitaciones de diferentes tamanos, la suite es estupenda.",5,2013,06,29
113,PERFETTO ma.......,"Posizione ottima per la zona che √® molto bella, per la vicinanza alla tube station di South Kensington , curato e pulito. Personale attento e gentile sempre pronto ad esaudire ogni richiesta in tempi brevissimi, buona la colazione. I ragazzi del bar sono italiani molto cordiali e professionali. Abbiamo trascorso 5 notti  in un bello Studio al quarto piano, in realt√† avevamo prenotato una De-luxe ma carinamente ci hanno fatto un up-grade di loro totale iniziativa. Quindi che dire?..Perfetto ma.... purtroppo per noi c'√® stato un problema. Ovvero l'edificio anche se totalmente e pure con gusto ristrutturato di recente √® il vecchio tipico edificio londinese con una spessa moquette sul pavimento che per√≤ non riesce a coprire i forti scricchiolii del sottostante pavimento in legno. E se vi accade come √® successo a noi di avere sopra la testa ( al quinto ed ultimo piano) degli ospiti estremamente rumorosi fino dalle 6.30 o quasi del mattino non √® il massimo!!! Quindi consiglio vivamente questo hotel ma con camera al quinto piano!!!",4,2013,06,03
113,A due passi dai parchi reali inglesi,La prima volta a londra sono rimasto per cinque giorni in questo delizioso hotel vicino alla stazione metro di south kensington dove ho trovato la possibilita di fare colazione italiana con cappuccino e cornetti al burro e dopo via verso le meraviglie storiche e moderne di questa cosmopolita citta. Hotel confortevole e molto ben organizzato con personale gentile e pronto a soddisfare ogni richiesta lo consiglio per la tranquillita e la meraviglia di queen s gate.,4,2013,04,28
113,Buena localizaci√≥n. Relaci√≥n calidad-precio mejorable.,"Hotel antiguo, pero bien cuidado. Estuvimos en una habitaci√≥n doble de luxe que no val√≠a lo que costaba. La oferta que aprovechamos inclu√≠a el desayuno buffet (magn√≠fico) pero me toc√≥ cada uno de los cinco d√≠as el tener que aclararle al maitre que ten√≠a el desayuno incluido, lo cual  result√≥ bastante desagradable. La localizaci√≥n, en South Kensington, me pareci√≥ estupenda, pero s√≥lo volver√≠a a alojar,e en este hotel si el precio fuera m√°s acorde con lo que ofrece.",3,2013,04,15
113,Il personale NON fa la differenza.,"Albergo elegante, formale e classico, situato in una bellissima zona e a due passi dalla stazione tube. Buona la cura dei dettagli e i cocktails al bar.
La stanza bella e spaziosa, anche se un po' fredda nonostante il riscaldamento al massimo.
Ma il personale √® davvero non all'altezza della situazione. A parte il capo barman, dalla reception al manager di sala, c'√® stato un totale menefreghismo rispetto a richieste e cortesie che, per me che lavoro negli alberghi, non √® concepibile.
Oltre alla lentezza del servizio quando si fanno richieste dalla stanza.",3,2013,04,02
113,L'eleganza,Beh devo dire che ogni volta che entro mi sento a casa! L'atmosfera molto calda. Colazione top e il personale ti riconosce sempre! L'unica nota a mio parere negativa √® il troppo caldo in camera pur spegnendo il condizionatore! Tutto sommato √® da provare e lo consiglio vivamente ,5,2013,03,08
113,Gutes Hotel mit sehr gutem Preis-Leistungs-Verh√§ltniss,"Bin 2 bis 3 Mal im Jahr beruflich in London und √ºbernachte hier immer wieder gerne. Das Peronal ist sehr freundlich, alles ist sauber und ordentlich, das Fr√ºhst√ºck ist vielf√§ltig und die Lage super. Die Zimmer sind recht klein, was aber f√ºr London normal ist und mich auf einer kurzen Gesch√§ftsreise nicht st√∂rt. (Das w√§re privat und zu zweit sicher anders.)

113,London Break,"Per dovere o per diletto pu√≤ capitare di andare a Londra. Albergo √® nei pressi di High Kensington. Non grande, elegante e accogliente allo stesso tempo. Estremeamente gentile il personale, tutto giovanissimo, sorridente in ogni occasione.

113,Excelente servicio y buena ubicaci√≥n,"Me quede tres dias en este hotel y me encanto. Los cuartos son muy comodos, el staff muy simpatico y la ubicaci√≥n es ideal. A pocas cuadras de la estaci√≥n de South Kensington y muy cerca a restaurantes, tiendas y cafes.

113,"Classe, tradizione, professionalit√† e gentilezza","Non scrivo mai recensioni ma faccio un eccezione per il Kensington Hotel.
Posizione fantastica. Lusso non ostentato. Accogliente e caldo. Gentilezza, cordialita, disponibilita e non da ultimo, per essere in Inghilterra, pulizia
A casa lontano da casa.
Devo amettere che ho ricevuto un upgrade avendo prenotato ad una tariffa vantaggiosa perche in un mio precedente soggiorno al Bloomsbury Hotel (facente parte dello stesso gruppo) avevo avuto dei disservizi nonostante la stessa gentilezza e professionalita che ho trovato al Kensington.
Sicuramente segliero ancora il Kensington che riese a fidelizzare e coccolare ogni suo cliente.",5,2013,01,07
113,"Es un buen hotel, las habitaciones dobles son peque√±as","El personal de recepci√≥n atent√≠simos, en el comedor no tendr√°s problemas si hablas espa√±ol, y se desviven por atender. Las cenas y desayunos buffet (cenas repetitivas y de escaso sabor, la macedonia es insipida) pero teniendo en cuenta la media de hoteles de Londres y el precio no est√° mal. Las habitaciones limpias y la situaci√≥n del hotel es magn√≠fica, el barrio est√° lleno de tiendas, pubs, la zona es elegante y bien situada a unos 10 minutos a pie de Harods.",4,2013,01,06
113,Finalmente,"Finalmente un hotel che mantiene le promesse senza lussi inutili ed eccessivi, completamente fuori moda oggi e nel futuro, che fornisce un servizio preciso ed impeccabile sempre e che, gi√† dalle piccole cose, denota un management pensante : ad esempio la batteria di prese gi√† pronte per le varie esigenze (addio adattatore). 
Per il resto...posizione ottima, townhouse ""rinnovata"" e cos√¨ via. 
Consigliabilissimo.",4,2012,12,10
113,A 300 metri dalla fermata di Kensington South dell'underground,"Personale gentilissimo, molto disponibile. La sera nel salotto comune c'era il camino acceso. Stanza molto, molto spaziosa, con poltrona, pouff gigante, tavolo e vetrata enorme che dava proprio sul caff√® italiano ""La Bottega"" (ottimi caff√® e cappuccini). Letto superconfortevole e grande, cuscini di piume, lenzuola e copripiumino impeccabili. Bagno super pulito, ampio, molto accessoriato e caldo con asciugacapelli vero (non alla parete). TV al plasma da 32 pollici, armadio doppio con diverse commodities: termos elettrico, assortimento di t√®, caff√®, zuccheri e dolcetti. Una cosa da non sottovalutare: in camera ci sono le doppie prese: quelle inglesi a tre poli e quelle europee a due poli. Unico neo: non hanno camere per fumatori!
Raccomando senz'altro per soggiorni di lavoro.",5,2012,09,21

113,un po' delusa,"iniziamo dai lati positivi: l'hotel √© molto ben situato, il personale gentile e molto educato, le parti comuni magnifiche. Il mio problema √© stata la stanza:situata al primo piano, molto piccola, senza un'anticamera, con bagno piccolissimo e senza finestra. Abbiamo cercato pi√π volte di cambiarla ma ce ne hanno proposta o una ancora pi√π piccola (!) oppure un'altra situata sempre al primo piano sulla facciata e quindi molto molto rumorosa (e comunque grossomodo grande come la prima, salvo il bagno). Ho avuto l'impressione che non abbiano fatto del loro meglio per trovare una soluzione e questo mi √© dispiaciuto molto e, in parte, ha rovinato il mio soggiorno. Per una stanza di quel tipo il prezzo √© veramente eccessivo.",2,2011,12,21
113,Pi√∫ che Doppia superior √® una mini superior!,"Struttura molto bella nel cuore di uno dei quartieri pi√∫ eleganti di Londra. Camera decisamente piccola (la 103) anche se spacciata per ""superior"" con un bagno ben rifinito ma piccolissimo,  con una doccia molto comoda. Un mini armadio e una finestra che √® meglio non aprire (da su un cortile interno un p√≥ abbandonato). Vani i tentativi di cambiarla: tre notti in nemmeno 10 mq. ad un prezzo decisamente alto. Meglio un albergo un p√≥ decentrato ma con camere pi√π spaziose e accoglienti!",3,2011,12,08
113,Grande delusione!,"Ho soggiornato al Kensington dal 6 al 10 novembre, in occasione del WTM di Londra, e sono rimasto profondamente deluso.
Ero gi√† stato in quest'hotel, con la mia famiglia, due anni f√† e mi ero trovato abbastanza bene. Ho trovato il servizio molto peggiorato (non da 5 stelle).
Ho prenotato una camera superior (circa 300 ‚Ç¨ al giorno) e mi hanno dato una camera al 4¬∞ piano di pochi metri quadri e con una serie di problemi. Il bagno era mignon ed il corridoio di accesso alla camera era molto stretto (in barba ai ns. standard - min. 1,20 m).
Alle mie rimostranze alla reception mi era stato assicurato il cambio camera, che puntualmente non √® avvenuto.
Sicuramente non ci ritorner√≤.
Che delusione!!!!!",2,2011,11,18
113,perfetto,"Ho soggiornato in questo Hotel pi√π di una volta e sempre con ottima soddisfazione,
la struttura √® di recente ristrutturazione ed √® in tipico stile londinese, √® ubicata tra i quartieri pi√π esclusivi della capitale ed √® molto vicina alla fermata della metro di South Kensington.
Le camere sono molto confortevoli e pulite, le standard sono di modeste dimensioni mentre salendo di categoria aumenta di conseguenza anche il comfort, consiglio una camera studio √® veramente charmant.
Il personale √® cortese e professionale, la colazione e il ristorante sono ben proporzionati al contesto.

Eins mit King Size Beet und 1 Zimmer mit Twin Beds. Was wir erhalten haben waren zwei Zimmer min. 50 m. voneinander entfernt !. Nach Beschwerde haben wir 2 Zimmer nebeneinander mit Queen Betten erhalten. In ein Zimmer wurde ein Mini Zusatzbett gestellt. Es ist entt√§uschend wenn die Zimmer nicht der Rservierung entspricht.
