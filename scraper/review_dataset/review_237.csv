237,A GEM.  With a capital G!,"From the way we were greeted, professional, friendly and VERY helpful a true gem of a hotel.  Clean, good breakfast and first class service.  Only mediocre service was at the bar.  Otherwise this is truly the best hotel in Dublin.   And, I stay in two hundred room nights a year.",5,2024,10,18
237,Definitely a Fav!!,"I'm a 37 yr business traveler and a Hilton Diamond member so I've stayed at my fair share of hotels over the years  - and a fair number of them were Hiltons.
I've not held back when a hotel isnt worth it, and it's only fair that I also point out when a hotel is good.
....and the Morrison is very-very good. My wife and I spent four nights there in late July 2023.
The hotel is fine, It's in a great central location in Dublin, walking close to most everything and has everything that you expect in a Hilton property.  Walk through the door and it's quiet, clean and spacious - an oasis in the city center.
But in this hotel the staff makes the difference.  From the moment we checked in (Axel Jaufur was outstanding - quick, accommodating and efficient) to when we (sadly) left the staff was courteous, friendly and helpful - even the housekeeping staff! I view that as a sign of a well-run hotel.  Good job.
The breakfast area is wonderful, well stocked with a mix of breakfast foods and coffee drinks.  I saw the area manager several times walking the floor to check on the cleanliness and flow - always a good sign - but the manager was helped by a staff that was very friendly and efficient.  This was the highlight of the stay for me because you may go elsewhere for lunch and dinner but you never stray too far before coffee.
The bar is great and the restaurant is excellent and top end, so much so that in a city full of good restaurants we ate dinner there - twice!
Call the desk and there will be a taxi waiting for you and the front desk is very good at handling questions and requests.  let them know what you are interested in and they will offer suggestions.
I would absolutely-absolutely stay at this hotel again.  I do recommend that you spend the extra money and get a room facing the river.  The street noise (we were on the second floor) is not an issue and the view is worth it.

237,Good location,"Wonderful hotel! Located just across the river from the Temple Bar area, this hotel was close to the tourist attractions yet far enough away that you can get a great night's sleep.  There is also a good restaurant and lounge.  We enjoyed our stay at The Morrison.",5,2024,10,18
237,Until Next Time,"Best way to kickoff our 3-week adventure in the isles. We spent four wonderful nights at the center of life in the very walkable city of Dublin.   A short taxi ride from DUB, extraordinarily accessible. Friendly and helpful staff. Started off our mornings with a sumptuous breakfast. The fitness center met my every workout needs -- well maintained equipment. We will certainly be back. Highly recommended.",5,2024,10,17
237,Great stay will be back,"LOVED this hotel.  it is perfect location to all our tours we did and to the happening spots in dublin.  Close to Temple Bar  we took cabs from the front of the hotel, food was great, staff was very friendly and helped us do anything we needed.  PERFECT stay in dublin.",5,2024,10,16
237,Very good place to stay in Dublin,"I stayed two nights for leisure as a couple. It was my first trip to Dublin.  My stay was the last leg of Ireland trip, and very nice wrap up of the journey.  It was located at the very center of the city that most of the places were either by walking distance or with short public transpotation.

Checkin and checkout process were very smooth and easy.  Staffs were very friendly.    Lakisha was very helpful, recommending certain public bars. We enjoyed very famous one as was advised.  I was recognized as the Diamond member and got upgrade.  Breakfast was excellent with combination of Buffet and kitchen menus.  The room was very clean and modern with a good space for a hotel in city center.

Definitely a must-stay place on next trip to Dublin.",5,2024,10,14
237,Best Hotel on the Liffey,"My stay here went perfectly! The hotel is situated on the banks of the Liffey River, on the quiet other side of the river from the Temple Bar pub scene and just a few more minutes to Trinity College and its Book of Kells.  The service has been gracious, thoughtful, and attentive in every area, from the concierge and front desk (special thanks to Bianca but really to everyone), to the servers at breakfast each morning, to housekeeping, and to room service staff (special thanks to  Roney).  Before I’ve only stayed at the Shelbourne, but the service and location here was at the very least a comparable or even better experience because of the ultra attentive staff.",5,2024,10,12
237,Rooms are way too stuffy.,"Our room was stuffy, and it seems likely that yours will be too.

The first night we showed up, at about midnight, our room was stuffy - probably 3 degrees warmer than I would consider comfortable. I discovered the thermostat on the wall and turned it on. A note says that it will take 15 minutes for it to fully activate, so I didn't think much more about it and fell asleep. I tossed and turned a few times during the night, but by morning it was (slightly) cool, and I assume all would be well.

The next night, it seemed slightly cooler at bedtime, so I went to sleep, and then tossed and turned throughout the night when it was still stuffy.

The next morning I told the rep at the check-in desk that our room was too warm and I couldn't sleep. She apologized, took my room number, and promised that a maintenance person would be up to fix it. We were out for the day, and came back around 6:00pm, and noticed that the room was still stuffy. I went back to the front desk and advised that the room was still stuffy and the person at the desk called maintenance, chatted for a minute, then told me not to worry because the air conditioner works on a timer and raises the temperature between 11am and 7pm, but my room should be cool by bed time.

You can guess how this went. My room was still stuffy. My wife had fallen asleep and I decided I wasn't going to wake her by calling hotel service, having someone come up to our room, or changing rooms. I tossed and turned throughout the night because it was so stuffy.

The next morning I was a little more firm in my complaint to the front desk. This time it appears they did actually adjust the temperature, but they also brought a fan up to my room. Between those, I *finally* had a comfortable night after 3 nights of horrible sleep.

And the kicker... when I was talking to the person at the desk about this, and we wrapped up because I had a fan, I overheard the gentleman next to me talking to another person at the front desk, complaining that he got horrible sleep because his room was uncomfortably warm. And then I saw the other reviews of this hotel mentioning that it's too warm.

This seems a perpetual problem with the hotel, not confined to one room, not confined to one day when the A/C wasn't working. This hotel is just too warm. And why you can't individually adjust the temperature in your room to suit your comfort is completely beyond me.

Another thing that irked me: The desk gave my wife and me drink coupons as a ""sorry"" for the warm room. We sat down at the bar, presented our coupons, and asked for a drink we enjoyed the night before in the restaurant. After the bartender called the desk and even told them which room we were in, she came back and told us that the coupon was only good for their cheapest drinks (e.g., house wine), and not for the ones we asked for. What a dismal experience.",2,2024,10,11
237,Modern hotel on the north side of Liffey,"Stayed one night and wish that I could have stayed longer. I booked a king room and it was clean, modern and well maintained. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was spacious (they put me in a room that was disabled-friendly even though I did not request it). There were lots of grab bars and special fittings for the toilet presumably to help those using wheelchairs. 

The staff is friendly and helpful. I checked in early morning and left my luggage there and when my room was ready, they had already moved my luggage to the room. 

The breakfast was very good, with Irish breakfast buffet selections as well option to ordering a la carte hot dishes for the same price (I booked the bed and breakfast option). The fruit and pastries were fresh. 

The location is convenient, right on the north side of the Liffey river on Ormond Quay Lower. It is a five minute walk to catch the Dublin Express bus to the airport at Ormond Quay Upper, which takes about half an hour to the airport. Coming from the airport, Dublin Express can also drop you at Wellington Quay on the other side of the river and it is also a five minute walk to hotel. It’s a short walk to Temple Bar area, Ha’Penny bridge and rest of city center. 

I will be back!",5,2024,10,08
237,Highly recommended,Front desk team was amazing from check in to check out.  This evening they provided sound departure advice and helped make arrangements for our “too early” flight in the morning.   Provided necessary directions as well as umbrellas when needed.  Lovely accommodations and delicious food at both restaurants. Highly recommend!.,5,2024,10,07
237,Great hotel in close proximity to the Temple Bar area,"Great hotel near the Lissy River and the Temple Bar area. Clean and modern. Very close proximity to Trinity College, lots of shopping and tons of restaurants / pubs. If you have a car they will validate the parking for a nearby garage. We paid only 12 Euros at the garage for overnight parking.",5,2024,10,05
237,The Morrison - The Place ⭐️,"We recently stayed at The Morrison for a Global conference we were hosting. During the 7 week tour across the UK & I. The Morrison hotel stood out as best in class. From the reservations team to reception staff and the events team, everything was perfect. Ricky and the events team went above and beyond to make our week extra special. Thank you to all of you including Petr for leading such an incredible team. If I were to have a wedding, special event or work conference, this is THE PLACE!",5,2024,10,04
237,GREAT LOCATION! VERY CLEAN! GREAT STAFF!,Very helpful staff. Great location across from Temple bar and the hop on hop off bus stops. Great location to tram and Connelly station. About a mile and a half from Kilmainhan  Gaol and Guinness Storehouse.  The rest is easily walkable from this relaxed hotel.  Very clean.  The breakfast is OK you can order as well as a buffet.  Did not eat at the grill so can’t review that restaurant. They really did try very very hard to make you comfortable and help with any questions and activities which we greatly appreciated!!,4,2024,09,30
237,Morrison Dublin by Riverside 👍,"Wowwww what a location besides flowing river, in heart of the city, beautiful surroundings- shopping, restaurants -, good ambiance , extremely helpful and supportive staff - Valeri, Rishi, Presco-, very delicious Hot chocolate drink.  

For me “When in Dublin, Morrison is my Home”.

237,Decent Hotel but Overpriced,"This is a relatively nice hotel but you’re clearly paying for the location.  Dublin hotel prices are high but this hotel is too expensive for what you get.  We had very average room with a cramped bathroom.  I used points but the cash equivalency was over $500/night for this fairly basic room.

Admittedly the location is great.  It’s within walking distance of a lot of tourist sights and restaurants.  It’s also popular with business people.

Front desk personnel were very good.  A young woman from Slovakia checked us in and was very friendly and helpful.

Breakfast was included in our room rate and was a mixed bag.  They offer a buffet and  you can order some dishes a la cart.  The food was good. The servers are polite but not very good.  They forgot our order one day.  They brought toast one day but not the others.  They have a knack for cutting you off as you walk around the buffet. 

Overall the hotel is fairly nice but I wouldn’t return unless the price was a lot lower.",4,2024,09,29
237,Best location and top notch hotel,"The Morrison is spectacular! The location is just across the river from the hustle and bustle of Temple Bar, so you can walk over in less than 5 mins, but quickly escape to one of the finest hotels in Dublin. Ask for a River view for great views of the River Liffy and downtown Dublin.
The restaurant and bar located in the hotel are a destination as well. 
I highly recommend the Morrison!",5,2024,09,29
237,Highly recommend,"Was a lovely stay, very helpful staff and close to heaps of things to see and explore.

237,"Fabulous hotel, location and staff","Fabulous location, across the bridge from temple bar which means less noise. Walking distance to trinity college, Dublin castle, guiness and jamesons. The front desk staff, thank you Ricardo, you always acknowledged us, and concierge staff are fantastic, wish I got all their names. We had a deluxe room with a river view. Air con was the best we’ve had. We are looking to coming back next year so we would definitely stay here again.",5,2024,09,09
237,Excellent customer service,"The perfect luxury hotel experience. We booked a block of rooms for a wedding, and the staff was great with communication and service. Room service options were fast and always available, and everyone was so friendly to all of our 20+ guests. Highly recommended.",5,2024,09,01
237,Not quite 5 star hotel but still good,"The facilities were nice, the staff were all very nice and helpful, and the location is great. The food at the grill was eh, and breakfast was good but ala carte portions were on the smaller side. Diana and the other breakfast staff were all kind, helpful, and made breakfast enjoyable!",4,2024,09,01
237,Make this your go-to destination in Dublin.,"Fabulous people work at this hotel.  Cathrin was extremely accommodating when she recognize our need.

237,Amazing afternoon tea!,"Wonderful afternoon tea-delicious food and a great cuppa!made my mums 75th birthday so special.Olivier provided excellent service-polite and attentive.he knew exactly when to check in with us and when to leave us to enjoy.we stayed over four hours and were made to feel so welcome and never once hurried!Olivier even brought over a special surprise birthday cake for my mum when he heard it was a birthday celebration- not even requested by me and thank you so much.it made my mum so happy and we felt very special.Olivier has such a lovely manner-pleasant, friendly and professional and he couldn't have done any more to make the celebration outstanding!he chatted happily and conversation flowed easily.we thoroughly enjoyed the personal attention and treats and would certainly recommend the afternoon tea-we had a choice of two menus-a range of delicious choices to please all palates and indeed we ended up taken some treats home as we couldn’t finish everything!thank you Olivier for making my mums 75th birthday so memorable!",5,2024,08,20
237,Afternoon tea made extra special.,My daughter and myself had booked afternoon tea as it was my birthday. What really made it super was the way we were treated in the Grill room. Our waiter was Olivier from Holland. He made us feel so special. He was very attentive to our needs without being overbearing. He understood just what we wanted including taking photos for us. We were so comfortable that we never noticed 4 hours passing us by.!! No attempt at hurrying us out! We could have stayed even longer! Thank you Olivier for your wonderful service.,5,2024,08,17
237,"Great Hotel , Great location","Friendly staff , going the extra mile for you during breakfast and if you have any questions regarding your stay.

237,AC and breakfast spot on 👍,"Nice location and very professional staff here . The breakfast staff is very courteous and special thanks to Ricki, Anthony & Rishikesh for going above & beyond to make sure we were fed well. 

I have to give the hotel credit for excellent air conditioning. Most hotels in Europe have AC’s that are old and barely work but Morrison deserves 5* for his alone.",5,2024,08,15
237,"Great hotel, great service, great location","Great hotel with really good service and peaceful atmosphere. Well located near to shopping areas and across the river from the lively part of the city (Temple Bar).
Room was very comfortable, clean and quiet, except for the occasional noise outside, but you will get that everywhere in Dublin.
A good breakfast selection and food in the bar was well priced and plentiful. The team in the bar (food and drink) were excellent.
Thanks Eleuton Alvares - we will definitely be back",5,2024,08,13
237,"Great location, very nice room and awesome staff","Very pleasant stay here, very convenient location, walking distance to lots of places and very lovely staff.

We will come back!",5,2024,08,10
237,We had an amazing stay!,"My wife and I had an amazing stay for a week at The Morrison, celebrating our 20-year anniversary. The hotel is in the perfect location, walking distance to all the great Dublin sights, and easy access to tram and bus stops. We got a visitor Leap card and used the Dart to take day trips out to Bray, Howth, Malahide and Dalkey, the Tara Street station is an easy 15 minute walk from the hotel.

I especially want to thank Marianna for going above and beyond with helping me make arrangements for our stay, with guidance on bus stops, suggestions on what sites to see, and helping me pull off an epic surprise. Marianna is a valuable member of The Morrison team, you are lucky to have her, and everyone else on the front desk team who were so helpful and friendly. When we return to Dublin, we will definitely be staying at The Morrison again!",5,2024,08,08
237,"Excellent hotel, great location","The hotel accommodations and restaurants are 5-star quality for sure. We found the housekeeping and restaurant staff to be beyond friendly and accommodating. However, the times we requested bellhop/porter they did not show up. We also found the front desk to be difficult to work with regarding loyal Hilton honors membership requests. 

The room was immaculate. The view of the River was awesome, although a little loud on Friday and Saturday night given the proximity to Temple Bar area.  

The fitness center was clean and spacious, although it lacked in equipment offerings. 

Overall I’d stay here again, and only gave it 4/5 stars because the front desk and bell ho service experience that we had, granted that may be unique.",4,2024,08,07
237,Morrison Dublin Hotel Bar,"We arrived at the hotel a short while before the scheduled check in. We decided to wait in the hotel bar until our room was ready.  We’re so glad we did!

The bartender, Deivid, made us laugh from the first encounter.  He’s witty but also very knowledgeable about local whiskeys.  Even more helpful were his suggestions on restaurants and sites to see.  Although we intended to stay for just one drink, we ended up ordering appetizers and more drinks because Deivid was so engaging.",5,2024,08,05
237,"Great location, good service, comfortable accommodation","I stayed at this hotel on a short trip to Dublin. The location could not be better, directly overlooking the Temple Bar and walking distance to the Dublin Castle, St James’s Cathedral and The Guinness Storehouse among other places. The service was very good, staff were very helpful. The room was very cozy and comfortable.",5,2024,08,03
237,"Will stay there again, again, and again!","This was our second trip to Ireland, with the first being on our Honeymoon, and this our first Anniversary.  The staff was AMAZING!  They upgraded our room during check-in, and at no charge.  Upon asking the reason for our stay, they provided bathrobes, slippers, and sent up a dessert plate, to our room.  We feel they went above and beyond with their service.  The accommodation was wonderful, and will definitely stay there again, on all our future trips!",5,2024,07,30
237,"Great place, great staff, great location!","The Morrison was a great hotel. It’s perfectly located near but not in Temple Bar and it’s just a quick walk across the bridge to the other side of the river. The people were nice, the room was adequate, comfy bed, and housekeeping was good. Breakfast was exceptional – the food, staff, etc. I highly recommend starting your day in their restaurant. 

Con: TERRIBLE ROOM SERVICE PIZZA AT 1 AM. Beware.",5,2024,07,25
237,Fantastic service and rooms,"The rooms are beautiful and the service has been amazing! 
All the hotel staff has been so friendly and eager to help. Eleuton A went out of his way to book us a bus tour with a discount and printed out tickets out for us as well. Great experience!
Would definitely recommend this hotel for others.",5,2024,07,21
237,Prime Hotel in the Heart of Dublin,"Just came off of a nice stay at The Morrison, and hands down, this hotel excels for its prime location. Located right on The Liffy, and across the bridge from the Temple Bar neighborhood, we found The Morrison to be a prime hotel for our first visit to Dublin and Ireland. 

Upon arrival around 12pm, we were quickly and efficiently checked in and our room was (thankfully) ready, allowing us to get some rest after the red-eye from the US. A nice touch at check in was that we were handed chocolate truffles to complete the check in process, marking the start of a sweet stay at The Morrison. 

As a Hilton Honors Diamond, I wasn't actually upgraded (at least to a discernibly better room) but we called room 207 our home for four nights. The rooms are generous in size, but pretty basic, all things considered. There's some fun quotes painted on the wall, but other than that pretty simple and straightforward. Robes and slippers were available in the room (albeit only one robe, and if you want an additional you have to call and ask for a second.) Reusable water bottles were also provided - I give The Morrison a lot of credit for their focus and efforts on sustainability and the environment. 

Breakfast is in the main ground level restaurant. It was well stocked with both hot and cold items, as well as a handful of a la carte hot items you could order with a server. I did find it odd that I ordered the Full Irish Breakfast, as listed on the a la carte hot menu, and the server simply told me all of those items were available at the hot buffet section and to help myself. No issue, but if that's the case, take that off the menu then. My partner had the eggs Benedict which were great. Servers were also attentive with coffee and refills - all other beverages were self serve from the buffet. 

Overall, a decent stay at The Morrison, and I'd consider coming back in future trips to Irish. It's good, but has the potential to be great. While I wasn't blown away, it is still a worthwhile hotel to call home in Dublin, and the location and access to major points of interest in Dublin can't be beat.",4,2024,07,18
237,The Best Hotel in Dublin!  Experience it for yourself!,"As the wife of a Hilton Lifetime Diamond Member, I can confidently say that the Morrison Hotel in Dublin is the best Hilton Hotel we've experienced, excelling in Service, Cleanliness, and the Quality of its Food for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner .  My husband and I have stayed here several times.  This time we stayed for 4 nights.

Upon our arrival, we received a warm welcome from Edit at the Front Desk.  Shortly after, we met the General Manager , Rory Rooney. who also greeted us warmly.

We dined at the Hotel’s Restaurant for two nights, where Derek, the Restaurant Manager, greeted my husband and I by name.   We also had Breakfast at the hotel for 4 days which was Excellent as always with a great selection and great service.

My husband and I highly recommend this Excellent Hotel  in the heart of Dublin and look forward to our next stay at the Morrison.",5,2024,07,14
237,Great Hotel and Location,"Stayed at beginning of tour of Ireland and liked it so much went back for our last night in Dublin.  
The location is great on the river in the center of Dublin.  Parking is a block away in a large parking garage which was ok.  Our rooms overlooked the river and a main road, but it was super quiet.  AC and heat was quite efficient.  The rooms were very clean with a large, clean bath.  The beds were very comfortable.  The vibe of the hotel is great with lots of open space.  They did a great job converting the old building into a modern hotel with lots of great amenities.  
We ate an the resto one night.  Three of the five of us had Irish beef with was done nicely.  The other two had fish and were less impressed.  The breakfast area was perfect with a large buffet and a menu with lots of choices.  We got the menu and enjoyed our last meal in Dublin.
We stayed here 2x on our trip.  This will be the 1st hotel i look at the next trip to Dublin.",5,2024,07,13
237,Birthday Afternoon Tea,"Such a great hotel!

Downside is that it has no swimming pool and the gym is very limited. I was looking for kettle bells but they don’t have it.",4,2024,07,04

The hotel is very clean, posh, and has one of the best breakfasts we've ever had in a Hilton Curio property. There's also a very nice on prem bar and restaurant that we ate at.",5,2024,06,15
237,Well positioned near Temple Bar,"Hilton hotels are often predictable in that rooms are reasonably sized. Beds quite adequate, the service as expected. This hotel is better positioned than most. It fulfils all your needs without being over the top or pretentious. Dublin is expensive. This hotel is not cheap but a good hotel that is inexpensive is hard to find.  We liked this hotel without getting ovey excited. We would  e happy to stay there again but its worth looking at deals at other places",4,2024,06,14
237,"Long weekend in Dublin, Ireland.",We stayed at this hotel for an extended weekend. Ricardo was super helpful in booking us an all day coach trip to Cliffs for Moher as well as a Celtic Nights event with music and dance.

237,Great stay at the Morrison!,This hotel was a very pleasant surprise. I came with my family for a 2 night visit to Dublin and loved the hotel! The staff in all areas are extremely helpful and kind.  We had 2 rooms facing the river and they were immaculate! The beds super comfy as were the pillows.  Great showers with plenty of hot water and great pressure! The food at the Grill restaurant was wonderful! Best bangers and mash! We will be returning.,5,2024,05,24
237,Simply incredible,"Trying to find hotels for 2 nights in Dublin when  'The Boss' was playing  was a challenge. As Hitlon Diamond status holder i was lucky enough to grab our first night at the Morrison followed by our second night at another hilton property in the city. Thanks to our evening flight being delayed we only arrived at 21.45 but were instantly welcomed by Maria and received a welcome room upgrade. As the restaurant had closed, Maria kindly reccomended a nearby bar that served food until 22.30, she even called ahead to ensure we would be served. 
The room was wonderful, overlooking a courtyard but totally silent so we spent very well following out late journey and dinner
Breakfast was also very special in its own dining room, with made to order menu cards on the table. I spend a lot of time in Asia and have only ever experienced this level of breakfast quantity in Asia, but the Morrison more than matches it...the food was tasty and fresh, the service was really friendly. 
Finally, as we had to check out and move to our next hotel, Ricardo on the Honors desk gave really good advice for our stay in the city.
We really didn't want to leave and I so wish I could have got 2 nights here, we will be back later in the year for sure. Absolutely wonderful hotel made very special by the amazing staff.",5,2024,05,23
237,Fantastic hotel!,"A very good hotel well placed to visit so many local sights (and music filled bars! ). Spotlessly clean everywhere, with welcoming and helpful staff from the check-in desk to the restaurants and housekeeping. I cannot fault this hotel and will be back some day for sure! Our room overlooked the river but was still quiet and peaceful at night.",5,2024,05,21
237,Excellent Service.,"Ricardo at the front desk and the rest of the staff were extremely helpful and accommodating. Breakfast was excellent and the staff were attentive and professional. The room was clean and comfortable. Location is excellent within walking distance to the temple bar district, St Patrick’s Cathedral, Dublin castle, and Trinity College among other area attractions. Highly recommended.",5,2024,05,18
237,Super helpful staff!,"Lakisha at the front desk was wonderfully helpful arranging a fantastic Dublin walking tour in well less than 24 hours. Hotel was clean, comfortable, well appointed. Our included breakfast was tasty and the location of the Morrison can’t be beat. We walked everywhere!",5,2024,05,16
237,Morrison Service Exellent Again,"This is our 3rd stay at The Morrison. We will always stay here when in Dublin!! We love the hotel, the staff, love Hilton! The staff here is amazing!! This time Eleuton & Laki were above exceptional!! They're so respectful & professional. Our Liffey River looking Suite  was beautiful.  We look forward to our next stay !!!",5,2024,05,16
237,The staff at the Morrison Hotel in Dublin are great!,"The beauty of the centrally located Morrison is subtle, from its art work, to its Irish breakfast, to the comfort of its rooms. But what makes it truly special is their staff. The ladies at the front deck, including Lakisha, Maevonna, Maria and Valerie, are exceptional. The warmth of their personalities is felt and appreciated. They are always there and helpful. They made us feel welcomed and valued. 
We are Hilton Honors Gold members and the AX Surpass Card gets you automatically elevated to Gold status-well worth the $150 annual fee.",5,2024,05,15
237,Outstanding location with great service,"Wonderful staff member, Lakisha, made our trip very memorable through her help at the hotel, as well as suggestions for where to go. We were also surprised with a gift in our room from the manager, and they also had our request for breakfast to go ready for our early start to the airport. Overall, a fantastic stay!",5,2024,05,11
237,Very Average,"The hotel was very clean and it was fine as a place to rest. We booked this based on the excellent previous ratings seen. The hotel isn’t bad, but the reviews felt overrated. It is not a 4 or 5 star hotel though as advertised. It is maybe 3 to 3.5 stars. As Hilton Diamond members, free breakfast was offered in the morning. It is a buffet style breakfast with options to order as well. The food was average at best. We opted to eat breakfast elsewhere for most of our five night stay. The dinner at the Grill was a littler better. 4 out of 5 stars here.

The room itself was adequate and clean. It was very average, as is the property. It wasn’t terrible, but not a place we would stay again. Temper your expectations.",3,2024,05,10
237,Best. Night. Ever.,"I'm a Hilton guy and also enjoy a nice stay in the boutique hotels. This boutique Hilton is one of the best I've ever been! A lot of hotels put fancy furniture in the lobby and claim to be high class, but the Morrison has it all…

First and foremost, the staff is as helpful and friendly and accommodating as I've ever seen. From Rory, Hotel Mgr, to the front desk staff (Maria & Co) all the way to the bartenders (Jesswin & Oliver), everyone treated me like I was a king for a day!

My room was beyond stunning with views overlooking temple bar and the river...

I am lifetime Diamond, which means I've stayed more than 1000 nights in Hilton hotels. This was hands-down the most amazing experience I can remember…

Thank you to the Morrison staff for making my Birthday Week in Dublin an overnight success!

Slainté!",5,2024,05,08
237,Great hotel,"We had a wonderful experience at The Morrison Dublin.  The property is modern and very well maintained.  It is in an excellent location across the river from Temple Bar - great access without the noise of Temple Bar area.  The staff did a wonderful job, and the breakfast was great (complementary for Hilton Diamond members).  I also want to especially recognize concierge Marianna Kovacova for all her wonderful advice and guidance on places that we had not planned to visit.  She was very patient and has a great attitude.",5,2024,05,07
237,What an Amazing Hotel!,"The Morrison Dublin is a great hotel all around! Lovely rooms, excellent restaurant and bar. But, the service is even more stellar. Everyone was so friendly at the reception desk, especially Valerie- she welcomed us with a genuine enthusiasm. The manager, Rory Rooney, was just amazing. We got pick-pocketed at the Haypenny bridge and he was by our side the entire time we were making calls to VISA and the police.
That was the front end of our trip. The back end, we were again  booked there and were given an awesome corner room.. Just bent over backwards to make us feel special. Wonderful experience!!",5,2024,05,03
237,Whiskey!,"Olivier at the Morrison bar was very good company! Knowledgeable, affable. Worth stopping in for a drink with a newer addition to the",5,2024,04,30
237,Expected better from 5 star hotel,"Improvements needed, expected better. I'll give you my very honest opinion. Booked as a 5 star hotel paid 7000 euros for 6 rooms and 3 days, average 385 euros per night, for that money you could have included a bath in a 5 star hotel. There is no bath, I had to pay an extra 50 euros for an upgrade per night per room. In the room you cant set the room temperature only 6 settings cooler warmer and the speed of the fan. Rooms were cold and I woke up few times because of that. At the bar ordered few coctails for myself and my spouse 15 euro each, I am very confident that those drinks were nearly virgin, other girls ordered Mojito had same opinion. Brekfast was basic and not on 5 star hotel level if you compare 5 star hotels with the rate you pay per room (black pouding was not fully cooked) Positive, Hotel is very clean and located in very good location, staff is very frendly and polite. Food in Morrison Grill restaurant was nice and our guest realy liked Margarita they served.",3,2024,04,30
237,Wonderful stay—Lakisha is the best!!,"We were visiting Ireland for our honeymoon and had an amazing experience at the Morrison Dublin. First of all Lakisha was absolutely WONDERFUL and greeted us as soon as we walked in. She spent so much time giving us tips and advice on restaurants and places to visit. I ended up getting an ear infection on our trip and everyone was so helpful at the desk with directing us to a doctor that could help. Lakisha even called to offer some hot tea and checked in with us later. It was a such a comfortable stay and we felt so taken care of. If you’re luck my enough to have Lakisha take care of you, tell her we said hi!! ☺️",5,2024,04,28
237,Great trip with my brother,Everyone was incredibly kind-the staff was so courteous and was always going above and beyond-they helped us with tours and wheelchair assistance and were some warm and inviting. To Oliver and Mario and all the girls at the front desk thank you so much for making this such a great stay!,5,2024,04,27
237,Great Front Desk Staff,"Great front desk staff, especially Marianna and Valerie. Friendly and responsive. Followed up with all our requests. Always accomodating. The hotel is in a great location. Very clean. Great bedding. We recommend highly to travelers. We will be back!",5,2024,04,26
237,Absolutely Incredible,What made the hotel experience the greatest one I’ve ever had was the two lovely ladies behind the counter. Valerie and Maria are absolutely incredible and made sure the stay we had was beyond perfect! 10/10 would recommend to anyone that is looking around. I will be staying at this hotel everytime from here on out! Thanks you two!,5,2024,04,25
237,The Morrison Curio Dublin. A great place to unwind in a city that knows how to wind up.,I truly enjoyed my stay at the Morrison. Not only was it so convenient to all the local entertainment and sights of Dublin it was very quiet and easy to get to. The reception staff was unmatched. Both Maria and Valarie were so helpful and kind. They were delightful to talk to and assisted with car services and possible exploring questions. This Hilton property is very fortunate to have them greeting and assisting guests.,5,2024,04,24
237,Fantastic stay at the Morrison,"We had such an amazing time at the Morrison Hotel in Dublin. It’s located in a great part of the city center, making it convenient to explore all the attractions. The staff truly goes above and beyond to ensure guests are treated well. Our room was immaculately clean and comfortable, providing a relaxing retreat after a day of sightseeing. 

Breakfast—the food was delicious with a great variety of options to choose from, setting us up perfectly for the day ahead. Overall, the Morrison Hotel exceeded our expectations and we would highly recommend it for anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2024,04,24
237,10/10,"We stayed for 3 days and it was a great experience. The front desk was very helpful, the bar had great service and the breakfast experience was beyond amazing. The level of service and attention from the staff was very professional and they were always at hand if we needed them. The rooms were beautiful and the location was everything we needed. Such a high level of excellence. Will be staying here again in the future.",5,2024,04,24
237,Fabulous staff!!,"Outstanding staff!! Fabulous hotel!!
Domingo and Valerie greeted us immediately as we came in from the rain and they were wonderful for our entire stay.  Helping us with wonderful places to eat and visit in Dublin.  They celebrated with us for our 30th anniversary and made it extra special!!!",5,2024,04,23
237,"Perfect location to explore the city, but son’t expect a good night sleep","Very good location, the hotel is within walking distance to all the major attractions. Breakfast was good and room was clean. But don’t expect to have a good night sleep, you cannhear doors slamming late in the evening and early in the morning. One night I woke up because of the car alarm - twice from the street next to hotel, so not much not much sound proof rooms. The staff was polite and smiley. Would I go again? Hard to say, location is  perfect but Indo value a good night sleep too.",3,2024,04,22
237,Great location but not really a five-star hotel,"Absolutely adequate hotel and the central location was perfect for walking and exploring. Initially we were not recognized as Diamond (not good). Of more importance there is no executive lounge. No doorman, no turndown service. No warm, personal greeting when you enter the front door. None of these are ""necessary"" by any means, and we usually stay in 3 or 4-star places quite happily, but to me 5 star means I am going to be ""coddled"". That said I would consider staying here again, but just wouldn't expect a special experience. (Although the lack of a lounge really hurts - it's not just the free booze and snacks - though those are nice - but we have found these lounges to be nice places to relax and have often met and visited with  nice folks there -kind of like a little cocktail party). Back to details. The breakfast was good. There was a nice fitness room. Most importantly we were initially assigned a first floor room on the street (ouch!). After asserting ourselves we instead got a second floor interior room. This was clutch. The interior rooms open onto a quiet little space. Windows open for fresh air which is nice. I can't imagine doing this on the street which is quite busy and noisy .",4,2024,04,21
237,Very comfortable hotel,"Lovely hotel, very comfy and cosy. Well situated in the centre of Dublin. Parking is available in the nearby public car park. Staff were excellent throughout the stay. Will also provide a small breakfast bag if checking out early just speak to reception the night before. Cannot comment on the restaurant as i explored the city by night. Overall, it was a very positive stay.",5,2024,04,20
237,Hotel with the best service in Dublin,"Visited the hotel as I was in Dublin for the Ireland v Italy rugby match, the service in the hotel was 10/10 I was blown away how good it was and came across how genuine the staff were in wanting to help. 
I was really impressed with the front desk manager, needed help with something and was sorted right away.",5,2024,04,14
237,The Mossison Dublin Hilton is an excellent hotel.,"I was extremely happy with my stay at the Morrison Dublin, Curio Collection by Hilton. The entire hotel staff were so very helpful and friendly. As a pilot, I spend many nights in hotels and this was a wonderful experience. 

I would like to acknowledge a couple of the front desk employees that went aboveboard to ensure my stay was an excellent one. Catheryn and Ricardo were so friendly and helpful in assisting me on numerous occasions with questions concerning the hotel and Dublin in general. They both are such outstanding employees, totally first class! 

I also would like to express my appreciation to Eleuton Alvares with his assistance in the dining room. He too was extremely friendly and helpful. 

Speaking of the dining room, the Morrison provided an outstanding breakfast that rivaled any Hilton I’ve ever stayed at.",5,2024,04,06
237,Wonderful staff,"Morrison Hotel staff is incredibly welcoming and helpful! It’s in a great  location, and extremely clean. Continental breakfast and hotel restaurant served great food. My family loved our stay  here and would definitely come back again!!",5,2024,04,06
237,Fantastic hotel in the heart of everything,"I had won a competition to stay at this beautiful hotel. On arrival we were welcomed by a lovely receptionist who gave us chocolates and a room with a view of the river. The room was lovely, clean and very modern. The bathroom had both a seperate shower and bath. We had a knock on the door and hotel staff brought us in complimentary dessert slate and a congratulations card which we thought was such a nice touch. Included with our prize was a 3 course meal with bubbly in the restaurant. We had starters veg soup and prawn pil pil,  the fillet steak each for main which was usually a extra 9 euro each supplement but we did not get charged for it. The steak and trimmings were delicious. Dessert we had Chocolate fondant and creme brulee both which were delicious. The waiting staff were super friendly and attentive to us even at 9:15 near the end of their shifts. Wonderful hotel with amazing staff. Breakfast in the morning was very nice too, the room decor was gorgeous and we loved the sculpture. We look forward to staying again the next time we visit Dublin.",5,2024,04,05
237,"Great location, service and accommodations in Dublin.","We were very pleased with our stay at the Morrison. It is very well located on the north side of the river, right across from the Temple Bar area. Taking the Dublin Express Bus (#782) from and to the airport was a breeze, too. Get off at the Wellington Quay stop coming from the airport, and when heading back to the airport, hop on the bus at Dublin Ormond Quay Upper/Capel Street. Entrance to the hotel is tucked away on Swift Row. The stylish lobby was very welcoming and warm. Our room was not ready upon arrival, so we left our bags with the friendly front desk clerk and went to lunch and to explore the town. When the room was ready, our bags had been brought to the room and were waiting for us. 

The room itself was well appointed, interestingly decorated, in good condition, and had a very comfortable bed and pillows. The bathroom was spacious and had one of the best showers I have experienced at a hotel, with great water pressure, a full door, and a rain showerhead along with the standard hand-held showerhead. The only minor complaint is the very shallow wardrobe which made it difficult to hang clothes. 

We had the buffet breakfast in the Halo restaurant. The host, Eleuton, was gracious and very welcoming! The buffet had a delicious full Irish breakfast.  There were also many cold and baked options, including a wonderful jam dispenser. You could also order offa small breakfast menu that included things such as omelettes and oatmeal/porridge. 

Overall, we had a wonderful stay.",5,2024,03,31
237,Centraly located Hotel.,"You can not go wrong with this hotel.  It is very centrally located within walking distance of restaurants, shopping, train lines. and the water.  It is also within walking distance to the Airport Express stops in both directions.  The buffet breakfast was also wonderful.",5,2024,03,30
237,Perfect stay,"Beautiful hotel , perfect location , rooms were clean and well sized . The staff was incredible especially Catherine she went out of her way to be extremely helpful to us ! Would def stay again and would definitely recommend ! Can’t wait to return",5,2024,03,26
237,Excellent stay,"You couldn't get a better located hotel to enjoy Dublin. The decor was modern and tasteful and everywhere was spotless. Our room and bathroom were a decent size and had everything you would expect for a 5* hotel. The large bed was very comfortable and we slept well. The soundproofing was excellent and we couldn't hear the traffic from the road outside. We had a river view room but didn't think that it was worth the extra cost - not because of the view, which was perfect, but because the river itself was very disappointing.

The breakfast area, as with the rest of the hotel, was lovely. You had the usual choices you would expect but we were a little disappointed with the hot buffet - particularly the hard bacon.

We ate in the restaurant one night. In the main the food was excellent, particularly the steak, although one of our party was a little disappointed with his fish and chips. The seating was very comfortable and the service was efficient and friendly.

The bar area was comfortable and relaxing and we tended to drop in there for a drink to round off our day.

It would be unfair to single out any individual staff as all of them were very friendly, helpful and efficient.

We would certainly stay here again.",5,2024,03,25
237,Loved the breakfast Buffett,"Beautiful hotel in a great location. Lots of food nearby. The breakfast buffet was amazing. Elution the hostess was awesome, helpful, and very organized. He was really great with our kids too. 
I would definitely stay at this property again if in Dublin.",5,2024,03,22
237,"Class, refinement and top notch service define The Morrison Hotel!","A stay in Dublin? Do NOT look any further than The Morrison Hotel, on the River Liffey in City Centre! 

The hotel has undergone a stunning renovation, offering refined, stylish and comfortable surroundings making you feel right at home here in the City. From the moment you walk through the door, the hotel’s team is there to greet you with warm smiles, ensuring your every need is taken care of. Whether it is room service or the hotel restaurant, the food is amazing and so delicious! I would be completely remiss if I did not mention the location: the hotel is located on the River in City Center, which is walking distance to most major sites, including the Ha’Penny Bridge, Temple Bar, Dublin Castle, the GPO and St Stephen’s Green. It is the perfect spot to plan your holiday adventures from! 

The Morrison Hotel is complete perfection when you are staying in Dublin; I cannot recommend it highly enough!",5,2024,03,21
237,Ideal Hilton option,Located in central dublin east walk to all city amenities. Check in was quick and helpful. Room was clean and tidy.  WiFi thought out was good. Restaurant food was tasty with good choice and reasonable options.  Lovely selection of wines in cosy surroundings.,5,2024,03,17
237,Unfortunate Stay,"My recent stay at the Morrison left much to be desired.  I am a 
'Diamond Member"" and have stayed at this property many times. Unfortunately, the showers have no bath mats and I managed to fall.  Not seriously injured but somewhat pained in areas, I decided to find an "" urgent care center.""  I asked the front desk clerk for assistance to which she responded that it was within walking distance which was not quite the case. I also asked for a bath mat.  To shorten this considerably, there was no concern given by the manager or the front desk staff as to my injuries. The housekeeping staff demonstrated concern and to their credit found a bath mat and asked repeatedly as to my health. I checked out this morning and again repeated my story pertaining to my injures. I was given the bill and a bag of candy. I am now recovering in another hotel.",3,2024,03,14
237,Morrison Dublin,Our room was spacious and LaKisha at the front desk was extremely helpful upon us arriving early.  She ensured our bags were put away safely until our room was ready. The staff offered many recommendations for things to do around the city and they also called us a taxi on multiple occasions. Looking forward to staying again!,5,2024,03,14
237,Amazing hotel with great staff!,This hotel is super clean and great with customer service! The location is in the best location of the city center. Customer service was prompt and excellent.

237,Dublin’s Gem,We had an incredible stay at The Morrison. The breaks host Eleuton Alvares was especially helpful in the mornings and kind. All the staff were professional and you could tell truly cared about their work. The inside of the hotel was extremely clean and the interior design was lovely especially for a European hotel. I’d highly recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Dublin.,5,2024,03,12
237,Like a family,"As usual we experienced the best stay in Dublin. Many thanks to Rory and all the staff that treated us as a family. The best possible choice.  The breakfast is georgeous, we cand recommend you Bennedict eggs and French toast to use extra energy for walking the city.",5,2024,03,10
237,Wonderful Staff,"It has been our second time here at this hotel in Dublin, we do really recommend it. Hotel is wonderful, they have one of the best staff, they are all really nice and caring, and they would look after you really nicely! The breakfast buffet it’s a must, all the food is delicious they also even have a menu that they will prepare instantly.

237,Beautiful hotel.,"We adored our stay at the Morrison Dublin. The rooms were beautiful to say the least with the right amount of luxury and coziness combined. And the service was amazing, everyone was the kindest and friendliest. We will definitely be coming back here when we visit Dublin in the future!",5,2024,03,02
237,Absolutely perfect in every way,"I do a fairly considerable amount of travel and I can say this has to be one of the top hotels I have had the pleasure of visiting. Several factors put it over the top: The staff, the location and the incredible breakfast. I arrived early on a Sunday morning without my baggage as the airline decided not to put it on the plane. The hotel staff were more than accommodating. They brought me a pot of tea to relax and Marianna worked to get me a room earlier than normal check in. It was just a 7 minute walk to Grafton street to pick up some clothes - the hotel location is just minutes across the walking bridge to all of the action. The breakfast is probably one of the best I’ve EVER had at the hotel. I already miss the mini buttermilk scones and the bacon. Shout out to Eleuton and the breakfast crew! This is a can’t miss hotel. Gym is decent too. The room didn’t heat well enough for me so they brought me a Dyson heat fan. Just ask if you’re cold the entire staff is AMAZING. Have a great stay! You’ll absolutely love it!!",5,2024,02,29
237,Classy Hotel: Always a great stay ❤️!,"We experienced exceptional service from everyone we interacted with from Catherine at Check In to Ricky in the Dining Room at Breakfast.

Amazing food, amazing rooms, and amazing staff!",5,2024,02,28
237,Centrally located hotel with modern rooms and good restaurants,"An enjoyable stay at this hotel. The rooms are modern and look recently updated. 

Breakfast is very good, with buffet and menu options. The dinner menu is also good, with great service and surprisingly large portions. 

The hotel is conveniently located for central Dublin. 

I like the environmentally friendly considerations too. 

I would definitely return here. 

The only suggestion for improvement would be to make sure a room map is available for online check in and to offer, without asking, Diamond members an upgrade (available but I had to ask). That said, once checked in at the hotel, my loyalty status was recognised.",4,2024,02,27
237,Wonderful experience,"I would like to give a compliment to the entire hotel team, from reception to cleaning, they were wonderful, a special compliment to the restaurant and cafe team, always very polite and friendly, Caroline and Liege gave us exceptional service.",5,2024,02,19
237," Christmas in Dublin","We arrived late on Christmas eve after a 23 hour flight starting in Australia, it was raining and we had alot of bags. Ricardo at reception looked after us with a warm.smile and the most positive attitude I have seen in a hotel staff member for a long time. He helped us with directions and reservations around Dublin.
Our suite was bright and had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable. Breakfast was included in our stay and we very much enjoyed the service and the quality of food. 
We even booked a sneaky couple of extra nights when we returned to Dublin a couple of weeks later.

237,Excellent location and overall great accommodations,I stayed here twice to bookend my two week trip to Ireland.  The hotel could not be located in a better area.  It is right across from the Temple Bar area and within walking distance to almost anything you would want to do in the city.  The staff was great and the restaurant served a nice breakfast each morning giving you a choice of a buffet or cooked to order options.  It truly did enhance my experience staying here.,5,2024,01,14

We are huge fans of Dublin and have been many times but this was by far the nicest hotel we’ve stayed in. Location is perfect. We could walk to all our favourite shops and restaurants. The staff were very welcoming and really looked after us. The room was spacious, clean and with such a comfortable big bed. We had breakfast included in our booking and loved the option to have it in our room with a small fee for tray charge. The bar is lovely and breakfast was delicious! I would really recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a trip to Dublin centre :)",5,2024,01,12
237,My go-to hotel in Dublin,"My stay at the Morrison was just perfect. The room was big (especially the bed!), clean and had all the amenities and necessary equipment. 

I didn't have breakfast, but enjoyed two dinners in the fancy restaurant downstairs and they were high quality for reasonable price. 

But what I would really highlight is the staff friendliness and helpfulness. Lakisha at reception did a fantastic job understanding my needs and coming up with solutions. Thank you again!",5,2024,01,09
237,Lovely Saturday night stay ,"I stayed here over the weekend with my partner to celebrate his birthday and our recent engagement. 
We got excellent value on our room. The room was spotless, bed was comfortable and the staff were extremely friendly. Ricardo checked us in, his demeanour was excellent and upon learning we’d just become engaged, gave us a voucher each for a complimentary drink at the bar to celebrate, which we thought was a really nice touch. We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back. ",5,2024,01,07
237,A happy return,"Another successful trip. The urbane and personable head manager (I warned him I would be saying things like this) is always to be found seeing what is going on and is well-regarded by the staff. The staff, as in my previous trip are helpful, cordial and proactive. It is usual to see supervisors working with their teams.
Food is excellent; the breakfasts 1st class with very nice service, including efficient, young, identical Brazilian twins, under a capable manager. Dinners are not, understandably, cheap, but you get what you pay for, very good quality.
Rooms are kept well clean and are comfortable, nice beds. The small gym is worth using, it has good modern equipment. The bar is spacious and well-stocked.
Well-situated just over the River, and easy to travel to places worth visiting.
I had an upgrade for just Euros 10 per night and had views over the Liffey.
Thoroughly recommended, and I propose to return in April/May.
No complaints, just compliments.

237,"Great location, lovely staff, disappointing breakfast","The hotel is in a fantastic location for exploring Dublin, especially if just there for a few days. The hotel is nicely presented and the rooms were clean. A few issues to note however - only one robe provided for 2 of us, the room still wasn’t cleaned by almost 4pm on the second day when we came back from our day to refresh, not all the lights in our room were working and the safe is in an impractical position where the door just opens itself unless locked at the ideal head-height to hit off it (as I did very loudly). Other than that the rooms are clean and quiet. The biggest disappointment from the whole stay was the breakfast. Excited to get a cooked breakfast we were very disappointed to find the quality of the hot buffet was extremely poor, I have never seen such unappealing and over cooked scrambled eggs. The food was all very cold from the buffet so I tried to ask the waitress for some fresh scrambled egg one morning ( a la carte options are available) but she told me to take it from the buffet. The staff are all lovely and the service was fantastic, coffee was also good for a machine. It was just a great shame about the food especially considering it is a highly rated Hilton, a brand which is known for a much higher standard than what we received. After leaving the hotel they took further payment from my card for something unidentified in the mini bar. Luckily I noticed the additional payment and phoned them as we hadn’t touched the mini bar which did not have much on offer. ",4,2024,01,03
237,"Great location, attentive staff and powerful shower","We stayed one night recently whilst visiting Ireland. Check in was quick and staff were very attentive. Our room was not ready so we went to the bar for a drink. The lady at reception came to find us to tell us the room was ready. We dined at the restaurant, food was beautiful. 
Breakfast was lovely, great full Irish. 
Everyone staying at the hotel were travelers from out of country. The hotel is very American friendly. 
Will return again if we are home visiting family again",5,2023,12,30
237,The Morrison Dublin is a cut above the rest.,"The hotel is absolutely excellent. The hotel is located close to everything. The staff are very professional and welcoming, and they tentatively see that you are well taken care of. My room was serviced daily by attendants who take exceptional pride in their work. Liege and Carol, who greeted me during my breakfast and dinners in the hotel’s restaurants, and the other wonderful staff, went above and beyond to assist their guests. I look forward to future visits to the Morrison Dublin. It was truly a pleasurable experience. I look forward to returning in the Summer. ",5,2023,12,28
237,Highly recommend Morrison Dublin Curio,We thoroughly enjoyed our 5 day stay at the Morrison Dublin Curio. From the front desk staff (especially Ricardo with his delightful laugh and welcome!); the breakfast staff who were super attentive (food choices were excellent); to the cleaning staff who were friendly and gracious and left our room spotless (which is a challenge). Highly recommend the hotel and the location for walking around central Dublin.,5,2023,12,21
237,Staff is lovely specially Liage from the restaurant.,"I loved the Hotel, it is close to city centre, it is new and modern. Super clean and the staff is friendly.
I like that the Hotel support local artists and writers.
I went with some friends to have afternoon tea and the waitress Liage gave us an excellent service. She is friendly and helpful. She offered us a good options and we were si happy and comfortable.

237,Wedding Review,We had a fantastic two night stay. The staff were fabulous especially Eleuton the lovely person who served us at breakfast. The hotel was very comfortable and the food was amazing. It's a great location in the centre of Dublin. ,5,2023,12,18
237,Great Little Hotel,"We really enjoyed our stay here for 4 nights...Close to the usual Dublin things south of the Liffey, easy to get the Luas rooms were smallish but normal for Europe hotels and very well laid out, Great Shower, Staff was awesome and welcoming which was great after a horrible stay in London. Highly recomend...Also the breakfast buffet was quite good and great service.",5,2023,12,17
237,A Great Stay,"We recently stayed in room 334, which is a junior suite, for several nights. It was very comfortable having a larger room with a sofa and two chairs for relaxing in the evening after a day of sightseeing. No problems sleeping in the very comfortable bed and I wanted to take the pillows home with me. They were perfect!

As mentioned in many other reviews, all the staff at The Morrison are pleasant, polite and willing to help in any way they can. They are to be commended.

Breakfast every morning was good. Having additional items to order off menu gave the buffet variety. We dined in the restaurant our first and last evening and the food was good but maybe not as good as some other dinners we had in Dublin.

The Morrison is in a great location, easy access to almost all Dublin has to offer. I often read you must stay south of the river. Not so with the Morrison.

In my opinion, some suggestions to make things even better for your guests would be to have easy to understand directions for how the shower and espresso machine operate. I should not have to watch you tube videos to learn how to make my morning coffee; and it’s no fun trying to shower the first morning and having no idea which way to turn the handles for hot/cold and rain shower or handheld. Lastly, please reupholster the orange banquette in the breakfast area with a material that makes it easy to slide in and out to your table. 

Thanks to all for a great stay!",4,2023,12,14
237,Another Great Stay at a Curio Collection hotel by Hilton,I found the room spacious and the bed very comfortable.  The staff were most helpful and you couldn’t ask for a better location near the heart of Dublin.  I will definitely return The Morrison again!  ,5,2023,12,12
237,Brilliant.,"Clearly at the top end of the Hilton chain, we found this hotel to be excellent. From the moment we entered, every member of staff without exception we came into contact with, would smile and say hello. After a late check in, and walking into a superb room with a river view, we went to the bar to get a drink before dinner, but the bar was full. On seeing us looking uncertainly, the restaurant manager came over to offer help by showing us to a table. We had really tasty meals of beef and Guinness stew and bangers and mash. We retired to be and apart from a room that looked freshly decorated and immaculately clean, I noticed in spite of heavy traffic outside, the glazing completely obliterated and sound at all. Breakfast was either Al a Carte, buffet, or you could mix both was excellent with the most attentive staff. We walked across the bridge about 200 metres to the Temple Bar tourist area to enjoy outer dar. Highly recommend this hotel and we will be back.",5,2023,12,06
237,Fantastic,"We had a lovely stay at this hotel in December 2023. The location is perfect for a weekend in Dublin- everything in walking distance. Rooms and bathrooms are very spacious and comfortable and you have everything you need to have a good vacation. The breakfast is also very good. But what made the visit extra special was the exceptional  staff members. Every single person we were in contact with was very professional, polite and serviceminded. The reception were of great help, and the housekeepers were so helpfull in making our bed into a twinbed upon arrival and made us feel so welcome. The breakfast personell was also very polite and serviceminded and made the breakfast a really good experience. Please take good care of the very qualfied staff! Thank you for a lovely stay, we will be back :-)",5,2023,12,04
237,"A quiet and very comfortable hotel, in a great location, facing the River Liffey.","We enjoyed a very good breakfast each morning at the hotel. Carol and Liege are twin sisters working the dining room. The breakfast includes a buffet and an opportunity to order from the menu. The identical twin sisters were exceptionally attentive to us. We all had a good laugh upon discovering two people were serving us, not one!",5,2023,12,02

237,"Great hotel, very friendly staff","Hilton’s have a degree of predictability but where this do very it was at the better end. Loved my stay here. The location is excellent within 1-2 minutes of Temple bar pubs. Lovely decor in lobby. Excellent room and very friendly reception staff. 
I’m back on business here in February and  I’ll look to return.",5,2023,12,01
237,Quick Christmas weekend in Dublin ,"The staff at Hilton Curio were so attentive to making our stay so pleasurable. 

We arrived early in morning from our international flight and Ricardo, at front desk, immediately helped us get acquainted to hotel and area with excellent suggestions.

 The breakfast in hotel was traditional Irish breakfast and no need to leave hotel to find local cuisine early in day. 

The afternoon tea, served after noon in restaurant, was a great way for my husband and I to relax and warm up and eat lite.  When back in Dublin, this is our choice again. So easy to walk to shopping and sites. ",5,2023,11,30
237,Dublin November 2023,"I’ve stayed in a lot of hotels in Dublin but this  one is the best. Very luxurious, great ambiance in the bar a restaurant and excellent food at reasonable prices. Special mention to our waitress at breakfast, Caroline. So friendly and attentive. Thank you!! ",5,2023,11,24
237,Liege and entire staff phenomenal!,"I am sooo impressed by the hotel restaurant for breakfast! Everyone is so warm and inviting and genuine! They all have a nice night smile on their face and service is soooo polished!!! Liege is especially a stand out! Every morning she’ll remember you and give you a warm welcome back! 

The food also is super fresh and I love the mix of buffet and a la carte items! The sausages were so great and I love how they use as many local ingredients as they can! Even the yogurt!

Fresh squeezed orange juice is also a plus! This staff all deserves a raise!!! Phenomenal job!!!",5,2023,11,21
237,"Excellent, centrally located boutique hotel ","Beautiful boutique hotel. Interesting art collection.  Staff were delightful from the front desk, to restaurant, to cleaning staff.

237,Great service.,"The staff at this hotel  are excellent. I have traveled extensively and I do have to say this is the best staff  I have encountered so far. especially Lakisha and Lea at the front desk. They go above and beyond .

237,Great Stay at The Morrison Dublin,"Stayed at the Morrison Dublin for a week.  First, the location, central and a quick walk to all the places of interest and eating places.  Minutes from the Temple Bar area and also to the shopping areas.  Second, a very cozy hotel tucked away with the entrance on the side. Very clean, well appointed rooms, may be a little small or tight for some but that is city center Dublin for you.  Third amazing staff, starting with Maria at the front desk who was so helpful with our reservation changes (we extended), and Eleuton Alvarez at breakfast who was always ready to assist with a big smile.  Made the stay a very pleasurable, comfortable and memorable.",5,2023,11,13
237,Great romantic mini-break!,"We stayed at the Morrisson for our anniversary in November 2023 (our 2nd visit). We got an upgrade to a Junior Suite which was a really nice room - very spacious and felt extremely luxurious. The staff were attentive and helpful, but not over-the-top or intrusive. The concierge (Ricardo) was able to give us some great restaurant recommendations, and we were also given a surprise mini-box of chocolates when they realised it was our anniversary. We didn't dine in the hotel, but we did have the hotel breakfast buffet which was pretty decent and well-stocked. Location is incredibly central and perfect for tourism. The staff were very welcoming to us as an LGBTQ+ couple and didn't bat an eyelid or do anything to make us uncomfortable (as it should be, but still worth pointing out unfortunately!). Would definitely recommend. ",5,2023,11,09
237,"Clean, Comfortable & Convenient ","The staff, especially Ricardo & Nabid, were so generous with their time and care in answering all of our questions, helping us make arrangements, and ensuring our stay was enjoyable.  The breakfast included was diverse and delicious and an easy way to start our day. The hotel was clean and quite comfortable and located perfectly for any activity you seek in Dublin. We are 40 shades of green in love with our decision to stay here.

Our room was comfortable and spotlessly clean and we very much enjoyed our most recent stay.",5,2023,11,03
237,One of Dublin’s best accommodations. ,"My wife and I were traveling for holiday. We stayed in Dublin for an overnight stay before returning to the USA. This is a beautiful hotel in a great location. Close to the Temple bar district and walkable to many key tourist attractions. 
We had stayed at several 5 star hotels in our travels on our trip and were pleasantly surprised by the quality of this hotel. The staff and managers could not have been more helpful. Our room was clean and comfortable. ",5,2023,10,29
237,Very good ,Best breakfast we have had in a hotel in a long time. Everything well presented and great quality. All the staff are so friendly and helpful from reception to waiting staff in both restaurant and at breakfast too. Food in the restaurant was lovely as well. Rooms were nice and were quite at night. Good quality shampoo conditioner and shower gel also.,5,2023,10,29
237,Glad we chose this hotel.,"The hotel is great but the staff are exceptional. Always smiling and welcoming from check in, restaurant, housekeeping etc.  Special mention to Ricardo on the front desk - helpful and cheery throughout our break and sorted a problem we had with our room quickly and efficiently.  Also special mention to Liege at breakfast- nothing too much trouble and ensured that we had everything we could want for a great start to the day.  All the staff are a credit to the hotel but these 2 are worth their weight in gold! ",5,2023,10,29

237,Perfect stay,"Excellent hotel.  From the moment we walked in, staff gave a warm welcome and nothing was too much trouble.  We had to wait for our room and therefore running over the checking in time, but the staff more than made up for it.  The food was delicious,  the bed comfy and amenities were excellent.

Don’t hesitate to stay here! We will be back!",5,2023,10,23
237,"Nice hotel, good location.  Zero complaints!  ","We were ""walked"" from our previously booked hotel and requested that they book us here at The Morrison.  And we are glad we did!

The hotel is centrally located, a 4-minute walk from the Dublin Express bus stop from the airport.  (Hint:  Use the Wellington Key stop when coming in from the airport, it's closer than waiting for the bus to circle back on the other side of the river on the hotel side).  

Check-in was efficient and friendly.  And we had dinner in the hotel restaurant.  Most hotel restaurants are mediocre.  But the Morisson Grill was quite good!  So much so that we had a second meal there.

The breakfast buffet was a bit of a let-down for us though (doesn't seem to be a part of the Morisson Grill, as it's off to the side).  So much so that we ate just down the street at a great little diner that served breakfast that was outstanding, and cost less on top of it all!

The room was nice enough.  All very modern with decent sized bathroom (separate shower and tub were nice!).  The bedding was great!  (We plan to contact the hotel to find out if any of it is for sale.  The pillows were amazing!!)

Should we ever return to Dublin, we would certainly make this a top priority to return to The Morisson!  Everything (except for breakfast) was very good to excellent!  ",4,2023,10,21
237,Perfect stay in Dublin,"Staff, location, property made for the perfect stay in Dublin. Such a great hotel for anyone. A must for a Dublin visit. Staff really make the property come alive. Walking distance to absolute everything. Temple Bar area a 2 minute walk. Easy transportation access. Restaurants are amazing. ",5,2023,10,21
237,NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY,"I do not see this as a 5 star hotel. Our friend booked two rooms and he did not get what he booked. They put us in a smaller and very cramped two room. The floors are squeaky when you walk into the room and bathroom and the furniture is ikea cheap. The corner walls are poorly done and construction throughout the hallway. At least close that floor until you are done with construction or put us somewhere else to begin with. Breakfast did not taste very good, I recommend Murphys which is down the street for amazing flavors on drinks and food. All in all, this did not fell like a 5 star when you walk in, staying and walking out. I rather book a hostel next time!",1,2023,10,21
237,Perfect location. ,"This hotel fronts the Liffey River with a walking bridge to city center north and south. It is a perfect location. The rooms are average size, updated and very clean. Drinking water is provided everyday. We only had breakfast, it was very good with good service. We arrived early dropped our bags and when we returned our bags were in our rooms. I did have an issue with the air conditioning or lack of. It was never really resolved but the hotel showed concern and made it right in the end. As room temperature is a personal preference, what was an issue for me may not be an issue for others. All in all we had a pleasant stay at this Hilton property. ",5,2023,10,12
237,Excellent quick trip to Dublin,"We met Ricardo at the front desk. He was amazing.  He gave really terrific recommendations on where to eat.  He also went out of his way to contact the Guinness factory for us.  He was just so pleasant and couldn’t do enough for you. 
I also thought the rooms were very comfortable, delicious breakfast and nice bar.",5,2023,10,09
237,"Amazing location, clean and quiet rooms. Very nice!","Stayed for 3 nights on Hilton points… what a win!  Staff was extremely helpful, we were able to have them hold our bags until the room was ready. They texted when room was ready and bags were already in the room when we returned. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Extremely quiet hallways. The breakfast is awesome and the waitstaff is friendly and attentive. Would stay here again in a heartbeat. Great experience!",5,2023,10,04
237,Excellent!,"I ended up staying here whilst on a work visit by chance as where I usually stay was fully booked.  Despite being an extra 10 minutes walk to the office I’m glad I ended up here.

Upon arrival my room wasn’t ready (I was early) but I completed all the formalities and they kept my bag whilst I headed to the office.  When I got back to collect my luggage it had already been put in my room.
The room was huge and had everything you could need and the shower was heaven!

I had a drink in the bar a few times but didn’t eat here.  On all occasions the service was personable and welcoming.

The front desk staff here are also super friendly.  Every time I passed I was greeted with a hello or good morning / evening, how are you doing.

I was very happy the other place was full otherwise I’d never have known about this place and I’ll certainly be staying on future visits.  Can’t wait to come back!",5,2023,10,03
237,Great place to base explorations of Dublin,"Our stay at the Morrison was excellent.  As many others have noted, the location is perfect, with numerous places of interest on either side of the River Liffey within comfortable walking distance.  Our stay included complimentary breakfasts, and those were wide in available choices and high in quality, with outstanding servers who were delighted to bring our coffee/tea and special orders to our table.  The housekeepers kept our warmly appointed and perfectly functional room fully supplied and in top shape in their daily visits.  Also of special note for us was Deivids, the friendly bartender who not only served us lunch and great drinks but also provided advice on Irish whiskey, recommendations on places to visit, and stories of his life in Ireland.  When we return to Dublin, the Morrison will again be the base station for our explorations.",5,2023,10,03

Nothing has been too much trouble and beyond responsive! Our suite is gorgeous with a view of the Liffey but somehow completely quiet.,5,2023,10,02
237,Highly recommend ,"What wonderful accommodations. Fantastic staff highlighted by Eleuton who took great care of us both mornings of our stay at breakfast. 

It also served as a great location to fun activities (including the nightlife of course)  just across the river, but also great shopping just a couple blocks away. 

Everything was well within walking distance. ",5,2023,10,02
237,Dublin Madness😄,"This hotel is in great location! 10- -15 mins walk from major sites. Staff is friendly, willing to recommend great places to eat or do and the Seafood chowder is a must have when dining in the hotel or even room service! ",5,2023,09,30
237,Wonderful stay,"Beautiful hotel, beautiful stay, beautiful people.  Would highly recommend a stay at the Morrison. It is quiet and the staff are some of the most friendly of any stay we have had.

237,A great stay!,"The hotel was lovely. Great location. Right on the River Liffey. Breakfast was amazing! Huge offerings! The staff was all TOP notch.

Highly recommend the hotel for its service, accommodations and location in the heart of Dublin.",5,2023,09,11
237,Luxury & Hospitality in the middle of Dublin,We felt welcomed as soon as we arrived. The staff was knowledgeable with the area and the hotel was both beautiful and comfortable. One of the things I loved was that the hotel was decorated with song lyrics. It was Lovely.,5,2023,09,11
237,Best stay ever,"I stayed here for just 2 nights it was a short stay for us. I was moving from india and had one of the best sleep here at morrison. Everything here was amazing, the staff, breakfast and all the services provided by them. It was my best stay so far. ",5,2023,09,11
237,Outstanding Breakfast and Staff.,"Wonderful hotel in a good location.  But noisy both from the traffic and people partying well into the night. On two successive nights, some external alarm went off and woke me up.  After I brought this to the attention of the front desk, it either never went off again or I slept through it.

Breakfast was complimentary for us as a Diamond member.  It is definitely five stars both the food and service.  It included both the buffet and an entree from the menu.  This amazed me as Hilton properties in the USA nickel and dime Diamond members on the breakfast.  As a result, I will no longer stay with Hilton in the States.  The breakfast staff was generally outstanding especially the identical twins from Brazil and the young man from a Mexico.

The bed was very comfortable.  The bathroom is designed poorly with the toilet right by the sink table.  This awkward arrangement does not allow a person to stand in front of the table.  Plus it would be easy to drop items into the commode.  Plus the shower is narrow.  Obviously this matter cannot be rectified.  

The exercise room is well stocked with loose weights.  Again, the staff is wonderful.  Even with the few shortcomings, we would stay at this property again.",4,2023,09,10
237,Our Lucky Charm in Dublin,"A wonderful hotel across the river from Temple Bar. Although it's near all the noise, it's a quiet property. Our mini-suite was very comfortable with all the amenities that we needed. The hotel staff was awesome. We wanted to visit out of the city and Howth was suggested. It was a 30-minute train ride to a nice seaside village. ",5,2023,09,10
237,Great hotel to stay in,Excellent hotel to stay for the week. In the heart of Dublin. From the Morrison everything was walking distance. The Guest Relations Manager: Marianna was very helpful & insightful on what activities to do while my stay in Dublin.,5,2023,09,08
237,Customer service off the charts A+,"I wish I could give the Morrison in Dublin more than 5 stars. But since I can't do that in the tripadvisor system, let me do it verbally instead.

We've stayed here multiple times because it's a fab property in a perfect location (legit walking distance to whatever you want and even shorter walks to busses, trams, and trains.) The rooms are hip, the beds are ridiculously comfy, and your room is reliably cleaned and turned down every single day. It's always been such a well run place, and we've enjoyed so many different stays here over the past 5 years. 

HOWEVER the customer service of our most recent visit is what compels me to write now. We found ourselves in need of a last-minute room at the worst possible time: Dublin was hosting an American football game that brought 50,000 extra people to town, students were coming back, and summer tourism was still in play. The entire city was just plain sold out, and we were screwed. The amazing staff at the Morrison helped us secure a room - even amidst the chaos they were certainly experiencing. And we needed to keep extending that stay beyond what we expected. So I was the crazy lady reserving another night. And then another one. And each time, I'd just grab whatever room the Hilton website said ""yes, this one is available."" And somehow, the wonderful staff was able to continuously allow us to keep the room we were originally in rather than packing up and moving over and over and over (and we weren't in a basic room - I don't know how they did this, but man I am so grateful.)

Beyond this, the breakfast served at the Morrison is delicious - but it comes with the kindest service you'll experience. Liege, Caroline, Rodrigo, Elouton, Pierre - you begin the day with wonderful people bringing you whatever you need, and they send you away with a to-go espresso or croissant, too. They just couldn't have been better at their jobs, and beginning our days with such kind, competent professionals was awesome.

Our time in Dublin was personally stressful, but the Morrison - from the front desk folks to the servers to the room cleaners - made our stay so absolutely wonderful. 

This is a property worthy of praise, and worthy of your time in Dublin.",5,2023,09,05
237,Wonderful visit on Dublin,"Probably a 4.5. Staff was wonderful and super helpful.  Especially the staff for the morning breakfast. They worked quick and efficiently when it was super busy because of the Notre Dame v Navy football weekend. The room, which was an upgraded room, was just ok and nothing special. Location was great and made it easy to get to all of the sites.",4,2023,09,02
237,"Clean, modern, quiet","This was a comfortable, modern hotel with everything I’d expect of a first rate business hotel owned by Hilton.  It was in a very quiet location, yet a very short walk from all the tourist areas and restaurants too. After a long overnight flight they had a shower and changing facility which was great, since I arrived about 7am and my room wasn’t ready for hours.   Good breakfast too.",4,2023,08,31
237,Best Wedding Venue,"A gorgeous hotel and perfect venue. Sarah and her team really made the day magical for us while putting us at ease. The Morrison staff were so patient with us after a few postponements due to lockdowns and covid. Sarah always listened to our concerns and requirements while offering keen advice. The day turned out to be a wonderful way to celebrate after all that waiting.

Everything was laid out perfectly, and the staff really took the time with our personal touches. The food was also spectacular. We had multiple guests tell us it was some of the best wedding food they'd ever had. Special care was also taken for guests with dietary concerns.

The penthouse was an extra special treat for me and my husband! Such a lovely touch for couples that really makes the day feel indulgent.  I highly recommend the Morrison as a wedding venue.",5,2023,08,31
237,"Hands down, best hotel in Ireland ","There's so much to love about the Morrison: friendly & attentive staff,  delicious food, breakfast (order the pancakes!), stylish rooms,  central location, funky bar and restaurant. Always recommended",5,2023,08,30
237,The Morrison Dublin was great!,"We loved our stay at the Morrison Dublin Hotel! Everything was great - excellent location, staff friendly and helpful, room was very nice, clean and modern. Breakfast was very good with a great selection (and the coffee was great)! Walking distance to many of Dublin’s sites and restaurants. We would definitely stay here again if we have the opportunity to come back to Dublin and  will recommend to our friends as well!",5,2023,08,28
237,The hotel has friendly staff but lacks information transfer at reception. An earlier breakfast was promised but unavaila,"Excellent hotel with friendly staff. The only issue was that no information was passed from person to person at the reception. On the day of departure, an earlier breakfast was promised, but reception says it is ""not available,"" despite the fact that it was promised and included in the accommodation price on the day of departure as well.
The meal quality is also such that we frequently ate elsewhere because we could get better for less.",3,2023,08,27
237,Disappointing,"This property is very well located right on the river and a walk bridge directly to temple bar.

Dublin has a wide range of excellent properties of high standard and the prospect of staying at one of Hilton’s stylish and well appointed curio level properties appealed .

Sadly it doesn’t meet the level one expects of a curio property and the rates demanded.

Reception is helpful however check in demonstrated they pre arrival correspondence hadn’t been communicated .

The property appears to have been renovated or recently appointed however the quality and standard is lacking , worn Carpets, extremely noisy air conditioning which keeps you awake at night , mediocre bathroom fittings that we expect from lesser brands, poorly  maintained and cleaned , only one robe for a two person booking , an average quality breakfast and mini bar offering .

The room size is ok and beds comfortable . 

Look, the hotel does its job as a relatively comfortable 3 or lower 4 star hotel . Comfortable and good size rooms and excellent location,  it it isn’t a luxury or premium hotel and charges rates which don’t deliver an expected level of service and fit out / design .",3,2023,08,25
237,Going the extra mile,"Traveled to Ireland for my wife and I’s one year wedding anniversary. Hotel was amazing l, Rick ran down the street the day we arrived to get  flowers and champagne for our room. 

Hotel is located to the fun bar district was great food. 

Also, the breakfast is amazing ",5,2023,08,13

237,Wedding venue -fabulous,"Used the Morrison as a wedding venue for my daughter . Fabulous food, attention to detail. Guests constantly mentioned food and quality of staff working there. Cost not as much as you might think! Really enjoyed it. Easy to get there, Luas /bus/taxi all near to hand.",5,2023,08,04
237,Our Wonderful Experience,"We arrived at the Morrision and immediately were made to feel welcome and relaxed. Book in was easy and friendly, Room was beautiful and comfortable. Food was excellent and bar was friendly and professional. Location is fantastic for seeing Dublin. Recommended and we will be back. ",5,2023,08,02
237,An Asian girl with wonderful smile,"Absolutely impressed with the exceptional job the staff, Camellia, has done in keeping the hotel's public areas immaculate. Her attention to detail is evident in every corner, and it truly enhances the overall ambiance of the hotel. Not only does she approach her work diligently, but she also greets everyone with a warm and friendly ""good morning"" and a fantastic smile. Thank you Morrison Hotel for creating such a welcoming and clean environment for us to relax and enjoy our stay.",5,2023,07,29
237,Perfect location,"This hotel is situated in the perfect location. Everything we wanted to see and do was within walking distance, and if not then there is a LUAS stop very close by.
The staff are welcoming and helpful, nothing is too much trouble. Our bedroom was a good size and was spotlessly clean. ",5,2023,07,25
237,Great place to use your Hilton points.,"It's a nice hotel steps away from the nightlife and sites of Dublin.  It was all spotlessly clean and modern with lots of surfaces to place the suitcases, which I appreciate.  We weren't able to book a room with two beds online, but they kindly did it for us at check in, and the staff at the coffee stand could not have been sweeter.",4,2023,07,24
237,The Best Hotel in Dublin ❤️!  Highly recommend!,"My husband and I have stayed multiple times at the Morrison Hotel, and this hotel never ceases to amaze us.
Service was fantastic in all areas of the hotel,  and it is what we are accustomed to every time we stay here. 
Shout out to Rory Rooney GM, Derek Restaurant Manager, and Ricky Asst. Dining Room Manager.
We look forward to returning again soon…

237,"Great Hotel, Located Across From Temple Bar","Nice hotel just across the river from Temple Bar, easy to get to most places (hop-on/off bus goes right by). We were able to stay twice on our trip (four nights total, two rooms each time) and found the staff to be well trained and professional, providing all around good service. The breakfast was included in our rate and is nice, they even had a variety of gluten-free options that my family appreciated. Some of us ate in the restaurant for dinner and enjoyed it, the bar area is also quite nice.

One of the rooms was louder than we’d have anticipated (broken seal perhaps?) but management was attentive to the feedback and other rooms had no issue, even on the river facing Temple Bar.

Credit to Rory and his team for their attention to detail and efforts to ensure guests have an enjoyable stay.",5,2023,07,17
237,Outstanding customer service,"Outstanding customer service from a very friendly, well-trained staff. This seems to be this hotel's distinctive contribution to Dublin's hospitality reputation. That said, standards are very high throughout all aspects of this hotel - food, amenity, housekeeping - the whole experience in fact. Simply excellent throughout: thank you!",5,2023,07,11
237,Fantastic City Centre Wedding Venue!,"A huge Thank You to all at The Morrison Hotel for making our wedding a truly memorable one! 

It was absolutely fabulous from start to finish. All our guests have commented on the quality of food, venue and above all the staff and how friendly and accommodating everyone was.

For our wedding day we wanted a city centre experience as most wedding we have gone to have been outside of Dublin, therefore we wanted to do something different and true to us as a couple.  
We have always loved The Morrison Grill for a date night dinner so when we booked our ceremony for City Hall, The Morrison Hotel was a no brainer decision for our reception. A 5-minute walk across the river Liffey was perfect and allowed for great picture opportunities along the way.   

Upon our first meeting with Sarah, she was ever so friendly and helpful, throughout the planning process she was always quick to respond and bent over backwards to help us with any queries or worries. 

All the team treated us extra special whenever we stopped by on the run up to the big day, even if it was just for a quick chat or for a delicious meal in the Morrison Grill restaurant. A special nod to the food tasting experience on the lead up, it was such an enjoyable experience. Laura looked after us so well.     

The night before our wedding where we had drinks and nibbles in the Quay 14 bar, it was a lovely time to catch up with family and friends ahead of the big day.     

Rory and the team made sure everything ran smoothly for us on the day, which it did (from what saw and knew anyway! 😊). There was no sense of rush on the day it all ran with ease every stage of the day from drinks reception to DJ time.  

The food was superb, all the guests were so complimentary of it and the service. It’s still a talking point 4 months later!    

I created my own table centrepieces which The Morrison hotel had no issue with and so kindly let me get involved in dressing the tables the evening before.  

No request was an issue, they even took on the task of putting together our doughnut display which we chose as a cake alternative.  

Topping it all off staying in the Penthouse with its cityscape views!    

We would without a doubt highly recommend The Morrison Hotel. 

It will forever be our special place where we will continue to return to!",5,2023,07,10
237,Perfect stay ,"My daughter and I spent one night stay at the Morrison. Maria and Ricardo at the front desk were welcoming and helpful; Piyush from the concierge team was also so friendly and willing to help us at any time. Our room was spotless and comfortable with a modern decor. There are good quality products for showering etc are provided and the rain shower was excellent. The rest of this boutique hotel has also a really nice decor /vibe and it’s in a great proximity to most city centre interests positioned right on the river across from the Temple bar area. The car park recommended is on the same street and the hotel offer a discount for the stay there. We wished we had another night stay, so we will definitely stay in the Morrison again soon. Many thanks",5,2023,07,05
237,Nice Hotel but Offensive Credit Card Policy,"This is a really nice Hotel in a great location just over the River from Temple Bar.. The buffet breakfast is excellent and the staff are all friendly and helpful. Special mention for the Brazilian identical twin sisters in the breakfast restaurant who were both exceptionally nice.
We enjoyed our 
We enjoyed our 3 night stay but wish the Hotel would revise its Credit Card Policy. We had pre-paid the Hotel through an online engine and when we checked-in the hotel blocked a small amount on my card to cover incidentals. Fine but then whenever we went over that amount the hotel would keep incrementally blocking an additional amount to the point that my Card Company (with whom we have an aotopay arrangement to pay the account in full at the end of each period) contacted me to question what was going on. We found this practise to be unnecessary and offensive because the hotel had my Crad details on file and could have charged any unpaid amount should we have (which of course we would not) aabsconded leaving unpaid accounts. If they really have such an apparent lack of trust in their guests, which we found offensive, they should just block a larger amount upon check-in to avoid keep bothering guests with this constant increase in blocking. My Card has a very high limit so I would have absolutely no problem with a substaantially higher block upon check-in.
This all left a bad taste in our mouth.",2,2023,07,04

237,Spectacular,"Absolutely perfect location, just at the side of the river, beautiful hotel, immaculately clean. Great welcome, smooth check in, lovely big clean room with plenty of amenities such as tea/coffee. Iron and ironing board, umbrella, complimentary toiletries. Breakfast was lovely, lots of choice and all fresh. Very attentive staff. Wouldn’t stay anywhere else in Dublin now that I’ve been here, Thankyou the Morrison ",5,2023,06,28
237,Perfect place to stage visits in Dublin at The Morrison,"My wife and I had a wonderful time staying at The Morrison Dublin for five nights in late May. The location is fantastic - near everything, including public transportation. Our King room was roomy and comfortable. We enjoyed one night dining at their restaurant after a full day of touring the city. The staff was friendly and helpful. The only complaint we had was some noise - not street noise - seagulls! Who knew they fly around squawking all night? Earplugs worked fine.",5,2023,06,19
237,Classy lovely hotel right in the city centre,"Top notch service, everyone was so nice.
The pillows and beds were so comfy.
The shower pressure was immaculate.
Located right in the city centre.
Only thing I can say is they need to offer vegan chocolates as well 😂",5,2023,06,19
237,Great stay!,"We had a fantastic stay at the Morrison. The room was comfortable, toiletries were of good quality and the beds were comfortable.
The breakfast had plenty of choices and the service was quick and courteous. The location is nice in the city center by the river.
A special shout out to Marianna at the check-in desk who was so helpful and made us smile. I wish we had stayed longer!",5,2023,06,19
237,Great location for seeing the sights in Dublin,"Stayed here for a few nights while in Dublin before heading to Killarney. Hotel is in an excellent location as we didn't rent a car, and our tours were all within walking distance as were numerous pubs and restaurants. Had asked for an upgrade through Hilton Honors and received one upon check-in. However, I am not sure the upgraded room was any different from the standard king. Service was fine, and the restaurant in the hotel had good food. Would definitely recommend. ",4,2023,06,17
237,My Go-To hotel when I'm in Dublin,"As a frequent traveler, this is my Go-To hotel when I visit Dublin. I love everything about it - the helpful staff, the decor, comfy beds, quiet rooms, the bar area, good restaurant AND the location is perfect for touring Dublin (just across the bridge from the Temple Bar area). About a 20 minute Uber ride from the airport.  ",5,2023,06,14
237,Nice boutique hotel,"Wonderful hotel, staff and location.  Bar was very nice and relaxing, breakfast was good and staff was great!   Room was very nice.  Comfortable bed and nice shower.  Only issue: Could not get the room cool enough and it was only upper 60s.  Can’t imagine summertime.",4,2023,06,14
237,The customer service is unmatched. ,"This is the second time we've stayed here. I I should have written an exceptional review for Aug 2022 as well.  That time we were dealing with an 8 year old who had food poisoning (Food was consumed in the city).  The staff was very compassionate and helpful, giving tips for pharmacy's, Doctor, extending our stay and keeping our same room.  With that in mind, I knew we had to book again and under happier circumstances. 
Our stay in June 2023 didn't disappoint. We were greeted warmly.  Vren was working at the front desk and made sure all of our needs were taken care of. She was kind and jovial, just the attitude we needed after an overnight Atlantic crossing.  She gave a perfect tip of where to get the best hot chocolate for our daughter.  Thank you Vern!!!!!   We arrived at 9am, and it was totally understandable that our room wouldn't be ready just yet.  But they had a shower room available to freshen up. I took advantage of it and it really helped with the jet lag.  The staff also stored our baggage and brought it to the room when it was ready. 

  At the restaurant our breakfast was delicious, the staff swift and helpful.  We met the manager Rory who inquired about our travels and was very accommodating. We saw him over the next few days and he remember our names, very impressive considering the size of the hotel.  Every interaction, he seemed happily focused on our needs. While having to multitask, as any manager in the hospitality industry must do, you knew you had his 100% undivided attention.  

We booked two rooms one with a king bed, the second adjoining with two twins.  The rooms were immaculately clean, furnished to our liking.  We stayed for two nights, and if we weren't leaving for Galway would have enjoyed staying longer. 
The location of the hotel is perfect for walking to all the sights. We were able to see so many sights while having a home base to drop off shopping item. 

Thank you to the staff for making our second stay so pleasant. We truly appreciate the memories you all helped make for my family.  ",5,2023,06,13
237,Very well located hotel in Dublin,"So I liked it, but, there is a but, it was super expensive for what you get. It's rated at 5 stars, but I would personally not say it goes anywhere above 4. The rooms are a good size, some come with balconies, the bathrooms are large, both standing shower and a bathtub (quite rare to spot these). However, the floor is carpet, and I wouldn't say the highest quality of carpet. Another thing is the heating, it doesn't work, unless it's between specific hrs. I understand this might have to do with the govt, however, other 5 star hotels have heating on demand (sounds weird not to have heating on demand in 2023 at a 5 star hotel, right?); also my personal deluxe room had a view of a wall, not the best. The staff however, brilliant, they were so lovely from checkin to checkout, the restaurant downstairs? I absolutely recommend it, the food is great, drinks as well and the prices are all right. 
Overall, if you don't mind paying a bit more than usual and a few little things that might be uncomfortable, the hotel is located in the centre of Dublin, close to attractions and amenities, it's clean and as I said before the staff are brilliant.",3,2023,06,09
237,Good for 1 night,Stayed here for 1 night in. King River view room. Room was nice. Front desk and restaurant staff are top notch. Halo Restaurant for breakfast was superb. Took off 1 star because the bed and pillows were so uncomfortable. Felt like we were sleeping on top of a cardboard box.,4,2023,06,07
237,The staff make your day at Morrisson,"Very helpful staff, 5 stars to them.

Nice room but the beds are small, not 5 star beds as you would love. Loud noice from the ventilation system all the time. The breakfast was OK but not more, not as what you expect from a 5 star hotel. 

Perfect location, Temple Bar on other sidae the river. Lot of restaurants nearby. ",4,2023,06,06
237,Unbelievable ,We had our wedding at the hotel. From. Start to finish they exceeded our expectations. Sarah Reilly... Fiona and Jackie in events couldn't do enough. They are a credit to the hotel. As is peter at reception and all the girls and Jack. Ricky looked after us every morning for breakfast the whole weekend. He has the patience of a saint. Good is outstanding and the beds are the most comfortable. Do not hesitate to stay here. It's more than a 5 star hotel to us. ,5,2023,06,06
237,Wedding at the Morrison,"I got married at the end of May in the Morrison this year. Sarah,  the events manager was amazing in the months, weeks and days up until the wedding. She answered all of our questions, listened to all of our requests and helped to make the day perfect. On the day (as Sarah was not working), Jacqueline and her collogues were super. They went through everything with us and checked in regularly to make sure myself, my husband and our guests were having the time of their lives,  Amazing day, thank you. ",4,2023,06,06
237,Highly recommend!,"I stayed at the Morrison for 7 nights, and it really started to feel like home. Every member of the staff was welcoming, helpful and friendly. Big shout out to Jackie in the restaurant and meeting space who went above and beyond to make sure our requests were met. 
I also appreciate the front desk clerk (who was half Irish, half Texan!) for understanding my need for a room accessible by stairs due to my claustrophobia and dislike of elevators. He was so thoughtful and put me in a room on the first floor (second floor for Americans), it made a huge difference in my stay and I can’t thank him enough. 
The hotel is right on the river; Primark, M&S and Boots are a few blocks in one direction and the Millennium Bridge taking you to the heart of Dublin is steps away in the other direction.
The only downside was the noise I could hear from the room across from me, the doors could use some soundproofing but that is why I always travel with earplugs. Overall, I would happily come back and recommend The Morrison to anyone, especially for the price - it’s a great find!",4,2023,05,31
237,A bit hot,"Very centrally located by the Liffey and near the Jervis shopping precinct. Close to the LUAS tram with connections to both Connolly and Heuston stations. The hotel is modern with a lovely restaurant and bar overlooking the street and the river. The room was hot as the air conditioning was broken, the staff gave us a fan. Good bathroom facilities.",4,2023,05,29
237,Make sure and get the breakfast included,This is a wonderful hotel in the city center. The beds were so comfy it was difficult to get up! Make sure and get the breakfast included. It was great and the staff there were very helpful to my sister and me as we use walkers . You can order off a menu as well as the buffet. We both had poached eggs with toast .,5,2023,05,27
237,So sad to be so very disappointed.,"Whatever happened to the Morrison?! After a few years away we came back especially to celebrate our anniversary.

- Not busy but a few very loud drunks in the bar every night. And everywhere else in Dublin was heaving!
- Breakfast buffet doesn’t include eggs!!! Really?!!!! You have to order these separately and especially so you have to have your hot breakfast in two parts. The only bread has been handled by lots of other guests (unless you want Guinness bread which has had every particle of moisture removed). And because you’re ordering in parts you can’t eat at the same time as your partner!!!!! And a whopping 23 euros each NOT to eat your eggs and your tomatoes at the same time!!!!
- The rooms are small and the same colour scheme and decor as Premier Inn.
- There is a ‘nice’ seating area near reception with large luxurious sofas. Day one - a couple sat on one of the two large sofas. ‘He’ took his shoes off and fell asleep while ‘she’ went to the toilet- I know this because he was snoring loudly!!!! Day three, a couple on one of the bench type areas both asleep at 9.30 am when we went out for breakfast - and her with her feet on the furniture. They were still there when we got back at 10.05. What is going on??!! Are the hotel renting out the reception furniture?!
- Second day - the new set of loud drunks were SO LOUD we were driven out of the bar area to the ‘nice’ seating area. Only to find a woman on loud FaceTime calls. By call three we went back to our room - only to find that once again our minibar had not been restocked!

More negatives:
- no convenient mirror at which to sit and apply make up
- The chair in the room was far too big for the space it was in. If someone sits on it the only way to get past is to climb over the bed!
- Why ever would you have this decorating your hotel room wall (typed in case photograph doesn’t load)
   “I wish I was a fisherman
     Tumblin on the seas
      Far away from dry land
      And it’s bitter memories”
    Unless of course you’d spent 400 euros a night to stay on this particular bit of ‘dry land’!

   I don’t know how this place is still in business- it certainly doesn’t know the meaning of quality standards and service. 

   And the good?  The bed was comfortable (not so the pillows), and the rain water shower was very good. The location is very good.
    We shall definitely not be returning!!!!

Post note: On checkout we were asked ‘Did you enjoy your stay?’. I said ‘Errr’ and my husband hesitated and then said ‘okay’, with a downward inflection……. No supplementary question followed for clarification. Speaks volumes!!!!",2,2023,05,25
237,Location location,"Great Hilton offspring in a fantastic location right on the River Liffey, a stones throw from Temple Bar district.  Rooms were lovely - we were upgraded to a Deluxe King thanks to Hilton Honors.   Pillow were dreadful but I find that standard.   Breakfast was terrific as it offered a la carte as well as buffet - something you normally don’t get.   Lovely bar & restaurant.   Service was of very high standard.  It was expensive the weekend we stayed - eu$700 - so I would’ve expected all these things at that price.",4,2023,05,23
237,Great location cute hotel!,Fantastic location!! Really amazing service as well. Cute lobby area. Room itself is just a standard room. Hopefully you won’t be spending too much time in the hotel itself as there is the entire heart of Dublin right outside the door! ,5,2023,05,21
237,"GREAT PLACE, LOCATION AND TEAM","I absolutely can not say enough good about The Morrison. From check-in to check-out (8 nights) it was all wonderful. The rooms, hotel, bar/restaurant and everything about it was EXCELLENT! Help for directions, places to see, things to do and everything in between were all helpful. My travel partner had a heart attack and they couldn't have helped more, or been more accommodating. And we did continue our 6 weeks of travel, after he was released from the hospital.",5,2023,05,20

237,Excellent,"Excellent room, service and location. Would definitely return.  Front desk staff were very knowledgeable and friendly.  Parking was in a building across the street. They will stamp your parking ticket at the front desk for a discount. Wish we had time to stay longer than 1 night!",5,2023,05,18
237,Beautiful Hotel with Wonderful Staff,"The hotel was fabulous!! The junior suite was a great size, but the bathroom was HUGE! Everyone working at The Morrison makes you feel special. We stayed here for 2 days prior to heading to England and 3 days after. I had knee surgery between the visits and they made every effort to make me comfortable. But, Eoghan was the real star. He made us feel like family. We loved our time at the bar, catching up with him while he made truly beautiful and delicious cocktails. 

We're going back to The Morrison in June 2023 and can't wait to see all our friends!",5,2023,05,16
237,Our Second Stay at this Wonderful Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel about 5 years ago on our honeymoon. When we came back for our 5 year anniversary, they recognized that we were back and took even better care of us. The hotel staff at this hotel goes over and above in every single way. We had dinner and drinks at the bar one night, breakfast one morning in the hotel, ordered room service one night, and even stopped by for a random coffee in the middle of the day. No matter what different experience we had, they went over and above to make us feel special. The location is walking distance to everything and we love it here. We will never stay at any other hotel when we visit Dublin!!",5,2023,05,16
237,Great stay,"Very nice hotel with a good location in Dublin—-close enough to Temple Bar, but in a quieter area. Very nice bed linens. Good breakfast options with quick service. Also ate in the hotel restaurant one night and the food and service were good.",5,2023,05,12
237,Great place to stay in the heart of Dublin!,"Spent our first few days in Dublin at The Morrison and will 100% stay here again! The staff was so friendly, provided good recommendations, and were very accommodating. Our room was a good size with a very comfy bed. And the bathroom was so dreamy! ",5,2023,05,11
237,Friendliest Staff :),"Recently I stayed at the hotel for a work trip. At the reception the staff couldn’t have been lovelier, especially the bell boys offering to help with luggage and showing me to the meeting room.

The hotel room was beautiful, extremely clean and really spacious. 

As I am coeliac I was apprehensive about gluten free options but all the staff were very clued up on what I could and couldn’t eat. There was also a great variety of food choices - unlike most places! The food was amazing. 

Thanks to the duty manager for ensuring such a great trip.",5,2023,05,10
237,Best location and service!,"We had such a wonderful time at the Morrison in Dublin.  They accommodated a late check in for my family, and alerted the entire staff to be on the look out for my phone that I left in the cab we took from the airport.  The driver returned my phone and we were immediately received a call from the front desk :). The breakfast was delicious with lots of options to choose from.  Entire experience 10 out of 10.",5,2023,05,09
237,"Excellent Stay, Excellent Service","After a whirlwind trip through Holland and Northern Europe, we had a one day layover at the Morrison before heading back to the USA.  The service, comfort and food were excellent.  We had high tea which was enough to be our dinner and a complete breakfast the next morning that was the best we had for entire three week trip.  Our room was very comfortable with a view of the River Liffey and of the the full moon rising.  ",5,2023,05,07
237,Great customer service,"Peter at the front desk was so helpful and wonderful to work with during my stay.  From assisting with getting us into our room, to calling a taxi..a true hospitality professional.  Oh and the restaurants were amazing too!  The staff was so accommodating and kind!",5,2023,05,06
237,"Perfectly located, brilliant staff - but is it worth it?","Location and staff are out of this world, the rooms are ok but nothing special - cleanliness ok but not 100%, breakfast nice but again, not superb... It is a 5 star hotel and comes with a price, and as everthing in Dublin is expensive, we were willing to pay almost 400€ a night incl. breakfast - and in my view, the price-value ratio is a bit off. Anyway, a beautiful hotel and a nice stay in Dublin. No other Dublin hotels to compare so this is as good as it gets, but I have stayed in hundreds of other 5 star hotels - for business and private as well. ",4,2023,05,04
237,Great location!,"Quiet but in such a  convenient location.  This hotel is in a great location, across the river from all the main touristy locations but so walkable. Our room was on the 1st floor, which is actually the 2nd floor and we were initially concerned about potential noise but it was very quiet. Loved the breakfast.  Thanks for a great stay! ",5,2023,05,03
237,We would go again ,The hotel and staff were the best we have had in a long time. They spoiled us and treated us as family and that was with 2 large groups in the hotel.  We loved the food and the room. We would absolutely go again.,5,2023,04,27
237,FAULTLESS,"Stayed on Friday and Saturday in April. Was able to sit in the bar and work on the Friday - wifi is brilliant. Was able to check in slight early which helped me out with my plans. Dined in the restaurant on Friday, good food and reasonably priced, attentive service from Maria. 
Rory in the restaurant looked after me despite me turning up late for breakfast. 
What is definitely a running theme throughout the hotel, is that the staff cannot do enough for you. Friendly, welcoming, attentive. A really nice experience all round.",5,2023,04,22
237,Fantastic stay in Dublin,"10 day stay at the Morrison for work, I will absolutely be returning for future stays. Hotel is centrally located in the city center with access to Luas, Train stations and Temple Bar but across the bridge so you can sleep at night. The facility itself is clean, modern and cozy. The staff all hours of the day from front desk, bar, room service and concierge have been more than genuinely warm and welcoming. Truly a great experience, from check in to check out and everything in between. Shout out to Quay14 for for starting to scoop my daily bucket of ice as soon as they saw me coming, and remembering my drink preference from the first day forward. Highly recommend anyone traveling to Dublin for work or play, can’t be location and great staff.",5,2023,04,22

237,Comfortable and beautiful,Gorgeous hotel all around. The beds and pillows were SO comfortable. We had two teen boys with us so they got their own room (very common in Europe) and their room was as good as our king. We had a river view which was worth the money! Highly recommend.,5,2023,04,18

237,Wonderful Hotel,"First time stay and very pleased with it, right in the middle of everything. 

Really friendly staff nothing to much trouble. 

Breakfast was really lovely and served till midday on Saturday and Sunday which meant no rushing round or big Qs. However not sure if this is a permeant thing as they were refurbing their main restaurant. 

Be nice if they kept that but going,",5,2023,04,17
237,Stylish and Amazing.,"A beautiful and stylish boutique hotel with the loveliest staff. The welcome on our arrival was wonderful and being remembered when we checked back in at the end of our trip was a special. Reception staff, particularly Nikita, were so helpful. She sorted out suitcase storage and phoned us when our room was ready.
The rooms we had at both ends of our week were beautifully appointed. The king deluxe was great on our first night in Ireland and the king junior suite for the 2 nights at the of our trip was gorgeous, thank you.
Breakfasts were tasty with plenty of hot and cold choices and wonderful dining room staff.
The bar was great fun and a very popular cocktail spot with friendly staff who were very proficient with the drinks even when it was very busy.
Wouldn't want to stay anywhere else in Dublin, The Morrison has spoiled me. Thank you.",5,2023,04,15
237,Exceptional Customer Service,"Just finishing a three night stay at the hotel with my sister. From arrival throughout our stay we were wowed by the amazing experience offered by this hotel. Marianna went above and beyond to get our room ready early and delivered the room keys to us in the restaurant. She was so friendly and welcoming. A real asset to the customer service department. Our room was bright and impeccably clean. Much attention to detail and very quirky decor which we loved.
In the restaurant Rory and his staff were incredible with very attentive service and a lovely selection of hot and cold items for breakfast each morning. We had lunch there one day and enjoyed the most amazing seafood chowder!",5,2023,04,15

237,Perfect location in Dublin...Perfect Hotel!,"The Morrison is under the Hilton and met all of our needs on our one week stay in Dublin. Location could not be better - on the north side of the river, walking distance t o Trinity College, Temple Bar and most of Dublin's attractions and restaurants.  Hotel design is contemporary, it's a boutique style hotel with 4 floors, rooms are fresh and immaculate, the breakfast every morning had a great selection of eggs, meats, fruit, yogurt, juices, coffees and more - could not be better.  Staff is very helpful and accommodating. We will definitely be back and I highly recommend the Morrison for a stay in Dublin. ",5,2023,04,13
237,Quite quaint and charming,The accommodations were wonderful. The room was very spacious for a city room. The staff was superb. They were very informative and kind.

Really enjoyed the central location of this hotel, walking distance to restaurants, bars and shops. Breakfast was great, with an explanation of how it works, buffet and hot menu. Limited GF options.

237,Top Tier Hotel,"Top Tier Hotel. Centralized in the city— easy to walk everywhere. The staff could not be better at recommendations. 
This was really a comfortable hotel as a touch base  as we rocked Dublin. This was right across the bridge from pubs and everything you could want to do. We loved the hotel restaurant for an afternoon coffee( or Guinness) break",5,2023,04,10
237,Great property and location,The Morrison was a perfect choice for our first visit to Dublin.  It’s a lovely property in a perfect location proximate to the city center.  The room was perfect—great king bed and nicely fitted bathroom.   All the staff with whom we dealt were welcoming and helpful when we had questions.,5,2023,04,10
237,Morrison Hotel staff makes a wonderful hotel truly a gem!,"It goes without saying that the Morrison is a lovely  modern hotel with an excellent bar and restaurant. Furthermore, the hotel’s superior location makes it a marvelous choice for a visit to Dublin. The Morrison’s staff were a lifesaver for me! I lost my passport prior to visiting Dublin, and at least five hotel staff members went out of their way to assist me and to comfort my nerves. I will never forget them. Kudo’s to the Morrison!!",5,2023,04,06
237,Not Five Star,"Where do I begin? 

Overall our stay started badly and ended badly. I have done my upmost to give Hilton a chance, but every time I stay in one I am left disappointed. I will no longer be using Hilton or the points system. 

We arrived just after 3 and were told that the rooms weren't ready. 2 and half hours later and I still wasn't in my room. I was told we were being upgraded to deluxe rooms - this didn't happen. We were given 2 complimentary drinks each (which were flat!!)  and later offered dinner. 

The rooms were ok - in the bathroom of 407 the roof was hanging down. The air conditioning in both rooms did not work and the were consistently too hot. Attempts to leave the window open during the night were futile due to the constant noise of either screaming/shouting and police sirens. I was woken at 3:30 am to the sound of someone seemingly being killed? But Hilton will say they have double/triple glazing. Well guess what Hilton - it doesn't work lol 

In room 408 the net curtains were torn and there were small black hairs in the shower. The Cast2Tv did not work. The curtains are not blackout and invariably let light in early in the morning. The bed was atrocious! The most uncomfortable bed - this appears to be standard across Hilton. It's lumpy and hard with pillows that go flat quickly and are hard to sleep on. The ""king"" bed was simply two beds pushed together - the wooden plinth style is probably another reason the mattress is so uncomfortable. 

The view from room 407 and 408 is onto the back of a building, which has occupants. People can most definitely see into your room. Be aware. 

The showers are standard - no good water pressure. The toilet was also so low! It was strange. 

A small note on the mini fridge - it's not cold. 

Next to breakfast - we were seated and left alone whilst everyone around us was offered table service. I'd imagine it was because they were American? Certainly felt that way. Nobody came to us. 

I helped myself to the cereal which was in a machine that ground the flakes to bits. There was hardly any juice - the containers were not even a quarter full. Ever. They were not cooled either and there was no ice - just a tub of water that should have been ice but was never replaced. The milk was left out, again not cooled. We were served COLD toast on each breakfast visit. My mum was served a luke warm latte and it took them 20 minutes to serve her a simple poached egg on toast (which was cold lol). The breakfast room itself is small - far too small for the number of guests. 

Dinner was ok, however we were shown one menu on the Sunday and a table of Americans were given another with different choices!!! Despite us being told there was only one menu. I will say the burger was tasty. Again the drinks - a diet coke and sprite - were flat. 

The lighting was so bad lol it was permanently dark, my mum had to use the torch on her phone to be able to read the menu. On the Monday (20th March 2023) I dared to have an ice cream sundae, after being served a cold ham and cheese toastie, which we had seen the day before - they were huge. Mine however was served in a glass jar the size of a small drinking glass they give you free water in. It summed up our entire experience as guests. 7.50 euros for the pleasure of a McFlurry sized ice cream. 

A note on the free water with dinner - do not drink this. It tastes really bad - I live in the UK and have never come across bad tasting tap water like this before. Atrocious. It actually gave me a bad stomach. 

To top off the stay we were then OVERCHARGED. I mean you really couldn't make it up. I had to send my confirmation emails to them - have you ever heard of this?!! When my mum dared to challenge the fact that our check in had been far too long, the lady at the desk attempted to preface this with how busy they had been. My mum, close to the edge of complete anger, decided against speaking back. There is no excuse for poor customer service when you claim to be 5 star. 

We were offered a taxi to the airport on Hilton - and we couldn't leave soon enough. 

This hotel is not a 5 star hotel. For a five star experience I'd choose The Westbury (we had afternoon tea there and will be staying there for future trips).",2,2023,03,22
237,Location and breakfast,"Excellent location for sightseeing and one of the best hotel breakfasts I've had in Dublin. The room was perfect, with a river view and everything needs for a comfortable stay. Hilton Honors benefits were freely provided. ",5,2023,03,20
237,Perfect Location - Excellent Hotel!! ,"Our brother and sister in law had stayed here and recommended this hotel - just perfect for our week in Ireland!  We stayed in Dublin as our base and did lots of day trips.  The Morrison is a wonderful location to walk to everything; dining, shopping, train etc and very comfortable!  Great housekeeping and service.  Beautiful dining as well.  ",5,2023,03,20
237,Central and comfortable,"The Morrison Hotel is a great spot to stay in Dublin, so central to both sides of the river but you don’t get noise. The staff couldn’t be more courteous and helpful while being natural and happy also. Food, breakfast all great! I’ll stay again, it’s a gem!",5,2023,03,15
237,"Chic boutique feel, big name quality.","We were pleasantly surprised with our stay. We weren’t quite sure of the vibe we would find, but we were happy to see the luxury and service of a big name hotel with the personalization and care of a small hotel. The room was comfortable, with a nice bathroom and mini bar service. The location was the best- convenient walk to all parts of Dublin. We drove, and had no problem getting in or out multiple times. There is a drop off area at the entrance on the side, car park at the next block. The car park was not open 24 hours, but we were able to park on the street for our early departure to the airport. The staff at Halo, especially the manager, was gracious each day. The food was also delicious. We also liked exploring the art around the hotel. We would stay again.",5,2023,03,10
237,Hilton with boutique feel,Two night stay. Good location with a lot to do within walking distance. Small property has a boutique feel. Many rooms with a river view. Comfortable room and bed. Walk in shower with seperate tub. Buffet breakfast available however did not meet the usual Hilton standards. Staff was very good but food was on the averag side and coffee was served tempid both morning. Still an enjoyable stay.,4,2023,03,06
237,A great stay! The location is perfect to explore Dublin!,"The Morrison is a great hotel for a trip to Dublin‘s fair city!

We stayed there for three nights and liked everything about the hotel.

The common areas (restaurant, lobby etc.) and the rooms are modern and clean and the location is great! The hotel is centrally located - one just has to cross a bridge and can directly explore Temple Bar. The main street, if you want to go shopping, is round the corner and there are plenty of coffee bars, restaurants and pubs in walking distance.
Breakfast is served in the beautifully designed Halo restaurant and the members of staff there  and at the reception desk are always friendly and ready to help.
We especially liked Onur who was our waiter in the mornings. He really made us feel welcome.
We would choose The Morrison again and can wholeheartedly recommend staying there when visiting Dublin.",5,2023,02,28
237,Irish hospitality at its finest.,"We found the facility and staff to be extremely professional and friendly.  Hilton hotels in the USA could learn a few things from their hospitality.  

We look forward to making this our hotel of choice on our return. ",5,2023,02,25
237,Great location and staff,"Had a lovely stay on a trip to Dublin for my birthday.
Rooms are lovely and enjoyed a welcome upgrade to a suite as a Hilton Diamond member.

Brilliant staff on check in, at breakfast and in the bar.",5,2023,02,18

Positives
Central, easy to walk around the city from it.
Reasonably priced car parking
Lovely bar and restaurant area
Comfortable beds
Fabulous shower
Very friendly attentive breakfast staff

Negatives
Advertised as sound proof bedrooms, this is not so. I could hear people talking on the street. Was woken at 6am by traffic noise.
Only one bathrobe in the room for 2 people 
No coffee machine in bedroom, only poor quality instant coffee
No complimentary biscuits on the hospitality tray",3,2023,02,17
237,Magnificent Morrison,"We popped into Morrison’s on a couple of occasions during a recent visit to Dublin. We love it now the bar is at the front, the old positioning didn’t do it justice. 

We were warmly welcomed on both occasions, the waiters were both fantastic, so friendly and efficient. One in particular remembered that on a previous visit had asked for a large glass of water with my glass of wine and presented this to me on the next visit without me asking. Great service.

We’ve not eaten in the restaurant for a number of years, however the bar is well worth a visit.",5,2023,02,11
237,Deluxe suite,"We loved the amazing location in city centre Dublin, all the shops and hustle and bustle was on the doorstep. We really enjoyed the  five star service. There has been a recent refurbishment which is beautiful and tasteful. We ate in the restaurant and the menu had something for me and my husband and it was delicious. We noticed that the staff were friendly and attentive too.",5,2023,02,09
237,"Close, but quiet","Great hotel in the perfect location. Just on the other side of the river from the Temple Bar area, it’s close to everything without the noise. We stayed here for almost a week to start our Ireland trip, then came back and stayed right in Temple Bar area for our last night … Monday … and I couldn’t believe how loud for how long it was. Truly terrible. Made me TRULY appreciate how wonderful the Morrison was. 

Staff was wonderful. Gym was great (and rarely had another person in it). The room had storage, comfy bed and everything else we needed. Wonderful choice! Highly recommend!",5,2023,02,09
237,Enjoy a lovely stay in Dublin by staying at the Morrison Dublin Curio,"We came to Ireland for a friends birthday. Although we would be traveling to Cahersiveen we flew into Dublin and spent a few days. We stayed here January 29th through February 1st and upon our arrival at the Morrison Dublin we were greeted by the very kind Tod who gave us a wonderful surprise that they upgraded us to a suite! The suite was gorgeous, spacious and well equipped. My husband usually goes to bed later than myself so having the living room was helpful. The bathroom was also spacious with two sinks, a shower AND a separate lovely bathtub (which I took full advantage of to soak in after a long day of sightseeing). We had a Nespresso machine which as New Yorkers was much appreciated for our morning coffee. The suite faced the River Liffey which also gave gorgeous views of the Dublin sunrise. The windows are double paned so the room was quiet morning and night. The hotel is situated in the city center and is therefore within walking distance of many of Dublins tourist attractions. Our first night we had dinner at the hotels restaurant the Morrison Grill. Food and drinks were delicious! The next morning we had breakfast in the restaurants Halo room. Here you can take advantage of buffet style eggs, bacon, bakery items, Irish sausages, etc. and/or you can have an omelette made to order. An added benefit…make your own Bloody Mary’s and Mimosa’s! You will also be close to MANY restaurants for breakfast, lunch and dinner. So many culturally diverse food options! Our adult daughter also stayed at this hotel in a Queen Superior room which was perfect for her. So, please don’t hesitate to book a stay in this wonderful hotel. The staff are kind and attentive and the hotel is clean, modern and comfortable.",5,2023,02,07
237,"What an experience, amazing!","My second stay in this brilliantly located Hotel.  The refurbishment is classic with some great Dublin touches!  Our room overlooked the River Liffey and its iconic bridges.  The staff on arrival were friendly & very helpful offering advice on events happening in the city and local places to eat.  

Breakfast was served in the HALO Restaurant area, the décor is light and bright.  The staff were very pleasant.  The food served was of a wide variety, in addition to the buffet there was a menu to order from. 

We didn't eat in the bar on this occasion however we had a super meal here on new years day and have also had afternoon tea on pervious visits.",5,2023,02,07
237,Fantastic Evening,"Myself and my partner stayed in this hotel last Saturday for one evening and were blown away by it.
On arrival the staff were super friendly, the room was amazing with a fantastic view overlooking the River Liffey. What a location smack bang in the centre of the city and yet the room was so quiet at night which is very important to me who loves a good nights sleep.
The bed was huge and an equally impressive bathroom with huge bath to match !
What a treat as a lot of hotels no longer provide a bath just the shower.
The dinner was amazing - the scallops were so fresh and the organic salmon a must and keep room for the delicious desserts!
Our waitress was super helpful and friendly we will definitely be going back
A must for all romantics who enjoy a night of luxury",5,2023,02,07
237,"Poor check in experience , but overall a nice hotel in a handy location in Dublin City center .","Let me start by saying I’m knocking two stars off for the very poor check in experience I had in the Morrison . 

I took issue with a request for a 100 euro deposit despite the bill for my stay being paid in full prior to arrival . I informed the check in staff I saw no mention of this when booking the room or on the pricing on their website . I was very abruptly informed detail is in the “terms and conditions “ and this deposit must be paid by a credit card pre authorisation. When I informed the check in staff that i don’t use credit cards ( I use visa debit ) I was informed the payment must be made by cash . I refused payment on the basis that me not knowing about this charge was their fault not mine . At this point the check in staff offered to “ help me “ by printing  off the Ts and Cs for me to read . ( yes that’s very helpful ) and that “in future “ I should have cash ready to pay this deposit . I felt she was more interested in proving she was right rather than seeing it from my perspective 

I told her “ in future “ I won’t be staying in this hotel due to the lack of transparency on pricing when booking . Again she referred to the Ts and Cs and didn’t seem too bothered . 
The issue was left with them swiping my visa debit card  in case “ I used room service “ which I was clear that I would not be using . 

The whole check in experience left a bitter taste and if I had not already paid the bill in advance I would have left the hotel and not checked in . Message to management . - be transparent about your pricing and charges . I shouldn’t have to thrawl through the small
Print or Ts and Cs to find hidden charges . You advertised a price , I paid it . Then you looked for more money when I checked in . This is your problem to fix not mine to put up with .  Also , some of your front desk staff need re training on customer relations . I checked in at approx 8pm on Tuesday 31st Jan . Your roster should tell you who those staff who need re training are . 

Aside from that , the room was pleasant although the beds are a little uncomfortable. The staff in the restaurant were excellent , very attentive . The food and cocktails were of a high standard and the location is great . A good review was spoiled by the first impression at check in .,",3,2023,02,03
237,Best in Dublin,"The Morrison is by far and away likely the best hotel in the city!! The staff at the front desk, the dining room and everywhere are exceptionally kind, the room was amazing and the location cannot be beat!! It is just meters over the river to Temple Bar area and  up the street is Jervis Shopping Center, and lots of amazing restaurants. One of the managers at the hotel Piotr is a really friendly and kind person. Superbly professional. If I ever had questions or concerns he was quick to help. Todd at the front desk is amazing!!! Every time I needed something Todd would help out. I especially adored Juan at the dining room and his colleague from Turkey. The breakfast there is superb!! Not exactly a Hampton Inn breakfast.  You can’t go wrong with the hotel and staff. Bravo!!!",5,2023,02,02

It was absolutely great ! From the time we arrived at the pre-Dinner Reception area, we were all very capably and warmly treated by the Hotel's Staff, and moving-on to the Dining-Area, we got very good Food & Wines + absolutely excellent Service from extremely attentive, patient Staff.

From the moment we arrived and were given a really warm and friendly "" cead mile failte"" by Todd on reception, everything was perfect.  All the staff we engaged with were friendly and helpful. The room we were upgraded to, 109, was outstanding,  with beautiful, tasteful furnishings and a rain shower.  The hotel is very well located, about 100 yards from the Halfpenny bridge and within walking distance of all amenities and shops.  Car parking is subsidised in the car park next door to the hotel.  Breakfast was of high class produce with a beautiful range of yoghurts, juices and smoothies, as well as a full Irish breakfast.  This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in anywhere in the world in 35 years of international travel - I can not praise it highly enough.",5,2023,01,24

We would like to particularly thank a front desk employee - Fiona and the Deputy General Manager - Rory.  The breakfast was very good as you could order ala carte from the muni or have a full Irish breakfast from the buffet.  The staff for the breakfast were polite and served all quickly and with a smile,  Rory, the Deputy General Manager was on site most mornings to help and fill in where necessary.  We had a long trip to various destinations over Christmas and New Years and this hotel and their breakfast, front desk and concierge were top notch!   Additionally when we were exhausted or needed a late snack the room service was always available!  Thank you Dublin ( all of our taxi drivers were amazing - with historical insights and lots of Irish humor) and thank you staff at the Morrison Hotel !

Hotel is centrally located, not that far from the airport too (as long as there's no traffic). Hotel is next to bars/clubs/restaurants and shopping centre. Also accessible via Tram transport.

Check in was swift and staff was helpful when I requested a cab going back to the airport.

The room looked great, tidy and spacious. I liked the interior lighting and design. Overall no complaints at all, good facilities.

Breakfast was good too, pretty much traditional Irish breakfast.

Thank you for a wonderful stay.",5,2023,01,03
237,There are so few hotels worldwide where things work as intended – the Morrison is an exception,"Another enjoyable December stay at The Morrison, Dublin, after being away for 3 years due to pandemic confinement. There are so few hotels worldwide where things work as intended – usually there’s a problem with heating, noise, uncomfortable beds, poor wifi, bad breakfast etc – the list goes on. No such problems here, and helpful staff to boot. Even witnessed 2 local homeless ruffians, dressed in rather soiled black, trying to bluff their way to a free breakfast being rather expertly “removed from the premises” by the Spanish speaking staff, but fluent in English also. 

This place has good memories for us – it’s improving with age and we hope to return.",5,2022,12,28
237,Had the best time!,"Marianna was so lovely at the front desk and helped us navigate our first couple nights in Dublin - we so appreicate her and all her help.

Great location in the middle of everything, and wonderful breakfast.",5,2022,12,28
237,"A really nice, centrally located and clean hotel","A really nice, centrally located and clean hotel.  Staff were lovely and I honestly could not fault any aspect of the stay.  Room was really nice and clean, just perfect.  Didn't eat in the restaurant at all - but in passing it looked equally as good.",5,2022,12,22
237,DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL,"Dear All as a seasoned business and leisure traveller i strongly suggest you do not book this hotel. i called this morning and the person i was trying to speak to kept talking over me, didnt listen to what i was saying. i politely asked to speak to the Manager and i was told there was no manager in today. REALLY? Hilton are running hotels with no manager on duty. i think we all know this is not true, its a very strong warning sign you should NOT stay here. Dublin city centre has many amazing hotels do yourself a BIG favour and choose one of them !! Merry Xmas.",1,2022,12,21
237,Best place for Dublin City,"One of my favorite places to stay in Dublin, the location and facilities are great. The staff are all so friendly and make me feel so welcome every time I stay. Special mention to the reception team and Todd. ",5,2022,12,20
237,Another Great Stay at the Morrison ❤️!  3rd One This Year!,"When I arrived, I was greeted warmly by Rory Rooney, Marianna at the front desk, and all the front desk staff.  

This hotel never ceases to amaze me: Great People, Great Service, Great Food, and Beautiful Rooms.

My husband and I will be back in the New Year.

Thank you very much!  Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all.",5,2022,12,16

237,Excellent hotel,"Clean, modern and well equipped rooms, an impressive hotel.

237,CPA Leinster Society Christmas Lunch,"We had our annual Christmas lunch in the Printworks, 50 guests for a meal, with entertainment and a mulled wine and prosecco reception. I have the honour of being the chair of the CPA Leinster Society, so if anything goes wrong the buck stops with me. Everything was seamless, nothing was a problem or an issue. The drink, the food, the room were all perfect and the staff were on hand to ensure that the day went smoothly. The feedback from the members was all positive and we may have to consider coming back next year, if you will have us.",5,2022,12,13
237,Perfect Setting,We stayed here for our trip to Dublin and it was a great location. The staff was professional and dedicated and the place was clean. For a well operated place to stay and better than expected restaurants stay here!  ,5,2022,12,12
237,Great event space,"We chose the Morrison in Dublin to host our Ball event, and we were delighted with the end result. The setting was very impressive and the service on the evening was top class. Would highly recommend for social gatherings or events.",5,2022,12,12
237,Perfect for a corporate Christmas Party,"We had originally booked our work Christmas party in 2021, and The Morrison kindly moved our date to 2022 due to COVID. There was about 80 attending the party and The Halo room was perfect for this size. We done tapas style bowl food and there were so many compliments on how delicious the food was. A big thank you to Sarah & events team and to the waiting / bar / kitchen staff working on the night for being super friendly and professional - we will definitely be back!",5,2022,12,12
237,A Very Good Stay in Dublin,We stayed at the Morrison for a couple of days last week. The reception staff was very friendly and efficient. We had booked 2 rooms and when we arrived early they were able to accommodate us in one room until the 2nd room was available. The breakfast was very good and the breakfast staff were so friendly. I can’t recall her name but a lovely woman with light brown hair attending to the tables in the upper area made breakfast even better.  The location is perfect and is very close to Temple Bar and really walkable to most everything. Wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again.,5,2022,12,08
237,3 * location,"I visited here twice in the same week.  I thought that this would be a boring business hotel but what a find. Basically you just need to cross the river and you have arrived at Temple bar but without the noise when you want to sleep.  Many other attractions are nearby as you're in the middle of the city centre.  Also block away from the Dublin Express bus stop which is very convenient when traveling from the airport. Room is not the biggest but clean, comfortable, and very well designed layout. The staff have the right attitude.  Best example was that the restaurant was already closed but when I wandered around and sat back at the bar they came to ask if they could offer me a sandwich even though the kitchen was closed.",4,2022,12,08
237,OMG!! The best time had by all.,"OMG!! After an amazing meal last year I returned to The Morrison for a Christmas event last weekend. The whole experience was a WOW moment, from arrival to departure. The food was phenomenal and even catered amazingly for the dietary requirement needed.  The service was 10/10, all the team I encountered were efficient and friendly. They provided a warm welcome and clearly love their roles. Will definitely be returning in 2023. Thank you for such a memorable stay and starting of the festive celebrations for myself and friends.  ",5,2022,12,06
237,Amazing Gift,"What a brilliant way to ring in the holidays and I absolutely loved the central location in Dublin City Centre. Made it easy to come and go. I was gifted a voucher so decided to spoil my Mother and myself for some girls time. We both loved everything, the whole hotel, our time there, apparently newly renovated which you can tell, the staff, their humorous the bartender and the food was top class, the place was clean and looks cool. We had prawns Piri Piri, Steaks, drinks, desserts, they had amazing bread complimentary and an incredible olive tapenade not to mention all the cheer to accompany this time of year. Steaks so good we forgot to take the photos :)  We will be back for certain! Merry Christmas",5,2022,12,05
237,Christmas Party and Stay ,"Stayed last week with a work party. Not my first visit. We all loved the food and the service was really on the ball for us that night! Would highly recommend for a Dublin City Christmas party night.

We all loved the rooms too. Perfect location. Five stars from me! Will be back.",5,2022,12,05
237,Amazing hotel’,Stayed in the Morrison last week and all I can say is WOW! Such a chic hotel in a fantastic location. The food and cocktails were out of this world and the staff could not have been more helpful. The bedrooms were so comfortable and clean. Great variety for breakfast. I would definitely stay again and recommend to family and friends.,5,2022,12,05
237,Great staff and event management,"We organised a very successful event for 85 people in the hotel.  

The space was warm and welcoming, and staff were very kind and helpful at all stages throughout the day.  

Joy, Sarah, Jacqueline and all the team were great!",5,2022,12,01
237,"Great location, lovely hotel","Stayed here while visiting a student at UCD, and loved it. Previously when in Dublin we’d stayed at the Conrad, which, while lovely and near beautiful green spaces, has an embassy row feeling.  The Morrison is in the heart of the action. Just across the river is the Temple Bar area, Dublin Castle, Trinity College, and shopping. The other direction is the Jervis shopping centre and Mary St shopping.
Public transit is very close if you want to go anywhere in the city
The bar and restaurant were very pleasant, breakfast also very nice.",5,2022,11,12
237,Amazing,Amazing service! Upgraded room for FREE Because I requested a river view room! Also told them it was for my boyfriends birthday and they delivered us a little gift which was amazing and when we first walked in they had a lovely plate made with fruit and chocolates saying happy birthday! So thoughtful and staff where excellent! Outstanding service!,5,2022,11,08
237,Comfortable and Clean Room,"I chose this hotel because I was looking to pamper myself a little after a fast-paced tour around Ireland. I would consider staying here again, but I would look into other options first, especially if room prices were as high as they were. 

I was a little disappointed with my room given the price and the fact that I have gold status with Hilton Honors. It was on the second floor and next to the elevator. I expressly requested a room on a high floor away from the elevator, though I know requests cannot always be granted. The room was long and narrow, but it was spacious enough for my needs. My “view” was of a rooftop and the breakfast room below. However, my room was quiet, even with the window open. I was able to leave my window open without concern for privacy, safety, or rain. This was especially helpful due to the hotel’s heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC). 

Like many places in Europe, the HVAC, power, lights, etc. only work if activated by putting the room key into a slot by the door. I accidentally left my key there for a few hours when I went out on the first day, and when I returned – the room was incredibly hot! I immediately called the front desk, and I was told the air conditioning was on a timer for the whole building. I didn’t understand at first and said I needed to switch rooms. Instead, they sent maintenance to check on my HVAC system.  

Maintenance came right away and was very helpful. He fixed the system and explained to me that the thermostat did not work per se. It’s more like an on/off switch rather than a thermostat. If set above 20, the heat turns on. If set below 20, the air conditioning turns on. However, the air conditioning is only available certain times of the day (hence the timer). I never figured out what those times were. Instead, I left the HVAC system off as recommended and kept my window open. 

I also had to call the front desk because my safe wasn’t working. Again, maintenance came promptly and resolved the issue quickly. Luckily, these were the only issues I had with my room. The room décor wasn’t to my taste, but I was able to turn off the pink LED lights I found tacky. Otherwise, I found the room to be comfortable, clean, quiet, and well appointed. It included amenities such as a robe, slippers, hair dryer, iron, safe (as mentioned), kettle with tea, coffee, and hot chocolate, two complimentary waters, shampoo, conditioner, soap, body wash, body lotion, shower cap, and an amenity pack with cotton swabs, cotton rounds, and a nail file. Many of these weren’t standard amenities in other accommodations I stayed in around the country. The room also had a mini bar. The refrigerator wasn’t very cold, but it was adequate. The only snacks were crisps and candy bars. I found the prices to be very reasonable for a hotel. 

I received complimentary breakfast thanks to my Hilton Honors Gold status. Breakfast was good and offered plenty of options. Service was also good, and there was ample room for seating. Unfortunately, I found the Morrison Grill to be a big letdown. Again, I’d just finished a whirlwind tour around Ireland. The prices seemed decent, and I thought I might eat several meals at the hotel for convenience. However, after a disappointing experience on my first day, I didn’t return. I don’t know if the servers were new and/or if it was due to a language barrier, but it was frustrating that they could not answer simple questions about dishes, drinks, specials, etc. I waited a while for my main course after finishing my starter but eventually canceled it. When I got my check, it was incorrect so I had to wait for them to fix it before I could pay and leave. 

Overall, the staff were not especially friendly, though with the exception of the servers, they were efficient and professional.

237,"Great customer service, a bit $$$","The Morrison is a very nice hotel located on the north side of the Liffey, a short walk from Temple Bar, Henry St, O'Connell St, and most major tourist attractions in Dublin. We initially got there at 6AM due to an early flight, with the airport bus stop conveniently located nearby. Our rooms were obviously not ready, but the overnight staff were great and gave us water and offered us use of the basement shower facilities to freshen up. A nice touch!

We were able to check-in when we came back to the hotel around 2PM (check-in was 3PM). Room 105 was pretty normal, and not a uniquely magical wonderful experience beyond comparison, but the beds were very comfy, and there was a nice little sofa that one could lay down on. Room was adequately-sized, though not big, and modern-ish but not in an austere contemporary sort of way. Bathroom was nice, though I found myself wishing there was a bathtub for a soak, as well as a hair dryer, which was inexplicably absent (though I imagine you could call up for one). Other things: good number of electrical plugs that are located in reasonable desired places (eg by the bed), lighting switches made sense, hot water was hot, very large washroom mirror with one of those zoomed in mirrors to obsess over your facial pores.

Due to my Hilton status, we got free breakfast included, and the waiter service on both days was great. It's a buffet, but they seat you and then take your drink and made-to-order food requests and regularly come by to ask if everything's alright. The breakfast food itself was just OK I thought, but there was quite a bit of selection, and the atmosphere inside was relaxed, comfortable, and classy. I liked that the baked goods were smaller in size since too often they bake them in full-size and ain't nobody finishing a giant pastry when there's like 10 other things to eat as well.

We were also presented with free drink tickets (not sure if this was a status thing, or just a complimentary welcome to the hotel thing). We got two glasses of the house white which was refreshing and nice.

Front desk staff were very good, and they were able to help us with all the questions we had, including some asks about anticipated traffic due to the Dublin Marathon and what time we should go to the airport as a result. They also helped book us the taxi. The sofas in the lobby are very comfortable and it's a good space to chill. There's also a little machine to fill up your water bottle in the lobby. I do believe that the building is accessible, though the elevators are not massive (very European).

Lastly, for those who enjoy a bit of nightlife, this is a very conveniently located hotel. Obviously the Morrison is a bit $$$ (292 euros/night when we stayed), but it's centrally located with Temple Bar across the river, and some of the more famous electronic music clubs are nearby (Index is a 13 min walk, Yamamori Tengu not even a 1 minute walk away, Wigwam 4 mins). Didn't find the 4AM fried chicken on my way back from Index, but I also didn't really look.

All in all, it was a very good hotel, made better by its great staff. Would be more than happy to stay here again in the future (if someone else was paying for it! :D)",4,2022,11,02
237,Great stay,"Fantastic location close to everything worth visiting staff very welcoming. Breakfast is great. Bar. Is lovely serving a great array of drinks been 4 times this year so far and will definitely be back

237,Birthday Celebrations ,"We stayed for the perfect evening celebrating a 40th birthday last week. Cocktails were first on the list; I highly recommend the Book of Love (gorgeous!!) - then dinner. We all had something different, so we got to sample different dishes. The scallops and prawns were particularly good. Steak followed - cooked perfectly! Our waitress Marianna was exceptional, her attention to detail was second to none. Can't wait for a reason to return!! ",5,2022,11,01
237,excellent hotel in a great part of  Dublin,"large trendy room. cool art.nice  promotions  ( have  lunch or  dinner, get a  free  Prosecco).  Super  clean, pleasant staff.  Easily walkable  to the  pubs, highlights  etc, but not on the  noisy side  of  Dublin. Nice  coffee station in room",5,2022,10,30
237,Fantastic location,"The best feature of this hotel is its location, which could not be better, right in the very centre of Dublin, overlooking the river, and right opposite Temple Bar. Its second best feature is that it's part of Hilton, so if you have Hilton gold status, then you enjoy free breakfast, the potential for upgrades and the opportunity to pay with points rather than money.

I was impressed when I received an e-mail from Marianna ahead of our stay, offering to help as a concierge. I replied back asking for help choosing a restaurant. The replies that I received, not from Marianna, were not very helpful and didn't meet our restaurant requirements.

Despite having gold status, we couldn't check in until 3pm, which was disappointing, and we were given late checkout until only 1pm the next day. I had booked two rooms - one for my girlfriend and me, and the other for my daughter. As my girlfriend and I both have Hilton gold status, we wanted to ensure that all of us would receive free breakfast, if necessary by registering one room in my name and the other in my girlfriend's name. I sent all the details to the hotel by e-mail in advance, and received a reply. So we were perplexed when, upon checking in, reception told us that they couldn't find the e-mail - the same e-mail to which their colleagues had replied. Having waited until 3pm to check in, this wasted more time while we started all over again.

On the positive side, I paid only 40,000 points per room on a night that the hotel was selling for €727 per night. Despite the hotel being full, my girlfriend and I were gratefully upgraded to a room on the 4th floor overlooking the river, with my daughter in a standard room immediately opposite our door across the corridor. The rooms are very comfortable, but comparable in quality to for example the Hilton Garden inn in Vilnius or Budapest where rooms can cost under €100 per night. If I had been paying the full monetary price for the rooms, I wouldn't have considered them value for money.

We stayed in mid-October, and the rooms felt quite chilly, particularly at night. When I queried this with reception, they advised me to use the air conditioning control to increase the temperature. But I felt no effect other than blowing air around the room. When I queried this the next morning, reception told me that the heating in the hotel had not been switched on for autumn and winter, and that it was impossible to heat the rooms without a manual override being made by staff.

Staff name badges are very dark, reflective and difficult to read. I sometimes mention names of staff in my reviews who give particularly good service, but couldn't do so on this occasion because of this. This should be addressed.

Breakfast was plentiful and good quality, a hybrid of buffet and table service, but with more of the latter than is typical elsewhere. We didn't need lunch. Being free for all three of us, it was fantastic value.

The positives outweigh the negatives, and I will definitely stay here again, but probably only by spending Hilton points.",4,2022,10,30
237,Fabulous!,"A perfect evening. Food was of an incredibly high standard, service was fantastic and there was a lovely cosy atmosphere! The only thing that would have made it better was if I was staying the night. Would highly recommend.",5,2022,10,28
237,Our 30th Anniversary trip to Ireland,When we checked into The Morrison Dublin 10/3/22 our expectations were IMMEDIATELY exceeded as we were upgraded to the Penthouse suite for our stay. AMAZING view of Downtown Dublin! The entire staff were extremely friendly and professional especially Daniel at the front desk and Rodrigo in the dining room. We would highly recommend The Morrison to anyone looking for the best place in central Dublin.,5,2022,10,25
237,Exceeded expectations,"Ending a month’s touring EU, our last night was at the Morrison.
Todd greeted us at the reception with a smile and a quick check in.  A last minute request for a walk in shower was promptly met after his quick search for availability.  Todd offered to reserve us a taxi to DUB the next afternoon for our long flight home.
Monday’s breakfast was perfect.  Wide selection, attentive staff and lots of smiles.
Next visit…more than one night.",5,2022,10,24
237,Halo Company charity event,"Halo hosted 60 of us for a company charity event and they did a fantastic job. It's a wonderful venue, complemented by good food & very attentive staff – a compliment to all there! Also great help with the AV equipment as well which was much appreciated. Already looking forward to returning next year.",5,2022,10,20
237,A Wonderful Stay!,"I recently returned from a family trip to Dublin and stayed at The Morrison.  I highly recommend it as the place to stay when visiting Dublin.  The property is very close to the Temple Bar area restaurants and bars, and easily accessible to transportation options such as the train, tram, buses and meeting points for excursion.  The Morrison was renovated in August and is 

Location: Across the bridge from the Temple Bar restaurants and bars (no more than a 5-minute walk).  From the airport, it takes about 30-35 minutes, although it could take longer during the day due to heavy traffic entering the city center. Our taxi fare from the airport was $32 for 4 adults with luggage.  An airport shuttle is also available (tickets can be purchased at the airport).

Front Desk/Check-In: The check-in process was smooth and quick.  The front desk team was friendly and were available to answer questions.  I’d like to acknowledge Marianna who whenever she saw us, would greet us with a smile and ask how our day was going.  She made us feel welcomed and appreciated for staying at the Morrison.  Marianna also shared information about the village of Howth which we planned to visit and provided detailed directions on how to get to the train station from the hotel as well as the train schedule, which was helpful.  

Rooms: We stayed in 2 rooms:  the King Junior Suite and King River View rooms.  Both rooms overlook the river and are modern, bright and comfortable.  The King Suite can easily accommodate 3 guests (there’s a pull-out couch) and has a sitting area to relax.  The bathroom is also large with a separate tub and shower, and double sinks.  The King River View is equally as spacious (for 2 guests) and has a single sink in the bathroom. USB ports and power outlets are available on the nightstand as well as the desk. Robes and slippers were provided in both rooms, as well as a golf umbrella, which thankfully we didn't need to use during our stay.

Dining: A buffet breakfast is served in the Halo dining room, and additional items cook to order items (omelettes, pancakes, French toast, poached eggs) can be ordered through the servers.  The self-serve buffet offers a variety of hot and cold items, as well as smoothies, scones and fresh baked bread.  The sausages, bacon and eggs are locally sourced.  Everything was tasty and fresh!  The servers, especially Juan, were friendly, efficient and readily available to take food orders, clear away plates and quickly replenished items when they were running low.  

Quay 14 and the hotel’s restaurant, the Morrison Grill are adjacent to Halo. We didn’t get the opportunity to dine at the Morrison Grill, but whenever we passed by, there was a decent flow of diners.  The drinks at Quay 14 were well prepared and service was quick.  My only negative was the drinking straws, which are biodegradable and tend to break easily (I had to ask the bar staff for a replacement).

Gym: Guests must use their room key to access the fitness center which is located on the lower level and has treadmills, bikes, free weights, and other equipment. It was empty each time I visited it. 
 
Overall: I highly recommend The Morrison for its comfortable accommodations, warm and friendly staff, and welcoming atmosphere!

237,"Ideal Location, Great Staff!","My husband and I started our Ireland honeymoon here. The location absolutely could not have been better! We walked to museums, amazing breakfast spots, and of course to Temple Bar just across the river. There's also parking right next door in a secure ramp (we rented a car). 
Nikita was the receptionist for most of our stay, and she was so kind and helpful. Our flight got us to Dublin a few hours before our hotel room was available for check-in, but we were treated as valued guests from the moment we stepped in (albeit early). After Nikita stored our bags, we enjoyed some Guinness in the hotel's bar. When we asked for trip recommendations, the bartender was incredibly thoughtful and thorough. It was a great first impression of Ireland!
When our room was ready, it had wine, chocolate and a card waiting; that add-on was 1000% worth it - the strawberry wine was deelicious! We actually went to a local wine shop to find more.
From there, we immediately got to sightseeing, and ultimately didn't spend a ton of time in the hotel itself during our 4-day stint in Dublin. However, the hotel/room was helpful for combatting jetlag. We enjoyed the blackout curtains, the availability of late-night pizza (very tasty), the comfortable bed, and the many entertainment options on the TV. 
If you plan to enjoy bars, museums, etc, definitely consider staying here: the location is simply perfect. Thank you again, Nikita and bartending crew, for taking care of us!!",5,2022,10,19
237,Great Stay at the Morrison,"Great stay at the Morrison Dublin, great hotel, modern, staff were fantastic, great atmosphere, Super Breakfast as well, very good location in Dublin.  Special thanks to Night manager Kaviraj, lovely gent from Mauritius, went above and beyond the call of duty to sort out my problem during the night. Made the arrangements and passed them on to Day Manager Axel, who was also superb, will definitely go back. ",5,2022,10,17
237,"Great location, great restaurant, great staff! ","Great hotel in an excellent location. We are diamond members. I often book hotels for business conferences and personal travel. The staff, except the person who checked me in, is fantastic. We got in early from a long night on the trip and were extremely jet-lagged. Hilton's diamond status doesn't mean too much here, in my opinion, although I have read others had better luck.   It does have me rethinking the high expense of the Hilton credit card. I know you are not entitled to early check-in, but it doesn't hurt to give a general idea. The snarky woman who checked me in did not make me feel welcome and didn't even offer us a cup of coffee.  She remarked that we were not entitled to our breakfast until we officially checked into our room. We checked in our bags and were offered to use a shower room to freshen up. We decided to venture on and do our Hop on Hop off tour and received a text after noon that our room was ready. We returned to the hotel a couple of hours later, went to our room, and missed one of our suitcases. Stressful, but it was located shortly. We ate a quick lunch at the Morrison grill. Incredible waitstaff, management, and food; overall, I give this a 10 out of 10. The price was extremely reasonable. So, after a very lukewarm reception, we received two days later a text asking us to rate our experience from the manager. The manager Axel offered to upgrade us the next day; he could not have been nicer.  We declined, not wanting to pack up our room, but the thought counted. All of the desk staff during the rest of our stay was top-notch. Offering to get our cabs, even delivering my husband an ice-cold glass of water after a long run he took. Daniel and the rest of the desk stop always greeted us when we came in and asked how our stay was. Every one of them we met after our first day was better than the next. We loved HALO for breakfast; Jorge, Fiona, Valentina, and all the other staff were phenomenal. I loved that the fresh eggs, scones, sausage, fresh fruit, fresh yogurt, and potatoes were the same daily. Yummy chocolate muffins, whole grain bread toast upon request. Cappuccino, Americano coffee, and tea were offered and included in the continental breakfast. I ordered off the to-go menu for my husband to bring up to him. Diamond members receive this for free. I didn't see one other person leaving a tip for the staff. I get that you are possibly getting this for free, but these people deserve a small tip. The HALO staff were friendly and always asked if I needed anything.  The hotel will reserve you a taxi if you need it, remember that the taxi will charge you 3 euros extra for this perk. Later in the week, we elected to get dropped off on the other side of the river and walk across. Saved a great deal of money due to heavy traffic. While at the hotel, we went to dinner, a short walk for Italian at Il Vicoletta for dinner. A small place that was recommended to us by friends. You should have reservations before coming to Ireland. We loved the fresh pasta, fried calamari, and steak we ate: excellent service and excellent food. We also went to FIRE Steakhouse. Beautiful old building with excellent service and food. We made a reservation and did the early bird menu for three-course for $40. The hotel is spotless, with rooms on the smaller side, but modern and spotless. I loved the Morrison Grill for lunch and dinner. We ate there three times and felt it was very reasonable for what we received. On Tuesday, check with the hotel for the exact day, but there is a $15 menu special for burgers, Guinness Stew, Prawn with pasta, and other choices. The Cappuccino was incredible and included a small cookie and two of the best chocolates. I had a burger one night, Guinness stew, and fish and chips. All great. The manager, Derrick runs a great restaurant with his attention to detail and hustling to make sure everyone has what they need.  Have the hotel book you a taxi back to the airport. It can be challenging in the morning to get one on your own. Breakfast starts during the week at 7 am; we got a very quick bite before we left. The hotel is in an excellent location, right across from the Temple Bar area but not too close to hear any noise. It is within walking distance of many other attractions. Make a reservation in advance of your trip to the Kilmainham Goal. Fascinating but challenging to get a time slot, only 8 euros. Guinness and Jameson's tour were fun, loved the Gravity bar with the beautiful view of Dublin.  We did a tour with WildRover to the Cliffs and Finn McCools for a Belfast and Northern Ireland tour. I loved both of them; they filled up fast, and we made this reservation before our trip. I also recommend the Hop on Hop Off tour. The green bus one stops right near the hotel.  I would definitely go back to the Morrison. Five stars, in my opinion.

Service was excellent except for one initial desk check-in person that was curt and not very helpful. For example, she was divisive about our diamond status reservation and the many questions we asked. She did not give adequate direction. Nevertheless, the hotel management went above and beyond to make it up to us. Also, a room upgrade was offered three days later, but we declined because we were already settled in. The grill restaurant was outstanding. Great service and food. Impressed by how manager Derrick was running the grill. Hands-on and professional. The servers were also great. Overall, minus a couple of hiccups, I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2022,10,06
237,Good location in Dublin,"Overall the hotel is well located, 5min walk from temple street. 
The rooms have a regular size, clean and the hair products are 100% organic but there is no free water in the rooms and in mine a little smell of sewage coming up at the end of the day.
Apart from that the staff is professional and helpful.",3,2022,10,06
237,Very nice hotel in a perfect location right outside of the temple bar area across the bridge.,"Good Property w/ friendly staff.
Nice updated rooms w/ comfortable beds
Breakfast team was Amazing
Dublin is a great safe city.   We visit numerous site each day walking 6 to 10 miles thru out the city coming back late at night each day and always felt very safe.",5,2022,10,05
237,Getting full value,"My 1st experience of this hotel, which I chose from the website. Accommodation of this type is expensive in central Dublin, but you got what you paid-for.
Reception cordial and welcoming.
Room-servicing very good indeed.
Food excellent, with an imaginative menu and very pleasant service.
Breakfast again well-presented and the staff welcoming.
The hotel is well-placed, just over the river, and convenient for the sites of Dublin, the area just behind it - N.Dublin - is rather depressing in comparison. But all you need do is cross the bridge.
There is a small but perfectly adequately-equipped gym in the basement.
Quiet at night too.

The good attitude of all the staff I met also reflects well on management, as even the nicest and most able staff will not work at 100% for a miserable supervisor/manager.

Note - buffet at breakfast, but a menu as well for other dishes.",5,2022,10,04
237,Birthday celebration,"Dined here many times. Have to mention had an another outstanding evening celebrating my daughters birthday, food and service was second to none. Made a fuss of, which made my daughter's night, food and service was excellent , return in a heartbeat. Thanks to you!!!",5,2022,10,02
237,Great hotel in Dublin,Wonderful hotel with a very modern “funky” look and very friendly staff.  Centrally  located and across the river from Temple Bar area.  Easy to access all areas of Dublin.  Dublin Express service (stop) to/from airport is very easy to get too about a 5 min walk.,5,2022,09,30
237,Great location and wonderful service.,"We stayed for 2 nights and were sad to leave.  Hotel is centrally located and very convenient to all downtown activities.  Staff was friendly and very helpful from checkin through checkout. Provided helpful advice on restaurants, helped with travel arrangements to the airport and other topics.  Breakfast and dinner at the hotel was excellent.",5,2022,09,30
237,"Function, Dining and Hotel Stay","Delighted with the function we held, excellent facilities, support and service, very friendly staff who were on hand to help when needed. Food was great and hotel rooms were excellent. I would recommend and will be looking to run another function in the Morrison again given the excellent experience we had.",5,2022,09,29
237,Amazing Hotel,"The hotel was so central in the city centre, yet it was so quiet. The staff were amazing. Courteous and efficient. The room was beautiful, comfortable and exceptionally clean. Included was every amenity you could possibly need in a hotel room. I will most certainly be booking again. ",5,2022,09,28
237,Trip to Dublin,Hotel is in a great location with all tourist attractions within easy reach. Hotel is modern and well equipped. Staff are very friendly and happy to advise and help with any issues. We had a minor issue with our room. Upon contacting the concierge at night time a female member of staff appeared and assessed the issue.  The following day we were upgraded free of charge. Thank you to all the staff on the front desk and the cleaning staff for a job well done.,4,2022,09,27
237,A Good Hilton Hotel,"The staff is exceptional and want to give a shout out to Lee who was always ready to help with even the smallest thing.  Rooms clean and beds comfortable but the room we had, one of the refurbished ones  on the lower floor, has no place for you to put your clothes so be prepared to live out of your suitcases.  Bathrooms have shower and separate soaking tub but did not care for bathroom layout.  Toilet wedged between sink and wall and shower requires you to step up about six inches and then down about three inches to enter.  We found this difficult to navigate and believe any one that has mobility, issues, balance issues or is elderly would have a difficult time.",3,2022,09,25
237,Overpriced,"We were on vacation during the Garth brooks concert. We would normally have paid less than $290 for this room, but the hotel jacked the price up to over $450 for a tiny 2 twin bed room where one of us had to sit on the bed to let the other pass. Beds had thin mattresses on platforms. So hard and uncomfortable. Pillows were too big and hard to be comfortable. ",4,2022,09,19
237,Great location but pricey,Beautiful hotel in a great location. Rooms are lovely and beds very comfortable but rooms are compact! Fabulous breakfast. Lovely touches like chocolates in room etc. Highly recommend but be will to pay!,4,2022,09,18
237,Fantastic accommodations and service,"My family and I stayed at the Morrison at the end of a wonderful prolonged trip to Ireland.  Our stay at the Morrison was a relaxing and fantastic end to our trip.  The accommodations were spectacular, but the service was truly exceptional.   Every encounter with the hotel staff was superior to hotels of their caliber (from a Hilton Diamond member).  I would like to offer specific recognition to the valet ""Lee"".  His service throughout our stay really made the difference for our family.  We will definitely be back.",5,2022,09,16
237,Wedding,"We hosted our recent wedding reception at the Morrison hotel. They were fantastic to deal with from start to finish. The food was delicious. We had a wonderful day. I would definitely recommend them as a great hotel for a city centre wedding. Thanks to Sarah, Rory and all the team for being such stars",5,2022,09,14
237,Great spot for Dublin travels!!,"The Morrison is a perfect base for exploring Dublin.  The service is excellent and staff are very helpful.  The location is super convenient for exploring the sights and steps away from terrific restaurants (including the hotel restaurant which is very good!), pubs and attractions.",5,2022,09,12
237,Best Hotel in Dublin,After 10 days of traveling around Ireland we stayed at the Morrison for the last day.  The shower was amazing.  The location was perfect (close to Temple Bar but not to close).  It was a pleasant and refreshing experience  Highly recommend it.  The employees there were beyond pleasant and the breakfast was great.,5,2022,09,10
237,In the Heart and Soul of Dublin,"What an wonderful experience! I stayed my last two days in Ireland (Dublin) at the Morrison. Not only it is literally located in the heart of the city, it is all the details this wonderful gem does to win your own heart. The staff, the cleanliness, the attention to details, the support when one has a question, and the neat white rooms with all amenities, including an umbrella for rainy days and a spacious bathroom. I will return to the Morrison. Its location is an important basic point for this decision, but beyond that, the great atmosphere and the high level of attention makes it a great stay for me as it will be for you.",5,2022,09,09
237,Great Room 338,Treated very well as a diamond member at this very nice Hilton establishment. The room was tricked out with lights galore. The showers were hot and bed very comfortable. The staff was great in every way. The morning breakfasts were way above most. The desk staff went beyond the best with the exception of getting taxis. They did suggest the tram which worked better. The place is perfectly located.,5,2022,09,07
237,A gem in the heart of Dublin,"The Morrison is an amazing property in the heart of Dublin with easy access to shops, entertainment and attractions. Also close to rail transit for a quick hop to the coastal towns of Mallahide and Howth. Friendly staff, great amenities and a wonderful restaurant. A must stay property if traveling to Dublin for a few days.",5,2022,09,06
237,Amazing!!! Hard to put into words,"My wedding was in the Morrison hotel on the 29th Aug 2022. I cannot speak highly enough of the professionalism of the hotel staff from start to finish. I was initially greeted by Sarah G. and Sarah O’R. on day one, and their friendliness immediately won me over and I decided that the Morrison was the hotel for me. I only booked the hotel a couple of months in advance and despite the late notice, I had no issues whatsoever.  Sarah O’R. took over as the main point of contact and every detail was organised to a tea.  She responded to all my emails and enquiries promptly and nothing was too much for her. Before the wedding, I attended the taster menu evening and the staff again, were amazing. 120 people attended and everyone spoke so highly of the staff, the food, the room, everything was perfect. Big thanks to the chef too – I have a family member with extreme dietary requirements who doesn’t usually eat out and she told me she ate the most amazing food and her every need was catered for. Everyone’s glasses were topped up all night, the staff were so friendly and attentive. I want to personally thank Sarah for her great work on the lead-up and Jacqueline, Fiona and Julietta for their assistance on the day. There were a few more that I didn’t get their names, the staff at the drinks reception and the barman on the day, and the following day who were also amazing. The icing on the cake was the beautiful Penthouse! I’d like to pass on my sincere thanks to the management who should be really proud of every single staff member and thank you for making my day so perfect. I could not have asked for more.",5,2022,09,06
237,Awesome Dublin Hotel,"This place is awesome - breakfast, service, and especially LOCATION!!  Extremely convenient to the fun Temple Bar area.  Highly recommend this hotel.  Front desk and bellhops are very friendly and helpful.  They can make great recommendations of places to see and eat.",5,2022,09,05
237,Superb!,Welcoming helpful courteous and professional Staff.  The location of the Hotel is good in Central Dublin. The room was spotlessly clean and very attractively furnished.  The bed was extremely comfortable.  We loved our stay and will be back. ,5,2022,09,05
237,"Great location, Hilton property in Dublin City","Great location in Dublin City on North side of the River Liffey. Close to the sights , Grafton  Street, Trinity College , O’Connell Bridge, Temple Bar without the noise of Temple Bar pubs keeping you awake at night. Very clean property and modern. Clean rooms. Friendly  and helpful front desk staff. Good breakfast. Used points to bill two room stay for the last night of my family’s stay in Ireland. Flew in and out of Dublin and spent first three days of 8 days trip in another hotel as this property  was booked full ( Northwestern v, Nebraska played the second day we where their. Our Wildcats prevailed, Go Cats!)
Will book again at this property",5,2022,09,04
237,THE place to stay in Dublin,"If you are planning to visit Dublin, don’t hesitate, The Morrison is the place to stay.  I spent 3 nights there with my wife, we LOVED it.
  
We loved it for many reasons:
  
-	Personnel has the right professional/friendly balance.  They are efficient doing their job, but they have also that human touch that is soooooo important.  You don’t feel like “just a customer”.  
  
-	Location, location, and location.  Just a few steps from Temple bar, basically just need to cross the river, without the noise when you want to sleep.  It is also very close to many other attractions.  It is steps away from the Dublin Express bus stop, very convenient when arriving by plane.

-	Room clean, comfortable, and very well designed.  I recommend a room giving on the interior yard (not giving on the street), still very good light, buildings on the other side are far.  It is very quiet, the bed was very comfortable, we slept very well even the first night we arrived, fighting a 5hrs time difference.",5,2022,08,24
237,Incredible hotel and staff.  Helpful to a tourist at a time of need!,"I don’t usually leave reviews but I’m compelled to leave one about the Morrison.  I’ll keep it short, I was on vacation and was unlucky to have been robbed in one of the local pubs.  With no way of calling home and no money, Rory (general manager) was SUPER helpful and set me up in his office allow me to make the necessary phone calls to cancel all my cards.  In such a stressful situation, he helped me in every way possible.  

Not only that, but the hotel room was great as well and will definitely be back at a different time to visit my vacation.  Such an incredible staff and will forever be grateful to all of them to help me out when I needed someone the most!",5,2022,08,23
237,Perfect for a wedding,"I was part of a wedding Group and they truly catered for all our needs, from printing missing names for the table to catering for the DJ who came early. Morrison is really a great hotel highly recommend. 

The customisable fans in the room were GOD SENT wow it was bordering 30℃ on the day of the wedding and if we didn't have those fans our makeup and dresses would have been melting by the time we got down to the ceremony after all the running around.

Breakfast is gorge and the beds were amazing super comfy slept like a baby! ",5,2022,08,15
237,Excellent hotel!,"Unfortunately we only stayed one night. The service at this hotel is fantastic, from check-in to check-out. The front desk staff really takes their time with you and makes you feel so welcome. The breakfast was great with many options to choose from. The room was clean, and very comfortable. We would definitely  stay here again!",5,2022,08,11
237,Your stop for exceptional food and service,"From the staff, amazing breakfast and in house restaurant, the Morrison has it all.  Exceptional service and food quality.  I recommend the fish and chips along with the seafood chowder.  My travel companion couldn’t get enough of the very special bread/butter and chicken wings.  Great location as well, very close to the tram.  Enjoy!",5,2022,08,08
237,Excellent hotel in good location for seeing the city,"Lovely experience at this hotel, the staff on reception were very welcoming on our arrival spending time after checking us in giving us information about the area and getting around.  We had one of the refurbished rooms on the 2nd floor, no real view from the room but that wasn’t an issue.  Everything was very clean and all the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful.  We had reusable water bottles in our rooms and a water fountain in the reception area, also tea and coffee making with refills when required.    We had breakfast daily and had plenty of choice from cooked to cereal and pastries and also items of the menu freshly made, there really was something for everyone and excellent value at only €15 per day.  We also ate in the restaurant one night and had an excellent meal and the cocktails were amazing.  I would highly recommend staying this hotel.",5,2022,07,29
237,"Wonderful Hotel, well-located with caring and attentive staff.","This is my second stay at this hotel.   I have now brought both of my nieces on separate trips to celebrate their graduations and each time we stayed here.

The location is excellent.  Quick walk to tour bus departure points and right across the river from the main Dublin attractions.    It's also nice to be right on the River Liffey.

The rooms are very comfortable and quiet.   Breakfast is wonderful and I love the bright breakfast room.

What also sets this hotel apart is the excellent service from the staff.  In particular, Rory Rooney has gone out of his way to make sure that my niece's graduations were acknowledged.    Diamond  status is definitely recognized here as well.

I didn't catch the names of the front desk staff who assisted us - but they were all very helpful and caring.

Thanks again for a great stay!",5,2022,07,28
237,The Morrison: The Best Hotel in the ❤️ of Dublin,"Would highly recommend this hotel.  My husband and I have stayed here multiple times.

Greeted warmly by Rory Rooney, Marianna, and all staff members.  Excellent Customer Service throughout hotel.  Great Irish Breakfast, and excellent dinners in the dining room.  Very relaxing at the bar as well…

Our room was spectacular as always.  Looking forward to our next stay.  
This is the perfect hotel in the ❤️ of Dublin.",5,2022,07,27
237,Luxurious 2-night stay at The Morrison,"My fiance and I had a great final 2 nights of our 2-week UK/Ireland trip at The Morrison.  To get us off to a great start, we were upgraded to a river view suite, which was amazing.   Very comfortable, king bed, massive amounts of space, and wonderful views of the city.   The hotel is in a perfect location on the banks of the River Liffey, allowing you to have quiet nights while still being just a short walk across the bridge from Temple Bar and the rest of Dublin's main attractions.  There are also a lot of cool bars and restaurants (and the Jameson distillery) close to the hotel on the same side of the river.  The breakfast buffet was also top notch.  My only regret is that we didn't have more time to to explore the bar and restaurant.  We will definitely stay at The Morrison if we return to Dublin, and highly recommend it to all travelers.",5,2022,07,26
237,"Great hotel, great location, great service","Great hotel just down from Ha'Penny Bridge on Lower Ormond Key with the Jervis St LUAS (red line) just behind the hotel.  Well apportioned rooms, great staff make it a great choice in Dublin.  Would recommend this hotel for being centrally located with 15 mins walk to St Stephens Green",5,2022,07,26
237,A great start to a wonderful trip!,Our large family group stayed at The Morrison last week at the start of our ten day stay in Ireland. The rooms were very clean and comfortable and the location was ideal—walkable to anything we wanted to do. The staff was very helpful before and during our stay. The breakfast is delicious! A plentiful buffet and several made to order options. We could not have been more pleased with our stay and I highly recommend The Morrison!,5,2022,07,22
237,Excellent Stay in the Center of Dublin,"We booked the Morrison for one night while we waited to join our cruise leaving Dublin the following day.  This hotel seems to be in the process of transitioning to a higher level Hilton brand, and, as a result, is a relative bargain in terms of the cost vs. the quality of the rooms, which are very current.  The service was excellent and our bed was very comfortable (firm, but comfortable).  I'd suggest staying here before it's re-branded and becomes more expensive.",5,2022,07,21
237,Perfect organization of staff event. Mind was at ease knowing there would be no hiccups during any hour of the event,Great management of events. Great set up and good communication during event.

237,Favorite hotel in Ireland,"We toured the country from north to south, and the Morrison was our favorite. Great location, helpful staff, clean and spacious room. Wonderful, upgraded  bathroom with tub and separate shower. Mini-bar. Ability to adjust heat/air.  The breakfast was amazing.  And the restaurant was so good, we ate there several times.  Personal note from the manager.  We were treated well.  Highly recommend.",5,2022,07,15
237,Great location,"Rafael at the Quay bar was great. He made me a drink that was excellent. Hotel was very clean. Beds are comfortable and room was quiet. Location was excellent, very close to Temple Bar. We walked everywhere, but if you need a taxi they were readily available.",5,2022,07,03
237,Good location and friendly service,"This was one of the Hilton family group of hotels in Dublin which became available with some reasonable rate during my first 3 nights of my trip to the city.  There was only 1 room type category available. 

 

Location
The hotel is centrally located in the city centre of Dublin.  It was just right across the River Lyftt from the Temple Bar area.  On this side of the river, it is much quieter, however there are still a few places for food and some bar area for those not looking for too much crowd.  Outside of that, about 2 blocks away from the river, there’s also a shopping area/street.  Walking from the hotel to most major attractions in the city centre was doable (despite some requiring some hiking up some steep roads/hill). 

For those with a car, the hotel itself has no car parking facilities, however about a few mins walk away, there’s a parking complex, Jarvis, which has some reasonable overnight parking rate (which starts from 18u to 10u the next day), available to also walk-in customers.

Check In
I arrived very late, in fact just after midnight.  To access the lobby/hotel, after 10pm, you will need either a card or use the doorbell.  I was let into the hotel quite fast and later an associate was at the front desk to check me in.  Since the hotel (at the time of my stay – if I remember correctly) did not offer digital keys, I did not bother to do a digital check-in.   The check-in process was fast and efficient and welcoming.  I was given a quick rundown of some of the facilities especially as an elite member.   Since the hotel was fluctuating in being fully booked and some rooms getting released, I noticed later when I was in my originally booked room category that there was a room category 1 category higher which the hotel did not upgrade me to.  Anyways I did not bother to pursue further on this since I was expecting to not be in the room most of the time.   As it was late, I was informed that there were no cookies left and I could collect them the next day if I had wanted any.

Room
The room was situated on the 3rd floor of the hotel and luckily (as it was assigned by the hotel) it faced the interior courtyard of the hotel.  I believe rooms facing the road might have disturbance from the traffic?  The room was a refurbished room – in preparation as noted on a letter in the room, converting from a Doubletree branded hotel to a Curio Collection hotel.   The room size was ok for a hotel in Dublin and also as a entry level room.   The decoration can be a discussion point, to me – it seem like combination of artistic/modern meet Scandinavian style.   For me, it was not really something that I liked as it seemed quite random yet at the same time, much too white and somewhat cheap in some ways.

The layout of the room was ok, with the wardrobe and mini bar/tea-coffee making facilities here ara at the entry way.  This was modernized with the purple mood lighting with the switch for this at the side of the bed (it was specifically indicated).   The bathroom was situated to the right of the entry hallway. 

There the usual long desk along the wall – which acted as a TV stand, working/multi functional desk.  At the corner of the room was a small sitting area and a table.  On this table was 2 boxed water – with a note requesting guest to re-use them with the water cooler located in the lobby area.  This is by far the best environment friendly option provided at any hotels I’ve seen.  (Yes, some do provide guests with those reusable plastic water bottles for them to take with them, but how many does one need and how often do they get used just once or twice and forgotten/thrown).  The bottle/box was actually quite sturdy as I used it so often that I lost count. 

Sleep quality was good – since the room was facing the courtyard, external noise was close to zero (I do wonder how those facing the main road will be as it does get busy late into the night).  Noise from the internal was also minimal, with the occasional chatters from the hallway and in the morning at times hearing the housekeeping cart being pushed.  The bed was ok – being not too firm nor soft.  Temperature control in the room was ok – only small complain was the fan noise, even at low speed it was on the higher side, more like in US hotels. 

Internet speed was decent and the TV options were quite limited to UK and Irish channels with a handful of international options.  As for electrical outlets, it was all Irish/British type – again rather disappointing that they did not include some EU/US one especially recently refurbished and as an international hotel chain.  There were a couple of USB type charges around the room.

As for the bathroom – it was of a decent size with a walk in shower area.  The same themed continued from the room into the bathroom.  The shower area was a bit narrow – depends on the direction you shower, but at least from the logical direction one would stand, it was narrow.  Pressure and temperature control of the shower was ok.  They did provide sufficient toiletries – the usual Crabtree and Evelyn. 

Breakfast
Breakfast is served in an area next to the main restaurant – seems like this area is used only during breakfast hours as in the evenings, I did not really see it being used.  It could be that it’s used as a spill over area during peak hours from the main restaurant.  The space was a 2 floor space – with actually quite limited seating area.  I think if it was busy, they would use the main restaurant area as the spill over.  The decoration was actually nice in the breakfast room with some modern eccentric pieces of art.

Breakfast concept was a mix of buffet and made to order items from a limited menu.  With the hot dishes, one could create your own Irish breakfast.  Hot drinks were made to order – from the different servers in the area.  It was more of a restaurant serving concept in general.  The quality and variation of items was good during my 4 days stay.    All in all a top breakfast service for a Doubletree, but maybe on par when it changes to a Curio Collection property.

Service
In general I thought that the service level at this property to be good especially for Irish hotels (especially now comparing with my post experience at the Hilton Dublin – which was horrible).  I found the breakfast staff to be friendly and accommodating to requests.  Housekeeping was also very good – with some small details like placing a towel over the washbasin surface and your toiletries on it – when they know you’re staying long.  I have only expected this when staying in Asia, so this is a level up – and something which one would expect when it’s a Curio property.

HHonors Benefits
In general recognition level is ok – slightly better with the small local gift provided and a drink voucher.  I am only curious how upgrading elite members will work here if it had the rooms available and if there would be some additional happy hour provided when it becomes a Curio property.

Overall
All in all, I would certainly recommend this property if the price is right – it can get quite pricy when occupancy is high.  I believe the location is one of the best among the international chain hotels which I noticed.",4,2022,07,02
237,One of the best Hilton  company hotels I’ve ever stayed,Staff is amazing.  Great service. Heat central location.  Hotel is very clean.  Breakfast is great.  Nice restaurant and bar in lobby.  Rooms are large and are cleaned every day if you want.  Hilton needs to use this hotel as an example for how it’s hotels should be operated.,5,2022,07,01
237,Fantastic!!,Lovely hotel and the customer service from every employee was excellent. Great breakfast and perfect location in the city. Clean and Spacious  hotels with full size bathrooms. Many other European hotels have tiny bathrooms.,5,2022,07,01
237,Fabulous hotel in centre of Dublin!,"My daughter & I stayed here last Friday when we went to see the School of Rock in the Bord Gáis and what a treat it was. When we went to check in they told us we were upgraded to a junior suite and were given a beautiful, spacious room on the second floor overlooking the Liffey. The room itself was fabulous, beautful decor, modern, bright and so clean. The bathroom had a shower and bath and again was very spacious. The hotel is just around the corner from the Jervis St. Luas stop and 5 mins walk from O'Connell St/Temple Bar. We could have stayed another few nights...loved it!! :)) ",5,2022,06,27
237,Fantastic hotel!  Great location too will stay again!,"I was most impressed with our recent stay at the Morrison hotel.  Starting with the front desk, Vrenellie and Daniel were very helpful answering our many questions.  Our adjoining rooms were perfect for our family.  Rooms were clean and beds very comfortable.  AC worked great too.  Breakfast was delicious so many options and the best tea we had in Ireland!  Please share the brand of tea!  Great location walking distance to Temple Bar neighborhood, but not in all the noise of Temple Bar.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2022,06,25
237,Great wedding,"Our special day was hosted by the Morrison. With the best of help from Rory and Simon all the guests were so impressed by the food, service and the rooms. As newlyweds we got the Penthouse suite with a lovely view over the Liffey. Having all the rooms on the ground floor (Halo, Art Gallery and Printworks) made it very convenient to everyone there. We couldn't have wished for a better hotel to host our wedding.",5,2022,06,23
237,Wonderful Time in Dublin,The staff was wonderful. Very accomodating. Whatever request I had was met with a smile. The room was spacious and very clean and well appointed. The location was perfect. A 2 minute walk to the Temple Bar area. The wait staff were friendly and helpful. The bed was very comfortable. And I am very picky. The only critique was the gym could use a little  more equipment.,5,2022,06,22
237,Try the Sundae!,My cousin and I stayed for two nights. The staff was friendly and helpful. We had drinks at the bar and ordered their customizable sundaes. The bar service was great and the sundae was fun and yummy. We had no issues the whole stay. I would book with them again.,5,2022,06,22
237,Great Hotel and Great Location,My wife and I stayed at the Morrison on 2 consecutive weekends. Five nights total. The location is excellent for exploring Dublin. Check in was perfect. Our rooms on levels 1 and 5 were great. We picked river view rooms. The room on level 1 had windows that partially opened. The room on level 5 had larger windows. Both nice rooms. King size bed. The breakfast in the morning was really really nice. Friendly attentive staff who made sure you were happy. Definitely the place to stay in Dublin,5,2022,06,19

We were coming to Dublin for a big summit. 
Hosting 30 people working with us.

Our experience was fabulous. 
The place is located in a great area close to city center. 
the restaurant is very nice and inviting, 
The food was super fresh and delicious. 
And the service team was very nice and did a great job. 

Our guests were very happy and we got very good feedbacks from all of them. 
Will definitely recommend the Morrison grill restaurant for any occasion.",5,2022,06,18
237,Couldn’t of been more helpful thank you Rory,A Massive thank you to Rory Rooney who sorted everything out as they didn’t have a room for us but checked us into another hotel even though it was too far from everything but perfect for what we were seeing that night he moved us to another hotel nearer everything. We couldn’t be more happy with his custom and his quick replies to sort everything out so Thank you so much it’s really appreciated and thank you for the Lunch the food was amazing!!,5,2022,06,16
237,Great location!,"Stayed at the Morrison for 3 nights! Started with a complimentary welcome cocktail while short wait for our room. Location is great, short walk to many things. Good breakfast each morning with friendly staff and of course the warm choc ship cookies any time of the day. Our corner room was large and comfortable. Appreciate the robe and slippers. Will definitely go back!",5,2022,06,15
237,June Ireland stay,"Excellent stay. Outstanding restaurant. Friendly, helpful staff. Bottled water replenishment plan a great idea.  Clean rooms, nice linens. Quiet at night. Perfect location for walks to Temple Bar, Trinity College, Christchurch, Guinness, Jameson, tour bus locations, hop-on bus. ",5,2022,06,12
237,The location and staff are amazing,"The rooms are clean and modern looking.  The restaurant for breakfast was absolutely the best breakfast and service we had on our trip.  What made our stay even better was Vrenellie, the person who greeted us and checked us in to the hotel.  I had mentioned that this was a graduation trip to celebrate our daughter graduating from Medical school.   Vrenellie up graded our rooms and sent our daughter a congratulations treat and a book of the best chocolates ever.  A big shout out to Vrenellie, Hilton and the breakfast crew.",5,2022,06,09
237,Ideal location with wonderfully kind staff!,"Fantastic, amazing, responsive, and kind staff - with the ideal location. Highly recommend. The location is great:  near Temple Bar and many of the Dublin sights, but not too near. You can cross the bridge and you’re right in the heart of Temple Bar, but the crowds,  bachelorette parties, and bar sidewalks are not at your door. It’s clean and bright. Restaurant is good. There’s hop on hop off bus stops steps away and they sell tickets at the front desk. What makes this place so special is the staff. I, unfortunately, tested positive for Covid during my stay. The GM, Derek, went so out of his way to make sure I was well looked after while I got things sorted. The staff did the same. He had me make a list of things I needed from the pharmacy and the staff kindly picked the items up at the local pharmacy. More than once. Someone checked on me at least once a day. And, sent me get well cookies and chocolates every day - with get well soon notes. I travel quite a bit for work and for fun, and this was far and away the most authentically kind service I have experienced.   I will be coming back to Dublin for work and fun again, and I will most definitely be staying here. Thank you to the GMs and the team for a great stay, Covid and all!",5,2022,06,02
237,Amazing stay highly recommend!,"Amazing experience highly recommend you choose this hotel for your stay excellent location,  walk to everything, beautiful renovated rooms, great customer service all around super happy with our experience. Be sure to visit the bar/restaurant",5,2022,05,30
237,"Great Hotel, Great Staff, Great Location, Great Everything.","Once of the best hotels. The staff is amazing they never stop trying to provide the best customer service. It was just outstanding. Can't say enough great things about the property. It is great location, with so much within walking distance, the hotel looks great and the food is just wonderful. Once again the breakfast staff is the perfect combination of a great service and great personality. No kidding the staff treat you like a good friend they invited to stay with them. Just a great place look forward to my next visit.",5,2022,05,24
237,Wonderful afternoon tea!,"Tables were beautifully laid out for afternoon tea for our party of 12!  Food was amazing, service very friendly and efficient!  Everyone was catered for - vegetarian and coeliac!  Sweet and savoury sandwiches and cakes were delicious,  would have no hesitation in recommending the Morrison Hotel for Afternoon Tea!  We will be back!",5,2022,05,21
237,Excellent Room and Excellent Location,"It is difficult to balance the feel of the locale when traveling internationally and some of the perqs that many Americans have come to expect.  European hotel rooms are typically far smaller and ""quaint"" than the major American chains like Hilton or Marriott.  The Morrison is a wonderful mix of both.
We were concerned to learn that the hotel was undergoing renovation during our planned visit.  But management responded to our questions and concerns quickly and we were not disturbed by this activity.  Our room was quiet and comfortable.

Breakfast and dinner in the hotel restaurant were very good.  But It is frustrating when the breakfast is limited to an all you can eat buffet with no a la carte menu for someone who might just want a cup of coffee and a pastry.  

The location was perfect.  Quiet, off the main street.  But  easy to access many sites of interest and of course Temple Bar neighborhood with vibrant and noisy nightlife.

Would definitely recommend.",5,2022,05,18
237,Great Hotel,"Stayed here for two nights at the end of a six day Ireland tour.  Booked this due to reviews and proximity to most sights I wanted to see in Dublin.  The location is excellent as most sights are within a few blocks.  The hotel is very nicely decorated when you walk in and has a classy feel.  Had a room on the 4th floor that was spacious, clean, functional, and very quiet to outside noise.  Also had a huge walk-in shower with rainfall head that was great.  Bed was firm and comfortable.  Had breakfast here one morning, and had many choices and reasonable for EUR 15.00 (could do buffet or order off menu).  Staff at front desk were friendly and attentive, and arranged my cab for the morning.  Wouldn't hesitate to stay again!",5,2022,05,15
237,Great room and location,Great central location right on the river.  We had a room overlooking the river which was very nice.  Good breakfast with both buffet and menu items. We didn’t try the restaurant for dinner but it was always doing a good business.,5,2022,05,15
237,Not a great experience,Room was claustrophobic with no chance to opens the window. Dry and hot air with no air conditioning. Couldn’t sleep all night. Food average! A cheeseburger was looking like made from my son 6 years old! No good at all Very disappointed ,3,2022,05,14
237,"Great location, staff, and accommodations","The staff was so lovely! They helped organize a surprise for my wife as we were on our honeymoon. They helped with the elevator when my hands were full, called cabs for us, etc. Marianna and Jordi in the breakfast room were superstars. They always knew our order and remembered what we had visited the day before so always asked detailed questions. The rooms were great and location was fantastic. Only downside was the room never got very cold, but hey the windows opened with a nice breeze so it was manageable.",5,2022,05,13
237,Awesome hotel,"Great hotel. Very close to everything in Dublin center. Bus stops are close by and so is the tram stop.
Staff is super friendly and helpful.
Restaurant is great. Rooms are very spacious, modern and clean. 
I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2022,05,10
237,Fundraising Gala Event - Amazing experience,"Our organisation hosted a Fundraising Gala Event on Saturday 7th, May 2022. We hosted 120 people that were comfortably served in the Printworks room. The staff was so accommodating, efficient, kind and professional. They helped us provide an amazing experience in the event, we want to mention specially; Jacqueline, Leandro, Ignacio and Daniel. 

We tried the bowl food menu which was a very interesting concept (Like a Tapas kind of experience) and people was happy to try new options. The organising staff was very flexible and understanding with our needs. Also the location is unbeatable! 

We are happy to recommend the Hotel for any important event you might have in Dublin and we'd love to continue collaborating with them for our next events.",5,2022,05,09
237,A great venue and staff,"I booked the Morrison for a party celebration for my wife's birthday. From my initial contact with Fernanda, to the actual event on the night, everything was handled smoothly and professionally.

The decoration and food were both excellent. The staff were welcoming, efficient and  very helpful on the night.

I would highly recommend the Morrison if you are considering organising an event or party.

237,Concert weekend,"We stayed at the Morrison for 2 nights.  We came over to see Ed Sheeran in concert . We first came to this hotel back in 2006, so to come back years later was lovely, and it was just as good as we remembered. 
 Great friendly service from the moment we checked in.  Breakfast is superb and the staff are so friendly and helpful.  Our room was great , really comfortable , with great views of the river and the city.  The hotel is in a fantastic location , with most things we wanted to see easily reached  within walking distance., including the venue of our concert , Croke Park.  We ordered room service and the food was great.. The room was spotlessly clean. 
We will definitely be back , thank you for a very enjoyable stay.

237,Dream Wedding,"Myself and my partner got married in The Morrison on Saturday 23rd of April and it is a day we will never forget. From the start the events team (Sarah G.) was able to keep our nerves cool in a somewhat post pandemic world. The process was extremely easy and any question we had was answered in a prompt fashion. The hotel were extremely flexible with any requests we had. The staff were beyond any that I have experienced in any other hotel. Extremely approachable and friendly. Will give a few mentions. Hugo who looked after us when we did our menu tasting, Simon the food and beverage manager, Rory the general manager and of course a huge thank you to Jacqueline the events person we delt with on the day of wedding. She had everything in hand and any other questions that had to be asked she was able to answer from looking after picky eaters to what the raost potatoes were cooked in. I didn't get any other staff members names but the reception staff, waiters and floor staff for the wedding day itself and the residents bar staff, the breakfast staff?! There are so many but I couldn't say how amazing they were and all my family and friends spoke so highly of them. 

The food itself to die for, the chefs did an amazing job! My aunt who has been to 20 weddings said it's the best food she has ever had at a wedding!! The snacks in the evening went down a treat especially with now husband still raving about them chicken sliders 3 days after the wedding. The breakfast was the best hotel breakfast I have personally experienced. 

The hotel itself, beautiful, clean and smelt beautiful (forgot to ask what the fragrance was). The rooms were great. Nothing more needed. If you get the penthouse, well you will never want to leave. At least we didn't, great place to get a few pre wedding photos or after ceremony photos as the views of Dublin city are breath taking. Also a nice place to retreat too for a bit of down time. The ceremony room/dining room was huge with uplighters and own private bar that was set up in our own personalized style was amazing! The private terrace, perfect for the smokers was a beautiful extra to have because there wasn't far to travel. 

I couldn't recommend this hotel enough for a place to help you make your day special but I do hope this review helps you make this hotel an option.",5,2022,04,25
237,Another Excellent Stay at the Morrison,"Would highly recommend this hotel.  Upon our arrival, we were greeted warmly by Rory Rooney.
Great Irish Breakfast in the Dining Area with excellent service by Marianna.  We have stayed here numerous times in the past, and Marianna remembered us from our previous stays.  
Excellent Dinner at the Hotel on Day 2.  
Our room was spectacular as always.  
Looking forward to our next trip and stay at the Morrison.",5,2022,04,24
237,Excellent Hotel,"My wife and I were at The Morrison (a DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel) for two nights (18th and 19th April 2022). Room (103) was in a great size, clean and tidy. Friendly staff and good service. I would like to express my thanks and appreciation for the service and care to Marianna (breakfast shift), Scarlett, Mariana and Hugo (Dinner). Well done all of you.",5,2022,04,23
237,Perfect,"My second visit here in a few weeks. First visit was great but second was even better as we got upgraded to a suite. Beautiful room, with nespresso machine, fridge, jumbo sized bath. Breakfast was delicious and fab selection. Fresh squeezed orange juice was available which is almost never on a breakfast buffet now. Dinner in the bar was again delicious, great choices, reasonably priced. So good we ate here on our second night too. Secure car parking available too close by.
Will it’s definitely be back on my next trip to Dublin. ,",5,2022,04,18
237,Hilton the way it used to be,It was great to have a full breakfast like the old days not like the new Hilton $14.  Voucher. I hope this is a trend and the breakfast my way comes back. This hotel is a must stay at location. Close to everything.,5,2022,04,18
237,Great Property!,"Right from our arrival to our departure the ENTIRE staff was like real family. Joy and Peter were delightful at reception. The entire property and our stay was just awesome. Breakfast each morning was a pleasure with Marianna and Jordi. The bar and dinner was most rewarding every evening with fabulous service from Laura, Derek, Mariana and Claudia. I highly recommend this property and look forward to returning.",5,2022,04,16
237,Lovely hotel,"First time staying here. Really impressed, hotel and rooms are gorgeous, two barmen Rafael and Tino were lovely to talk to as the bar was quiet the night we were there. I’ve stayed I’m hotels all over Ireland and this is up there with one of my favourites . Will definitely be booking again.",5,2022,04,15
237,Great time,"We booked an anniversary afternoon tea but could not make it within the afternoon tea time frame but they still accommodated us, which they did not have to. The staff are amazing the food (the gentleman’s tea) was so nice. Fabulous place for food drink or even an event, we will be back . Thank you to all the staff",5,2022,04,11
237,"Inviting and modern, great customer service","We had a warm welcome and staff was extremely accommodating. The hotel has a cool vibe and was both elegant and modern.  The room was clean and updated. We had a king room with a river view, and this was perfect for our 2 night stay. Would highly recommend to get the river view. Our bed was comfortable, the bathroom was updated and good-sized. After a long flight we decided to stay in and have dinner at the hotel restaurant.  Have to say the Angus steak burger was absolutely the best burger we've had in a long time!  We also chose to have breakfast one morning at the hotel as well and the service and food was very good there as well. The hotel is extremely close to the Temple Bar area and we had an easy walk to visit the Dublin Castle and the Jameson Distillery. We felt quite safe in the area as well.  It was an easy taxi ride from the airport and I understand the bus stops close by as well. The front desk staff also arranged for a taxi to the train station upon our check-out. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay within walking distance of the many places to see in Dublin.",5,2022,04,05
237,Corporate Retirement Dinner,"From start to finish we were looked after by a very professional team. They ensured that everything running up to the event and the actual dinner itself, ran smoothly.
Even though we kept adding little extra things on a daily basis, they were extremely obliging and helpful.
Dinner was delicious and served promptly.
I would certainly recommend the Morrison Hotel for any business events.",5,2022,04,04
237,Feedback,"Rafael excels at customer service. He is extremely welcoming and helpful. Service with a smile as always. The reason we keep returning when we are in town. Looking forward to our next visit.
Many thanks

237,.,"I stayed on the 31st of March. Fabulous stay at The Morrison the service was supreme We had an fantastic stay. Great location it was in the heart of Dublin. Food was fantastic, and staff were all so friendly. Our room was very clean and well maintained.",5,2022,04,03
237,Very Best Hotel in the Dublin,"Absolutely the BEST hotel in the heart of Dublin.
This was  a very special trip since I was celebrating my daughters birthday. 
From the moment  you walk inside  the lobby, you are welcomed  by the wonderful staff . 
The rooms are very spacious and extremely clean!!  Everything is spotless 
The location is perfect to explore Dublin by foot since all the main  attractions to explore are within walking distance.  Even the buses and trains are very accessible if you want to explore the rest of Ireland,  this is the perfect hotel to keep  as a home base during your entire stay. 
The attention to detail is truly remarkable!
When we walked into our room we had a special surprise birthday cake  waiting for my daughter with a very nice  birthday note from Mr Rory Rooney, Deputy General Manager of Morrison Hotel.  Thank you for taking the time , we truly appreciate the nice gesture .Little things like this truly make a difference and made our trip extra special.   I highly recommend this hotel to anyone that’s visiting Dublin.  I wish I could give it more than 5 stars!!  Wonderful Hotel with a wonderful and very caring and helpful staff!!!",5,2022,03,30
237,Flawless,"Stayed 2 nights on a room & food package and could not have been treated any better. I would like to leave a balanced review but literally cannot think of anything that could be improved (You know it’s good when your taxi driver tells you you’ve chosen really well). Firstly the location is perfect. Easy, flat walking distance from the Jamesons & Guinness tour. The room was impeccably clean and massive for a city centre hotel and the staff were fantastic. The restaurant was as good as any I’ve eaten in and has a decent choice of wines. I appreciate this review isn’t particularly constructive but there’s not a thing I’d change.",5,2022,03,28
237,Great Chioce,My Daughter and I stayed here one night during our trip to Ireland.  She thought it was a fabulous hotel.  Very clean amd friendly staff.  We had a premium room amd it was very large and comfortable.  Shopping and walking all close.  Highly recommend.,5,2022,03,27
237,Treated like a Queen!,"Myself and my husband had a wonderful stay in The Morrison Hotel on 26/03/22 to celebrate my birthday.
I was treated so well by all the staff, especially Front of House Manager Piotr Marek.
Fabulous atmosphere, food and cocktails ( I recommend the Cannonball Martini!)
The junior suite is fit for a Queen and made our stay so comfortable.
I can't wait to visit again, sooner rather than later hopefully!!",5,2022,03,27
237,"4 for room, 2 for restaurant","To was too hot, with air con on full, when it was only 15C outside.

Bathroom door was just a weird design. Latch doesn’t properly seat, and door swings open, and I’d suggest rebooking at the whole arrangement. 

Room had lights (e.g. temperature controls) that couldn’t be turned off, but were too bright. We had to cover them with pants.

Dinner was not a great experience.

Menu did not describe the food that was delivered to our table.

Serving staff clearly have no idea what the dishes should contain or look like.

Really surprised that several guest facing staff members had a poor grasp of English. In what is an international hotel in a capital city. Beer and Beef are quite different things.",3,2022,03,25
237,Nothing less than superb!,"We began planning our wedding reception six weeks before the day. From the first phone call with Sarah, the events manager, everything was brilliant. Every communication, every suggestion, made planning our wedding effortless and hassle free. Whenever we visited the hotel every member of staff was so helpful and friendly. Every meal we had leading up to the event was incredibly good. We worried that our good luck might run out on the day of the wedding. But no. The event was flawless. So many guests complimented the food, staff and hotel. I couldn’t rate one thing less than 10 out of 10. And in a great stroke of fortune we also found our photographer, Nina Val, through the event manager. Thank you to The Morrison and their team.",5,2022,03,17
237,Great location.,"Fantastic hotel in a perfect location. 
Really impressed with all aspects of the hotel. 
Just a short walk across the bridge for temple bar, go right along the canal will get you to guiness factory, phoenix park, Dublin zoo. Go left will take you to book of Kels, wax museum etc. All are within walking distance or a very short Uber ride if you don’t fancy it. 
Rooms are nice with comfy beds. Good breakfast and no problems getting a table. May be different at busier times as the room seemed quite small. 
Have stayed in a Hilton for all stays so far this year and this one was another that didn’t disappoint",5,2022,03,14
237,Fantastic service,"From the moment we arrived we recieved such amazing service. Our server Rafael,was beyond friendly and so attentive. It is in fact my second time to be served by Rafael and both times he had us laughing and smiling from the minute we sat down, not to forget the fact he ensured our glassses were never empty. We will definitely be returning and hopefully see Rafael again! 😊",5,2022,03,14
237,Worst hotel experience of my life,"It is firstly worth pointing out that since 2014 I have been a regular guest at the hotel in particular 2014 2015 2016 where the staff used to joke  ""did i not have home to go to""  I  have spent 5 Christmas breaks as their guest and would rate the hotel as easily one of the best i have stayed in.
Until Christmas 2021.
I had a 6 night stay booked and was super excited to be at the hotel again as my stay at Christmas 2020 was cancelled by the hotel at last minute due to Co Vid however i managed to make a booking at the Conrad and was their guest and had a fantastic time even with the Co Vid restrictions.
In the last 8 Christmas i have stayed 5 times at the Morrison and 3 times at the Conrad.
I am a Hilton Diamond member and overall get looked after incredibly well, in particularly at the Hilton hotels in Dublin as i stay around 30 nights a year there and have done so for 8 years.
As a loyal patron of the hotel and having stayed with them a significant number of times over the last years i was looking forward to be welcomed back.
There was no welcome back Mr Forrest and thanks for being a Diamond member at check in.....  they also only had me booked for 1 night and not 6 and it took longer than it should to get my booking corrected.
However a small blip so it was instantly forgotten by me....
I had invited 6 friends in for dinner on my second night and left 600 Euro at reception as payment in advance for our meal.
I spoke with Sushill the head chef later that day as i have known him since 2016 when he started. He said he was working and would personally look after me and my guests. 
He did that and ordered in an excellent fillet steak which 4 of us enjoyed.
Me and my guests had a fabulous evening.
The next morning i decide to go for a walk after breakfast to blow away the cobwebs and stopped at reception to enquire as to my bill as i retired to bed and my daughter and her partner were still there so they signed it on my behalf.
The receptionist eventually found it and said it was 640 Euro.... oh great i said it was not that much over budget. I said thanks and turned to leave and go on my walk.
Excuse me she said.... i need the 40 Euro now. I said just add it to my final bill.....No i cannot  do that you need to pay it now. I explained that i am well known to the hotel and i am  here for another 4 nights so i'm not going to run away. i turned to go for my walk. At that point she came round from behind reception and stood in between the door and me and said ... I am sorry i cannot let you leave the hotel until you have settled your bill. Really and can i ask why. Yes she said we have had a number of guests recently not paying their final bill.... i chuckled.... oh that is not good....however i am going for a walk.... i will come back. I am here another 4 nights Again she repeated. I cannot let you leave the hotel until you pay 40 euro.
Ok fair enough and took 40 euro out my pocket and gave it to her. 
She asked if i could come back to reception.
She said that is good you have paid however as you are here another 4 nights i require an additional deposit.
Again i went through all the explanation about being well known to the hotel ect ect.and even asked for the manager.... she said it does not matter who you ask for i need more money.
i started to loose patience a bit at this point and said i'm going for my walk now i will sort it out when i come back
She shouted after me..... when you come back, come and see me or you won't get back into your room... really i thought.
on return to the hotel i asked for the manager who was not available and someone else explained the same thing that guests had recently left without paying so they needed more money.
I explained that as a Diamond member they have all of my cards on file and the one used to make the booking is a debit card with an irish bank.
She said it does not matter.
ok i said there is my card take a deposit payment.
She said that i would need to pay 500 euro as i had a big spend on my second night and might do it again.
I exclaimed that was outrageous and had never ever happened at any hotel ever not least at a hotel where i was known.
She said that was the rules.
I paid the 500 euro but made a decision that i would not spend another cent during to remainder of my stay.
i tried to speak later with rory rooney about it....
however he was not interested in even listening to what i had to say.
ALL I WAS LOOKING FOR WAS AM APOLOGY.
Simple as that.
No he could not or would not offer an apology.
there were another 2 issues with reception regarding the air conditioning and check out.... being told when i said the room is relly hot and the ac wont go cold....
no one else has ever complained about that and when i asked for an extra half hour in my room ....we have availability however i will need to charge.
On returning home i filled in the customer survey in the hope that they might take what i said seriously and offer an apology.
But no rory wrote to me by email and said i was no longer welcome at the hotel and they would never allow me to stay again.
In rory's defence he has only been with the hotel a couple of years so does not know my long standing history having stayed over 150 nights spending thousands and never complained about anything.
Oh well that eventually got it off my chest.
I have to say that looking at the reviews left since Christmas it looks like the hotel has upped its game .....
so perhaps my experience has made it better for everyone else.
Being honest though i can't help feeling that rory is well out of his depth.
Time will tell i suppose",1,2022,03,13
237,Weddings Done Right at the Morrison!,"We had our wedding in the Morrison last Saturday 05th March. 
On the lead up to the wedding we had the pleasure of dealing with Sarah, who took care of all our needs and made everything so easy and stress free. Our wedding day was the most amazing day. Everything was perfect, we honestly cannot praise all the staff enough especially Hugh & Rory who looked after us from the moment we arrived at the hotel. The hotel had all our guests rooms ready for check in first thing that morning and the day went like clockwork.
From myself and Jen a massive thank you to Sarah, Hugh, Rory and the rest of your amazing team. 

From the moment We arrived to the hotel last Friday, right through to check out on Sunday, every minor detail was taking care of. We honestly can’t praise the Morrison enough. You guys really made our dream come true.

For any couple out there looking for the perfect wedding venue, the Morrison is the place to be. We are already looking forward to returning for a weekend trip.

237,Stay at The Morrison if you can when visiting Dublin on a break,"We had a 4-day trip in February and selected the Morrison because of its location and the other reviews. We didn't regret it. It is in a good location for walking the city and proximity to the MTS. The team were excellent - so friendly and professional throughout. The  room (upgraded on arrival) was spacious, clean and had all the facilities we could possibly need. It was a little noisy at night due to traffic and some revelers but that didn't detract from our stay. Well done Hilton and thank you Morrison team   ",4,2022,03,04
237,Best city centre wedding venue,"We got married in the hotel on the 26th of February and I can’t recommend the hotel enough. From the time we started organising to the day itself the team were incredible and in particular, Sarah, from the event’s team. Due to covid we had to reschedule several times and the team were always so helpful. On the day of the wedding everything ran so smoothly and all of the staff treated our guests so incredibly well. Hugh was on hand all day to help us out. The food and the accommodation were outstanding. The location of the hotel is also fantastic if you want pictures around the city centre. We were so pleased with everything. Thank you so much, Katie and Lee",5,2022,03,03

237,Dinner and cocktails,"Last week I went to the Morisonss Hotel restaurant to celebrate Valentine's day with my husband.

My experience was amazing - the food, the drinks, and the staff - they all deserve 5 stars!

The 3 course meal was from their special set menu and it was absolutely delicous!

For me the night's highlight was the cocktails! Rafael, a very friendly bartender, surprised us with an amazing cocktail called Crazy Love. We were very well looked after by him at the bar and will definitely go back.

I recommend you and your friends go and check it out yourselves!",5,2022,02,21
237,Perfect hotel in the heart of dublin,"Superb hotel . I've been a diamond member for several years and the hotel quality at this property is significantly better than highly rated hotels in the US. The staff at the the Morrison were extremely polite and hospitable. The rooms were modern and clean. Great bar/ restaurant / lounge area. Perfect location, right across the street from the liffy bridge...lots to do within walking distance ( great restaurants, pubs, shopping etc). Parking was extremely convenient , just a few properties past the lobby entrance. Special thanks to Rory (GM) for going above and beyond to ensure my fiancé and I enjoyed our stay. I look forward to staying at this property again. Keep up the great work Morrison team!",5,2022,02,21

237,Anniversary Delight,"We live in Dublin but decided to celebrate our wedding anniversary and  booked the Morrisons Big Deal as recommended by friends.

Thanks to Sarah Glennon who looked after our booking, I had only mentioned it was a special anniversary so the added touch of the personal note in the room on arrival with our bubbles and chocolates and the drink to our table at dinner was such a nice touch.

The room was fab, overlooking the liffey, spacious and bright.

The staff throughout the hotel were so friendly and attentive but yet not overpowering.

Food for dinner and breakfast were totally top class and gets a 10/10 from us.

Amazing hotel with exceptional service from start to finish and a great location as an added bonus

Only downside was that we hadn’t booked a longer stay!

Highly recommend",5,2022,02,17

The check in was friendly and efficient, the concierge were helpful, the room was exceptional, the breakfast was excellent (the the Slovakian Manager knowledgeable and very friendly), the location was superb and the check out was easy and efficient again.

From checking in, to chatting with the bar staff,  meeting the breakfast team to checking out, the staff could not have been any more helpful!

The entire hotel and our room was spotless!
Breakfast was delicious and plentiful (we didn't dine in the hotel)

237,Should be 5*,"Love the location of this hotel, right in the center of the city within walking distance of all the main attractions. We got a really good deal on a midweek two night package including breakfasts and one evening meal. Our king room on the second floor was very spacious and comfortable. It was a little on the “white” side but the bed was extremely comfortable. The breakfast room “Halo”is huge with a gallery level and huge projection tv. The staff were very attentive and brought the hot drinks to the table while the food items were self service. We chose to have our dinner in the Morrison room on the second night. I can honestly say that the 28 day aged fillet steak was one of the best I’ve ever had. The potato gratin the sauce and the veg all were perfection. Equally great we’re the scallops and prawn pill pill starters. Our service was warm and friendly and they even recognized our special occasion which was a lovely touch. The Morrison is a must for a luxury city center break if you force yourself to leave the hotel.",5,2022,02,04
237,Weekend Getaway,I definitely picked the right spot for a weekend getaway to Dublin.  The hotel was central to everywhere I wanted to be and checkin was easy.  What made this property standout was the staff!  The friendly faces and the service in every area was over the top.,5,2022,02,01
237,Best location and nice staff,"The Staff was very friendly, the location is perfect and everything was very clean. I have only one point which disappointed me. The twin bed room has two very small beds. Never slept in such a small bed since I was a teenager.
But the staff made it definitely up!

We highly recommend the restaurant to stop by.
Thank you very much Deivid and crew.

237,Extraordinary service and location,"Loved our stay at the Morrison. Canceled two other reservations to stay here longer. The staff especially the breakfast crew were absolutely amazing and friendly and helpful. Really made us feel welcomed. We interacted with several different staff at the front desk and all but one were outstanding. And even the one was not bad, just not as friendly as the other folk. Loved the location. Walked everywhere. Close to your pickups for Wild Rover, which were awesome. Drinks were very good. Food was varied. Steak was very good and so was the chicken sandwich. Had a great view of the river. Very friendly people. The mattress was a bit stiff for our preference but it was quiet in our room. We opened the window and fell asleep to the sounds of Dublin. Close to everything we did. We would come back. Beautiful hotel. ",5,2021,12,31
237,Good,I booked the hotel for three nights as this is my first visit to Dublin. The location is perfect in the heart of city centre. It’s clean and have friendly staff. The only thing that I didn’t like is the breakfast. ,4,2021,12,26
237,Wonderful Winter wedding at The Morrison.,"Where do we start, we had the best day. Penthouse was amazing for getting ready as was Marks suite. All the staff we met were really friendly and acknowledged our day. Ceremony room was lovely. Print works was perfect for reception and the slide show was a great touch. Hugh was just brilliant he made us so at ease and was great fun too. Food was as delicious as at the tasting and everyone loved it. We all felt safe on the covid front too. Thanks for making our day so special.

237,Schubert wedding,Outstanding hotel with exceptional service! We arrived late and the staff did so much to accommodate our needs.   We could not locate a luggage cart so they helped us carry our many pieces of luggage to our room.   Room service was available and delicious.  It was a nice way to unwind before our early morning flight.,5,2021,12,23
237,"Christmas night stay, Dec 2021","I stayed in the Morrison this month with my partner for one night, the lady at reception was very welcoming. Our room was so nice and comfortable. We had both lunch & dinner in the hotel, all the staff were so nice & friendly. For dinner I had the beef & my partner had the chicken, so tasty. The bartender who served us that evening was a gentleman & so lovely, he made us a Hendricks

237,Exceptional hotel in the heart of Dublin City,"My husband and I had our first visit to the Morrison Hotel & it certainly wont be our last. I can't praise Rory Rooney & his staff enough, for their warm welcome, attention to detail & just the smiley look in their eyes, which really gave a much needed lift during this difficult time.

Everything was perfect from the hotel, location, the room, food, drink and service. A 4 star hotel that provides a 5 star flawless guest service in a state-of-the-art facility.",5,2021,12,18
237,Afternoon Tea ,"Fantastic dining experience. Had Christmas afternoon tea here and we ended up staying in the bar for a few drinks.
The afternoon tea was scrumptious and plentiful and we were happily offered any of left over to be boxed up. The one thing that sets this experience apart from any other hotel is the staff. In particular Deivids, whom waited and attended to us throughout, nothing was too much trouble for him and he went out of his way to make our dining experience very special.
Kudos also to Eogham in the bar who was very professional and friendly and to Derek whom I think was the manager. 
All in all the Restaurant and bar in The Morrisson offers quite the experience and is obviously well managed as all of the staff were couteous, polite and very effiecient.
Again I must mention Deivids who made our afternoon tea experience all the more special with his charm and professionality.
Top notch all round!",5,2021,12,12

237,Great Location Perfect Accommodations,"Great location and perfect accommodations near so many important sites in Dublin. Nearby is The GPO, Jameson’s Distillery, The Abbey Theater, Epic Ireland, The Custom House Visitors Centre.  It is just a short walk over The Liffey at Ha’Penney Bridge to The Temple Bar and Trinity College.",5,2021,12,10
237,Afternoon Tea to die for,Was treated to Afternoon Tea by my son today for my birthday and it was absolutely delicious. The savoury options were stunning and the sweet options couldn't have been better. Such a wonderful treat. Only problem was I couldn't finish it all. I'll definitely go back. I've had afternoon tea in a few places but this was the best.,5,2021,12,07
237,Dublin Center,Excellent location near many restaurants and pubs. Beautifully decorated hotel spaces made for a pleasant spirit. Temple Bar very near. Wait staff very attentive. Very nice food quality. Would stay here again. ,5,2021,12,06
237,5 star service at 4 star prices,"We had our wedding in the Morrison Hotel in November 2021. Overall we stayed in the hotel for three nights. We cannot speak any highly of the service, the food, the comfort of the room etc.
Our wedding went very smoothly thanks to all of the staff from Sarah (our organiser and contact) to Hugh (who looked after everything on the day) and all of the staff in between. 
The food for our wedding was amazing as well as the breakfast and meals we had on the other days/nights we stayed. 
We had nothing but positive feedback from our wedding guests regarding the staff and food. Our other guests from outside of Dublin who stayed over, have already said they will be using the Morrison when they next visit Dublin. 
It's two thumbs and if I had a third thumb that would be up too!!!",5,2021,12,05
237,A gem in the city,I stayed in the Morrison Hotel last week with a group of friends to celebrate a special birthday. What can I say .. the hotel is beautiful and located right in the heart of everything. We ate in the grill and the food was fantastic. Staff were obliging and friendly and service was on the ball. We had a wonderful stay and I will definitely be recommending to family and friends.,5,2021,12,04
237,Outstanding staff and location,"Whether you’ll be visiting Dublin for jus a day or for a few days The Morrison on Ormond Quay is a fantastic hotel.  I’ve stayed at The Morrison on several occasions, and each time the staff has been absolutely fabulous.  The hotel is modern and clean, & the food is very good.  The location is central to both train stations, and easy walk across the Liffey via the ha’penny bridge will have you in Temple Bar, near the Book of Kelly, and shopping on Grafton Street.",5,2021,12,03
237,Morrison,Stayed in the Morrison last week for my husbands birthday and it was just fabulous. The service was exceptional from start to finish. We ate in the Grill and the food was fab.

237,Wedding guest,"I was recently a guest at a wedding in the Morrison and it was definitely one of the better ones I’ve been to. The food was gorgeous and the staff couldn’t do enough for us. Very clean as well, with staff regularly sanitising. 10/10!!!",5,2021,12,01
237,The place to stay in Dublin. ,"All I can say is WOW! Stayed here in The Morrison last weekend for a surprise wedding anniversary with my wife.
From the moment we arrived,  I knew I had made the right decision.  Such a genuine welcome from the reception staff was just the start. After unpacking in our very well appointed room, with a view of The Liffey in full flow, we adjourned to the bar for a pre dinner drink. To say I am fond of a ""drop of whisky "" may be an understatement. The selections in the bar were mouthwatering,  too numerous to mention. My wife, a wine buff, was as delighted as me. The staff in the bar, and later the restaurant, were exceptional in their service and knowledge of their menus.  All done with a genuine understanding of their guests needs and wishes. Throw in the fantastic location,  you could not ask for more. 
We will definitely be back.",5,2021,12,01
237,Amazing stay will be back!,"We stayed here last month for our anniversary and loved every minute. Got warm cookies when we checked it and the stay was full of small touches! Staff very accommodating and friendly, we ate at the grill and food was immense. Cant wait to be back in the New Year!",5,2021,12,01
237,November Wedding,Attended a wedding last week of some close friends and the experience was five star from start to finish.

The bride and groom were overwhelmed with the venue and the service and I have already recommended another couple to have there wedding here in the near future if possible.,5,2021,12,01
237,Location Location Location,This hotel was in a perfect location for what we wanted to do. We arrived in Dublin very early in the morning.  The front desk staff that greeted us was welcoming and helpful.  We even were able to get into our room early.  Our room was beautiful and had everything we needed for our trip.  The breakfast in our hotel was also fabulous with very helpful staff an a nice variety of food.  Would stay there again.  Highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Dublin,5,2021,12,01
237,Wonderful hotel and great staff!,"Wonderful stay! Very warm welcome and thank you Nikita for always being jn touch! But the whole team is really awesome! 

Breakfast was very good as well as the team there, i could have breakfast all day at this atmosphere. 

3 min away from Temple Bar, and you can reach almost every important point of the city in 10min just walking. 

All in all one of the best hotels in Dublin!",5,2021,11,30
237,"Central, Modern on Point","Booked a one night get away in the city, swift check in. Lovely touch warm cookie as you check in. Lobby amazing, room amazing. Booked dinner for later on that evening which was out of this world. Scallops followed by fillet of beef, tarte tatin to finish. Best meal I had in a long time. Next morning had room service which was out of this world, warm prompt and great selection. Will definitely be back. Best location in the city.",5,2021,11,30
237,"Clean, convenient and centrally-located","This wonderful hotel sits across the river from Temple Bar, the notorious pub district popular among tourists. This initially gave me pause to book a room here, but on the advise of a local friend, I did and I'm very happy with my choice.

Getting here was a bit of a slog, given road closures, but I'd say it was a 20-30 minute drive from the airport. The staff at reception were friendly, helpful and informative. Given a busy weekend, they suggested that I book my breakfast times in advance. I'm not sure how necessary this was but I showed up each day at the appointed time and everything was great. There's a cook-to-order menu, along with a sumptuous buffet - I'd highly recommend adding this to your booking. It's a great way to start the day. Incidentally, on my final day I had no reservation but they sat me right away.

Location-wise, you're on the River Liffey, across from Temple Bar and a 20 minute walk from Grafton Street and all of the great restaurants, cafes and shopping in that area. Behind the hotel is another cool little area with some large department stores, coffee bars and pubs. There's also a tram stop about a block away, which can get you around the city, including the Heuston Train Station, which is three stops away. I actually walked to Heuston on the morning I checked out - with a backpack and a roller suitcase, I easily made it over there in 20 minutes - easier and cheaper than a cab.

The hotel restaurant is great - high-end, delicious food. On the Friday evening that I ate there, a great band entertained for about two hours. Wait staff were wonderful.

The room itself was clean and comfortable - very standard European-sized room with all of the expected amenities, including a mini-bar. Upon check-in, I was asked how often I wanted my room cleaned. They seem to pass this off as a COVID response but it's hard to see it as anything other than a labor-cutting/cost-cutting measure. That said, every other day was more than fine for me and the receptionist made it quite clear that requesting housekeeping daily was absolutely fine. 

I'd absolutely stay here again. With the Morrison, you get the convenience of easy access to some of Dublin's most popular areas without the hassles of actually being IN those areas.",5,2021,11,30
237,Date Night - amazing experience!,"Stayed in October with my boyfriend and couldn't believe what an amazing stay we had! We live in Dublin but friends had recommended the hotels Big Deal so we booked for a night away and we were thrilled we did! 
Our room was lovely, and who can't argue with a bottle of prosecco on arrival. Dinner was amazing - such a good menu for a  package deal! 
The staff here really made us feel welcome, and there was a great vibe in the bar & restaurant! Dominic in particular stood out for us - he was so helpful! Marianna stole the show at breakfast - it was refreshing to see staff so happy and upbeat after such a rough time in hotels. We will def be back!!",5,2021,11,30
237,A lovely well located hotel in Dublin City,"Staff were really nice and helpful, Christmas decorations were beautiful. Bedroom was bright and spacious and the bathroom modern with a good shower. Only minor criticism was that I could not get the air conditioning to work properly and the room was quite warm during the night. ",4,2021,11,25
237,A gem in the heart of Dublin,"Love it, love it, love it! 
Stayed three nights in this Hotel. It was a delight. 
The location is excellent, the design and style of the rooms is modern yet incredibly cosy. The staff we encountered were delightful and always helpful. A special mention to Marianna, breakfast manager who was one of the many lovely people we encountered during our stay. If you are staying for breakfast, you HAVE TO order their french toast, it’s spectacular! 
100% would recommend without any hesitation. 
Even if we live in the city, we can’t wait to be back to this hotel for a mini break. A true gem!",5,2021,11,21
237,Amazing!,"The most amazing stay! Everything from start to finish was flawless. The staff were so friendly, the breakfast manager in particular was so lovely (sorry I cannot remember her name).

237,Beautiful hotel and even more beautiful people who work here.,Great hotel and the people who work here are outstanding who go above and beyond for their clients. The food and environs are magnificent and we cannot wait to return before Christmas. The menu is brilliant with such a selection of fine foods sourced from Irish suppliers around the country.,5,2021,11,12
237,Townhall Meeting - Excellent service from start to finish,"I reviewed a number of venues to facilitate our annual townhall meeting and decided to book the meeting facilities and lunch with Sarah in the Morrison Hotel. From visiting the venue, to discussing our requirements and agreeing the menu the whole process was seamless. On the day we were greeted by Hugh who assisted me in setting all of our AV requirements and giving me a run through on the facilities. The event ran like clockwork and all of the staff were so helpful from when we arrived to when we left. Thanks again to all of the team!!",5,2021,11,06

237,Thank you,"Just like to thank for  the service which me and my partner received in the restaurant a few days ago,..
We got in the restaurant for dinner after a long day,, the barman was really on the ball with offering different things and trying the find the best drinks and food for us. He really did put the effort into it,, just like the others.. I even got his name Rafael..
The service was No*1 same as the quality of the food and the drinks..
All i can say is a big thumbs up for the staff..
Thanks so much for the night.",5,2021,10,28
237,A fine hotel in a wondering area,"Had the pleasure of staying for 2 nights last weekend. It was a belated birthday present for myself and let staff know prior to arrival. The requested bottle of prosecco was duly in the room upon arrival, despite checking in early at 1pm. A nice note left from the manager as well, with a couple of sweet treats. 

Staff were friendly and accommodating throughout and the location can't be beat for accessing Temple Bar and beyond. We'd absolutely love to be back.

Late checkout (1.30pm) was also accommodated

Two minor areas of improvement, but not worth subtracting a point for..not a single draw in our room for storage. The closest was decent in size but if staying for more than a couple of nights you'd run out of room.

The drinks vouchers offered don't cover everything at the in house restaurant, and in fact could only be redeemed for an item costing more than what I asked for. I understand the principal but to insist someone orders something on the menu more expensive (bottle of Heineken) Vs what was requested (pint of Guinness) seems strange. 

I'd like to think we'll be back before too long!",5,2021,10,24
237,Outstanding place to stay...,"Even though this location can't be topped, what is even more amazing is the staff and accommodations.  From the moment of arrival, the welcome is heartfelt and very obvious.  Front desk staff are well informed and gently professional.  Restaurant/bar staff are the most attentive anywhere.  

A highlight was also the hotel's referral to Tours with Locals Ireland, specifically Brian O'Reilly.  If you ever envisioned spending wonderful days learning and laughing with a genuiIrishman, Brian is the one to engage.  He knows everyone (from pub owners in small villages to parking lot attendants) and he makes sure his guests are comfortable and enjoying their tours.  Can't sing high enough praise...and he had us all in a sing-a-long in his ""taxi"" van.  

Our ten-day vacation in Ireland was based out of The Morrison.  Although we were advised by friends to ""hit the road,""  we are truly glad we stayed the whole trip in The Morrison.  So appreciate their care and guidance for our first trip.",5,2021,10,24
237,"Great staff, great weekend","Arrived at the Morrison late on Thursday, start of a busy bank holiday weekend in Dublin. The staff at the Morrison really got my trip off to the best of starts. The reception staff were very welcoming and got me set up quickly but the bar staff were the best. As well as a few well-needed beers, they sorted me out with water and other bits I needed as the local shops had already closed, thanks Eoin!! Such a nice touch. Really made the difference. Would highly recommend",5,2021,10,21
237,Great Hotel and location,"Room - Big enough and kept well clean. I had a great nights sleep in the bed.

Food/ Drink - We had a table booked at a place in the Temple area and it was just a Covid breeding ground and a lot of young kids hanging about, off their faces. We couldn't get into any bars beforehand for a drink without a reservation or a mile long queue to enter, so we ventured back to the Hotel for pre-drinks. We thought we would chance it and see if they could accommodate us for a meal there instead and the Manager had us a table within 5 minutes and we stayed the whole night. The food was excellent and the price of a drink was very reasonable, considering its location. The waiters/ waitresses couldn't have done more for us, they provided such a good service.",5,2021,10,18
237,Our wedding day,"The staff were absolutely amazing from the moment we went in to do a site viewing, the tasting and finally the day we got married. Everything was just perfect. The timing of the day was so smooth and relaxed. Our guests were delighted with the hotel rooms and how well they were looked after. The food and drink was delicious. Myself and my husband were treated like King and Queen what a day we will never forget. 
The following day we had breakfast with our families and again the staff couldn't do enough.
A massive thanks to Simon and Rory the men in charge on the day and also to fernanda for answering all phone calls and emails before hand to make sure everything was perfect and all you have done you are a perfectionist and a beautiful person to deal with.",5,2021,10,10
237,Ecellent Afternoon Tea with a Difference ,"Enjoyed a fabulous Gentleman's Afternoon Tea here with my husband on a friday afternoon. 
The food was so tasty and especially good if you want lots of meat with a smaller amount of desserts. Presentation was excellent and its great to have a choice of different Afternoon Tea's - something for everyone's taste buds.
Well done on thinking outside the box.
David looked after us and was an excellent host - what a credit to the Team here in this lovely hotel. 
He checked out our Digital Covid Certs and all hygiene measures were in place which made us feel very safe.
We would highly recommend enjoying the service and wonderful food in The Morrison - we will be back

237,An AMAZING staycation with a young family!,"We have 3 children and stayed night in this superb hotel for a mid week stay during the summer. We live in Dublin so this was a real treat. We managed to get 2 interconnecting rooms which is usually a tricky ask in most hotels. Nothing was a problem with these guys. 

The staff were so nice and helpful, particularly in the restaurant where they had the colours and menus ready for the children before we arrived! The food was a really high standard, not what you'd expect from your usual hotel. Its perfect for families and I would also recommend to couples and solo travellers, this place is really special and you'll feel looked from the minute you arrive through the doors! 

 Looking forward to returning for a Christmas treat!",5,2021,10,06
237,Exceeded our expectations!!,We were finishing off a much needed mini break - Dublin was our last stop. We couldn’t have picked a better hotel! It’s easily one of the best hotels we’ve ever stayed at. We booked through ‘the big deal’ which I was lucky to see on Instagram a few days before. On arrival we were told that we’d been upgraded to a junior suite! A lovely surprise & an incredible room!! We had a beautiful meal in the restaurant - staff were very attentive & friendly. We enjoyed the Prosecco & then after a short walk were ended up in temple bar that night. Traffic may be busy in Dublin but the bed was very comfy & had a great nights sleep. Breakfast was lovely too & after another short walk we were very close to the main shopping area the next day. We were sad to leave and looking forward to returning soon!!,5,2021,10,04
237,Will not stay again,"I rarely write reviews and frequently use Hilton hotels, this was unusual. 

Room was with outdated bathroom and with malfunctioning almost everything. Outdated,with fading look, carpet. Poorly trained managing staff and many other things which made stay below average. Response to complaint was polite, but useless offer for better stay in the future. 

Stay away.",2,2021,10,02
237,Birthday Surprise,Stayed here as a birthday surprise and it was fantastic from start to finish !! From easy check in and some lovely warmed cookies we then had an amazing suite overlooking the Liffey. Some bubbles and chocolates were left in the room . The room was spotless and so modern. Loved the huge bathroom . We ordered room service and a lovely guy Dominic delivered it and was very friendly and courteous.  We had dinner in the hotel and it was fab excellent service and the barman even made me up a cocktail that wasn't on the menu . Everyone was friendly.  Dominic  was there again the following morning showing us to breakfast.  Nothing was a problem as I requested poached eggs instead of what was on offer . Definitely we will stay there again.  I believe Sarah helped my husband  plan the surprise so thank you .,5,2021,10,02
237,"Great package deal, lovely hotel","Great value with the Big Deal package, we stayed for 1 night and upgraded room which was spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The meal in the Morrison grill was excellent value and top marks to Patricia serving us! 

Great location in Dublin, only downside was the breakfast as only buffet available which was not so great, there was no offer of any of the offerings like porridge or pancakes etc as didn’t really want a Full Irish buffet breakfast as didn’t look very appetising!",4,2021,10,02
237,Tasty and immense,"Had an amazing meal on Saturday 25th September. Service was impeccable, bringing correct cutlery for the food ordered and remembering who ordered which meals, which was a pleasant touch. All team were smartly dressed and happy to oblige to any request, including adding broccoli to my fillet steak. The food was mouthwatering and professionally presented. Music added to the atmosphere and the buzz around the room was great to see given the past tough times.",5,2021,09,28
237,Our Perfect Day,"My husband and I got married at the Morrison Hotel in September 2021. We first visited the hotel in February 2020 and straight away we knew we would have our wedding there. From day one of the wedding planning we were looked after so well by Sarah. Due to Covid we had to reschedule our wedding and the Morrison were so helpful. On the day, Hugh and the service staff were so kind, accommodating and couldn't do more for us and our guests. The venue was so beautifully decorated and everything ran so well. The food was amazing and the rooms were so spacious and comfortable. The location could not have been better and we were able to get some amazing photos in the city we love. If we could do it all over again we would choose the Morrison again and wouldn't change a thing.",5,2021,09,25
237,Excellent,"Great property. Excellent service. Wonderful treatment my wife loved it. 
Especially the personnel. Professional at an extremely high level. Clean room.Close by parking. Easy access. Highly recommend. Would definitely stay again.  

",5,2021,09,22
237,"Great location, newer hotel decor and atmosphere","Stayed here at the end of a 2 week trip throughout Ireland.  The hotel is conveniently located near all the most popular spots throughout Dublin.  The rooms are nice, with modern decor.  There are A/C units in each room which is nice to have as the weather was unusually warm for September.  They have a buffet breakfast (free with Hilton Honors status) but you must book a time slot in advance.  They serve typical Irish breakfast items (eggs, bacon, sausage, mushrooms, potatoes, tomatoes, etc.) as well as cold items such as pastries and cereal.  The staff seems genuinely interested in making guests feel welcome and will try to assist in any way possible.  There was an event at the hotel while we were there (I think a wedding) which resulted in very loud music and party noises heard several floors up from the ground area until the wee hours which was frustrating if you were trying to sleep for events the next day.  Parking is off site but the hotel will validate so you get a reduced rate.  The only issue with this is there's no reception parking area at the hotel so if you have a significant amount of luggage to drop off it can become cumbersome to trek it across 2 blocks to the hotel.  The restaurant is nice and provides good dinner options if you want local fare without having to go far.  Overall a nice hotel and we would stay there again.",5,2021,09,19
237,Perfectly fine hotel !,"As someone who used to live in Dublin, I have a list of my favorite hotels, all south of the river. I needed to stay for 10 days this time so was looking for something a bit more affordable. This hotel was on the north side of the river and had good reviews but the photos of the suite I wanted made the rooms look old and worn out. Decided to go with the reviews and try it and I was not disappointed. The rooms are dated but clean, spacious and much better looking in real life. 

Easy stay, nice breakfast, kind staff, lots of cafes nearby. 
Would definitely again.",5,2021,09,18
237,Great hotel and service,"I came here to isolate after returning from South Africa and the hotel could not be better, as I was stuck in my room for 5 days they removed the tray charge for me and also anything I wanted they tried to cook.  Hotel room was clean and modern and only down side is at nights I didn’t want my air con on so opened window and fri and Sat nights a few drunken Irish people making noise… (I never knew Irish like to drink…lol).

Once isolation finished still couldn’t do enough to help. Breakfast was buffet or cooked and everyone worse masks and disposable gloves given out so no one touched the utensils and was Covid clean… 

I would like to thank the staff for making my stay an enjoyable one and hope to be back again soon.",5,2021,09,12
237,Another great stay at the Morrison!,"Thank you again The Morrison Hotel for another fabulous stay. We felt so very well looked after by your team. The accommodation was second to none. The food was divine and all those lovely little extra touches really do make all the difference. This is why we are return visitors and we will be back again soon!

The hotel is perfectly situation in the heart of Dublin city. A great base for visiting on a holiday. Lovely to stroll around the city to take in the vibe and then to be able to return to the comfort of the beautiful Morrison hotel is icing on the cake. The 'big deal' represents great value for money. We will be back to our second home very soon!

Sarah and Lynne.",5,2021,09,10
237,Great central location,"We stopped for one night as a layover from an early evening ferry arrival before starting an around Ireland tour the next morning. 

Location could not have been more central. Car park right next door with a good reduced subsidy after the hotel validated our ticket. 

Room was large and spacious and ok, we didn’t have a river view (but a wall of another building), but for one night was more than acceptable. 

2 minutes walk over the  bridge and you are in Temple Bar. 

We ate at an Italian Taverna next door to the hotel, good pizza and pasta. 

We have booked to stay over again at the end of our trip before joining the ferry back to Wales again.

Overall a pleasant stay, friendly staff and perfect location.",5,2021,09,09
237,Great stay,"Great location in the city centre. Close to Jervis shopping centre and the tram line. Overlooks the River Liffey and close to everything in the city centre. 

Very good staff all round. Felt very Covid safe with all wearing masks and lots of sanitisers around.

Food at the restaurant and in-room dining was excellent. Breakfast was very good. Large and well appointed rooms which were very clean and tidy.",5,2021,09,05
237,Great Hotel,"Really enjoyed our 2 night stay in the Morrison. All members of staff are pleasant and polite, food and drinks are of a high quality. Location of the hotel is great, very central, would have no hesitation booking/recommending this hotel to anyone.",5,2021,09,05
237,Fantastic stay in the heart of Dublin,Hard to fault anything with this hotel. Lovely big cosy room and the hotel really is beautifully designed. Fantastic quality food in the restaurant and the breakfast is exceptional. It really is located in the perfect spot for all things Dublin. Looking forward to staying again. ,5,2021,09,02
237,Nice Stay,"This is our second time staying at The Morrison Hote,  its a really great hotel in a great location 
The staff are always very pleasant, helpful, polite and nothing is too much trouble for them
We had a meal in the restaurant and the food was very nice, breakfast was good too and the service was very professional 
Our room was ok but we had a better room on our last visit, we stayed in room 308 the bed was very creaky and didnt feel stable but that was the only downside to our visit",4,2021,08,31
237,Luck of the Irish to stay at the Morrison,"We recently stayed 12 nights at the Morrison, a DoubleTree by Hilton and had a wonderful time.  It's an upscale, very stylish hotel with a friendly staff. Our room was very pleasant. Breakfast in the breakfast room (buffet or menu) was delicious and we could see Maryanna's smile although she wore a mask.  She was great and always there when we needed something. Deputy General Manager Rory Rooney also couldn't have been pleasanter or more helpful, answering many questions and always gracious and thoughtful. Also its location couldn't have been better, just across the Liffey from Temple Bar and very near the walking bridge. We really had a wonderful time. We also enjoyed several dinners in their dining room. It also was very clean.",5,2021,08,28
237,Look no further!,"If you are fortunate enough to have wandered upon this hotel, you should book immediately and spend the rest of your time planning the special things you want to do in Dublin! The front desk and restaurant staff are great and coming back to the Morrison each day will feel like home.  There are too many individuals to name that made my trip special and that is the sign of a perfect place to stay!",5,2021,08,24
237,Fantastic Stay in Ideal Location - Luxury in Dublin City Centre,"Visited with my friend in August 2021. We opted into ‘The Big Deal’ which included a room upgrade, Prosecco and chocolates, a three course meal and breakfast.

We had to wait a little bit after check in time for our room to be ready but this was no problem at all as we had left our bags in to the storeroom whilst we did some shopping. The staff were lovely and so polite.

The room itself was fabulous and so modern with all the amenities needed. Location was the best I had ever stayed in Dublin. So central but was really quiet as night to sleep too!

Food was excellent for both dinner and breakfast.

Overall we had a fantastic time and are already planning our next trip before Christmas!",5,2021,08,23
237,Excellent wedding receiption,"We had a wedding reception here towards the end of July.  From start to finish, the staff (Sarah, Simon, Hugh and the chef (the name escapes us)) were excellent, its very rare to find a team this capable, even in a five star hotel.  The food was of a very high standard, with a lot of attention to detail as we had some vegan guests in the group (including the bride) and they were very well catered for.  All our guests really enjoyed the day, and I would definitely recommend the Morrison as a venue for any couple planning a wedding reception.",5,2021,08,22
237,"Great location, great staff, wonderful lodging","I’ve stayed at The Morrison on several occasions, and have never been disappointed.  The staff is welcoming, the property is clean and comfortable.  The location gives easy access to the north or south sides of Dublin. ",5,2021,08,20
237,Highly recommend!,Great experience all around! From check in to concierge services to check out the entire staff was on fire! Cleanliness and attention to detail as well as adherence to Covid safety guidelines were a big concern for us coming in and they exceeded all expectations. ,5,2021,08,18
237,An amazing stay....,"Just back from an overnight stay in The Morrison and what an amazing stay. There was six of us and we were so well looked after. We availed of the overnight stay with dinner and prosseco and it was such a good deal. The food was amazing, we were still talking about it this morning while stuffing out faces with an equally gorgeous breakfast... We had a little bit of everything as I couldn't decide which option to go for off the menu and the guy (who's name I missed, apologies) said he'd bring a selection for us to share.  Only for the fact that a couple of us had work commitments tomorrow, we would have stayed an extra night... We're already talking about a return visit both as couples again and also as a girl's night!! You have amazing staff who could not have been any more helpful and attentive. The rooms were stunning and I was very tempted to take the pillow home with me!!  Looking forward to my next visit 😘",5,2021,08,16
237,Wonderful Wedding Venue,"We held our wedding reception at the Morrison hotel in August 2021.

We  don’t know where to begin with how fantastic our two days were. Not only did we feel so relaxed and taken care of, our friends and family had nothing but the highest of praise for everything- the food, the service and the quality of each aspect in the hotel was amazing. 

The fact that even in unprecedented circumstances, Sarah Glennon (our wedding coordinator) and the whole team at the Morrison put together the wedding of our dreams is incredible. I genuinely can’t fault a thing and am so thrilled! Sarah was one of the most professional people you could hope to meet and made sure everything went to plan (including last minute accommodation changes)

A special mention also to Hugh, Jacqueline and Simon on the Food and Beverage team, who provided excellent and friendly service throughout. 

Thanks a million to everyone at the Morrison and we can’t wait to stay again at the earliest possible opportunity.

Anna and Nick

237,FANTASTIC HOTEL,The stay in this hotel was nothing but great from start to finish. Check-In online so only had to spend 1min at reception. Room is very spacious and very modern. Walk In shower is great. Beds are very comfortable. Hotel location could not be better as you walk out and straight across the bridge to temple bar. You just have to pay for parking at 19euro but it’s next door in a multi story car park. Highly recommend for your stay in Dublin,5,2021,08,13
237,A perfect wedding day,"We chose The Morrison Hotel for our wedding reception back in Feb 2020. We had decided on City Hall for our ceremony, and were looking for something cool and simple for the reception. We visited a number of restaurants and event spaces in D2, all of which were incredibly expensive, and didn't seem to want to give us the time of day.  When we visited The Morrison Hotel, we knew straight away that it was the right place for us. From the layout of the hotel, the quality of service, and most of all, the pleasure of dealing with their Events Manager, Sarah - she really sold it for us.

We had our wedding reception this summer and we can honestly say it was the best day of our lives. Our family and friends were blown away by The Morrison. The food is still a topic of discussion today - it was amazing. The service, both at the reception (Thank you Hugh) and across the weekend (Thank you Mariana), was exceptional. The staff couldn't do enough for us. The space itself, with the separate entrance, courtyard and reception room, made us feel safe (from a covid perspective) and private. You would never think you were in the middle of Dublin City.

We cannot thank the staff at The Morrison Hotel enough for making our wedding day so wonderful. If you are thinking of getting married in Dublin City, please consider this hotel for your reception. You will not regret it!",5,2021,08,11
237,Check in delay,"We had a lovely stay at the Morrison but the 2 hour delay at check in was disappointing. The problem is that breakfast finishes at 12 and check out is at 12 so the turnaround time for the new arrivals is not enough with covid restrictions, there should be a late checkout to compensate for the 2hr lost.",3,2021,08,10
237,Short break,"Hotel is fabulous ,facilities are spotless. Staff were extremely welcoming and very helpful. Rory and patrijca were particularly friendly and chatty. Our room was fabulous and had everything we could ask for. Loved the walk in shower. The food was amazing and the fish pie is highly recommended, breakfast was excellent. As Dubliners in our own city it was a great base from which to explore the culture and relax. We will be back.",5,2021,07,28
237,Excellent a must visit 5 star service,"Stayed here with my sister for 1 night . Firstly they have covid regulations 100% . Spot on we both felt so safe . The customer service is 5 star , from start to finish in all areas of the hotel . The food in the bar was amazing and cooked to perfection , prawns were perfect . Breakfast was different with covid restrictions , but also perfect , coffee so so nice . Patrick the Manager , took time to ask about our stay and welcomed us in person , what a touch .I don’t no how they did it they had a private venue the same night a wedding , we saw the bride , that was it we heard nothing at all , now that’s rare . Patrick obviously runs a smooth perfect Hotel I have to say I will defiantly go back , 
Thank you to all the staff

237,Fantastic.,"Visiting for 2 nights with my girlfriend to celebrate our anniversary. Cannot recommend the place enough. Location is absolutely perfect your beside absolutely everything. Staff couldn’t be more helpful. Service in the bar and restaurant was second to none. Food was gorgeous and plenty to chose from too, huge cocktail menu. The Guinness was gorgeous too definitely the best I’ve ever had from a hotel.",5,2021,07,15
237,Reunion  Celebrations,"A fabulous experience to celebrate being reunited with my sisters at the Morrisson Hotel.  Service was excellent from the moment we got to the hotel until we left.    We enjoyed the chilled Prosecco in our wonderful room ( included in our ""big deal"") while we were catching up and getting ready for dinner.   Before dinner we had delicious cocktails in the Quay bar.  Our dinner   in the Morrisson Grill was amazing and we were  looked after very well by Derek and his team.   My sisters tried the scallops and the goats cheese starters but I couldn't wait to try the prawn pil pil  and it did not disappoint.  We all ate fish for mains and there wasn't a morsel left behind.   We had a late breakfast after some early morning shopping on Henry Street.  The breakfast team were very friendly and  the eggs benedict was to die for.   Thanks all we will definitely return.  ",5,2021,07,13
237,"Centrally located, lovely staff.","Availed of the big deal for a midweek treat, we had already stayed two nights in dublin at a different hotel and fancied a change of scenery for the last night and chose the Morrison. Got lovely cookies on check in, room was fab, very quiet on 4th floor. Ate dinner, Patricia and Rory were lovely and couldn’t do enough, the younger guy that seated us was rude, stand offish and didn’t explain anything. I was thankful he wasn’t our server. Breakfast was ok, the pastries are a nice treat. But I was served a jam that had already been used and both of our eggs were over cooked. My partner removed the hard yolks from her poached eggs and just ate the white and I left my scrambled egg completely. Other than the overcooked eggs, used jam (if it wasn’t a mini one serving pot of jam, I wouldn’t have Been so disgusted) and the rude younger waiter at the restaurant, I think the big deal is great value and worth trying.",4,2021,07,07
237,Date Night,"We have just finished our stay in The Morrison Hotel after availing of the Big Deal Offer. I couldn’t recommend the hotel or this deal highly enough. From the moment we arrived the service and staff have been amazing. 
On check in we were upgraded and presented with delicious cookies.  Our dinner which was part of the offer was fantastic. The scallop starter was so tasty I will definitely be coming back to have it again. A special thanks to Simon and the Chef who went out of their way to ensure I got bread at start of meal and a dessert at the end when I couldn’t have the items on the menu. 
We felt very comfortable throughout the whole stay with the hotel practicing all the recommended precautions but incredibly still providing friendly attentive service at all times. Breakfast was another example of this where Marianne brought milk for our cereal before we could ask and took the time for a laugh and a chat.",5,2021,07,04
237,Brilliant,"Spent three days at The Morrison last week with my wife. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Food is magnificent and staff are brilliant. I asked for an upgrade and got a junior suite at a very small cost. 
There is an arrangement with the public car park which is next door (€19 per day), which is handy.
Excellent location also. Stay here!",5,2021,07,04
237,Excellent Morrison Stay,"Myself and 3 friends decided to book 2 rooms for a night as a treat away (even though we just live down the road) and what a night of luxury. We had an early check in, Prosecco on arrival, little before dinner cocktail and the most delicious 3 course dinner. We were looked after so well by the staff, who were super friendly and professional during this pandemic. They were all happy to be back working and there was such a positive atmosphere around the hotel.
Special thanks to Jaqueline who served dinner on the Saturday and Dominic, nothing was to much for these guys

The staff were so friendly and attentive and the room was lovely and spacious. We ate in the restaurant for our evening meal which was delicious. The food was really tasty, as were the cocktails!!

The breakfast was delicious and plentiful.

237,"Wonderful, friendly and a little bit of luxury","Stayed for 2 nights recently and can only say cannot wait to go back. Stayed with interconnecting rooms, and the whole trip was amazing. The food was brilliant, Breakfast, lunch and dinner all had in the hotel but the overall take was the staff. From the moment Edit checked us in to Patrycia's patience in the restaurant. I didnt catch the girl who served us breakfast both mornings but she was so lovely and helpful. Even as we were leaving catching Rory, cannot speak highly enough of the whole team. 

We will be seeing you all very soon. ",5,2021,06,25
237,Another fantastic stay,"Stayed for the 3rd time recently on the Big Deal package and had an amazing night. What a fantastic hotel. Location in Dublin City centre is ideal! The hotel itself is amazing...so clean, modern etc. From the moment we arrived staff were brilliant. Value for money on the Big Deal is unbelievable. From fabulous rooms, to gorgeous food for dinner and breakfast. Honestly couldn't recommend it enough and we will definitely be back.

237,The hotel and staff are 10/10! ⭐️,"Stayed in Twins Room and planned the perfect city break with “The Big Deal package.” The manager and the team provide top quality service and professionalism. 

The package offers a three meal course. The presentation of the food is stunning, and food was delicious, especially the Chocolate Fondant with pistachio ice-cream 😁

237,Great stay - location can’t be beaten for shopping and temple bar,"Stayed here on 2nd June with a friend for some shopping . We’re not into  the nightlife of temple bar but if you are it’s literally just across the bridge . 
Shopping was great as it’s about a minute walk to Henry street which has all the high street shops plus Arnotts ( I love this department store !) . A five minute walk  over the bridge gets you to Grafton street and Brown  Thomas  . We booked ‘the big deal’ which was €199 for dinner bed and breakfast - incredible value . We added afternoon tea for €49. We had some nice wine and a few cocktails that evening which brought our bill to €340 so @ €170 each that was money well spent and so enjoyable -. 
Room was perfect , couldn’t fault it . 
Food was very good and the service was above and beyond what we expected - absolutely faultless - I stayed in the merrion the following night and while it was lovely there I must say the service in the Morrison was a lot better . 
The manager approached us on leaving to tell us that we were welcome back to use the facilities / have a coffee or lunch as they were holding our bags until the afternoon and were therefore still guests of the hotel  . ( this was great as there’s still no indoor dining in Dublin due to Covid ) We’ve never felt so well ‘looked after ‘ . 
Highly recommended .",5,2021,06,15
237,Girls night away,"Just came back from the big deal at the Morrison. It was a fantastic package and everything from the room to the staff and service was excellent. The breakfast was amazing and served by lovely staff.
 The only thing I would say is that as a vegetarian there was only one option for starters and main course for dinner at the morrison grill which was a pity. But I'd definitely go back and highly recommend it",5,2021,06,13
237,Great City hotel,"Stayed Sunday night on the Big deal package. The hotel is in the heart of the city and close to all the attractions of Dublin City. It’s a beautiful hotel and the staff are superb.
Our room was excellent and we got a free upgrade which was nice. Highly recommend this hotel",4,2021,06,10
237,Fabulous,"Just returned from a one night stay. We have stayed in the past but, as always, our visit was superb. The staff are absolutely fantastic, they are so welcoming and can’t do enough for you. James was so helpful through the booking process and Rory who looked after breakfast. There was also a Fantastic lady who served us in the restaurant and bar but whose name I did not get. We ate  in the restaurant and the food was just divine, I can’t fault it. We booked the “big deal”, the room was lovely. My only regret is that we didn’t book a 2nd night! Cannot wait to return in July.",5,2021,06,06
237,Wonderful ,"We grabbed the opportunity as 6 old school friends in our 50’s to book the party night the Saturday before Christmas and before hard lockdown. 
Check in was 2pm but we couldn’t go to our rooms until 5pm which was no trouble for us as we sat in the bar drinking delicious cocktails until we were called.  We had a bottle of Prosecco in our room and Thornton chocolate.  Our three course meal was incredibly good.  I had scallops, surf and turf (didn’t need a knife to cut my 🥩) and delicious dessert all wonderful. 
Breakfast was incredibly generous. The staff were attentive, friendly as fab could not recommend The Morrison highly enough. ",5,2021,01,01

237,Perfect Break,"We looked forward to a short break in the city centre in a quality hotel that offered good value. Our choice of the Morrison Hotel worked out perfectly. Relaxed, friendly, and excellent food in a very comfortable setting so close to city centre attractions but not close to any noisy venues.
It was perfect !

237,Excellent Hotel,"Well what can I say from the time we arrived in reception it was lovely. The check in was swift and off to our rooms! The rooms were so spacious and absolutely spotless had everything we needed & the bathroom was so nice. We didn’t want to leave the room. 
We are in Quay 14 and found the service excellent and the food quality to a high standard and was so nice to be able to sit in a bar have a few drinks and catch up with friends before Christmas. I was really impressed with  all the covid protocols the hotel have in place as every surface was clean and it felt so relaxing for us not having to think about these protocols being adhered to.. 
Overall we had a fabulous stay and would stay again to have a catch up with friends when we get through all this. ",5,2020,12,15
237,Blew me away - 10 stars all the way. Overnight staycation in Dublin,"After restrictions lifted we booked into the Morrison for a treat and oh my lord what a treat it was! We are local and live only 3K from the hotel but it felt just as much a holiday as going anywhere else. From the time we arrived to the time we left, we were blown away with the quality of service, drinks and food not to mention the covid safety which was apparent at every point of our stay but not intrusive as to detract from the overall experience. I will start with the bedroom, most important for me is a comfortable bed and a great nights sleep. The mattress was perfect, pillows were out of this world. What I noticed but had not ever considered before in a hotel - was the quality of the towels in the bathroom. They were not like the normal thin ones, but real fluffy and high quality. Room & en-suite were to very high standards. Our package included Prosecco in the room which was a real treat before we went down to dinner. We had a cocktail before dinner in the lounge area, very safe - tables well spread but enough to have a great atmosphere. I recommend trying the pornstar martini. The dinner menu exceeded my expectations (I thought hotel set menus would be a bit blah but how wrong was I!) I opted for goats cheese salad which was top drawer, the caramelised wallnuts elevated the dish exquisitely. For mains I had the Surf and Turf. The beef had been slow braised and was simply melt in the mouth and the garlic butter was just perfect on the generously sized prawns. I'm still dreaming about the breakfast the next morning, I went for the full Irish breakfast and the waiter was extra attentive to ensure we were safe but could still have the experience of the buffet breakfast. We had orange juice and pastries and a few cups of coffees, it was a most pleasurable way to round off our overnight stay. I rarely leave reviews but The Morrison blew me away. I would highly recommend checking in here. Room 10/10, Dinner 10/10, Breakfast 10/10. I'd nearly go. back just to sleep on those pillows alone! Sarah Glennon looked after our booking and she was fantastic to deal with. I can't remember the name of the waiter who served us for breakfast but he went over and beyond and was just fantastic. Highly Recommend.",5,2020,12,08
237,Excellent,"Stayed with my Husband and friends as a treat on ""the big deal"" promotion.  Absolutely fantastic value. Mentioned when booking it was our friends birthday and there was a lovely greeting in his room and a treat after dinner. Such a nice touch! The Staff throughout the Hotel are so courteous and friendly, they go out of their way to be helpful. The food in the restaurant was top class and we felt completely safe in our own little bubble. The Hotel is so stylishly decorated for Christmas, it really added to the atmosphere. The rooms were really modern yet so comfortable and spotless. We're normally running to breakfast at the last minute but the late breakfast at 11.30 was such a bonus. Allowed us to enjoy a lie in and get ready at our leisure. Enjoyed our stay so much, will definitely be back. From start to finish we could not fault anything about our stay.",5,2020,12,06
237,A Comfortable Stay in a Great Location!,"A hotel right in city center on the River Liffey. What could be better?! We stayed here 3 nights over St Patrick's Day in 2020 and the stay did not disappoint. We loved being a 10 minute walk from a lot Dublin, and having the LUAS (Dublin's tram system) right at the end of the street. This made getting anywhere in the city and beyond quick and easy. We booked a basic room with a view over the River Liffey. The room itself was a bit on the small side and would not be great if you were traveling with two adults and children, but it was fine for just the two of us. We were even surprised at how quiet our room was, even with a busy street right below our window. We also appreciate how attentive the staff was in answering our questions and making sure the hotel was disinfected regularly during the pandemic. We will definitely be staying here again on our next trip to Dublin! ",5,2020,11,30
237,10/10 stay!,"Everything about my stay was perfect. Maria on the front desk, the guys working in the bar, Marianna in the dining room at breakfast - all offered superb service and went above and beyond to make sure I was well looked after. I will definitely be recommending the hotel to friends and family and hopefully I’ll be back to stay again in the future :)",5,2020,10,17
237,Anniversary ,"Big Thanks to Ana from the bar at Morrison, it was our 1 anniversary and she gave us the best service in town plus a surprise from her own initiative( well done Ana ! ) , the food was very delicious and I totally recommend this place. 5 star ! We will be back !",5,2020,10,17
237,Wonderful Stay at the Morrison,"I recently stayed at the Morrison for their fantastic offer 'the big deal'.
The staff were so friendly and professional. The food was sublime. The atmosphere was brilliant. Attention to detail was particularly good. The room was gorgeous and spotless clean. I have only positive things to say about the place. They did all the right things for health and safety measures. I will definitely be returning.

It was so lovely to be in the centre of the city, doing a bit of window shopping on Grafton Street and then returning to such a lovely hotel for a great meal and a few drinks. It was particularly appreciated in these uncertain times. 

Thank you to the Morrison for making the stay so special. We were celebrating my sisters birthday. It was just the two of us but you made it a night to remember.

Sarah :)",5,2020,10,07
237,Luxury Stay,"My hubby and I stayed in the Morrison Hotel last weekend for one night, from the moment we booked in, ( we were handed hot cookies) to the time we left on a late checkout we were treated like royalty, the staff were so attentive, friendly and all queries were dealt with. The bed room was pristine, so modern, we didn't hear a pin drop. we had dinner in the Grill, it was 5 star quality, we will be back.",5,2020,10,05
237,An truly unforgettable experience,"My wife and I stayed in the Morrison over the weekend, to surprise a good friend on his birthday and we had the most amazing experience. From a personalised greeting by Piotr on reception upon arrival, to the exceptional standards set by General Manager Derek, we were left pampered. He has a natural gift to make you feel special; a class act. The rooms were immaculately kept and the bed extremely comfortable. The space afforded to us during our time in the bar and dining areas, made us feel so at ease in the current climate. The food quality in the restaurant was of the highest standard, with recommendations from Derek to be exactly what we were looking for. They also catered for my wife's specific requests, as she was vegetarian this can be a nightmare; Derek provided  a number of options available, one more delectable than the last. Can I also recommend the whiskey sours crafted by Simon and his team, they are just a little bit of heaven. This was all delivered with live music in the background, which was a real surprise and an absolute treat in these times. This is all set a stones throw from the main streets in Dublin. We cannot wait to go back to this 5 star service",5,2020,10,01
237,Wedding Reception 👰🤵,"There are not enough adjectives to describe our experience at our daughter's wedding on Saturday 26th of September in The Morrison Hotel.

The professionalism, courtesy and care shown to The Bride and Groom and all our families was phenomenal.
From the minute we stepped through the doors of our OWN entrance, to a whole section of the hotel reserved SOLELY for the wedding party, until the end of the day, we were treated like royalty by each and everyone of the staff. The food, ambience and amazing care and attention to detail was so lovely. I can't thank them enough for the most  Beautiful Day.

Special Gratitude to Marian, Rory and Hugh and all the team who supported  the happy couple throughout the last few months. You are all TRULY AMAZING!! Thank you. X Gina",5,2020,09,28
237,Fantastic hotel,"One of the best hotels I have ever been to! The staff were so friendly and helpful and the room was beautiful and clean. We felt very safe and Covid regulations were being followed. Highly recommend, it was such a treat",5,2020,09,21
237,An Amazing City Break,"I had am amazing stay in The Morrison last weekend. The staff looked after us so well and I was blown away by how safe we felt. The bedroom door even had a ""safety seal"". I have not seen this before. The room was modern, funky, had amazing lighting, and was so comfortable. We had breakfast delivered to our room on Sunday morning. I have to say that it was one of the best ever hotel breakfasts. Thanks to all the amazing staff",5,2020,09,18
237,Good stay ruined by swarms of people not wearing masks,"There was a wedding in the hotel on the Saturday when we stayed and all of these guests were swarming around the public areas of the hotel proudly declaring that they were not wearing masks. They also all piled into the small lifts, no masks. This was not helped by reception staff on check in not wearing masks. They are behind Perspex, but not all the time, and it sets a really bad example. We did not feel safe in public areas of the hotel.  Consequently we took the fire escape stairs to descend from floor 3 to avoid the drunk non mask wearing wedding party, and none of the landing are marked to indicate what floor you’re on. Good luck in the event of a fire. 

Booked room for2, only one bathrobe in room. Had to wait behind a couple at check in for ages while they transferred funds around their own bank accounts delaying all other people. Then to hear the receptionist give them a complementary upgrade. No such upgrades for the people stuck behind them for a long time.

Other aspects of the hotel were good - room was quiet, clean, room service for drinks was quick. Water pressure in shower was good.",3,2020,09,15
237,Weekend in Morrison,"Just settling back after super weekend break in this wonderful hotel. Although a really cool place the staff bring it to the next level, Rory, Giovanna and everyone else we encountered over the 2 days could not have done more for us and were really top class.
Food, rooms and general hotel experience up there with the best places we have stayed. Great deal going on and well worth checking out. Thanks so much for a brilliant weekend to all at the Morrison. Hope to get back soon.",5,2020,09,13
237,Afternoon Tea,"Beautiful location. Impeccable cleanliness.
Superb service from all waiters, very attentive.
 Presentation of food was beautiful, it was fresh, tasty & a lovely selection.
 Well done to The Morrison.
We’ll be back to try the Gentlemen’s Tea (it looked lovely too)",5,2020,09,13
237,Great hotel,"Stayed for their special deal overnight with dinner , Prosecco and late checkout . It was my daughters birthday . I told them when I booked and not only did they remember and leave a small birthday cake in the room for her but they brought a birthday dessert complete with candle to the table when we went for dinner . The room was so clean . Staff very helpful and friendly . Really great value for money in the heart of Dublin . We will be back ",5,2020,09,13
237,Our stay,"Stayed in the Morrison for 2 nights BBD, from the moment we arrived until the day we checked out we could not fault the hotel & staff, with current Covid restrictions I was apprehensive about going away but the hotel has so well managed the change in regulations, plenty to do and see around the city also.",5,2020,09,10
237,A perfect stay at the Morrison ,"We stayed at the Morrison hotel for 2 nights from sat 29th Aug. Upon arrival we were greeted by the warm and welcoming receptionist Giovanna. And some delicious warm cookies! We were staying on “the big deal offer” got  upgraded and booked our dinner for that evening ( which is included in this offer) the room is spacious , modern and extremely clean! That night we had dinner in the restaurant , the food was beautiful and a wide range of choices . A 3 course meal was included in our stay and all 3 courses were delicious. It was my partners birthday and I had let the hotel know and we received a birthday dessert in our room which was a lovely touch and much appreciated. The next morning we had breakfast , we both went for the full cooked breakfasts due to Covid you choose what you like from buffet but it’s plated by a staff member. The breakfast was lovely , especially the white pudding! Our waitress was particularly fantastic , very welcoming and nothing too much trouble ( can’t remember her name sorry but she was fab) we had breakfast the second morning also but this time I had french toast bacon and maple syrup , and it was the nicest I had ever had . You must get it !!! The only negative we had was we found the room to be very cold . Especially the bathroom . We should have brought this to their attention on first day but I really hate to complain . After a cold night I decided to mention this on Sunday morning to Giovanna she apologised and sent someone to our room straight away with a heater . They explained their rooms are still set to summer temperatures at the min so couldn’t be altered which was unfortunate as the heater heated the bedroom but was still way too cold when in bathroom . I had such an amazing stay and the staff went above and beyond this minor complaint would not deter me from returning . I loved everything about this hotel , the staff are amazing at their jobs and make you feel so welcome. The food is delicious ( see pics )  and the rooms are clean and modern . Every part of the hotel is cleaned to the highest standard and we felt extremely safe with all Covid regulations they had put in place . I would love to return to this hotel in the near future . It’s the perfect location to explore the city and you would really struggle to find a better hotel . Well done to the Morrison hotel , you are doing an amazing job thank you for a wonderful much needed break! ",5,2020,09,10
237,Afternoon Tea,"We had an amazing visit for afternoon tea this weekend. We were greeted by a lovely member of staff who looked after us so well through out our visit. The food was delishes, the service was amazing and the covid precautions made everyone feel very safe. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to get out and spend time in a relaxing , stress free environment ",5,2020,09,07
237,Great hotel with perfect location,"My husband and I spent 3 nights here. The hotel is lovely, with nice sized rooms and is super clean. We were also offered fresh cookies on arrival which was a nice touch. We also visited the hotel bar for a few drinks which had a nice atmosphere to it.",5,2020,09,07
237,Gentlemen’s afternoon Tea.,Every year for our wedding anniversary we do afternoon tea. I decided this year to surprise my husband with the gentleman’s afternoon tea. I have to say it was fantastic. I thought I would miss out on having a fancy afternoon tea but this was 100% better than expected. Staff were helpful and friendly without being rushed. Would definitely go back for both fancy pants and gentleman’s afternoon tea. ,5,2020,08,29
237,Wonderful Service in a relaxed environment!,"Visited here for some food and drinks with friends. Cocktails were really good and the service was excellent, friendly and prompt. Very clean environment and we felt quite relaxed considering the current climate and restrictions.",4,2020,08,23
237,Amazing stay at the Morrison,"We booked the Big Deal, one night stay in the Morrison, included Prosecco  and chocolates in the room , dinner and breakfast. We arrived in the hotel and were greeted by the lovely Giovanna, she was so friendly and welcoming, offered us cookies on arrival. Our room was  upgraded, lovely huge bed, water in the room and spotlessly clean, big shower, everything you need. We went for dinner and again the staff were so friendly, food was beautiful and really flavoursome, cocktail menu great and the cocktail Dark Rosaleen was delicious. Breakfast in the morning was nice, our server Myriana could not do enough for us and again so friendly. There is not one thing i would change about our stay and we did not think about COVID once! It felt normal. Another thing that i want to mention, its lovely how the staff wear see through face shields rather than masks, great to see facial expressions, it makes a difference",5,2020,08,23
237,The Big Deal Stay ❤️,"We booked ‘The Big Deal’ stay at The Morrison as a first adventure out of hiding in the house for months.

It’s only a 15 minute walk from the train station and we also went to visit the zoo which was around a 35 minute walk from the hotel too! It’s literally opposite the famous temple bar area and everything is super central. 

Check in was quick, informative and helpful.

We booked a river view room and it didn’t disappoint. With a bottle of Prosecco in our room along with complimentary water and fluffy bathrobes. 

The room was absolutely spotless, the bed was super comfortable, the bathroom was nicely decorated and the shower was amazing ☺️

We had dinner on the first night as part of the deal and assumed it was going to be a very limited menu, but we were wrong. There was so many choices on the menu, the food was absolutely beautiful, it was the best stew I’ve ever had.

Our cocktails were wonderfully presented and tasted amazing. The menu for the drinks will easily cater for anyone and every one!

Breakfast was also fantastic. Shoutout to the gentleman who served us on both mornings as he was really helpful, incredibly friendly and was lovely to have a chat with. He’s definitely a credit to the already wonderful hotel ☺️

Thanks for making our stay so comfortable, safe and relaxing. We’ll come back soon! 

PS I took some photos of the amazing breakfast, dinner and drinks but it doesn’t really do it all justice tbh.

",5,2020,08,20
237,Excellent Hotel with the service to back it up.,"My wife, daughter & I recently stayed at the Morrison hotel after the Covid19 restrictions were lifted for Dublin. The service, check-in, and cleanliness of the hotel were so impressive. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking to stay in the heart of Dublin who wants good food, customer service, at great prices. 

Well done to the team on what they do each day. See you all again very soon. 

Kind Regards, 

David Clarke.",5,2020,08,17
237,Had a fabulous time on The Big Deal offer!,"We went for the Big Deal offer which includes dinner bed and breakfast as well as a bottle of prosecco on arrival! Such good value for what comes with it, especially the 3-course dinner and breakfast. Very handy especially with the new government guidelines as it made us feel safer and we didn't even have to leave the hotel because everything we needed was there! Would defo recommend for couples or a girls trip as we had a fabulous experience, not to mention the friendly staff who took the necessary precautions for cleanliness in both the dining area and our room! Great little hotel for a stress-free getaway",5,2020,08,15
237,Lovely stay ,"I booked the Big Deal after hearing the promotion on 2FM. It is good value and we really enjoyed our stay. The staff were great, the hotel felt very clean, spacious and covid compliant. The menu that was included in the deal offered a good variety of options and the food was delicious. A special mention for Derek and David in the bar/restaurant who provided great service. We didn’t leave the hotel as we just wanted to relax and enjoy a quiet break but the hotel is in a great location to explore the city. ",5,2020,08,15
237,Weekend Away treat.,"Lovely modern hotel. Great location. Staff super helpful & friendly - A special shout out to Derek and Gem in the bar / restaurant for their warm hospitality.

237,"Excellent covid precautions, top class stay","The Morrison really is a five star hotel in my opinion. I've visited on many occasions for dinner and afternoon tea but never stayed over before. We decided to visit as we had seen online the safety precautions the hotel was taking for covid, and I knew from previous visits how amazing the food was. The location is top class, right in the centre of town and near all the shops. Parking was very handy, just down the road from the hotel with a discounted rate. 

We stayed for two nights, and had breakfast and dinner in the hotel too. The room was lovely, spotlessly clean, very modern and comfortable, and the extra covid precautions were obvious including alcohol wipes in the room. We were lucky enough to be treated to some extra treats as we were celebrating a special occasion, and we're given prosecco in the restaurant as well as a dessert plate in the room which was so lovely. The breakfast was delicious, table service and well spaced out. Allergies and dietary requirements very well catered for. Dinner was fabulous, really excellent quality and brilliant service. 

What really made our stay was the staff in the Morrison. Piotr gave us such a warm welcome to the hotel, and Derek and Marianna were both lovely at breakfast, excellent service and both so lovely, warm and kind. The staff in the Morrison couldn't do enough for us. We didn't have any issues at all but I'd be confident if we did they would have been dealt with straight away. We're now planning to visit on a more regular basis and really commend the staff on a wonderful experience. I have a heart condition and have been cocooning, so this was my first trip out, and I couldn't have felt safer. Thank you!",5,2020,08,08

Will most certainly do it again.",5,2020,07,31
237,Great city break hotel,"I booked in a one night stay in a King Deluxe Room on 25th July with my girlfriend for her birthday and mentioned this.

I would like to thank the entire team who made this special occassion possible from the receptionist, the cleaners and the bar staff. Keep doing what you're doing!",5,2020,07,28

237,Little paradise in city centre,"Hmmm where to start. From amazing service on front desk where you even get hot delicious chocolate chip cookie. To the room that is amazing. Huge bed, georgeus bathroom. View on Liffey. Bathrobes, slippers, coffee provided. Room service if needed.
Morrison grill is again amazing place to have a dinner or lunch. Staff so friendly and want to give also special recognision to Josh who was taking care of us during dinner.

237,Absolutely Superb Midweek Break,"We decided to hit Dublin, do some shopping but primarily meet up with our son to celebrate with him his acceptance into Medical College. 
Having heard so many great things about The Morrison in Dublin we made our reservation to arrive mid-afternoon the following day.
From check-in to check-out this was pound-for-pound one of the best hotel stays we have ever experienced!
Not only is The Morrison a beautiful hotel ,gorgeously designed and our room immaculately clean (their Hilton Cleanstay procedures have to be seen to be believed!), it is the staff at this hotel who really made our stay a memorable one.
We made dinner reservations at The Grill and had a marvelous evening on what turned out to be Steak Night. The quality of steak we enjoyed at The Grill would seriously rival similar upmarket dedicated US Steakhouses.
Again brilliant restaurant staff for dinner and breakfast made us feel so very welcome. 
Congratulations to General Manager Patrick Joyce and his staff for maintaining massive standards of Service & Hospitality in the most challenging of times!
This is a 10/10 experience. 
We will be back!

237,Simply amazing,"Stayed in the Morrison for two nights last week and I can’t speak highly enough about my stay. From Giovanna on reception who upon arrival made me feel at home. Checking in with me throughout the day seeing was there anything extra she could do to improve my stay even further. She really went above and beyond. The breakfast the two mornings were of the highest quality both fresh and healthy. David was so polite and cared for our needs. My girlfriend is a vegetarian and advised her on her options, she got the vegan breakfast with an added poached egg and she said it was the nicest breakfast she ever had. David was such a gentleman and full of chat too. The hotel itself was spotless with sanitisers located throughout the hotel and social distancing guidelines in place. Can see they really prioritise the health and safety of not only the guests but their staff too. Our room was beautiful, it was very spacious with a modern bathroom on top of an amazing view of the River Liffey. All in all I would say it is right up there as one of the best hotels I’ve stayed in and would have no problem recommending it to family and friends. Be back here very soon for sure.",5,2020,07,21
237,Fabulous Meal,"So happy we chose the Morrison Grill for our first post lockdown night out.  Service was amazing from the time we arrived until the moment we left.  Particular shout out to Derek who looked after us so well.   The hotel itself is stylish with much attention to detail and after such a long time home we really felt that we were ""out out"".   There is good distance between tables which made us feel very safe.  It was difficult to choose from the menu as there were so many delicious options.  The food looked stunning on the plate and the taste did not dissappoint.  Will definitely be back. ",5,2020,07,19
237,family break in dublin,"We are a family of 5, and we stayed in the Morrison hotel on the 8 july for short break in Dublin. From the moment we entered the hotel the front desk team made us feel most welcome, and relaxed.There were alot of new safety measures, but the lobby smelled amazing and so calming, we knew we were in good hands. We had a suite over looking the river, again discrete safety measures noted, but this made me feel very safe.
We ate dinner in the restaurant and were looked after by Josh and David. The food was great, and the kids were so excited to design their own ice creams! We had an amazing sleep, and breakfast the next morning was amazing. 
all in all a great trip, very relaxing and highly recommended.",5,2020,07,15

237,Miss ,"Always have a wonderful time when I stay in this hotel, the staff are absolutely amazing. They explained the “new normal” and how things would operate going forward. Jacqline & Simon from F&B wore absolutely amazing, they wore able to distance themselves yet still engage with us. There was also a girl behind the bar Russian I think, she made the BEST drinks for us, she was so polite & really made an effort to ensure we had everything we wanted. The rooms wore so clean & cozy, the stickers on the door are a great touch.   ",5,2020,07,12

237,Staff make stay welcoming,"From the moment we got to the hotel we were greeted by the most helpful staff assisting us to show us where to park our car. 
In the reception checking in,the staff made it a real warm welcome. The hotel itself had a modern feel to it and the smell around the hotel was so refreshing, really clean.
We were there for my wifes birthday, the staff again surprised us with their need to please, we werent even in to our room 5minutes and we got a knock at the door with some nice treats for her, brownie points!
Later that night after being in town we arrived back to our room to find more treats had been left for her, this was outstanding service. 
Breakfast next morning is a must! The food that is served there is top notch! The staff again making sure you're well looked after.
I was that impressed with the hotel I decided we would have dinner in it, food again was superb. Bar staff were all friendly and welcoming too.
Location is perfect for nightlife only a stone throw away from Temple bar and main strip of bars and restaurants. 
I honestly couldn't fault anything about the hotel, it's perfect for a wee break in Dublin. The rooms were kept spotless and the hotel itself was spotless, the staff and management should be proud of themselves they're doing a great job at providing one of the best services I've had in a long time, I highly recommend the Morrison and look forward to having another stay in it 
Thank you again",5,2020,03,15
237,The Best Hotel in Dublin!,"My husband and I have stayed in the Morrison for all of our trips to Dublin--this most recent trip was our 4th stay.  You can't beat the location and the staff is truly exceptional.  This trip I brought my brother, sister, father, and spouses.  We had an incredible time and are grateful to the Morrison staff for their hospitality.",5,2020,03,12
237,Highly recommended - great staff and accommodations.,"My wife and I stayed at the Morrison recently on our trip into Ireland. I am a Diamond Hilton Honors member and have stayed in many Hilton hotels over the years. This stay was, hands down, one of the best experiences. First, the staff was very welcoming and worked hard to make our stay great. They didn't do anything necessarily over the top, but their attention to the details were what mattered. The room as very spacious and well designed. The location within Dublin was awesome as well and made it very easy for us to get around. If you find your way to Dublin, I strongly urge you to book a room.",5,2020,03,09
237,Outstanding Hotel - One of Best Hilton's I've Stayed At,"I'd highly recommend this property for many reasons, foremost is the amazing staff - friendly, courteous, happy to answer questions and make sure you have a great time in Dublin.

The rooms are very modern and nice, the breakfast was great and free for Hilton Gold members.  The bar area of the hotel was really neat and always had a lot of people and good atmosphere.

Thanks to the hotel for making it a great trip to Dublin!",5,2020,03,09
237,"Perfect, hated to leave!","Stayed here for 5 nights for a conference at trinity college. The hotel was perfect, lovely room, immaculate, huge comfortable bed, Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries. The staff were terrific, always checking to see if everything was ok, and helping with info on tours and things to do. The location is perfect, just a few minutes walk from temple bar and 10 minutes walk from the college and grafton street. Suggest splurging on a river view room. Breakfast was very good, lots of choices. The french toast seemed to be yesterday's bread, but really can't complain. We received complimentary drink at the bar as Hilton honors members and had a very good meal at the grill, yummy curry and burger and outstanding sundae. The worst part was having to leave!",5,2020,03,08
237,Amazing and Accommodating Service!,"We arrived from the US on an overnight flight that came in at 6AM. We came right to the hotel to check our bags and put in for an early check in, understanding that it was well before the normal check in time. The hotel was tremendous in getting us into a room after our flight and providing us with great service overall. We would highly recommend staying here as you can easily walk the city to see many of the attractions! ",5,2020,03,07
237,Out of this world!,We were given a voucher as a wedding present and when we arrived we were greeted by warm cookies and a drinks voucher because we had signed up to the hilton honours. Upon checking in we were informed that we had been upgraded to the penthouse. This has been the most amazing experience we have encountered anywhere we have stayed. The sheer luxury of the penthouse alongside the view made this the most wonderful stay! We had dinner in the restaurant followed by a gig in Dublin. Thank you to The Morrison for everything!,5,2020,03,06
237,Excellent Service All Round,"Arrived for a 1-night stay prior to traveling back to NY. Check in at Front Desk was easy - everything as perfect with them being friendly, helpful and providing us with a quiet room without asking. Taxi booked for the morning was on time. Room was quiet and the bed is so comfortable - a much needed requirement before flying. 

The restaurant onsite is consistently fantastic - with so many restaurants in Dublin, we opt to eat here as it is top notch. Starters were goats cheese tart and caesar salad, which were very filling, then perfectly cooked steak and my wife had the fish pie, both very tasty and with excellent presentation. Combined with pinot noir and a sauvignon blanc, and lastly a chocolate sundae - excellent all round. Highly recommend this hotel for all round excellent service. Thank you.",5,2020,03,05
237,Weekend break,We were totally blown away with the first class service we received from everyone of your staff we came into contact with.  Nothing was too much trouble for them to stop what they were doing to assist us. Well done!,5,2020,03,02

237,Excellent,"Had a great stay. It's really well situated with ready access to the station. We walked easily to loads of great restaurants.. Lovely staff
Great location, great service and good, free Internet for 24 hours, literally no complaints. Staff was very polite, wish there was more space in the Lounge, but it was winter and outdoor space was chilly as expected. Staff is very friendly and seems happy. Keep the staff happy as it is such a pleasant experience for a Guest and experience a genuine greeting and hospitality of the staff. Love nice small surprises like a cookie or a piece of bakery next to my beverage. Impressive! Will defenitely come back.",5,2020,02,27

237,"Excellent Hotel, Perfect Location, Wonderful staff.","The Morrison is a wonderful hotel and our first choice when visiting Dublin. There is nothing not to like, a very warm welcome, excellent fully equipped room, extremely comfortable bed , first class breakfast with many choices, friendly service throughout.
We visited during the busy Christmas  period, the hotel was beautifully decorated for the season and there was a wonderful vibe. We had dinner in the restaurant, sat by the window to savour the atmosphere from the street outside, Junior looked after us and service and food was first class.  We also met Padraig, GM  and had a lovely conversation with him.
The hotel is a perfect location to see many of the sights in Dublin, many only within 5/10 minute walk and has lovely views over the river Liffey.. 
Highly recommend this hotel, ticks all the boxes for either a short or long break in Dublin.",5,2020,02,22

We would definitely recommend this hotel for a city break and found all the team to be super helpful and professional. The bar and restaurant are also very good. ,5,2020,02,18
237,Another seamless stay at The Morrison,"As I've stayed at The Morrison previously, it was good to have a seamless stay again. The room was stunning and had everything we needed. We attended a function that was held at The Morrison but separately to the Hotel. Staff were great at the function and food was gorgeous. The bar staff were a little slow for pre-dinner drinks and it took a while to get our order unfortunately.That was the only downside.",5,2020,02,17
237,True Irish Hospitality by Rory Rooney and his Staff in our Favorite Hotel!,"My husband and I have stayed here many times and love it!  We last stayed here just before Christmas.

237,unbielevable service ,i visited the bar for a few drinks with my friends and the service by the young man (martinis i think thats how you spell his name)  hehind the bar was amazing. his knowledge on cocktails and watching him make them was most definitly very professional !! + tasted amazing ! made our stay very enjoyable !! ,5,2020,02,15
237,One Of The Best,"I stayed here with my partner on the 31/01/2020 just for one night. The room and service were beyond fabulous. I wouldn’t normally pay big prices to stay somewhere but as it was a special occasion so I decided to fork out. The quality of this hotel is just under the 5 star ranking in my opinion. It’s perfectly located in the city centre and the staff are so welcoming and approachable. While checking in, the lady at reception was very informative and explained everything in great detail. She also produced two large, warm hazelnut chocolate chip cookies and that was just a sweet touch to add to check in.
I was in awe of the room, it was beautiful. I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody. Thank you for a wonderful night ",4,2020,02,14
237,Excellent hotel and amazing service,"Always very friendly service and good clean rooms with all the mod cons. Food in teh restaurant is always well cooked and presented and the variety of beverages 'to die for'. They have theor own take on many classic cocktails that adds a little something extra.
",5,2020,02,13
237,Fab,"Morrison hotel is a lovely hotel in the heart of Dublin city centre, only steps from all the visitor attractions and shopping. Great rooms with comfortable beds. Great staff very helpful, I left my perfume in the room and they checked, called me back and held it till I collected it. The warm chocolate cookies at check in were delicious. We will definitely return the Morrison. ",5,2020,02,12
237,"Brilliant location, lovely stay","Stayed here for one night when visiting Dublin for a weekend. The staff were lovely and stored our luggage and sent a text when our room was ready as we had arrived earlier than check in. The room was clean,the shower was nice and hot and powerful. There was a little noise later in the evening from outside, but nothing you wouldnt expect from staying in the centre of a town.
We left our Amazon firestick in the hotel when we left by mistake, the staff couldnt have been more helpful when I rang to explain. They arranged postage and kept me updated throughout.
Great location for temple bat, lots to see and do, 20 minute walk to the guineas factory too.
Would highly recommend and would stay again.",5,2020,02,12
237,Perfect!!,"Everything you would want from a friendly team, in a great location with the most amazing breakfast.   The warm cookies on checkin are a good sign of great things during your stay.  Modern very clean rooms with all expected options for a doubletree.  We don’t stay anywhere else in Dublin now.  ",5,2020,02,11
237,Afternoon Tea for two,"Given a voucher for Afternoon Tea as a gift.  When booking given a choice of time etc, chose 3.oclock. We also had a choice of menu, either the Fancy Pants Tea or the Gentlemens, and in fact Lorcan our server said we could each choose one of our choice. We both went for the Fancy Pants, and was served our chilled Prosecco. A lovely section of savoury and sweet treats arrived and pots and pots of tea!.  Lovely surroundings with views of the Quays.  All in all a lovely afternoon, service by Lorcan excellent.",5,2020,02,11
237,Friendly staff and good location,I have been there for 17 days for biz. Staff are very friendly and I feel so comfortable to talk wtih them. The hotel location is great which is right in the city center and close to shopping centers. ,4,2020,02,06
237,Fantastic Five Star Stay,"Fantastic stay my mother and I stayed for her birthday. We stayed on a Sunday night and the vibe and atmosphere was on anither level to the hussel and bussel outside. The bed , room and facilities are absloutley fantatsic. The team are brilliant extremely professionally and very personal .",5,2020,02,05
237,Absolutely perfect in every way,"We booked three nights at this hotel as it seemed in a good location without being too noisy. It was one of the best decisions we made. Our room was a good size (28 sq metres) with a larger than king size bed which was super comfy. The hotel is beautifully clean, all the staff are helpful and polite especially Jordan who was a great help to us. The bar staff are very knowledgable (see the gin photo - impressive!) and the housekeeping staff are also on top of their game. The restaurant on site is a great place to eat serving excellent steaks one of which was cooked as requested (Blue) which is one of our usual problems. Thoroughly recommend. ",5,2020,01,29
237,Our Go-To Hotel in Dublin,"Husband and I were staying for one night on 3rd Jan as we had an early flight to NY the next day. 

Front desk were delightful and friendly... 

Even though knowing we knew we had little time, we dined in the restaurant and were delighted to see Junior serving us. He is just impeccable in his customer service, jovial, caring, attentive - it is like seeing a friend each time we visit. All other serving staff were just as attentive so the Morrison management are hitting it spot on as far as we are concerned..

The room is spacious, bed is super comfortable and I like that the hotel has a bath. I am so disappointed that many hotels are taking out baths, not this one. We had a great night's sleep and yet again Front desk allowed me to print off a document and in the morning were friendly and efficient.

Good job guys.. and I hear that Junior is now going to work on Front Desk.. great to see the hotel is keeping a great asset. We look forward to staying in a few weeks time. Thank you to a great team.",5,2020,01,27
237,Lovely hotel and fab staff ,"A great HILTON in the heart of Dublin close to everywhere you want to be and easily accessible from the Luas and the air coaches. The hotel itself is lovely as is the restaurant and breakfast was fab but the staff were outstanding. So friendly. 
Also kudos HILTON for caring for the environment. Reusable water bottles in the room! ",5,2020,01,26
237,Nice hotel,"Super location, clean and funky, food quality is generally good, however they need to learn to cook eggs! Our stay was significantly over priced for a midweek stay but if you get a good rate then it’s a very good option!  ",4,2020,01,24
237,Within walking distance.,"My daughter and I stayed at the Doubletree during the Christmas/New Year holidays. The hotel is in a centralized location of the city center and very easily within walking distance of almost every attraction in Dublin. The room and bathroom had been updated which made for a very comfortable stay. The room offered free hot chocolate, coffee and tea which was nice as well as a mini bar. We often had room service with the food being the exact things served in their restaurant, which was delicious.
I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be able to walk to most places and it is near many restaurants.",5,2020,01,21
237,Excellent service & great bar,"This was our second time staying at the Morrison with the last being 3+ years ago.  We had two suites overlooking the Liffey.  The suites were incredibly large, much larger than a typical suite which I think is most likely due to the layout of the building.  The bathrooms were equally large with a separate tub and shower in both.  The only minor 
 problem was the lighting in the bathroom was dim.  The windows looking over the Liffey opened which was great for New Years Eve.  We had drinks at the bar in the evening and our service was incredible.  
Lastly, Piotr was a great help coordinating our room reservations prior to our arrival so our rooms would be nearby.",5,2020,01,18
237,Excellent ,"Well worth the money we paid. Breakfast was amazing, comfortable beds and excellent location - incredibly quiet too. We were sad to only stay for the one night. Will likely stay again when returning to Dublin. ",5,2020,01,13
237,The kindness of the hotel staff,"A very pleasant first stay at the Morrison last week, made all the more special by the action taken by housekeeping team member, Aggi, who was so thoughtful after seeing my birthday cards in the room, to have arranged a birthday cake treat for me via customer services. This is absolutely the definition of teamwork and Hilton values at their best.   Birthday aside, this is a lovely hotel, rooms well appointed. 

",5,2020,01,13
237,Clean and Comfortable ,"This hotel was very common of what you would expect from a DoubleTree chain. Hotel had good amenities, great location and the room was nice. I would not recommend paying extra for the Riverview room. The windows in room 331 were too small to really enjoy the view and I don’t think the open to try and get a better view. The Hop On Hop Off bus stop was a close walk. We went to Guinness and took a horse drawn carriage ride for 50 euro back along the river and it was 100 worth it. The food at the hotel restaurant was fantastic. I am on the Keto diet and was able to maintain my diet with no issue. I would recommend staying at this hotel. ",5,2020,01,11
237,First visit to Dublin,"- Excellently located in the heart of Dublin. A stone throw away from temple bar. 
- Fabulous hotel, very clean and stunning lobby. 
- Rooms seem newly refurbished, comfy and provides everything you need. 
- Breakfast was brilliant. Good selection and I liked there was a set breakfast menu for gold and diamond members! Really nice touch. 
- Staff were super friendly and very professional. Especially the reception team. 

Overall the hotel didn’t disappoint and I would book again in a heart beat. 
To Rory and the team, thank you for a beautiful stay. 

",5,2020,01,11
237,I would stay again!,"Everyone is welcoming, the hotel is lovely. The Guest Services staff were very helpful and could anticipate your needs. The lobby smelled amazing. Clean rooms, great team. I did not love the price of the breakfast but no problem, we just went elsewhere. ",5,2020,01,09
237,Amazing Hotel ran by Amazing Staff,"The staff was very friendly, helpful, and accommodating. Paola and Fiona at the front desk went above and beyond making sure we were taken care of during our stay. The staff in the restaurant and the bar were equally as accommodating and friendly.",5,2020,01,07
237,Great But short stay,"I stayed at the Morrison overnight just after the new year.

It is well located at the heart of the Dublin City centre with a small shopping centre just 100 meters from the hotel.

Check-in took a little while though it appeared there was a large group checking in at the time I got there

Rooms were very well lit and extremely comfortable. Was impressed with little details in the room. Right temperature despite the fact it was freezing cold in Dublin.

Hotel has a nice grill and bar right next to each other on the ground floor and it is quite busy. I had a meal at the bar and I must say that they Angus beef burger was excellent.

Overall it was a nice stay and I will recommend if you plan to be around Dublin City Centre.",4,2020,01,07
237,Fantastic Hotel!,"I'm a regular Hilton guest, and so we booked the Morrison as i could use my Gold Status for the free breakfasts, but also it was very close to the action and in particular Custom House Quay for the NYF.

We had a great sleep in the hotel, it was clean, quiet and comfortable. ",5,2020,01,07
237,2nd time in Dublin,"The Morrison is a conviently located hotel just across the river from Temple Bar.  The area is very walkable and safe.  The beds are comfortable but extremely small.  The air conditioning is nonexistent.
Overall, the hotel is not worth the amount paid.",4,2020,01,05
237,Fabulous,"Traveled to Dublin from the states on a redeye. They were able to check us in early, which was extremely helpful. Rooms were clean and amenities lovely. As an America who frequently travels, would definitely recommend. Bar and food were also excellent. ",5,2020,01,05
237,Cofefeffe!,"Wow, I don’t often write reviews for hotels, but The Morrison in Dublin is first rate and I need to say so.  The staff are friendly and helpful, including the main desk, service crew for the room, the breakfast group, and the bar tenders!  All first class people and first class service.  Thanks to all.  The room we selected was standard — I think.  But the staff made the stay seem first class all the way round.  The location is also premo for our purposes — a half hour walk to almost everything including Guinness, several whiskey distilleries, theater, etc.  And only steps from excellent deli food!!",5,2020,01,04
237,Fantastic New Year stay ,We visited Dublin for the first time for New Year. We thought all the staff were extremely accommodating and friendly. Our room was very quiet and blackout curtains were very much appreciated after new year festivities. We will stay again at this hotel and would not consider anywhere else.,5,2020,01,02
237,Perfect,"We stayed for 2 nights between Christmas and new year. Beautiful hotel, clean and modern. We greeted with a warm cookie each too!  Rooms were well equipped, beds very comfy. 
Expensive breakfast so we didn’t bother with that. There is a little cafe right opposite that did lovely breakfasts for half the price! ",5,2020,01,02
237,Friendly and Helpful staff,"Couldn’t have been happier with the facilities, location, and staff. The location was perfect for our stay over the Christmas holiday because we were able to walk to Guinness, Jamison, Temple Bar, etc",5,2020,01,01
237,Wonderful hotel!,This is a great hotel! Very clean and beautiful. Friendly staff! Loved it! Would plan to stay here again. Staff was extremely helpful and courteous. Room was pretty and comfortable. Free internet was good. ,5,2019,12,31
237,Gem of a hotel,"Well appointed, near the shops, sites and night life 

Rooms are a decent size, clean and well maintained. 

Restaurant was good as was breakfast, generally a nice selection and very fresh. 

I would stay here again.",5,2019,12,30
237,Wedding,3 days spent in this lovely hotel at family wedding.... Rooms beautiful food excellent staff extremely helpful.... Location is perfect so central...... Only small faults not enough bar staff/long wait to be served.... No cashback facility when paying by card..... Otherwise very memorable stay❤️❤️,5,2019,12,30
237,A Gem of a Hotel,"This is a great Hotel in a good location. Very clean, very professional staff, great amenities, well maintained, and very chic! We really enjoyed our stay here during the week before and somewhat after christmas. ",5,2019,12,29
237,Leisure,"The Morrison Double Tree is 10/10. Staff exceed at customer service and have made this experience exceptional!! Pleasant, professional, helpful, and friendly. This hotel is also walking distance to everything. You are walking distance to Temple bar, Jameson, Guinness, and Brazen (Ireland’s oldest pub 1198) I would recommend staying at this hotel. The room is large, safe, very clean, and comfortable.",5,2019,12,27
237,Top Quality Hotel in the middle of Dublin City,"Spent one night here when going to a concert.

We're greeted with a complimentary cookie at check in and the room, restaurant, and breakfast we're top class. Really enjoyed the bar (though it was a bit on the expensive side).

Overall, a very good hotel in the middle of Dublin.",5,2019,12,26
237,Excellent food and service,"Brought a large group there recently for a meal and had the most wonderful food and service! Particular shout-out to our waiter, Junior, who could not have been more attentive. I generally dislike hotel restaurants but this was really exceptional!",5,2019,12,24
237,Modern and recommended - some IT savvy was necessary to get the pink lights extinguished and TV on.,"We kind of got off on the wrong foot with this stay at The Morrison, Dublin. Had stayed there over 20 years ago and decided to go there on foot after being dropped off at O’Connell Bridge, by the AirBus from the airport. Made our way along Ormond Quay Lower, across the road from the shops and hotels on a sunny day in December! Just couldn’t find a sign or entrance for the hotel, but having reached Capel St we had to make enquiries. There is an entrance to the Morrison Bar, up some steps from the street but, in fact, the main entrance to the hotel is from Swift Row, by the side – important information for people with mobility problems.

 The unaccustomed heat and walking left us a bit uncomfortable at check-in – a bit compounded by the room numbers numbered consecutively on one side, in contrast to most hotels where the even-numbered doors are on one side and odd-numbered doors on the other side. Our main concern was to get a drink and lie down in a darkened room. The very detailed but nonsensical writing in the lifts and Saw Doctors' (Did bless them) lyrics on the wall with very bright pink lights amounted to sensory overdose – some IT savvy was necessary to get the pink lights extinguished and TV controls working. 

The bed was very comfortable, excellent sound proofing and tea, coffee and hot chocolate available; we finally got to enjoy the large and free chocolate chip cookie offered by reception. There was no fridge in the room and the bar was absolutely packed even in mid-afternoon; the bartenders for happy hour were very helpful in suggesting cocktails etc. We availed of the bacon, cabbage and mash – always a favourite in Dublin – the bacon was a bit tough but the Dingle gin washed the salt taste away. 

The breakfast menu buffet was good and the menu satisfying; the containers for the buffet worked well and had the lids had a “hold position” that enable tidy filling of plates, without a requirement to be held open by one hand. In summary the hotel was very clean, excellent location near the Luas, a public transport tram system that operates in Dublin, and a short walk to Temple Bar's dining and nightlife. Prices were reasonable for such a well-appointed hotel – recommended.",5,2019,12,24
237,Very enjoyable stay,"I recently stayed here for two nights on my first visit to Dublin.  I was very pleased with this hotel and would definitely stay here again.  We arrived long before normal check-in time and they stored our suitcases while we started on a self-guided walking tour of the city. Soon we were pleasantly surprised to receive a text letting us know a room was ready so we headed back and checked in. The room, the beds and pillows were comfortable.  The front desk staff were helpful and called taxis and even the Guinness Storehouse for us when we had a question about our scheduled tour. The location is excellent and within easy walking distance of pretty much everything. ",5,2019,12,24
237,grear stay,stayed here for 1 night with my partner. we have stayed in a few hotels around dublin but this was by far the best. staff were great. modern room which was spotless and the location is excellent. would 100% recommend this hotel,5,2019,12,24
237,Beautiful Hotel,"This was the second time here,  my first was a June 2018.  But they welcomed me back with a very nice note, and a sweet box of chocolates!  How thoughtful!  My room was ready earlier than I had anticipated, and everything was perfect.   The location is the best in Dublin!     Right outside the front entrance and across the street is the Ha Penny bridge!  

",5,2019,12,18
237,One of the best in Dublin,"As a repeat guest of the Morrison for the last 8 years, the hotel never disappoints in terms of service and facilities. Spacious, very modern rooms, great breakfast and bar. It can be quite expensive at times, but the excellent location and overall quality make it worth it",4,2019,12,17
237,Restful weekend but close to everything,"Great stay in the Capital, very welcoming staff and went above  and beyond when I had noted that it was my Wife's birthday. Great location in a very restful surrounding. Close to the centre of Dublin and a 5 minute walk to Temple bar.",5,2019,12,15
237,Comfortable and good location,Centrally located in Dublin. Bright and comfortable rooms. Nice little sofa in the room to relax after a busy day. Very friendly staff and good breakfast menu. The only challenge was to understand how to put off the cubical lights in the room.,5,2019,12,14
237,A great hotel ,"My stay was wonderfulm The staff in your hotel were very nice from the reception staff to the staff in the restaurant. My room was excellent. Even when I checked in and my room wasnt ready, they took my luggage, contacted me when my room was ready and left my suitcase in my room, which was convenient. I would highly recommend people to stay at your hotel and I will definitely be coming back in the near future.
",5,2019,12,13
237,"Lovely hotel, great staff, perfect location","Stayed here on Business for a couple of nights.  Found the hotel location to be perfect with nice views of the River.
Hotel has a nice luxurious feel about it.  Breakfast is good, restaurant food is really good (and reasonably priced for the quality).
Rooms are good, with decent space, comfortable beds.  Aircon was a little noisy, not the end of the world.
Really liked staying here, will definitely stay here the next time I'm in Dublin 👍",5,2019,12,09
237,Exceptional visit,"Stayed for a Saturday night following a 3-day work visit.

237,"Excellent Location, Great price and value!","Located right across the river from Temple Bar area proper, it is an easy walk across the bridge to go there and to walk to the Dublin Castle, Grafton Street and many other locations.  Guinness is also within walking distance and so is Jameson.  The hotel is quiet, state of the art, reasonably priced and has many amenities including a great restaurant and bar, work out room, great cookies on arrival and it is quiet and well appointed.  Uber anywhere from here. ",5,2019,12,08
237,Dinner @ The Morrison Grill,We had a lovely meal last night in The Morrison Grill. We didn't have a reservation but Junior managed to accomodate us.

237,Great stay at The Morrison,"Booked short notice using Hilton Honors points and cash.  Great location, friendly & helpful staff. Recommend the Mezanine rooms if you can afford and get one. Comfotable and quiet. Will stay here again.",5,2019,11,26
237,Fabulous ,Wow from the time we arrived I felt special. Check in girl was fabulous. Our diamond membership was fully acknowledged and we were upgraded to a fabulous suite. Breakfast was excellent. Superb location. I could not fault this hotel. Wish we could have stayed longer. Can’t wait to return. Well done to all the staff. You should be proud. ,5,2019,11,25
237,"Central location, clean and quiet",This hotel is close to Temple Bar without being in the middle of it.  Many inexpensive food places nearby.  Go a block to the north and you can catch the red tram line along with the Jervis shopping center which includes a pharmacy and a Tesco grocery store.  Great if you need to pick up something.,5,2019,11,18
237,Understated class,"It may be a small property but it is packed with professional staff and exceptional management. To truly appreciate the kind of experience you can expect, detail is what will ensure this. Upon arrival, check-in was swift and friendly by Edit who also gave us warm biscuits and tagged our bags for storage. Edit also gave us a few tips on where to stroll about in the Temple Bar district with a map. The hotel is ideally located at literally steps away from river Liffy. Our room was ready before check-in time and we were given s complimentary drinks voucher and wifi. Room amenities were fabulous and the bed very comfortable. Towels were ample, fresh and new. Cleaning was exceptional. I enjoyed prompt, fresh in-room dining daily and can recommend daily eggs benedict despite the 5 euro tray charge. Do try the sweet potato fries as well! I was especially pleased that the fitness centre was open 24hours with adequate airconditioning and towels. Functioning  treadmills, bikes, orbitreks and weights sections were fabulous. Key card access to the fitness centre and for the lifts to function was also a good sign of a quality hotel. The view of river Liffy made for an excellent stay as well and we did not feel short-changed on rainy days either as a result of this. There is an excellent casting option on their TVs as well.  The rooms are a bit cramped but in European minimalist style- the fact that they have been fully refurbished and clean made a huge difference. I strongly recommend booking a junior suite if staying for more than 2 nights. I must commend the staff for their gracious warmth and hospitality. Everyone was pleasent, well-presented and went the extra mile for me. This is also reflective of good management as it means ongoing improvements. I will be back and strongly recommend this hotel",5,2019,11,15
237,Great service!,"From check in we were greeted by Paula and a young Irish lad from swords both of whom were excellent and friendly and really set the stage for what would be a great stay.
We dined in the restaurant and our server Cathia was fantastic, friendly and gave us phenomenal service.
The only let down here was perhaps the food. The the duck which my partner ordered was overdone and parts of the meat were too hard to chew. I ordered the muir is tuir, which for the most part was delightful but parts of the meat I felt was a bit dry.
But the original cocktails we ordered were done to perfection.
There was some confusion during breakfast as to how we settle up and our server the following morning didn't really explain to us how or where, I think he didn't understand the question.
The room was spacious, with a very comfy bed and was perfectly clean. 
Overall a lovely stay and for the most part excellent staff.",5,2019,11,12
237,"Wonderful stay, wonderful staff","We stayed at the Morrison in August, and were most impressed with the people who worked there more than other aspect.  Rory Rooney, deputy general manager, went out of his way to make our stay not just enjoyable, but memorable.  The front desk, restaurant, and housekeeping staff all treated us with warmth and kindness.
The hotel itself is in an ideal location, and the room was very comfortable.  We look forward to our next trip to Dublin, and a stay at the Morrison!",5,2019,11,12
237,Location by the Liffey,"We stayed here for four nights and it was a great base for our Dublin trip.  The hotel has a modern design with airy lobby and restaurants. The rooms are large, especially by European standards, with plenty of outlets and USB ports. The location was the best - just a 3 minute walk from the Temple Bar district and a 5-10 minute walk from many of the city center's best attractions. As a Hilton Honors member we were provided with complimentary water boxes in the room and cookies at the front desk. We also really enjoyed the breakfast buffet - not huge buffet but the option to get a hot entree (omelet, french toast etc.) custom made was great.",5,2019,11,10
237,"Clean, comfortable and convenient hotel.","Stayed here with my father and brothers to tour Ireland and visit family. Wonderful staff make you feel very welcome. Clean, comfortable and well equipped rooms.  Great location. Definitely recommend when visiting Dublin. ",4,2019,11,08
237,Wonderful spot with a great location,"The Hotel was centrally located to all things Dublin but not in the middle of the noise.  In addition to a comfortable lounge/bar, the lobby was a good spot to relax and gather.  The staff was genuinely helpful in everything we needed.",5,2019,11,07
237,Excellent hotel and great location,Loved this Hotel right on the Liffy in central Dublin. Close to all the attractions...walking distance. Great service by the employees. Lovely bar area which also does afternoon tea and well as very nice food. Morning breakfast was excellent.,5,2019,11,04
237,Good Hotel in a great location,We loved the location of the hotel walking distance to centre of Dublin . Rooms were funcky and had all amenities. The staff were welcoming and helpful . One downside is price of the overnight parking it adds 20€ to cost of your stay ,5,2019,11,04
237,Great hotel,"Stayed here for two nights.

After the nightmare I had in another hotel in the city, I booked here last min (hour before I checked in) for cheaper then the other hotel that was a nightmare 

Was shocked when we got a cookie at check-in me and my girlfirend where delighted.

Offered us free drinks in the bar as well. We took these to and where delighted with them as we had them on the 2nd night with a lovely make you own sundie ice cream.

Service was warm and welcoming. 

Room was lovely clean and stylish. 

Will be back for my next trip to Dublin.",5,2019,11,02
237,Wonderful.,"The hotel was very clean, staff was very pleasant with a very positive approach.  The only complaint was the bed was not as comfortable as other places we have stayed.  Loved the location to the river and other local attractions. ",5,2019,11,01
237,"Good staff, nice room, great location","My wife and I recently stayed at The Morrison for three nights on a long weekend in Dublin.

We arrived after midnight due to a flight delay and the hotel staff were very welcoming.  Our check in was very quick and it was lovely to be given the DoubleTree warm cookie!  As a HiltonHonors member our room was upgraded at check in and we were given tokens for a complimentary drink at the bar.

The room was spacious and light with good facilities; tea and coffee, stocked mini bar, smart TV and the usual iron, safe and toiletries.

The lobby and bar area were well presented, clean and quiet on a Friday and Saturday night.

Location-wise the hotel is in a really good location in Dublin city centre, opposite the Temple Bar area.  Just a five minute walk from places like The Norseman and The Temple Bar.  Approximately 10-15 minutes walk from The Brazen Head and The Stags Head, EPIC Irish Emigration Museum and closer to 20 minutes from Grafton Street, St. Stephen's Green and The Celt.

As an international visitor flying in and out of Dublin airport, it was easy to get the Airlink bus to and from the hotel, with stops on the main road along the river and also on O'Connell Street, both around 10 minutes walk from the hotel.

Budget-wise, as with all things in Dublin (speaking as visitor from the UK), it's not a cheap hotel but on balance was worth the money paid based on the quality of the hotel and service and location.",5,2019,10,30
237,Very nice all around hotel,"The hotel location is great, room was well kept and staff was very helpful... altogether a very good experience.  Breakfast was very good, albeit a bit pricey if you just drop in... better if you at least call the day before to ""get on the list"".  Definitely a place I would return to on subsequent visits.",5,2019,10,29
237,Outstanding Customer Service,"Few hotels have the continuous outstanding customer service which is offered by the Morrison. The management is to be commended for their work and the taking notice of the ""little things"" which make a stay pleasant.  The location is excellent with easy accessibly to many of Dublin's places of interest.  Outstanding Staff!",5,2019,10,29
237,Excellent Hotel,"It's hard to pick a hotel in a new country (or anywhere!). After researching and reading Frommer's 2019, I chose The Morrison. It was THE best choice as far as location, service, cleanliness, and amenities. We were on the River Liffey, right across from the Temple Bar area. Most attractions were within walking distance, which was great. The hotel is nice inside. I love the artistic writings on the walls. The room was super clean and cleaned by the time we'd come back for an afternoon break. The decor was different and modern.  There was a hot water pot, plenty of coffee, tea, etc. There was a small fridge, ironing board, and hair dryer. Plenty of storage in the closet with shelves. Full length mirrors, and a safe. They had slippers and robes also. The staff was unbelievably gracious.  We received warm cookies on checkin, after an hour, a box of chocolates, and mid-stay, a phone call asking if everything was going well and could they offer assistance in things to do, etc. There is a concierge. In my review of the restaurant I noted a nice young man who went out of his way to help my husband carry coffee. Jervis Parking Centre is just down the block to park a car. After long days, this was truly a place to relax and sleep. Hopefully, we'll be back in Ireland and stay again.",5,2019,10,27
237,Great location!  Great service!,The location of this hotel is perfect for walking and exploring Dublin.  Our room was spacious and luxurious.  Great service as expected from the DoubleTree brand.  I highly recommend this hotel for your visit to Dublin. ,5,2019,10,27
237,A perfect honeymoon,"We came to Dublin for our honeymoon and the Morrison was perfect! We had a junior suite with a view of the Liffey and the room was spacious and modern with an amazing bathtub and rain shower. You can also chromecast to the TVs which made it very tempting to spend the whole week in our room! We were checked in by Giovanna who was absolutely amazing and gave us great recommendations, PLUS sent us a lovely dessert plate to our room, which was such a kind gesture. She also remembered us right as we were about to depart (a week later, which is no small feat!), offering to book us a taxi to the airport. Overall, I would highly recommend the Morrison for its great restaurants, modern atmosphere, and kind & attentive staff.",5,2019,10,26
237,Great Location!,"This hotel was in a great location to explore all of the sites in Dublin.  Right across from the River Liffey. We were there on a weekend, so it did get loud from people leaving the bars, but I guess thats to be expected anywhere in Dublin on the weekend.  The room was clean, and the staff was helpful!",4,2019,10,23
237,"perfect location to base out of for seeing Dublin,","The hotel location was great! the rooms were spacious the King bed was very comfortable, the bath room was well appointed.  modern design for the room which was very nice.  I did not try the restaurant so I do not have feedback about that quality.  Lobby area was great as well.",4,2019,10,22
237,Great Hotel in a great location!,"This hotel is very close to Temple Bar.  Full size hotel, full service, very friendly staff and nice clean rooms.  Happy we stayed here.  Temple Bar area is noisy so I'm glad we were across the river from it.  We were able to stay out late then head back to a quiet room to sleep.  Close to all all things we wanted to see/do. We would stay here again. Nice hotel.",5,2019,10,19
237,Wonderful hotel in excellent location,"The front desk staff and restaurant staff was very friendly and accommodating. The breakfast buffet and cooked to order menu had a variety of excellent selections. Room and bath very clean and luxurious. Bed was comfortable. Enjoyed the selections of coffees, teas, and hot chocolate in the room.",5,2019,10,17
237,Great experience,Overall warm welcoming vibrant lobby and staff. the check in was seamless. The rooms were nicely sized - modern - we had 2 twin beds in the room. Halls were clean with not a lot of noise. AC / HEAT. Staff were all very down to earth and cool. Walking distance to a lot of great eateries bars stores pharmacies etc. I would definitely stay there again. ,5,2019,10,15
237,"Great hotel, little value.","Clean rooms. Great staff. Extremely overpriced food and beverage options.This is the second time I've stayed at this hotel and it has so much missed opportunity. 

My check-in experience was great, the staff here are very welcoming. There just seems to be a disconnect between the F&B pricing/options and the reality of the fact that this is simply a DoubleTree in Dublin.",3,2019,10,15
237,Fantastic Stay! ,"Stayed as a couple for my birthday....
Room was quirky, modern and clean!
Cast on the TV worked great usually doesn't in most hotels...
Had dinner and a few drinks in the Bar/Grill which was absolutely delicious (the voucher for a comp glass of prosecco with every main in the room is a lovely touch)

Breakfast was amazing also!! Service throughout was amazing...

Will definitely be choosing here to stay when next in Dublin... ",5,2019,10,15
237,Morrison Hilton great location!!,"Stayed at the Morrison for one night prior to a long trip around Ireland. Dublin is a fantastic city. The Morrison is right across the street from the river near the bridge so walkable to everything downtown Dublin. Make sure you wear sneakers ! 
Great hotel restaurant and bar- we had a fabulous meal. Nice rooms -clean. We took a taxi. I am not sure how parking is there -it is in a very congested area. Front desk was fantastic. Ordered us taxis to get to our next destination. Everyone friendly. Highly recommend this hotel if you were going to stay in Dublin.",5,2019,10,14
237,FANTASTIC,"I loved the location, accommodations, perfessional friendly staff. A wonderful experience. I will be returning to Dublin next month and I will stay here again. I look forward to it. I reccomend this hotel for anyone. ",5,2019,10,11
237,Great Stay!,"We recently stayed for two nights.  The location is perfect.  Within walking distance to all the sites of Dublin.  The staff were very friendly and polite.  The room was clean, the bed was comfortable.  We ate breakfast in the hotel and it was wonderful!  So many choices!  One night we treated ourselves to ice cream sundaes.  Worth every calorie!  Delicious!",5,2019,10,11
237,Great Weekend in Dublin,Dublins a lovely city with lots to do and friendly locals.  The Morrison Hotel was excellent.  The staff could not have been more friendly or helpful.  The restaurant sered good food with a reasonable choice and did so quickly and efficiently.  Everything made for an excellent weekend.,5,2019,10,09
237,Dublin stay.,Convenient to the Jamison Distillery and Guinness and st minutes to Temple Bar area. An added bonus is the tram runs one block right behind the hotel. Also the breakfast bar was the best we had while in Ireland.,5,2019,10,07
237,Excellent Location,"We stayed here three days as the start of our vacation. First off, what makes this hotel a good choice is its convenient location, opposite the Temple Bar area just over the Millennium Bridge over the River Liffey. A short 5+ minute walk to just about everywhere. Plenty of restaurants, pubs, stores, etc. Parking is via a public car park a block away (they have a reduced rate), which turned out quite convenient.

Overall, we found the hotel very good. Our river view room (4th floor) was comfortable and clean. Our very early arrival meant quite a wait before our room was ready, and hotel staff made a true effort to get us in as quickly as possible, well before ""regular"" check-in.  Our luggage was checked during our wait, so there was option to head out for lunch, etc. Thanks to staff for making our arrival a positive experience. 

As Diamond HHonors members and HGVC owners we visit many Hilton properties. Although we were treated nicely, by no means any special or welcoming for our investment and long-term relationship with Hilton. No upgrade, nothing. Disappointing as other facilities seem to appreciate things more. We did get a small box of chocolates, which is something.

In short, I would return here based on location.

",4,2019,10,03
237,"Large room, small room",We booked here to be with friends. We paid about €20 more than them or an executive king room and had acres of room. They were a bit cramped. The room was beautiful but no drawers to unload or suitcases into so we lived out of ours for the visit. The room was always cleaned nicely and stocked amply. The personnel were friendly and helpful always.,4,2019,10,01
237,"Location, location, location","We wanted a centrally located hotel where we could walk to  the major sights of Dublin.  This fit the bill. Our room faced the courtyard and I have never had a more quiet room in a busy city location. Staff was helpful and welcoming although their tips for restaurants and bars tended towards the tourist traps and weren't very interesting.  I'm not a huge fan of minimalist decor and the gray hallways reminded me a bit of a prison block, but all was clean and comfortable.",5,2019,10,01
237,Great location with fabulous rooms,"Wonderful staff. We were treated to an upgraded suite as Hilton Diamond members, and it was fantastic. The front staff was very helpful and welcoming, and took the time to help us with our questions about area transportation and more. The bar staff was also very accommodating. Great service and we were absolutely delighted with our stay. We will definitely choose this property the next time we make our way to Dublin. The location is perfect as it is close to many attractions as well as public transportation and you can walk to either train station in about 20 minutes or so.",5,2019,09,25
237,Issues....,"Upon arrival receptionist was very welcoming and friendly. Unfortunately there was an issue whereby card used to book could not be charged from booking as was assumed. The male receptionist was very apologetic, a woman who seemed to be above this man, however, was extremely rude about the matter. They refused to take card details and insisted a link had to be sent to the card holder, which neither of them seemed to be able to do and we were waiting 10 minutes for the link to be sent which was extremely frustrating as we had informed them we were in a rush to get somewhere. 
The payment was made using the link, of over €380 for a twin room for one night. I was sent confirmation, which I produced for them, but this was not good enough. We were left waiting another 10 minutes until they found the confirmation in their files. 
THEN we were informed ANOTHER €100 deposit was needed “in case the mini bar was used”. This €100 could not be taken from the card just used to pay the other fee. It HAD to be from a physical card, something I have never come across in my life after staying in many hotels. We then payed this €100, which luckily we had to spare between us, before being given our room key. 
Throughout this mess, the male receptionist was extremely curious and made an effort to apologize for the delays. The woman however was appallingly rude and dismissive of me the entire time.
The room itself was stunning, everything spotless. I was very impressed with chrome cast being available in the room. The beds weren’t the most comfortable, both of us struggled to sleep. 
We were delivered some chocolates that night which I can only assume were an attempt to make up for the horrendous mess at reception.

All in all, would not return to pay such a high fee for such terrible service.",3,2019,09,24
237,wonderful hotel,"Wonderful hotel right across the river from Temple bar, the rooms are very clean and comfortable and the staff is super friendly. Walking distance to most of the sites in Dublin. The breakfast available is very good and the bar downstairs is very good and the bartenders are a wealth of knowledge about the local area.",5,2019,09,24
237,Exquisite,"Wow awesome ambience, the flare , the colour scheme , the service , the breakfast , etc. was so nice   Staff was friendly , helpful, parking was close by , hotel situated where you can walk to many nearby restaurants, bars, pubs , etc..",5,2019,09,22
237,Amazing stay,The Morrison is perfectly located and an absolutely stunning hotel. The breakfast staff were particularly fabulous. I picked out items to have brought to my husband so he could have breakfast in bed and the delivered it to him. Thank you. ,5,2019,09,20
237,"Beautiful hotel, great location","If you want to get the most out of being in the heart of Dublin this is your hotel.  But it is not cheap.  The hotel is beautiful, modern and clean.  Very busy place but staff is very helpful.  Room was clean modern and nicely decorated.  It worked for us as we were there only one night and wanted to get in the most we could of Dublin and this location works for that.  If we were staying longer I would have looked for a cheaper option.  Restaurant is very pricey as well.",4,2019,09,19
237,What you expect from Hilton!,"This hotel provides everything you expect from a Hilton property.  Friendly and clean with amenities you are used to in the US.  The location is fantastic and centrally located to sites, restaurants, shops and bars.  Walkable!",5,2019,09,19
237,Great first night in Dublin,"Booked a room at the Morrison for our first two nights in Dublin. We were celebrating our anniversary and asked for a river view room on a high floor and they upgraded us and made us feel very welcome.  The hotel is right across the river from the temple bar area and is easy walking distance to the Gunless Storehouse and Saint Patricks Cathedral. The rooms are clean and contemporary and their is parking at a discounted rate at a garage a block away. We stayed in room 431 and it had a great view. I only wish the windows would have opened as it was a perfect temperature to sleep with the windows open. The breakfast buffet was outstanding and the eggs Benedict are delicious. Would have given this place a full f dots but there was no early checkin and there was limitations on what you could use the drink coupon for at the bar to basically a house wine, a soft drink or a Heineken. It would be nice to offer a local draft  beer or a Guiness for goodness sake we are in Dublin. Would definitely recommend this hotel and when we return to Dublin and want to stay in the heart of the Temple Bar area we will stay there again. ",4,2019,09,16
237,The Best Hotel in Dublin ,I recently stayed in the Morrison hotel for a family event. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. The room was very spacious for a city centre hotel and very modern. The bed was extremely comfortable. The staff at reception were friendly and the cookie upon check in was a lovely touch. I was so happy that I decided to have dinner in the Morrison Grill. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for your evening meal. The food was delicious and of a very high standard. There is something for everyone’s taste on the menu. Service in the bar and restaurant was top class. The staff were friendly and professional. Breakfast the next morning was once again excellent. There is an a la cartel menu at no extra cost. The wide variety of breakfast options left me in awe. I must say that The Morrison is without doubt the best hotel I have ever stayed in in Dublin. ,5,2019,09,16
237,Perfection,"This is a great property and in the perfect location. Easy access to bus, hop on hop off, taxi and train. Just across the river from the Temple Bar area, which makes it easy to go visit and come back to get out of chaos. Plenty of great places to eat, shop and explore nearby. We were greeted by Joy at the Front Desk. She was professional and outgoing each time we saw her. We had breakfast and ordered from the menu, hostess made sure we were well taken care each day. Steak night, Thursday, was a treat. Perfectly cooked. Felt like royalty as we were waited on by Fernanda and Junior. They elevate the Customer Service experience.",5,2019,09,15
237,Outstanding place.,"My girlfriend & I arrived and were greeted by the nicest people were could imagine. 
 When I say nice this isn't a good enough word for them. Each and every one went above and beyond what we expected. 
 The hotel is right on the river close to everything.  The rooms are great & maid service is top notch too.
 Not a single complaint about the hotel nor this city.",5,2019,09,12
237,"Great Location, Pricey, but OK for short stays","The location is perfect - The price was a bit excessive for what we are getting but I figure we are paying for the convenient location.  I felt there was little thought in the design of the hotel because many areas seemed to waste a lot of space and other areas seemed so cramped.  The room was very comfortable - no complaints.  The gym was a major disappointment, the hallway to the gym could house 3 fitness centres and the gym was small and poorly equipped.  I felt it was another Hilton ""check the box"" exercise to say ""we have a gym"".  The mediocrity of the restaurant was underlined by the better quality options in the immediate vicinity.  Service was excellent, everyone was on their A-game.  Its a great location and a great hotel, I just was annoyed with the gym and restaurant, and thought value for money could have been better.",4,2019,09,10
237,Great location ,"We stayed for two nights, hotel is lovely and in a great location.
The room was just right, very clean and every thing we needed.
The hotel its self was lovely and the staff r very helpful.
Best bit is the location close enough to the shops and just over the bridge from all the bars and restaurants ",4,2019,09,09
237,Highly recommended,"Great hotel, great staff. Stayed 2 nights at the Morrisson and everything was set up to be perfect. We received an upgrade on arrival, outstanding view and staff. Breakfast was average only, however a True 5**** hotel, will always come back. ",5,2019,09,07
237,Can’t believe it’s a double tree! ,Stayed at this hotel for a night before heading back to the states and I cannot say enough good things!! This hotel first and foremost appreciates Hilton Honors guests. I was given a coupon for a drink at the bar AND I had chocolates left in my room when I went out for dinner. I’ve never seen a hotel have that much attention to detail and show appreciation for guests.  Great location- walkable to everything. Rooms were cool and very modern. Absolutely would stay here again. Also- most clever do not disturb signs I’ve ever seen :) ,5,2019,09,03
237,Superlative breakfast ,"Hotel in very good spot for both the businessmen and the tourists.
Everything is at a walking distance. Staff are friendly and supportive.

237,"Great location, good value, very nice hotel.","We spent five nights here during our vacation in Dublin and we really had a great time.  We initially booked a limited light view King room, but when we checked in we found out we had received a room upgrade as Hilton Honors members, so that was a nice surprise.  We ended up with a deluxe King room (Room 104).  Room was a very nice size, bed was comfortable, good sized shower and bathroom.  Really no complains at all.  At one point the air conditioner started making some noises but we brought it up at the front desk and they had it fixed almost immediately - great service.  We only used the hotel breakfast once but it was really great, and the water coolers in the hallways were a nice touch.  And of course the location is amazing, being a short walk from almost all of the major tourist spots.  The only places we needed to cab to were the Guinness Storehouse and Kilmainham Gaol, but both of those spots are pretty out of the way anyway.  Overall an A+.",5,2019,09,01
237,Classy hotel in the heart of Dublin!,"Thanks to Piotr Marek, Paola, & the entire Morrison staff for making our stay in Dublin so enjoyable!  Comfortable, well-appointed design rooms, wonderful service, very convenient location (across from Temple Bar, & all the other great restaurants & pubs).",5,2019,08,31
237,Just perfect,"We had a short 3 night stay and we wish we could have stayed longer. The cleanliness of the hotel is faultless, great check in and out service, very efficient service throughout the property. The food is great in the grill bar and breakfast is just heaven on earth. As for the staff, I have never met such polite, professional and dedicated staff...from housekeeping, reception food and beverage staff are all doing a great job and they are amazing. Special thanks to Lorcan in the grill bar and Fernanda the manager at breakfast...they made our stay magnificent. Looking forward to returning back...",5,2019,08,29
237,A gorgeous stay in a fantastic location,"So close to Temple Bar, but across the little bridge to escape the nighttime noise when you're ready to sleep. Friendly helpful staff, gorgeous smelling hotel, makes you feel relaxed as soon as you walk into the hotel. Spacious room, fantastic shower, spotlessly clean and very quiet.",5,2019,08,28
237,"Great location, great stay","The hotel location is great - just cross the river and you're at Temple Bar. The staff was welcoming and the rooms were clean. Due to booking through a 3rd party website, I felt that we didn't get a good room and had the view of an alley, but we only stayed for one night so it wasn't a big deal. Overall, a great stay. ",4,2019,08,26
237,Location location,"Biggest selling point for here..easy access to exploring Dublin.
Room spacious and modern. Limited comfortable seating area downstairs..
Food in bar area nice. Didn't opt for breakfast but plenty of options nearby. No street noise considering stayed over weekend.",4,2019,08,24
237,"Lovely, extremely convenient, would return","Great hotel in a superb location.  We wanted to be close to Temple Bar area but not actually stay in it since we heard from so many people how loud it is at night.  The Morrison is a few feet over the liffey river and took 5 minutes to walk to the heart of temple bar.  You really are ""in it"" without being ""in it"".  Travelled with four kids age 18-24.  Rooms are modern, very clean. Delicious hot cookies at check in....nice touches all around.  would recommend.",5,2019,08,21
237,EXCEPTIONAL hotel in Dublin,"Outstanding location with exceptional service, cleanliness of rooms, outstanding breakfast and a location that can’t be beat. The Morrison is conveniently located just across from the Temple Bar area and other attractions in Dublin. We walked everywhere in the city from our hotel including the bus terminal to take a bus for a day trip up to Belfast. The hotel was by far one of the best hotels I have stayed at in a long time. Each and every staff member provides exceptional service. The breakfast is a must as the quality is outstanding and again, the staff are great. The rooms are a good size with all the amenities needed and are spotless. The beds are extremely comfortable. The hotel is a great value. I would definitely stay there again when visiting Dublin and highly recommend it to all.",5,2019,08,19
237,Wonderful Stay at the Morrison,"Perfect location for exploring Dublin - close to Temple Bar, walking distance to Guinness and Jameson, wonderful restaurants on the same street. The rooms were a good size and very clean! The staff was friendly and helpful!",5,2019,08,19
237,Dublin,"This hotel is perfectly located. You can cross the bridge and be in the Temple Bar area within a couple of minutes, but avoid the all night noise of those hotels. 
We stayed here and in Temple Bar and in hindsight should’ve just stayed at The Morrison the entire time.
The room was large, quiet, clean and had everything we needed. The first night we were exhausted from the travel and had room service. It was better than most of the food we had in Galway! 
I would certainly stay here again.",5,2019,08,19
237,Beautiful hotel,"On check in, Maria, was lovely. She was cheerful, helpful and arranged a table in the restaurant for me within minutes of my arrival.
The room was exceptionally clean, with a fresh smell.
The restaurant was very busy, my food took a long time to come, and was cold. Full apology from the manager and my meal, once hot, was lovely.
I would stay again, as my issue was resolved quietly and professionally.",4,2019,08,18
237,Great location!,Located right across from Temple Bar area. The staff was wonderful. We booked three rooms for five people. Anything we needed was addressed promptly and completely. The bartenders were great. They recommended drinks and places to visit and were overall great to have a chat with -- we will definitely stay here again. We walked to pubs every evening and taxi rides to Aviva Stadium and the Guiness Tour were less than 20 Euro for our whole group.,5,2019,08,17
237,Another great night.,"We are home on a flying visit to Dublin and decided to spend a night in the city. We have spent many lovely nights in this hotel and this night didn't disappoint. The warm welcome from Giovanna on reception set the tone for another great stay. Our room was 314 which had a slightly different orientation as the bed faced the large window/ small balcony area and the television was to the left hand side on the desk. The bathroom was spacious but lacking natural light and the door opened into the bedroom although these are minor complaints. We had a complimentary glass of white wine in the bar while waiting on a friend and our Portuguese waitress was lovely( I'm sorry I didn't get her name).
We ate out of the hotel and returned late following a trip to the cinema. Chocolates in our room were a nice touch as we are Diamond members. The bed was comfy but the design of the base leaves a lot to be desired as it squeaks even with normal movement.  
Breakfast was very good and served until 12 noon with a large variety of hot and cold dishes. We used the multi story car park next door but didn't available of the discount as we had used our Ezpass tag on our car. 
Overall a great stay and we shall definitely return.",4,2019,08,17
237,"Good, expensive hotel in center of town","We stayed here 4 nights in August 2019. The hotel has 145 rooms (but it creates the impression to be much smaller) and is located on the north bank of the Liffey River, walking distance from the city center and main points of interest. Staff in the hotel is very friendly and helpful. Wi-Fi in the hotel is free and good. 
We enjoyed the stay but the hotel is expensive. 

The first 2 nights we stayed in a Junior Suite (room 211) which is a spacious (35 m2) room. 
After 2 nights we were upgraded to a very spacious one-bedroom Suite (70 m2) with river view (room 330). 

The rooms we stayed in have good lighting and a very nice (colorful) atmosphere. There is a minibar, a kettle to make tea or coffee and a Nespresso machine. There is also a safe, iron and iron board. 
Both rooms have a spacious bathroom with separate bathtub and shower. Unfortunately both bathrooms had poor lighting and no atmosphere at all. It seems the decorator of the rooms has not been involved with the bathrooms. 
The rooms were pleasantly clean but the floors of both bathrooms were full of stains and could benefit from a thorough cleaning. 

Breakfast was not included in our stay and due to the costs (€17,50 when you book in advance, € 22,00 without advance booking) we didn’t have breakfast here. 
We did have dinner in the restaurant (Morrison Grill) and this was excellent value for money: €18 for very good fish and chips and the same price for a similar Angus beef and Guinness stew. 

It is a real pity that they facilitate smoking in front of the entrance by  hanging the ashtray literally next to the entrance. Sometimes you enter or exit the hotel through a cloud of cigarette smoke.",4,2019,08,16
237,Good hotel if you want to be in this neighborhood,"Let me begin by noting my prejudice: I found the Temple Bar area and adjoining neighborhood revolting and was not charmed by the dozens of bars featuring loud music and young drunk people. If you want to be in this area then this is the hotel for you--although it might be outside your budget if you are in Dublin for a cheap drunk.

Staff are friendly and helpful. Rooms are cleaned professionally. Two strange features in the room we had: almost no place to store the clothing you unpack and only one bathrobe in a room for two people. Excellent walk-in shower but no tub. Comfortable bed with good quality linens. The breakfast was quite good (both buffet and menu items) but the coffee is way below the standard of the other items on offer. The hotel bar was good and the drinks were not very expensive. The one meal we had in the restaurant was very good for a hotel restaurant and the service was excellent.

We would not stay at this hotel again but not because the hotel was inadequate--the hotel was fine but its surroundings were extremely depressing.",4,2019,08,15
237,Perfect location. Great room and comfy bed.,Love this location for sightseeing. Close to everything we wanted to see. Hotel was spotless clean and the bed/bedding was so comfy. Couldn’t have picked a better place to stay in Dublin. The breakfast was plentiful and delicious. Would definitely recommend. ,5,2019,08,15
237,Hands down the best hotel in Dublin,"I’ve stayed at the Morrisson during all five of my visits to Dublin in the last year. The rooms are beautiful and the location is perfect. Even when they are full, the ambience stays chic and relaxing. 

On more than one occasion, Fiona has bent over backwards for me. I lost my wallet and my phone during two separate stays and she helped me tremendously. 

You may not be able to check in early, but the rooms are worth the wait. I’ve always felt safe, cared for and eighth at home.",5,2019,08,15
237,Great hotel; great location,"Great hotel; great location; clean and friendly - would stay again and highly recommend if you're going to Dublin - walking distance to almost every important location - restaurant is nice - rooms are small, but its expected in city hotel; value is good but a little pricey. ",5,2019,08,14
237,5 Star Accommodations!,"We had a wonderful experience, with an upgrade to a suite overlooking the Liffey River!  The room was elegantly appointed, spotless, large bathroom with shower and tub, and large sitting area.  The staff made our stay effortless, and were very accommodating!  Located in the heart of Dublin within walking distance of sights such as Temple Bar, Trinity College, Grafton Street, St. Stephen's Green, to name a few.  Large buffet or ala crate breakfast every morning with a variety of delicious options.  I highly recommend this hotel when visiting Dublin!",5,2019,08,12
237,Dublin Double Tree Morrison,"Stayed here for the weekend on a one day business trip / weekend tour of Dublin for the weekend.  Location was fantastic.  Able to walk to most tourist attractions in 10 minutes or less.  A few were about a 20 min walk, like Guinness.  Rooms were adequate if alone and you plan on only sleeping & showering.  Pretty small for much else.  Breakfast was a good set up with some a la carte choices and a good sized buffet.  Reception staff was friendly and helpful when I had questions.  I would stay here again.",4,2019,08,08
237,Convenient location and comfortable room,"We booked for two nights and were pleased with the quality of the room: large bed, funky pink lights, spacious bathroom with bath, iron, robes, safe and umbrella! Surprised not to have a pillow menu as I thought this was standard with quality hotels. Room was fairly quiet but given the proximity to Temple Bar, weekends are always going to be animated... if you're a light sleeper, ask for a quiet room as we heard the revellers in the apartment opposite.",4,2019,08,07
237,Newer hotel in a great location,"The hotel is in a convenient spot, with most of Dublin's attractions within an easy walk.  Temple Bar is right across the river for easy access to the pub scene.  The room was spacious and clean and the breakfast had a lot to choose from.  We would definitely stay here again when back in Dublin.",5,2019,08,06
237,Excellent hotel in excellent location,Stayed here for 1 night and hard to find any fault. As usual Hilton did not disappoint and the location makes this an ideal hotel to stay in for sightseeing in or working in Dublin. Quality of restaurant and breakfast also did not disappoint,4,2019,08,03
237,Excellent hotel,"Walking distance to popular attractions! Many food options and supermarkets nearby. Beautiful hotel, every employee was very nice and helpful. Check-in was fast, free cookie was delicious. The room was clean and had cool lighting. Bed and pillows were super comfortable. I could go on...everything was perfect. ",5,2019,07,31
237,Great location.,"Clean, modern hotel at great location and well-appointed rooms.
Helpful and professional staff. Wi fi was a little slow. 
You need air conditioning in Dublin on occasion in summer, the Morrison has it. Only thing, it does not run unless you are in the room and your key is in a slot that feeds electricity. A good idea to curb unnecessary use when out, but takes a bit to cool room down on return. ",4,2019,07,29
237,Another excellent stay at Morrison Double Tree in Dublin,"Among many hotels in Dublin, the Morrison stands out due to the 1st class staff services throughout entire hotel - room maintenance, bar, restaurant, breakfast lounge, front desk.  The rooms are clean, water pressure is as expected, additional perks for Diamond Hilton Honor members.   The restaurant serves the dishes we found to be better quality than majority of places around.   Will stay there whenever possible. The only negatives: WiFi signal was low, a bit on a expensive side, and seagulls were too noisy.  ",5,2019,07,29
237,Wonderful start to our vacation!!,"I posted earlier but had to repost  because I would be remiss not to mention the wonderful service we received from Jason.  I called a couple days before our arrival to ask about parking and early check-in.  When I said when we'd arrive Jason let us know he'd be working and to ask for him.  How pleasant it was to meet him after a long overnight flight!  We felt very taken care of! We weren't able to check in right away but he called us as soon as it was available. As for the hotel, this was so worth a splurge of hhonors points! All the staff, including the servers in the restaurant were fantastic.  The room was perfect with lots of outlets and USB charging ports. And the breakfast was wonderful. Thank you so much for making our anniversary stay so lovely!",5,2019,07,29
237,One of the BEST Hotels in Dublin,"Stayed two nights. Departure 29th July. We will be staying here regularly as my wife goes for Chemotherapy in the Mater hospital which is only minutes away. 
The Staff went out of their way to show us extraordinary kindness throughout. Making the check in and out experience stress free.
Rooms are excellent. The cleanliness is superb. Food portions are big and very well presented in the restaurant. Breakfast area is well layed out and all the staff are extremely attentive and interact very well with the guests. I’ve already booked two more nights. Looking forward to our next visit.
Thanks to all the staff and especially Rory the manager.
Top class.",5,2019,07,29
237,Checked all the boxes,"We stayed two nights at the Morrison after a long day's travel from California.  It was in a great location, had very comfortable beds and linens and the service could not be better.  Only complaint is the shower was quite narrow and there was limited space to put toiletries.  The location is excellent, a very short walk over the bridge to the restaurants and pubs of Temple Bar and to all the sights of the city.  it was also just far enough to spare us from the noise of happy revelers entering and exiting those pubs at night.  We slept well.  There are also several cafe's and restaurants on a pedestrian street a short block away from the hotel on the same side of the river.  We found the location to be perfect. Had a decent sized lobby and a restaurant and bar. Would absolutely stay again.",4,2019,07,28
237,"Great Location, Helpful Staff","This would be 5 stars except for an undeserved charge. First the hotel is in a nice location, walkable to most things we wanted to do. Right across from Temple Bar. The staff was helpful. We arrived early so I understand room may not be available but realize with international travelers some type of estimate would be helpful instead of we have a list of people. The wait was long, close to regular checkin time from the morning. In addition, Hilton corporate messed up the reservation stating that the room could accommodate 3 but 2 was the max per front desk. Because of my Hilton status the room was upgraded to a suite, very much appreciated BUT I had to pay an additional 50 Euros per night for a roll away. In good faith, I dont think this should have been charged but yet it was. Be aware that depending on location of your room, you may encounter outside noise. Understandable as this is a city but there was some type of buisness across the street from us where workers did speak loud the entire stay of 2 nights. Overall a good stay.",4,2019,07,28
237,A Dublin-Treat Hotel,"Very clean, modern, bright and airy property with a great attention to detail with everything in the right place for a most enjoyable stay. Well positioned on the river bank with all the Bars, Restaurants and shopping within easy waking distance.",4,2019,07,24
237,Great Hotel in Dublin!,"Very clean, modern, air conditioned, quiet and the location just across the river from Temple Bar made this the perfect hotel.  I'm not sure what else anyone would want out of a hotel.  We will definitely stay again when we are in Dublin.  ",5,2019,07,22
237,Very impressive,"We stayed here for two nights. The rooms are large, modern and very clean. Bathrooms are fantastic with great quality products. 
Great location. Walking distance to Temple Bar, shopping and food. 
Warm welcome cookie on arrival a nice touch. Staff very friendly. Free wifi. Would stay again. ",5,2019,07,22
237,Treated like royality ,"As a Hilton Gold member, I am used to staying at Hilton properties and getting star treatment, but here they really did exceed my expectations.

Location-
The hotel is in a great location, you cannot get any more central than this! Other than to the airport and back, we walked everywhere in no time.

Rooms-
From check in, I was upgraded to a suite with a view of the river. The room was newly refurbished, and from reading other reviews on here where they said the bathroom was a let down...our bathroom was brand spanking new with a great shower and tub too. Lovely touches by the staff with a hand written note and chocolates left in the room to welcome me. Room decor is light, minimalist and has great huge windows with natural light....always a plus in hotel rooms. Nice and convenient plug points too, especially round the bed with USB ports. Often you stay in hotels which you have to unplug the bedside lamp to charge your phone, or leave it at the study desk to charge so far from the bed, so the small touches really matter and go far in this hotel. Beds are huge and comfy. Good toiletries in the bathroom too...makes a difference when as a female you rely on them when travelling. 

Staff-
Staff were incredible. The automated text service checking all is ok makes it easy for you to communicate if there is an issue and for things to be fixed, but of course this was not necessary with us. So just ended up getting alot of nice texts asking if everything is ok, and them receiving lovely replies with it being great. 

Breakfast-
As a Gold member, breakfast is included for free, and so I was grateful for what we were given, but had I paid for breakfast, I feel this is the only area the hotel can improve upon. Choice was pretty poor, compared to the rest of the Hilton hotels and despite being able to order off the menu, eggs were overcooked, avocado on sourdough was not on sourdough, and had shop bought guacamole underneath fresh avo, and covered in so much balsamic vinegar it was not edible. The buffet option was limited, with only scrambled eggs to choose from.
Coffee was very average in the breakfast area but we had a nespresso machine in the room,so relied on that for a good fix. I will say as someone who is lactose intolerant, they did have a few options of non-dairy milks which you do not often get in even 5* hotels, so that was a bonus.

Gym-
Used the gym once, and for a hotel gym was very well equipped. Open 24 hours as well.

Would highly recommend staying here. Service, quality and standards are very high.

237,Our 4th Stay at our Favorite Hotel in the heart of Dublin!  Truly Amazing GM Rory Rooney...,"Another amazing stay at the Morrison located in the heart of Dublin.  This time my husband and I stayed for 3 nights.   Beautiful hotel with true Irish Hospitality starting with the Deputy General Manager Rory Rooney.  
Mr. Rooney was visible throughout our stay at the Morrison and checked in with my husband and I several times to ensure we had an excellent stay.  He is truly an excellent role model for his staff.
Would like to say thank you to Malo at Front Desk, Hugh at Breakfast, and Fernanda who remembered my name from our last stay in November who are all excellent employees.
All meals are Excellent at the Morrison.  We especially love the Irish Breakfast.  There is nothing like it!
Rooms are spacious and beautiful with very comfortable beds and pillows and air conditioning.  
Great hotel to experience Irish Hospitality for yourself...  It is worth the treat!",5,2019,07,21
237,Fantastic Stay! Great breakfast!,"Overall, this place was fantastic!

Pros:
- Great location - just walk over the bridge and you're in Temple Bar. Easy walk to a bunch of restaurants and pubs with live music. Lots of fun!

- Big, comfy bed + large room. It was nice to be able to spread out a bit for a few nights.

- Wonderful breakfast! We were able to use our points to get the breakfast and they had SO many options. There's a buffet with eggs, bacon, sausage, smoothies, pastries, cereal, juice porridge, etc. Plus you can order from a menu (pancakes, waffles, etc!) 

- Very friendly staff - they were so welcoming and helpful.

Cons:
- The only con was that our room ""window"" overlooked the stairs, so we couldn't see outside, which was a bummer, especially in a city you've never been in.",5,2019,07,20
237,Gorgeous hotel and incredible Staff.  Fantastic downtown location!,"The Morrison is absolutely gorgeous, the lobby, restaurants and rooms are beautifully furnished and clean.  As you enter you will be greeted with wonderful smiles from the individuals at the Reception desk.  Check in was easy, they were very helpful with the parking and providing maps and tips of where to go and what to do.
You do not need a car from the hotel as everything is within walking distance, which is great especially if you are out in the Temple Bar area late to enjoy the great Irish Music, beer and atmosphere.
The breakfast is ""huge"" lots of choices from full Irish, cereals, fresh fruit, yogurts, breads, pastries, great coffees and wonderful atmosphere.  The breakfast room in the Halo Restaurant feels like you are attending a party, beautiful wooden tables and comfy sofas to sit on.
We can really recommend the hotel, bar and restaurants, great value!
The trip was for a 60th birthday.  We received glasses of complimentary Proseco and lovely chocolates in our room....such a wonderful surprise.
Thanks to the Morrison for making our stay in Dublin so extra special, we look forward to returning soon!",5,2019,07,17
237,What a great place!,"The friendly staff, the quality food, the comfort of the rooms, the location, the overall atmosphere were fantastic.  We had issues with our luggage being delayed and the people at the Morrison could not have been more understanding and helpful.  Do not hesitate to stay here if you get the chance.",5,2019,07,15
237,Great wedding anniversary getaway,"We stayed 2 nights here and the treatment was super from staff. Food is amazing, dinner and breakfast. Close walk to temple bar, Stephens green and rooms are so clean and fresh. Got upgraded to junior suite for our 10th anniversary . Amazing weekend , can’t wait to go back. ",5,2019,07,15
237,Great hotel.  Great staff.  Great location.  Reasonable price.,"Great location right across the river from Temple Bar.  Short walk to Grafton Street, Guinness tour, Jamesons tour, etc.  Great bar downstairs.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  Rooms are big enough and are light and airy.  Ask for a river view when you check in.  You can feel good about booking here.",5,2019,07,15
237,Wonderful choice in Dublin,"We recently stayed two nights at the Morrison as part of our 25th Anniversary trip through Ireland and want to express our thanks to the staff at the hotel for making it such a wonderful stay! The room was lovely, the bed comfortable, and the breakfast delicious. The proximity to the heart of the city made our whole stay in Dublin walkable and easy. As a Dimond member celebrating our anniversary, they left us a thoughtful acknowledgment in our room which we appreciated. We recommend The Morrison for a delightful stay in Dublin!",5,2019,07,15
237,Very nice hotel with Air Conditioning & restaurant & bar,All employees were very nice. the food was good in the restaurant. It is a very hot summer here and we chose a hotel in Dublin that had air conditioning. The bar staff were very friendly. Close to everything.,5,2019,07,14
237,Great Business Experience,"excellent hotel for in city access, excellent for business, fast, excellent food and very quiet!  i will definitely recommend staying, the staff is very friendly and their room service is top.  i was very pleased.",5,2019,07,11

",5,2019,07,07
237,"Lovely hotel, wonderful staff","The staff here deserves high marks for being accommodating, friendly, and helpful.  The hotel itself is quite nice, with comfortable rooms and nice public areas.  Most of all though, it a fantastic location--you can easily walk to just about anywhere you are likely to want to go in downtown Dublin.  Highly recommended.",5,2019,07,04
237,Dreamy First Rate Luxury Hotel and Breakfast,"If you can manage the breakfast package, do it, and try to book in advance so you can get a room with view onto the street. Rooms are smallish but you'll spend most of your time outdoors with the knockout neighboring communities. A brief short walk to whatever you wish to experience in Dublin, whether cuisine, the pub crawl row, mall and movie theatre, museums or storytelling like Leprechaun Museum. And the workers are ever so helpful and conscientious. My son dropped his iPhone when moving luggage, and the workers turned it in so we got it back. Breakfast is amazing and set in a cheery, posh dining hall that's elegant and stylish without pretense. Staying at this hotel was our best experience of Dublin. Glad we were able to get two nights here at least.",5,2019,07,03
237,"Excellent stay, and it should have been for the price.","The hotel seems very new.  It's clean and the rooms are large and quiet.  The restaurant and bar were great.  It is an absolutely excellent 3 star hotel, however the rates we paid were more in line with 4 star prices in the area.",5,2019,07,03
237,Comfortable in a good location,"The location across the river from Temple Bar is convenient, and the hotel is quite stylish.
I've stayed here several times, and my only complaint is that a bit more attention could have been given to livability in the rooms - they look great, but lighting is a nuisance to deal with (too many switches, oddly located) and drawer and hanging space is severely lacking for anything more than a single person staying a day or two.",4,2019,07,02
237,"Nice hotel, good location ","Lovely hotel across from Temple Bar. Room was very nice - pretty good size for Europe, “funky” in a good way and all the usual niceties. Location is fantastic - near the top spots but largely outside the crowds and noise. Very helpful staff - received several texts during my stay to check up. ",4,2019,07,02
237,"Nice location, helpful staff","This DoubleTree hotel is ideally located for business and tourists alike. It is just across from the Temple Bar area of Dublin.
Check in was prompt and friendly, the warm cookie on arrival is a lovely touch. The room was clean and had nice decoration to it. Nice touches such as coloured led lighting and a multiple pillows made the stay very comfortable. 
Only down side was that the rooms had thin walls so sounds from around the hotel could be heard, like people walking around, lifts etc.
Breakfast is available both buffet and a la Carte. However it takes up to 20 minutes for a la Carte items to be cooked. 
Staff were helpful with booking taxis. Small gym located on ground floor with basic gym equipment but nicely organised and clean.",3,2019,06,27
237,"Modern, well appointed hotel, just steps away from all the action!","Stayed here for one night prior to returning home and I truly enjoyed every moment of it. We arrived in the afternoon around 2 and had a seamless check-in process. We had stayed in Dublin a few weeks prior and knew where to go and what to do and were truly impressed with the excellent location of this property. The hotel is just a 3 minute walk from the Temple Bar district and a 5-10 minute walk from many of the city center's best attractions. The hotel is modern, sleek, and well appointed. The staff is very friendly, helpful and efficient. As an HHonor member they provided us with complimentary water, cookies and of course free drink tickets which was a nice touch. A special thanks to Giovanna who did her best to get us a taxi right away upon check out since we had to get to the airport earlier than anticipated. The hotel has good WiFi and excellent A/C in the event that it is needed during a heatwave. My only gripe about our room was that the bathroom was a bit dated (as opposed to the actual room which was modern, very comfortable and well appointed). The bathroom also had a tub that was extremely high, while not a problem for me it would be an issue for anyone that has mobility issues. Despite this minor defect, the hotel is wonderful and I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting beautiful Dublin.",5,2019,06,26
237,Superb Customer Service!,The hotel has a wonderful location on the River Liffey and is close to many of Dublin's landmarks.  I have stayed at this hotel numerous times and am always pleasantly surprised by the continued outstanding customer service.  Thank you!,5,2019,06,25
237,Great location on the river Liffey,Worth it to ask for a river view. Breakfast was included with our stay and was wonderful! Staff was incredible! Great hotel with a good location for walking to everything. We did take a cab to the Guinness tour and the staff is always ready to call you a cab and quickly.,5,2019,06,23
237,"Great staff, lovely evening","We reserved some space for a private function, which worked out very nicely, cordoned off within the main bar. Staff were so helpful, and food was good, catering for all dietary requirements. Would recommend!",4,2019,06,23
237,Overnight stay for concert,"Lovely hotel with very pleasant bar and restaurant staff. Great service, everything you need. Fantastic location in heart of city. Everything you’d expect at breakfast but cooked breakfast not the tastiest if I’m honest. Otherwise a lovely stay. Would stay again when in Dublin.",5,2019,06,21
237,great place,"We stayed there during our vacations in Dublin last year and the year before. We booked five nights again this summer.
The hotel has a great breakfast! The staff is friendly and helpful. The rooms are spacious. 
If you can, try to get a  river view room.",5,2019,06,21
237,Great Place to Stay,First trip to Ireland and the Morrison was an great choice for accommodation. The location places you in easy walking distance to most all of the main local attractions. The hotel staff were very welcoming and helpful. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. We ate at both the restaurant and the breakfast while guests and found the food to be exceptional especially compared to other hotels I have frequented in the past. The Morrison was a great choice for a hotel and helped make our first trip to Ireland fantastic experience. We plan to return to Ireland and stay at the Morrison in the future. First time I ever wrote a review but I thought the hotel and staff deserved it.,5,2019,06,20
237,"Great hotel, great location",My husband and I visited Dublin for the first time and stayed at this hotel. It is very centrally located and within walking distance to many of the city’s top attractions. Giovanna greeted us on arrival and was very welcoming and helpful.  The hotel itself was perfect with all of the amenities we would expect and need for this visit.,5,2019,06,19
237,Great Stay,We stayed here for 2 nights- I wish it was longer. The hotel is great- very comfortable bed and nice updated shower with hot water and great pressure. We did not have a car at the time- I know there is a garage 30 seconds from hotel. The location is wonderful- just across the water from the main noisy busy center- with temple bar and plenty of restaurants. Easy to navigate.,5,2019,06,18
237,"Modern, Friendly Service & Good Location","We stayed at the Morrison after having stayed at The Westbury Dublin initially (in April 2017) and this review is a bit late. The first part of the trip was paid for by my company as part of an incentive trip and we decided to extend our stay, but change hotels. We were very pleased with our choice of going to the Morrison. The staff were extremely friendly and gave us great recommendation. The location was still very good and we walked everywhere from it. Loved the Irish coffee at the hotel bar. Definitely would be back if we are visiting Ireland again.",5,2019,06,18
237,The Morrison,Great location right next to the Ha Penny foot bridge and Temple bar area. Hotel is clean and comfortable but know that you have to use your keycard to keep the electric on in your room! Took us a while to figure out how to use it. Room entry door is not very soundproof. Room doors are very close together so you hear every word in hallway regardless of the time of day.,4,2019,06,15
237,Lovely hotel with wonderful staff located just across the river from Temple Bar - a perfect stay!,"Pros:
* Location: Location is perfect, just across the river from Temple Bar
* Room: Large and comfortable 
* Breakfast: Substantial and tasty, with excellent service
* Service: All staff were lovely, friendly and helpful

Cons:
* Nothing comes to mind

Location: 
This was my first trip to Dublin and I wanted to be close to Temple Bar, without being smack in the middle of the noisy nightlife. The Morrison is perfectly located directly across the river, about a 5 minute walk to Temple Bar. Other attractions, like Jameson, Guinness, Trinity College, Stephen's Green and Dublin Castle are all an easy walk. We never needed a taxi or public transport - we walked everywhere!

Room: 
The room was good sized and included a comfy king size bed, desk, closet and room for luggage. I especially liked the bed, premium linens and a very comfortable mattress. Bathroom was great too, I loved the rain shower head. Decor was modern and tasteful and seemed recently refurbished. In-room coffee and tea was available and two bottles of water were left for us daily.

Breakfast and Bar: Breakfast was delicious! They serve a full buffet, including premium meats (Irish bacon and sausages), puddings, cold meats and cheeses, cereals, juices, coffees and fresh fruit. I loved how every item was clearly labeled, some including the origin of the food item. In addition, there is a menu of other options (including vegan), like eggs Benedict, pancakes, avocado toast and omelettes. Service was always so friendly. I felt as though the staff was happy to see me daily. I especially want to thank Marrianne (I hope I got her name right) for her kindness and suggestions for sight seeing in Dublin. Bartenders were also extremely friendly and helpful. I believe one of them was named Luke and he was helpful in explaining how the local transit (Leap card) worked and where to get one. Thanks to the great staff for a memorable stay. Long after I've forgotten what the room looked like, I will remember how nice the staff was.

I am very glad I stayed at the Morrison and would not hesitate to stay there again.",5,2019,06,15
237,Afternoon Tea,"Booked 2 for 'Fancy Pants' and 2 for 'Vegan' afternoon tea and was not disappointed. Lovely setting, amazing staff and also really good value for what you get. Everything was just perfect. I would definitely recommend.",5,2019,06,14
237,Exceptional experience!,"We loved The Morrison. Staff, especially Rhea, was very kind and accommodating at every level. The kids loved coming in everyday and given warm, delicious cookies (and so did the Moms)! Rooms were spacious, well appointed, and close to many things. Wi-fi worked perfectly. This was a winner and we would definitely choose to stay here again! ",5,2019,06,13
237,Perfect location for an overnight stay,"Unbeatable location right in the heart of everything, very comfortable and clean room, friendly staff, amazing spread at breakfast with high quality items - I loved their french toast!!! It's the perfect choice for my short stay in Dublin.",5,2019,06,13
237,Fabulous Stay in Dublin!,"This was our first trip to Ireland, we decided at the last minute to take the luxury Ferry over to Dublin for a few days as we were travelling from Canada and wanted to make the most of our time abroad.

We booked this hotel on a last minute whim and were not disappointed. The location is stellar! Really ideal. Close to everything. It's right on the river Liffey, close to all the tourist attractions, we walked everywhere from there including the Temple Bar area , Guiness Brewery, the shopping district, the University, you name it, it's within walking distance. We had a nice view of the river and often just sat and watched the people and traffic, really nice.

The staff was very friendly and accommodating, the hotel is very modern and clean. Our room was comfortable, clean and had almost everything i look for in a hotel. I have been spoiled I suppose, as i now expect a Nespresso machine in my room, so when there isn't one, I can't help but feel disappointed, but hopefully one day, every hotel will have one in each room, that would be fantastic! I really appreciate good coffee and free water, those are the two ""must haves"" as far as i'm concerned.

However, I have no complaints about this hotel, everything was really fantastic, and i would highly recommend it to anyone travelling to Dublin.",4,2019,06,11
237,So accommodating!,"We spent one night at the Morrison on a quick stop through Dublin. The hotel manager, Simon, was VERY accommodating before we even arrived, and found a bar for my husband and I to watch the Boston Bruins play in the Stanley Cup (which did not start until 1:30AM). The room was nice and clean! Highly recommend!!",5,2019,06,11
237,Great location and tremendous customer service,We could not be more pleased with our choice to stay here. The location is central and the employees are the most friendly and helpful people you could hope to encounter. We all loved our stay here. Special thank you to the young man that checked us in along with Stephan and Rodolfo (?).,5,2019,06,10
237,Great place to stay in Dublin!,"Excellent location, right on the River Liffey. Nice rooms, courteous staff. We will stay here again on our next visit to Dublin! It’s worth the small upcharge to get a room with a river view. Nice bar and restaurant in hotel too.",5,2019,06,10
237,Central location. New and modern,Nice hotel central to Dublin. A short walk to the main tourist points as well as mass transit. Breakfast buffet is good with lots of choices. Restaurant seems to struggle and we didn’t see more than a few dining in the evenings. Room is large and modern.  Quiet nights and comfortable bed ,5,2019,06,09
237,Lovely stay and would return,"The hotel is on the outskirts and only a 5 minute walk into town. 

Lovely modern rooms and friendly staff. Room has a fridge which was useful and the bathroom is good. 

Would highly recommend and would return here ",5,2019,06,07
237,The best Negroni in town.,"It is so good to pop in here for a cocktail where the bartenders are consummate professionals. These boys know how to make and skake or muddle and stir a cocktail.
On two occasions in the past month, I have tasted the best Negronis ever ( and this includes those in Naples, Sorrento and Sicily !!)",5,2019,06,05
237,Fabulous Hotel,Such a lovely hotel from the very friendly & efficient Front Desk (Jason) to the excellent buffet breakfast.  I must say the guys of the breakfast service were all excellent.  Very friendly and attentive.  This hotel is only a 2 min walk across the river to the Temple Bar so all the fun without the noise when trying to sleep.   I've been a Hilton Gold or Diamond for many years and this is the best DoubleTree branded property I ever stayed at.  Bright fresh and clean!!!  ,5,2019,06,03
237,Just Fab,My mum and I stayed here for one night while I was getting laser done on my eyes. From the moment we checked in the staff were so friendly and helpful. We arrived a earlier than the actual check in time and just expected to be able to drop our bags into a luggage room but we were given our room with tasty complimentary cookies. That evening we had a lovely meal in the bar area and the girl working was more than helpful. The latte and tea we got aftee were extremely well presented and we got some complimentary treats which were yum. She even provided my mum with a little box of rice to help dry out her phone which had fallen into water. The rooms were very nice and comfy too. The location of the hotel is great just a two minute walk to the Jervis Centre and just across the bridge to the Temple Bar area. I would have no hesitation staying here again and would highly recommend it. Thanks for a lovely stay.,5,2019,06,03
237,Ok stay,I was given the option of switching my room during my online check in but was technically not able to.  Why provide this option?  At the hotel I asked again but was told I could not switch rooms.  I ordered a pizza through room service and it was really horrible.,3,2019,06,02
237,"Awesome location, great stay","Best location, close to Temple Bar and Downton Dublin close, within walking distance.  Hotel was updated, clean, overall great.  Highly recommend.  Be aware this is called The Morrison, don't look for Double Tree.  ",5,2019,06,02
237,Excellent experience ...,"Excellent service and close to all eateries with great location. If you want to be close to the Temple Bar area, this is the place to stay at.

The room was clean with complementary water daily. Also, it had all the necessary things that made my stay great. ",5,2019,06,02
237,Wonderful stay in Downtown Dublin,"Fantastic stay in center of downtown Dublin.  Close to all of major attractions.  This property was immaculate and squeaky clean.  Great dinner at their hotel restaurant!  Close enough to everything, but a short convenient walk across Millennium Bridge.  This location allowed peace & quiet away from the noisy Temple Bar area.",5,2019,05,30
237,Great location,Very convenient location for an overnight stay in Dublin. Rooms were very modern and clean. Bar/restaurant and front desk staff were all very friendly and helpful. We were able to walk right across the bridge into Temple Bar to meet family for dinner.,5,2019,05,29
237,Great visit here,"Great visit here; May 2019.  Staff were helpful and friendly.  I stayed in a premium king room, which was large and appeared recently renovated.  Bathroom was huge.  Floor to ceiling windows; although the view from my room was just city buildings, not particularly inspiring!  Good wifi/internet.  Had a coffee pot and refrigerator in the room.  Hotel is well situated for tourist attractions in Dublin.  Breakfast buffet was nice, standard Hilton breakfast buffet.",5,2019,05,28
237,Great hotel in central location for Dublin City,"I can't fault this hotel - the staff were all very friendly and helpful, the room clean and comfortable, and the location ideal for exploring Dublin.
As a city hotel it is quite expensive and we didn't eat here, preferring to explore the surrounding cafes and restaurants.
If you arrive by car be warned that Dublin is very busy and full of bus lanes, making it difficult to gauge which lane you need to be in.  On the one way system you will need to take the left lane for Jervis street (signposted a long way ahead of the turn but difficult to access later as it means crossing the full bus and taxi lane).  The Morrison Hotel is on the corner, but there is no parking so you need to continue straight to the next public car park on the left hand side.  You then take your parking ticket into the hotel and they will stamp it for you which entitles you to a discount bringing it down to a cost of 19 euros a day.",5,2019,05,25
237,Great hotel and staff,"Came to Dublin for a night and was excited to check the city out. This hotels location is right in the center of everything we wanted to do! Staff was extremely friendly and helpful, room was fantastic. ",5,2019,05,24
237,Great for Small Corporate Group,"As someone who lived in Limerick, Ireland for 4 months, I was a little picky on our location for the hotel for a corporate reward trip I was planning for my company. In total we had 20 guests staying at the Morrison and I cannot say enough words to thank the staff and praise this hotel. First, Sarah Glennon was amazing with all of the changes, workarounds, headcounts, etc. Even on site, she was attentive to our needs and frequently checked in. Second, the thing that is always the hardest when planning group travel is knowing the outside space...will there be enough room for pick-up and drop-off points? is the front door easy to access from multiple ways? how close is it to points of interest? - This hotel's location was perfect. It was never too crowded, was right across from the Temple Bar area (bridge across the Liffey), and had easy access for pick-ups and drop-offs. Third, I always wait to see what the small things are that really put the cherry on top of events. The check-in was easy and a great experience, especially with the warm cookie (bonus, they gave us more after a night at the bars!). Then our breakfast lead, Hugh, was very accommodating. He brought us to go boxes for early mornings and made sure everything stayed warm and fresh. Our evening lead (I forget her name!!), she was also accommodating. She showed me the room, asked about some light music. It was just perfect. I couldn't have asked for a better hotel for our event. I highly recommend The Morrison for both individual travelers and group travel (both corporate and non-corporate).",5,2019,05,23
237,"Great service, clean, lovely staff","Very nice, helpful staff. Our room was beautiful and clean with a lovely view of the canal. My fiancé proposed that day and they sent us a lovely card with chocolate and Champagne. Edit, who checked us in and got us an upgrade, was an amazing concierge. Highly recommend.",5,2019,05,20
237,Convenient and modern,"We enjoyed our three night stay in a King room. The hotel is very clean and our room was spacious. We had all the modern conveniences to make our stay comfortable. The River Liffey is just out your door and Temple Bar district just on the other side of the bridge. Location is perfect for walking to either train stations (Connolly or Heuston), shopping on Grafton Street. We would stay at this location again.",5,2019,05,20
237,Well central ,"Location is center and convenience. Few restaurants nearby.  The building and hotel room structure a bit odd, wide walkway corridor, two lifts, washroom has one large empty space while hanger is next to dustbin, small wardrobe, aircond facing the bed on the side etc. Pillow and bed too soft. Good breakfast variety and able to order grab and go as early as 5.30am. Free add bottle water for members. Reception friendly and helpful. It was cheaper compared to other doubletree chains. ",3,2019,05,16
237,Modern and clean,"Everyone was super nice. Restaurant and bar were very nice. Wait staff prompt and courteous. Great location on the River Liffey at city center. Room was very nice and very clean. Got there early, they locked up our bags and sent us a text when the room was ready.",5,2019,05,16
237,Excellent stay on short business trip,"Special mention to Giovanna on the front desk who was excellent and everything Hilton reception staff should be - efficient, smiling, informative, helpful. She checked us in and out.
I was upgraded from normal double to junior suite - probably based on room availability rather than HHonors status as there was a large expo in town.
Junior suite was clean, highlight was a huge bathroom with both rainshower and huge bath. Only gripe and it is a small one, is that the build quality of a few items was sub-standard: bath taps coming away from the bath, couple of sockets poorly finished. Oh, and please invest in stronger hairdryers.",5,2019,05,16
237,Right in the Heart of Dublin ,"Modern, chic, yet utterly comfortable, The Morrison is among my favourite places that I have stayed in terms of proximity to things to do as well design and well-thought out amenities and comfort.

Right on the River Liffey The Morrison is in the thick of culture with a view without feeling cramped as city hub hotels often do.  The Morrison has all of the design to be expected of a world-class, innovative boutique property, but with great bounds of natural light and airyness in both the rooms and the public spaces.

I arrived early in the morning following a transatlantic flight and Solomans desk team got us settled in quickly with that famous cookie. Exhausted we we're delighted to find a large room with bright lighting to get us in and ultimately a nice, firm (read: perfect) bed.

Our room was clean, well designed and cozy. The shower with its oversize head relaxing after long travel.
I look forward to coming back!

I loved dining at the contemporary Morrison Grill under the warm care and coffee making skill of Petra at the tail end of a fabulous tea. She's so kind and hospitable.",5,2019,05,15
237,All round winner,"The all round winner in my book in Dublin, ticks every box in every way from start to finish. Staff are welcoming, friendly and professional, rooms are clean, well equipped and spacious and the facilities exceed expectation. I wouldn't stay anywhere else.",5,2019,05,15
237,One of our best hotel stays ever,"From the moment we entered the reception area, this was a completely perfect and relaxing stay. Every single staff member went out of their way to help us, even in ways we didn't request. They helped us enjoy not only our time at the hotel, but our other activities in the area. Edit, Giovanna and all the other ladies at the front desk and room service were amazing. Fast and efficient. The staff at the Morrison Grill... Simon, Maro, Petra, David and Stevie were awesome. Whomever is the general manager of the Morrison is doing a terrific job and has instilled in his\her staff the passion for excellence that we rarely see throughout an entire stay. Kudos to all if you!!!",5,2019,05,15
237,Of course it is a fantastic location....,"But what really sets this hotel apart is the fantastic service.  At every step the staff seemed to go out of their way to be friendly and accommodating.
Our room as terrific, spacious and sparkling clean.
The breakfast we had in the restaurant might have been some of the best food we ate in Ireland!
Well done Hilton... well done.",5,2019,05,15
237,Best hotel staff in Dublin,Stayed for first time in the Morrison Double Tree in Dublin. I have visited Dublin over a dozen times. This hotel staff was the very best I have ever encountered. Bar staff was knowledgeable and friendly and professional. Breakfast was excellent and the staff was extremely attentive. My dealing with the day manager was excellent. All the house keeping staff greeted me when I walked by. This place is first rate. Highly recommended !,5,2019,05,14
237,Poor value for money,Very expensive but well located Hotel. Nice staff who tried to be helpful but it is overpriced for what you really get. Gym equipment is cheap and limited. And breakfast starts at 07:00 which is hopeless for a businessman. 8 of us sat waiting for breakfast to open. Not great. ,2,2019,05,14
237,"The location was fantastic, but what really made our stay special was Giovanna","Long time Diamond Hilton Honors member. I have stayed at Hilton family hotels all over the world. The ""Morrison"" is a very nice, very comfortable hotel. The location is great, right in the heart of down town Dublin. However, I can't say enough about the people at this hotel. As I said, long (10+ yrs) Diamond Honors member, never have I had workers go so out of their way to make our stay special. A very special thanks to Giovanna, one of the nicest most helpful people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. All the people running this hotel were great. I didn't get all of their names, but a call out to Fiona also.",5,2019,05,13
237,Perfect location to explore Dublin!,"This is a lovely hotel right across the Liffey from Temple Bar - a 5 minute walk to all the action but quiet when it is time to sleep. The room was spacious and clean, as was the bathroom. The bed and pillows were perfect for a good night’s sleep. We even had a bit of a view of the river. We really enjoyed the decor of the hotel and the staff were all lovely and helpful. We ate breakfast at the hotel and there were lots of choices and great service - Eamon was a favorite of ours. I would absolutely stay here again  - we had a great stay. ",5,2019,05,11
237,Excellent location ,"I have been using this hotel for a number of years in Dublin. 

Excellent service 

Rooms very comfortable, trendy, great coffee machines in room.  Breakfast buffet style and lots and lots of different food. 

Nice restaurant and food brilliant and good prices 

Afternoon tea great price and very nicely presented 

The staff can’t do enough for you. 

I will continue to use this hotel for pleasure and business trips

We also used the hotel for two events which were both excellent - staff and food were brilliant",5,2019,05,10
237,I'd rate it a 10 if I could!,"This is THE BEST hotel I've ever stayed in in terms of customer service.  I seriously can't think of anything wrong with our stay and if I could, it would be completely overshadowed by the outstanding employees.
We arrived in Dublin after an overnight flight from the states, customs, a bus ride into Dublin proper and a walk with 4 large suitcases, many smaller bags, a stroller and toddler in tow, etc.  We entered the hotel from Bachelor's Way (which goes into the restaurant and has stairs going up off the street and then stairs going down into reception).  There wasn't a room ready for us yet, but Giovanna came out from behind the desk to help us get our bags to the main level.  Then, because we wanted to freshen up and change clothes, she helped us get everything on the elevator and get downstairs to the restrooms.  I was so embarrassed with all of our bags open (because I had no idea where anything was and we were all exhausted and starving).  Not only did she help us downstairs, but she checked on us and helped get our bags back upstairs to hold as we went off to explore.  There was also a cleaning lady that came by and offered to let us use the pool and spa area in case we wanted to shower.  So kind!
Mid-afternoon we came back to check into our room.  There was a wedding in the hotel, so they kindly put us in room 319, which was a perfect corner room for us away from the noise of the party (if there was any).  They already had a cot set up for our little girl.  Everything was so nice.  
Giovanna must never sleep.  I swear she was at the front desk every time we came or went.  She was so sweet with our little girl.  I just can't get over how well we were treated.
This hotel is a GREAT location to explore Dublin.  The beds were super comfortable.  All in all it was a seriously perfect stay.  If I could rate it a 10, I would!",5,2019,05,08
237,Design hotel in great location,"Interesting modern design, beautiful location but ...
bathroom arrangement very strange and not comfortable, toilette connected to same board as hand-wash but large empty room at the opposite side of the bathroom ... 
would not recommend congress-facilities e.g. meeting-rooms, as without daylight, no telephone spider for webex audio connection etc.",4,2019,05,05
237,Nice Stay - Great location,"The location is perfect for temple bar, just a short walk across the bridge. 

Arrived and left our luggage to explore the city, returning and our room was ready. 
Provided wrong room, call to reception and swapped rooms. 

The room was large with a large bed. No view only of a glass floor below with view in to the breakfast room.

Breakfast was really overpriced at 17euro per person, we found a lovely place in temple bar for breakfast at 10euro.

Hotel is nice - No Wow factor.",3,2019,05,01
237,Top Flight,"From the moment before we arrived I knew these guys got customer service.  They started emailing me before arrival and when I became lost finding my parking (stayed on Fleet St) even offered to drive with me so I might find it ( the streets of Dublin are very confusing). The room was spacious and quite, and the bed very comfortable.  The location is right in the middle of multiple places to eat and right across the river from Temple Bar.  Despite its location the room we had (inner courtyard-no view) it was quite. Jason was very helpful as was another young man (sorry I am horrible with names).  People are what make this location #1.   We were always made to feel like our presence was appreciated. ",5,2019,04,30
237,Excellent location and service,"The hotel is located on Ormond Quay, and entry to reception is on the way to the Jervis Center.  It's a perfect location for getting around Dublin City.  We were attending a gig in Vicar Street and were going to hail a cab but realised it was only about 15 minutes away by foot.  We had to park in the Jervis Street carpark nearby, and it was about 19e for the night. 

On arrival we got our standard warm cookie and also 2 drink vouchers.  The vouchers were limited to house wine and Heineken, but it was still a nice touch.  The staff were lovely on arrival, and while we were checking in I did note that one staff member was dealing with a difficult translatlantic guest, but was marvelously composed. 

The room was overlooking a quiet back-street, and we were not disturbed during the night by any traffic noise. The facilities were of a high standard, and the room had a nice modern design. 

We enjoyed our stay here and would stay again!",4,2019,04,28
237,Wow 3rd wedding anniversary treated fantastic ,We came to this hotel on the 18th till 23rd April for our wedding anniversary.

237,Amazing staff and location,"we love this hotel.  The location is perfect. Right by the Temple Bar district but not in the 'mess' of it.  Behind the hotel are some great spots to go to and restaurants.  Walking distance to everything including the key bus stops.
The staff is amazing. The breakfast is a bit pricey but worth it! Such amazing flavors for the menu items.
We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made sure to make our visit extra special.  The staff really does an great job.
we will visit the hotel again.",5,2019,04,25
237,Great location,"We were in Dublin for Easter weekend.  Just a quick 4 days in the city.  We stayed at the Morrison for it's location.  We were not disappointed.   The hotel was beautiful, the service was impeccable.   The only flaw was the cost of the buffet breakfast.  45 euro for two people (=$70CAD).   That's way too much.   But the food was very good and the staff was great.  ",4,2019,04,25
237,"central, decent standard, nice quiet room, drinks vouchers needs re-appraised","We stayed over the Easter weekend on points. We've stayed here several times, as it's a very central location and the standard is good. As a Diamond we got an upgrade to a premium room, was indeed a genuine upgrade in that it was bigger than previous rooms we stayed in. On check-in we were given the cookies which is always nice, and two drinks vouchers. Shortly after getting to the room, a nice select of 5 butlers chocolates were delivered, which were very tasty..I'm guessing this was also a diamond benefit. The swing tags for the door were amusing ""We're having Craic"" (i.e. do not disturb), or ""You're Grand"" (its ok to do the room).

Breakfast has everything you'd want, and as diamonds we could also order off a small menu. We hung ""You're grand"" and by the time we came back from breakfast the room had been tended.

Parking is just 30 yards away in a public car park at a reduced rate of €19 a night.

Now having been given pretty decent diamond benefits, I have to say the drinks vouchers come across as unnecessarily stingy. ""glass of house red or white wine, a bottle of heineken, or a soft drink. Available between 5pm and 8pm""

Having had drinks vouchers from dozens of hotels, it's the only one that has ever limited bottle beer to one brand. Looking at the menu, there were several bottles within 10c of Heineken. Really doubletree, you will give me a €6.40 bottle of Heineken but not a €6.30 bottle of Corrs, or a €6.50 bottle of Peroni ?

And 5pm-8pm, what if I arrive at 9pm and I'm checking out the next day ?

Given the other good benefits, it just seems remarkably 'tight' of the hotel to limit the choice of bottle beer to a total of 1, and give a 3hr time window in which it can be used. And of course it's only when you are at the bar and use them that the limitation becomes clear, given rise to a possible embarrassing situation from something that is supposed to be a positive experience.

Doubletree Morrision, you need to reassess these vouchers, how much financial gain can you get from the restrictions, that you don't pay more for in the poor customer experience ?",4,2019,04,25
237,"Great staff, great service ",We enjoyed our stay at this very clean hotel with an awesome location. Staff was beyond friendly and helpful. Breakfast was great and staff in restaurant superb. Room was clean and well kept. Recommend if you need a hotel that is well maintained in Dublin. ,5,2019,04,23
237,Last 2 nights of an Ireland holiday,"We stayed at this absolutely lovely hotel with our two kids (7/9). 

King bed rooms were very spacious and extremely modern and clean! 

Breakfast was a dream! 

Very friendly and helpful staff! 

The location of the hotel is the best possible (all you want in close walking distance but still not as busy and loud as the other side of River Liffey):

Night life:  2min walk to The Temple Bar
Shopping: 2min walk to Henry Street/Mary Street (pedestrian area)
Car park: 1min walk to Jervis Car Park (€19/24h)
Sightseeing: 7min walk to Dublin Castle

Definitely coming back to THIS HOTEL on my next visit to Dublin!!",5,2019,04,21

The location is great...very walkable to all the must see sites in Dublin. The hotel was very clean and pretty...and the beds were very comfortable.
The staff was so attentive and helpful! My girlfriends and I especially want to commend Malo from guest relations. Malo was the first to welcome us and made sure right from the start that we were comfortable and taken care of! 
He was also very good with touring ideas in the city.
Malo checked in with us when ever he saw us and we really appreciated his friendly and professional manner! The Morrison staff were all great, but he really stood out!
This really was a wonderful place to stay!

237,Amazing Morrison Bedrooms and Grill,On Sunday March 31st I had the pleasure of staying in probably one of Dublin’s best Hotels called The Morrison. It is superbly well located in the heart of the city and everything about it is five star even though it’s four star!! The staff in all departments are truly outstanding from the reception on arrival right through the whole hotel. Probably the classiest and spacious bedrooms that we have come across with a housekeeping standard of the highest degree. As for the Morrison Grill the food and service is truly a credit to the hotel and Liam who looked after us is a true gem who was brilliant at his job. Well done also to Jason who could not have been more helpful to us during our stay. The staff in this hotel really seem to love working here as their manner and friendliness at all times has to be see to be believed. Well done to you all and to the management for creating this amazing atmosphere. If you haven’t stayed in this hotel already put in your diary for your next trip and I can honestly tell you that you will not be disappointed. Breakfast is also outstanding and at weekends is served till 12 which is brilliant. We will be back soon again. Keep up the good work👍👍😎😎 Padraig Herlihy Castleisland Co Kerry 😎😎,5,2019,04,05
237,Warm welcome ,"I stayed here for 2 nights on business, most Hilton hotels that are usually drab, not this one!! My room was nicely decorated and clean, the quality of the food and service in the restaurant was outstanding. The hotel is located downtown and just a 5 minute walk from all the action. There is a non-Hilton car park right next door on Jarvis Street. Highly recommended. ",5,2019,04,04
237,Great Hotel with Perfect Location..,"Been there in March for a Family vacation, hotel provides a perfect spot to be in a calm place however 2 minutes walk from Great Bars and shopping locations. Kids loved the DoubleTree Cookies. Housekeeping team was great in services and maintaining cleanliness standard. Money worth spending. ",5,2019,04,04
237,Great stay,"We visited for a long weekend having never been to Dublin before.  We were greeted by lovely reception staff and given warm cookies 😊.  
The next morning at breakfast a member of the reception staff came to see us to ask if we would like any help with deciding where to go and how to get there.  We saw him after breakfast when we were given 2 maps and lots of great ideas and advice regarding advance bookings etc.  We were also able to purchase tickets for the hop on hop off bus right there.
When we left yesterday, they were able to store our luggage safely so that we could go out, and they organised a taxi to take us to the airport.
All of the staff at the hotel: reception, bar staff, breakfast room and housekeeping were extremely friendly and helpful. Thank you for looking after us on our first visit to Ireland. ",5,2019,04,02
237,Fantastic service - Afternoon Tea,"A group of 14 of us enjoyed a wonderful Afternoon Tea at the hotel yesterday. We were greeted by the staff who took our coats and explained the menu. The food was delicious and we were very well looked after. 

The only issue was during the booking process, when we booked months ago the price was 2Euros cheaper per person and only informed a week ago of the price change, which was not honored. It didn't take away from the day but communication could be better.",5,2019,04,01
237,Great Hotel Great Location,"Loved the Hotel and the location, good service in bar and breakfast 
and dinner service would book again if I'm in Dublin. Looks like the bar is used also by locals. Close to town center and other points of interest.",5,2019,04,01
237,Absolutely Amazing,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Morrison!

The exterior and reception area were modern and inviting.  The room itself was spacious and spotless. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom felt luxurious. All the small touches were lovely, and made this room a memorable space.

We did not get to try eating at the Morrison Grill but the room service breakfast was delicious.

Our experience was fantastic, and we are truly looking forward to booking our next stay!",5,2019,03,31
237,Good value great location,"Easy access to tourist attractions including Jameson, Guinness, Trinity, boat river tours, Temple Bar area, shopping areas and large selection of pubs and restaurants close by, good food at hotel too, friendly helpful staff, clean rooms, would stay again.",5,2019,03,28
237,Fabulous Location and Great Welcome,"Loved the location primarily of this hotel. What struck me from the outset was the absolute friendliness and helpfulness of all of the staff.  Particular mention to Piotr (Front of House Manager) for his courtesy.

The room was clean and spoltless, very modern and appointed well.  Wi-fi was reliable and quick, and special shout-out to the housekeeping department who were inconspicuous but thorough.  Would absolutely recommend - great value for money for location, service and hospitality (from a chain) as it didn’t feel ‘corporate’.  I’ll be back if they’ll have me!",5,2019,03,26
237,When in Dublin stay at the Morrison,"The staff was exceptionally nice and respectful, a true understanding of what customer service is supposed to be.  Helpful the entire stay, even though they were full for the St Patrick's Day holiday.  I have traveled for work each week for five years, and this has been the best customer service experience I have had at a hotel in all that time. ",5,2019,03,25
237,Right on top of all the action but far enough away from all the noise,"Lovely Hotel very close to Temple Bar but far enough away to escape all the noise and crowds. Nice and welcoming with good size rooms and great imnenities. Short walk from all the action. Friendly staff, great breakfast and well stocked bar",4,2019,03,25
237,Great hotel and location,"The Morrison is a perfect spot to explore Dublin. Centrally located with very good accommodations. Excellent bar and restaurant.  Arriving in the early morning from an overnight flight, I was offered acc as to shower facilities as my room was not yet available....A good find..!!!",5,2019,03,24
237,Great place in Dublin.,"Lots to love about this place. First, the location is amazing, very central to many of the tourist destinations in Dublin, including being almost directly across the river from the Temple Bar area - a couple minute walk.

The property itself is great, our junior suite had hardwood floors, plenty of space, and a super comfortable bed. We had lunch and drinks in the adjoining restaurant which was itself, a solid place.

Lastly, we had tremendous service from the hotel staff. Like really top notch, they went out of their way to make sure our stay was a good one. When available, we almost exclusively stay at Hilton properties and this was the best service we’ve had. I can’t say enough about how impressed we were.",5,2019,03,23
237,"Accommodating Staff, Excellent Location","Our stay at The Morrison over St Paddy's weekend was phenomenal. The staff went above and beyond to ensure a pleasant stay. The breakfast served in the hotel was great, I recommend the french toast! Marianne remembered us after the first day and greeted us with our specific drink preferences each morning. The Quay bar was another high point of our stay. Gary and David were excellent sources of information and made us feel right at home. We enjoyed the Morrison Grill so much, we ate in two out of our four nights! Special thanks to Etienne (Junior) for unparalleled service for my rather particular tastes. The location was within walking distance to almost everything you could wish to see in the city. It was perfectly situated close enough to reach the fun, but without having to hear it from your room. I highly recommend choosing this hotel for your next stay in Dublin.",5,2019,03,20
237,An amazingly friendly and welcoming hotel,"I have had the most wonderful stay here, right from check in to check out and everything in between the staff where excellent at making me feel welcome wanted and safe. The room was spotless and spacious I felt taken care of but anonymous at the same time, a perfect combination.",5,2019,03,19
237,Amazing Hotel,"This hotel is the best Doubletree I have ever stayed at, in over 20 years of traveling and staying in the Hilton Brand. The rooms are amazing and modern, the hotel staff couldn’t be better. The location is in walking distance to pretty much everything...highly recommended!!!!",5,2019,03,19
237,Lovely hotel in a great location.,"Have stayed here several times and have yet to have an issue. The rooms are modern with great beds and the staff are always polite, friendly and helpful. Breakfast is also excellent and the hotel is in an ideal location in central Dublin. Would highly recommend.",5,2019,03,16
237,Building works place a blemish on this chic boutique hotel,"Firstly, this is a stylish hotel which in other circumstances I would have not hesitated giving a 5/5 rating. However, when I visited the hotel there were internal building works  which appeared to take place from shortly after 9am all the way through to 5pm. 

Given the rooms are at the top end of prices for Dublin at over £200 per night, having 1/3 of the day with no peaceful usage, is very unreasonable. Most top end hotels would close down that part of the hotel or heavily discount for the duration of disruptive works. Instead The Morrison continues to offer these rooms at full price, which I view as unacceptable, but also provided no advance notice, even at checkin, that there were incredibly disruptive works taking place throughout the day, despite the fact that I explicitly mentioned that I wanted to ensure I had a room which was not noisy. 

I was visiting The Morrison for 3 nights as my company had also booked the attached PrintWorks exhibition space for a large business event. So additionally, it should have been clear that I may need to pop back to the room for business calls, and that the renovation work could prove problematic. 

Day one, I attempted to take part in a conference call and the noise from building works was so loud that I had to mute myself for the entire meeting and instead message attendees my inputs. I requested, and was moved to another room, which I was told would be very quiet. However, this room turned out to be closer to the building works and it was impossible to even be in the room during the renovation times, which took place sporadically between 9am-5pm. And as a result I had to curtail my calls on day 2 which resulted in a number of issues. I then found a vaguely quiet space near our Print Works area booking, but it was still in a thoroughfare and not at all appropriate for business meetings. On my final day rather than working from my room, which I had planned, I had to travel to our office location over 30 minutes away to ensure an appropriate environment for taking calls. 

Whilst the reception team were incredibly apologetic and left a small box of chocolates in the room, Il find it incredulous that rooms which are unusable for 30% of the time are rented out at full price, especially to major corporate customers who have clearly stated they will be using the rooms for business meetings throughout the day. The reception staff did their best to deal with this untenable situation, however, I would suggest management think about long term reputation rather than immediate money.  

Aside from this issue, The Morrison is in a good location, along the quays. It is also a stylish hotel, with nice decor overall and good lighting. However, I did find some slightly weird issues with my second room, whereby opening drawers for clothing was very difficult. However, it does have irons in all the rooms (which is one of my pet peeves for business hotels), there are nice quality toiletries from Crabtree and Evelyn and the bedding is comfortable. 

The hotel has a very nice restaurant with great food. And the conference facilities, and PrintWorks space are fantastic. 

So overall it is disappointing to not provide 5/5 for this hotel, however, I think management need to think carefully about taking the money for rooms which are unusable 30% of a customer's stay. It did take me back to my early hostel traveling days when you would need to vacate the hostel in the middle of the day for cleaning!",3,2019,03,16
237,Great Hotel!,"Have stayed for a business week. The staff is very helpful. The room was clean and had all the basics. The wifi was easy to access and fair in speed. The breakfast was very nice, and the restaurant crew were nice, hospitable, quick and quiet. The hotel gives a discount for a nearby parking lot full day parking. The gym is a bit small, but modern and well kept. I ordered an early breakfast on my 3am checkout which was waiting for me at the reception. Although the  computer was down when I tried to check out. Took them a couple of minutes and it all worked out. The balance was not available for payment the night before, so plan for it on checking out.",5,2019,03,14
237,Wedding reception at the Morrison Hotel,"My wife and I had our wedding reception in the Morrison Hotel a few weeks ago (February).
We always liked the idea of getting married in Dublin City centre area but had no particular venue in mind.
We approached several city centre hotels and from the outset the Morrison stood out.
We were treated like royalty by Aoife as she showed us around and explained the set up. (other hotels take note of how important this initial meeting is!)
After checking out some other hotels, the Morrsion was our choice- because of quality , cost and location.
Once we booked with the Morrison, Sarah became our main point of contact and was brilliant. Marion ably assisted us in Sarahs absence. No request from us was any hassle.
Despite me bombarding her with emails in the run up to the the big day everything was handled smoothly. Never left waiting for a reply or solution for anything.

Pamela and I really felt we were in good hands- that we were working with the pros here and were confident everything would be fine on the day.
Our food tasting evening was another lovely night in the restaraunt and we were well looked after by Luke and Junior.
One thing we both noted was how young all the staff and mangagement seemed. But this in no way offsetted their experience and professionalism!

The day of our wedding was handled by duty manager Hugh and Fernanda. This was done seamlessly. We were greeted upon arrival by Hugh, shown around the penthouse and 
advised on how the day would progress. Hugh and Fernanda were always close by the bride and groom ensuring we were been well looked after!
All our guests commented on the fantastic venue, how good the food was, the generous portions and the freely flowing wine. The waiting staff were
all great and no delays between courses. You can't really ask for more at a wedding. 
As my wife is Brazilian the hotel had Brazilian/portuguese speakers working that day to assist her family if needed. This was a great personal touch.
The rooms and facilites are superb , I won't comment too much on them as it is well reviewed here already.

Finally upon check out , we were told one our guests had left a hat behind. We were on the way to airport so it wasn't practical to bring it with us.
Jason at checkout asked where my parents lived- no problem he would drop it out to their house on his way home! A lovely gesture another that made us
feel valued by the hotel. Pamela and I have no hesitation in recommending Morrison Hotel for a wedding or other event. Thanks again, Mark and Pam.",5,2019,03,08
237,Inadvertent overnight,"Ended up overnighting here due to work circumstances.

Very clean and modern hotel with friendly, helpful staff throughout. The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. 

Breakfast has plenty of variety and is substantial. Superb location if you want to discover Dublin.

I would most definitely return.",5,2019,03,07
237,"Such a lovely, warm-hearted hotel","Not only is this hotel so perfectly located that you can never miss it, even after a long night out at some of the many pubs but the staff is also extremely nice and helpful. Also the interior design is a plus.",5,2019,03,07
237,"Christmas, home away from home.","Great location. 
Fabulous decor in the hotel. Some lovely features for Christmas residents, Prosecco and mince pies in the evening. Restaurant served very pleasing Christmas dinner, traditional turkey, christmas pudding etc. 
Room really spacious, great view on to an outdoor feature. 
Would most definitely love to stay here again in the future.",5,2019,03,06
237,Great location and great service from Malo!,"This hotel is in a great and convenient location. We were most impressed by the way we were greeted and welcomed by the staff in general but especially Malo. Malo went out of his way to be helpful, always greeted us and gave us great recommendations and info when we needed it. He was quick to respond and genuinely enjoyable! He made our first night at the hotel very welcoming. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful throughout our stay and the check in was speedy and efficient.

The rooms are modern - our jr suite was spacious and had a great coffee maker, Chrome Cast available on the TV and a good selection of channels. Bed was comfortable.  Breakfast is good with a fine selection of hot and cold food, cappuccino and even yummy fruit smoothies.  The fan in our room was a little noisy...

All in all I recommend the hotel-- and ask for Malo-- he will not disappoint! I wish ever hotel I went to had someone like him on the team- it really makes a difference!",4,2019,03,05
237,Top marks!,"I spent two days browsing hotels for a stay in Dublin before eventually booking The Morrison Hotel ,a hotel I had not yet had the pleasure of staying in despite hearing of it's positive reputation for some time. A reputation that is fully deserved! Everything from the moment of checking in provided a great stay. It's one of the cleanest hotels I have ever stayed in. It has a relaxed easy-going vibe. All the staff are wonderful. The location is probably the most ideal ,so central that you're never far from the main attractions in the city. Sleep quality was superb ,don't have any negative points for The Morrison! Will definitely return",5,2019,03,04
237,Good hotel,"Good average hotel in its category. Check-in is super fast and easy, especially if you use the Hilton app.

Room is of a fairly good size for Dublin hotels. The standard of the room was good, bathroom fairly good.

Its just one of them good average hotels. Nothing more, nothing less. A bit impersonal in my opinion.

Can recommend this hotel for an overnight but I’d prob stay elsewhere if for longer.",4,2019,03,03
237,Best stay yet...,"Myself and my husband were in town to attend a play in the Gaiety theatre and decided to make a night of it and stay in Dublin. We checked in about 4.20pm and the warm efficient yet friendly welcome was made all the better by our delicious warm cookies. As my husband is a Hilton Honors Diamond member we were upgraded and couldn't have been happier with the choice. Room 330 was a lovely suite. We have stayed in this hotel a few times before and always had lovely rooms but this suite was so comfortable that we almost wanted to skip the theatre and "" stay in"". The rooms were spacious, stylish and comfortable with views out over the river Liffey. The sitting room led to a beautiful bathroom complete with bath and an excellent shower and onto a decent sized bedroom. I really can't praise the room enough and would definitely recommend booking one for a special occasion.  We decided to dine downstairs in the restaurant as we were a little pushed for time before the Gaiety.  My husband ordered the curry which he thoroughly enjoyed and I had the Peri Peri chicken burger..although not stated on the menu the burger contained Mayo which I detest but the staff were great at changing the burger promptly. On check in we had been given two drink vouchers but when my husband tried to use them to order 2 pints of Guinness we were told they could only be used for house red or white wine or Heineken.. as we really wanted Guinness we paid for our pints and the bar man said we could use the vouchers later. Sadly by the time we returned from the theatre and tried to use the vouchers it was "" too late"" as they can only be used between 5-8pm.. I am quite happy to pay for drinks but a voucher with less T&Cs would be preferable. 
The breakfast this morning was excellent  and my only regret was that we were short on time so I couldn't drink as much of the delicious coffee as I would have liked. Again the staff were excellent, friendly and efficient, attentive but not intrusive. As usually this is by far one of the best breakfast selections in the Hilton hotel group and we have visited a lot of their hotels. The Morrison continues to be my "" go to "" accommodation whenever we stay over in the city. Thanks to all for making our stay our best visit yet..

",4,2019,03,02
237,Excellent location and friendly staff,We got a great deal here as the cost is twice as high in the summer so we were very happy. Location is very central. Just over Haypenny bridge far enough away from  but close to Temple Bar. Nice spacious rooms with comfy beds. Very clean and super friendly staff. Lots of great breakfast places nearby and shops right around the corner. Runners can run along the Liffey up to Phoenix Park. Great place. I’d give it an excellent but the price is so high in normal season. That’s Dublin though! ,4,2019,03,02
237,Return visit did not disappoint!,Was fortunate to return to the Morrison with my daughter for a couple of nights this month on our way to Killarney. We love the location of this hotel for exploring Dublin by foot. We arrived very early from a transatlantic flight and went to the hotel hoping  to store our bags and we were allowed to check in early for a small fee. The chance to nap and shower really saved the day! Breakfast was just as amazing as the last time we stayed. We also had dinner one night and it was very enjoyable. Loved the make your own sundae! I cannot say enough about how friendly and helpful the staff at this hotel is. My daughter loves the Doubletree cookie and was then over the moon when we received a small box of chocolates as a returning Hilton honours guest. The Morrison has totally spoiled our expectations for other hotels and we can’t wait to have the chance to stay again!! ,5,2019,02,27
237,"Outstanding staff, food and facilities!","This hotel, and most importantly its staff, are a real credit to The Hilton group. We have just returned from a wonderful trip in which our stay at The Morrison was to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary.
From the moment we arrived we were greeted with the warmest of welcomes, and throughout our stay the attention to detail from each and every staff member made our experience outstanding throughout.
The hotel is clean, the bed wonderfully comfortable and the food simply superb! It is perfectly located to explore all that Dublin has to offer and still remain quiet on a night to ensure a restful nights sleep. 
We could not recommend this hotel highly enough, and will look forward to a return visit as soon as possible. Thank you 'The Morrison team' for ensuring our trip to Dublin gave us memories to last a lifetime.",5,2019,02,25
237,Wedding reception,We had our wedding reception there recently. The hotel staff are excellent. They are so efficient and they seem to care about their customers. All our guests had kind words to say about them. The food was excellent absolutely beautiful. The rooms are really well furnished. Very comfortable beds and luxury bathrooms. Our guests were well looked after from start to finish by the staff. Our wedding plans were handled expertly by Sarah and her staff. We were really very happy with the way the whole days celebration were handled by the staff. We had the band Sax & the city playing at the wedding. Fantastic band. Highly recommended.,5,2019,02,24
237,A welcoming stay,"Recently stayed here with my friends, we had a wonderful stay. The staff were so welcoming and friendly, they couldn’t do enough for you and nothing was too much trouble Malo was fantastic, so attentive and happy! They gave us great advice on where to go and what to do. The breakfast was delicious, only had the continental but the choice was superb. 
The room was spotless and the bed was so comfy. 
We shall return",5,2019,02,22
237,Beautiful hotel right by everything!,"I received a complementary room upgrade which was under expected. The room was a suite which had a dining table, couch with a 55"" tv (looked like a 55"" but I suck at knowing the correct sizing. The room had a king bed and a massive bathroom. Bath include a his and her sink, seprsepa shower and a large soaking tub. Honestly the only time I've stayed in a hotel this beautiful was in Japan.

The location was next to everything and getting to the hotel was straight forward. I opted for the 24hr airlink bus pass and I got off at O'Connell St and it was like a 7 min walk. I highly recommend checking out the Irish Whiskey Museum. 

Staff was also very friendly and super accommodating. At the last minute I needed an extra room and they were able to help me out.

Highly recommend this hotel when you go to Dublin. ",5,2019,02,21
237,"Perfect hotel, nothing too much trouble","Stayed here for 3 days from 15th February 2019.  The staff, cleanliness, food are all a credit to Hilton Hotels.  We were met on arrival by a young man called Malo a trainee assistant manager, this young man was superb & nothing too much trouble.  Well done Hilton.",5,2019,02,20
237,Birthday weekend,"It was my daughters birthday and we decided to spend her birthday weekend in Dublin. It was our first stay here and we were pleasantly surprised at the colors that greeted us when we walked into the hotel. The purple and grey combo gave the ambience a very modern boutique feel. Checking in was a breeze and we had some tasty cookies as well.
The rooms where beautifully appointed and the bed plus the linen were so comfy we could have slept in if we hadn’t paid for breakfast as well.
Staff in this hotel were quite friendly and helpful it made us feel at home, not to forget how clean the rooms were.
The hotel is surrounded by restaurants, bars and good shopping with the Jervis shopping mall just a stone throw away.
If not that we had already booked a weekend getaway in March at the Hilton Dublin, The Morrisons would have been the place to be.
Must return, great stay, great staff, enjoyed our stay!

 ",5,2019,02,19
237,"Great hotel, super staff - no late check out possible","The hotel is super clean, room service did good job every day you can see they go extra mile. They provided extra blanket and tea. Nice breakfast very friendly staff. Unfortunately manager Piotr would not accept late check out for diamond member, with an excuse they are sold out. I checked and there were multiple rooms available online and the price was low that suggest demand wasn't great for following night. If it wasn't for that it would be my favourite Hilton in Dublin",4,2019,02,15
237,The most freindly service in Dublin,"As a local and a manager within the hospitality industry in Dublin the Morrison for me is the best little hotel in Dublin.
Great service - freindly , relaxed and cool without being pretentious - well done to all the staff here .
Its a little gem in Dublin town .",5,2019,02,13
237,Great Hotel ,We arrived early expecting to leave our bags and head out sight seeing. To our surprise they were able to get us our room. I know they didn’t have too and a lot of times they aren’t able too but it meant a lot to us. Beautiful Hotel with really friendly staff. Can’t wait to stay here again! ,5,2019,02,12
237,Great night away..,"Stayed here last night to attend a show in the laughter lounge. 
Lovely hotel. Room was spotless. 
Food was fab served by Larry in the restaurant. 
Will diffently stay here again. 
I did find it unusual  that you have to pay a deposit of €100 when checking in  but you get this back once you check out. 
",5,2019,02,10
237,Warmed cookie of a welcome ,"This hotel is nothing short of superb. It’s location couldn’t be more central. The staff are attentive, friendly and helpful. It exudes luxury from the deluxe rooms to the warmed cookie on arrival. I have stayed here twice in the past two months for business and wouldn’t go anywhere else in Dublin. The breakfast is fantastic, I would especially recommend the pancakes! It is excellent for hosting high class events.",5,2019,02,08
237,Great service!,"The location here is very convenient, the breakfast is as good as any hotel breakfast I've ever had, and the service is absolutely top-notch.  I really wanted to rate this hotel a 5, but:

1) The shower was terrible.  There was plenty of water flow, but no pressure, which means that you have to stand on the drain to get wet.  This should be a lot better at this level of hotel

2) The HVAC in our room worked but only after calling the technician to find that you had to set it roughly 10 degrees (C) lower than you actually wanted the room to be.  This was after setting it at 15 and having it continue to get hotter and hotter, and hotter....

3) The TV was volume limited to the point that some of the international stations weren't audible over the HVAC, even at the minimum fan setting.  While I understand that they are trying to prevent excess noise in other rooms, the problem is that not all stations have the same volume....bottom line, you can't hear some of the stations.  [This is minor, but the minor things add up.]",4,2019,01,29
237,Great location and smart pricing.,"I stayed at Morrison to tell you in the busiest time of the year: AirFinance conference.  Hotel staff was incredibly friendly and eager to solve all of my issues including late check-out at no charge. 
The hotel is located only steps away from a famous Temple Bar District  and yet it is Quiet.  So you can go party  Coleman return back and rest  peacefully.
Morrison  Has a really good functional  fitness center so you can keep in shape while traveling .
 Its grill bar is also very good  their Irish steaks and Irish beef stew  are excellent . 
 and there are multiple nice restaurants in the walking distance. I would particularly recommend windings stare which is steps away from the hotel. Fantastic Riverview and reading nice Irish cuisine.
I want to single out Edit the front desk supervisor. She was attentive almost friendly and very helpful in finding my way around Dublin. 
I will certainly come again.",5,2019,01,28
237,An excellent choice for Dublim,"We were visiting Dublin and only had 1.5 days so proximity to sites was important to us. As Hilton Gold members, we always try to stay at a Hilton if it meets our other needs - the Morrison did just that. It was a quick walk to Trinity College, EPIC, Temple Bar, even Guinness Storehouse was only 20 minutes away. Other reviewers complained about noise but our room was very quiet, the area surrounding the hotel wasn't loud either. There is a terrific shopping district on the backside of the hotel so when the sites get old, go shop, it's right there! We utilized breakfast one day, which was really nice. There were many choices and even some excellent Gluten free scones and muffins.  We had a King Deluxe room and found it very comfortable with ample room (compared to European standards), good TV channels for relaxing, and a comfortable bed with ample pillows. Staff is very welcoming and was able to assist with a taxi at 0600 the day we left. Overall we are glad we chose this property and you will be too!",4,2019,01,25
237,"Double Tree, Double Great","The Morrison offers smooth, efficient, yet frendly service in a stylish and comfortable hotel.  Not only are the accomodations great, the location is excellent.  Shopping, dining,and Temple Bar are all within walking distance.",5,2019,01,25
237,Very enjoyable stay,I really enjoyed my recent stay at the Morrison Hotel. The staff were very courteous and helpful. The hotel has a convenient location in the centre of the city. My favourite spot to stay when in Dublin. The French toast for breakfast was lovely!,5,2019,01,24
237,loved the hotel,"Giavanna, Joy and Fiona are so wonderful. This is my second time staying here and I can not wait to go back again. They made my stay extremely perfect. The hotel is beautiful and very clean. The service was perfect. Everyone greeted us with a big smile.",5,2019,01,16
237,Great Location,"Stayed here for holiday, great location.  Easy walking to all the sites and has a hop on hop off bus that stops nearby should you want to travel around Dublin to see all the historical sites.  Good Pubs nearby as its just across the water from Temple Bar.  Good value!",5,2019,01,15
237,The Morrison Dublin City Center,"This hotel in the heart of Dublin, Ireland is beyond amazing. The location is superb and and it’s in the heart of everything Dublin. The staff was really nice letting us checked-in before check in time and the room was really nice and clean not to mention the bathroom was extra big and it’s always a plus. I was so pleased to get back in our room later that day and there’s a box of chocolates waiting. Awesome hotel and staff thank you very much. We loved our stay!",5,2019,01,13
237,Fantastic all round,"Stayed here a couple of times. A few people I have spoke too have said they found the style of the rooms and hotel in general to be a bit odd, but I thought it was unique, modern and tasteful. 

The rooms are very comfy and have everything you need. Breakfast in the morning is really, really good. The muffins are just amazing.  and the staff all very helpful. There is a big statue of a strange creature which I sat behind during breakfast. My friend joined me at the table, and disliked having to look into the statue's backside. I however enjoyed his suffering, and approve of the strange creature at breakfast.

The free cookies are great, although I think it would be good to stick to a simple chocolate chip rather than a hazelnut one.

Special mention to Gary, the cocktail master behind the bar from Antrim, he knows his stuff and put up with us till the bar closed :)

Also I'd like to mention the great service provided by the young blonde gentleman who helped me book a table for dinner and remembered me as he passed through breakfast the next morning (sorry I can't remember your name!)",5,2019,01,10
237,Fabulous end to Vacation,"I choose this Hotel as i am a Diamond member and was able to use points for both of our rooms.  I travel quite a bit for work and have stayed at several properties over the years, but I can honestly say I have never experienced the level service as I did at this hotel.  

Upon check in, both of our rooms were upgraded to King Deluxe rooms.  The rooms are unique with the decor and lighting.   The front desk staff is extremely friendly and willing to help with just about anything. 

Unfortunately my travel partner was ill for a large portion of our stay in Dublin and spent most of the time in our room.  Upon the remaining 3 of us returning to the hotel our last night (roughly 11:30pm) I had asked the desk clerk if there was a small store on the property I was hoping to pick up a few things for him, as he had not eaten all day.  The clerk apologized and informed us they did not (I never said why I was looking).  As we were getting on the elevator, Kaviraj popped out of nowhere and asked us what we were looking for, I explained our friend had been sick and would love just some fruit if possible, he asked what room we were in and said he would be up shortly.  This young Man returned with a large bowl of fruit as well as some other snacks.  In no way did he need to go out of his way to do this! I felt truly valued as a customer!

Breakfast was excellent with a variety to choose from, always an added bonus!

The location itself can’t be beat!  We were able to see everything we wanted to see and were able to walk to it all.

237,Very nice hotel in great location,"Our flight arrived at 5 AM and when we got to the hotel, we were able to check into a room and rest for a few hours (we did have to pay an extra 25 euro). The beds are very firm but the rooms are a nice size- not too cramped. Everything was very clean and the bathroom well stocked with toiletries. The front desk ladies were always kind and helpful with recommendations. I used the fitness room in the morning and it was excellent. nice equipment and well maintained. We did not have breakfast included with our stay. We did not eat at the hotel bar, but it was always busy. We did get the delicious Double Tree cookies at checkin :) The hotel is a great walking location to the sites- especially in the Temple Bar area. We liked this hotel so much on our arrival, that we booked it again on the night before our departure. It was about 25 minutes to the airport and the front desk helped us with validating our parking ticket before we left. This is a modern, clean hotel and I would stay here again. Highly recommend.",5,2019,01,08
237,"Amazing location, even better service!","Not the usual review writer but felt inclined after my girlfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights in Dec 2018.  As others have mentioned, the location is incredible (Temple bar across the street, plenty of bars/restaurants, walking distance to Trinity/ Guinness / Jameson / and any of the day tour meeting spots), but the reason I'm writing is because of the customer service... it is top notch!  After a day trip to the Cliffs, coupled with plenty of pints & Jame, I lost my cell phone at nearby restaurant.  By the time the next morning rolled around and I realized it was lost, we were leaving for the airport and had no time to retrieve it.  The amazing staff at the Morrison picked the phone up and shipped it back me in the states (arrived today).  If you're looking for a trustworthy place to stay in the heart of Dublin, this is the it!

Thanks again guys! Slainte!",5,2019,01,07
237,A Very Good Hotel in the Thick of Dublin Nightlife,"As other reviewers have noted, the Morrison Hotel in downtown Dublin has one of the best locations to enjoy the fun and nightlife of Dublin.  It’s located right on the river and is a 10 minute walk from probably hundreds of pubs and restaurants. The hotel itself is an oasis of quietude, but step outside and it’s a very busy scene where you can enjoy everything Dublin has to offer.

The hotel itself is a Doubletree with all the Hilton amenities, but unlike some Doubletrees, it’s in an older building with a classic lobby and restaurant.  The rooms are well appointed and quiet (especially worthwhile given the neighborhood).  There’s no club lounge, but the gym is quite good - small but good.  The only complaint I have is with the breakfast. The buffet has all the usual suspects but unfortunately the place can’t make eggs.  The scrambled eggs on the buffet were dry and crispy(!) and the omelets I ordered on other days were the same.  All were tasteless, even when I tried to add lots of pepper to give them some type of flavor.  I realize that for health reasons it’s necessary to make sure that eggs are cooked through, but the Morrison takes this to the extreme.

But aside from the breakfasts, I enjoyed the Morrison very much.  It’s not cheap (no hotel in Dublin is) but I will definitely stay there again.

PS:  Take the airport bus into town,  the Morrison is only a 15-minute walk (at most) from where the bus stops and the driver will give you explicit instructions on how to get to the hotel - even recommending a coffee shop along the way.",4,2019,01,06
237,"Amazing service, great location","Amazing location, accross the street from Temple Bar. Staff was great and very friendly. Clean rooms beautifully decorated, spacious and it meet my expectations. No issues while there, great room service ",5,2019,01,05
237,10 out of 10,Myself and my husband stayed here for one night.   We were upgraded on arrival. Piotr was lovely at reception very efficient and friendly.  We didn’t have dinner here but had lunch and breakfast and both were very nice.  Room was great.  Overall a lovely hotel and location was so central to everywhere.  We will be back.  Thank you. ,5,2019,01,03
237,Great location especially if you are short on time in Dublin.,"Great location for walking anywhere that a tourist would want to see.  Shops and supermarkets are nearby.  20 minute walk to Guinness Factory and closer to Jameson distillery.  Beds are great, but, Temple bar crowds can be a little loud and go on into the night on a Saturday night.  Bring earplugs to be safe.  Breakfast if included with your rate is quite good.",5,2019,01,02
237,Diamond member review ,"The Morrison is a beautiful hotel and in a great location. Also, the on site breakfast is very good. As an American tourist, the size of the rooms, closet space, and the size of the bathrooms are appreciated. You will find the level of cleanliness you would expect from the Hilton brand. Overall I would recommend this hotel to future travelers. 

For any Hilton diamond members looking to stay at this hotel, I have stayed at this hotel as a diamond member on two separate occasions (once in 2016 and once in 2018). I am not sure if management has changed since the first trip, but the diamond recognition we received varied greatly. During the first trip, we were offered early check-in, breakfast the day we arrived and late check-out. During the second stay, none of this was offered - which if the hotel is sold out the night before arrival, I understand that early check in is not possible and am completely fine with that. However, I have never been denied the diamond breakfast benefit the day of check in before at any Hilton I’ve stayed at. Also, they denied late check-out, even though the Hilton app showed that multiple rooms were still available for purchase that night. Again, I would understand if the hotel was sold out - but this did not seem to be the case in this instance. 

Overall, I’d still recommend this hotel to travelers based on location and comfort but I would just caution diamond members that the diamond benefits may not be recognized. ",4,2019,01,01
237,Beautiful,The hotel was beautiful and extremely clean. The staff were very helpful. Our only complaint was the very loud fragrance from candles - we love candles but these were too much. The front desk crew were amazing and recommended some great shops and restaurants.,4,2018,12,31
237,Excellent experience,"The location itself is a winner - in the heart of the city, but a bit away from the noise of the Temple Bar area. Add to that the excellent service, rooms and food, and you have a winner. Not to forget, a surprisingly lively hotel bar!",5,2018,12,31
237,Dublin - quick tourist and friend event,Great location - close to everything Dublin has to offer - food/entertainment/shopping/sights/history....good value.  \The Morrision Grill serves fine food - and the Bar is well equipped.  The hotel is very near Temple Bar..5 minute walk to the heart of the action...rooms are very quiet - good sleeps.,4,2018,12,31
237,Brilliant hotel on the River Liffey,"We stayed two nights over the Christmas holiday and felt very welcomed. I'd be hard pressed to find anything to criticize, thus the 5 Star rating. 

Staff were available, accommodating, and warm/friendly. Fiona on arrival made all the necessary arrangements for our dining during the stay, and made sure there was a warm hand-off to any staff. Location is brilliant, being right on the river and a short walk from the Millennium and Ha'Penny bridges, so Temple Bar and the really touristy stuff is a short walk away.

In house dining and drink options were excellent in all. The hotel decor is a funky/trendy/chill vibe that was very relaxing. My only regret is not staying another night here. I'd highly recommend staying here if you want to be close to Dublin's cultural attractions but not in the midst of the chaos.",5,2018,12,27
237,Fab,"Stayed here 22nd of December just for one night and I couldn’t fault a thing. The staff were great and the room was fab. We had a King Junior Suite and it was fab, the bathroom was amazing and a balcony for a lovely internal view. You’re right in the heart of the city so the location is perfect for shopping, food and a night out.  Will definitely stay here again. ",5,2018,12,24
237,Modern and funky!,"This was our first trip to Dublin and we chose this hotel due to being Hilton Honors Gold members.

The location of the hotel is really good being very central and close to most amenities. It is also handy for the stops for the bus service to the airport if you choose to take this option.

The hotel itself is very modern and 'funky'. The decor is fresh, modern, bright and colourful. Rooms and bathrooms are well appointed and modern. The breakfast service was good. A small but adequate buffet selection was available with some nice touches like individual fruit servings rather than a huge bowl to help yourself from. 

Reception staff were courteous and efficient.  DoubleTree hot cookie delicious as always!",4,2018,12,24
237,Best hotel in Dublin,"Best location, great restaurant, friendly knowledgeable staff, cool modern rooms. Really really enjoyed it. There isn't a better location you can find in all of Dublin. It's smack dab in the middle of everything. The restaurant serves a great dinner and has a bustling busy bar. Reception is Uber friendly and helpful. You can't beat this place. ",5,2018,12,19
237,"Perfect, relaxing stay","I researched just about every hotel in the central Dublin area and am glad that I chose this DoubleTree/Hilton (the Morrison). This is a very modern hotel and management definitely wants to hold the place and staff to high standards which I appreciate. My 4 days in Ireland were jammed full of tours etc. and I insist on a certain level of peace, cleanliness, comfort, and amenities. The Morrison surpassed all of these areas. It is definitely not the least expensive, but you clearly get what you pay for here. My top floor room was impeccably clean and quiet so I always had good rest. Also note that the rooms are not your ""standard"" European size, but very in line with American hotels. The staff is very friendly and you can text them if you have an issue or need anything. I ate (once) in the restaurant and service, food, and drinks were great and at a reasonable price. The location is perfect to most sites...furthest for me was 24 minute walk while most places were 10-15 minutes. I will surely stay here again and recommend it to others.",5,2018,12,19
237,Excellent Location,"We made last minute changes to our travel plans (less than 1 week), which brought us to Dublin. We booked The Morrison on a recommendation from my work's travel agency and we couldn't have been happier. The price, staff and LOCATION were excellent. ",4,2018,12,18
237,Excellent,"We stayed in hotel Saturday night... the location was excellent and fantastic stay from start to finish. We had a concert in The Olympia and location great for anyone going there or planning on going out in Temple bar or Grafton street. I was checked in by Maria who was so helpful. We had a gorgeous dinner in the restaurant and service was excellent. After the concert we went back to the bar .. there was a dj playing and again service excellent .. I think the guys name was Gary.
Recommend and I will be back.",5,2018,12,17
237,Faultless!,"What a fabulous hotel! We have just stayed for 4 nights. We had booked a king room with a river view but on arrival were upgraded to a junior suite with a river view! The room was perfect in every way and spotlessly clean. The hotel was busy but the service was impeccable and the bar staff went out of their way to find you a seat and you never had to wait long to be served. On Saturday morning we asked if we could have a table in the restaurant for that evening. Although they were fully booked they found us a space and the steak was superb. All the staff, without exception, are charming and very friendly. A special thanks to Jason, in the bar, who made us feel so welcome. The breakfast is excellent and has a calm, un-hurried atmosphere. The hotel is attractively located beside the river and perfect for sightseeing. We would definitely return and would reccommend the hotel to friends and family. Thanks to all the staff for such a memorable stay.",5,2018,12,17
237,Christmas shopping ,We have stayed here 4 or 5 times now. Twice we have been upgraded to the Penthouse Suite which is possibly the most impressive hotel room we have ever stayed in. This time we booked a River View Suite and have to say it is almost as impressive. It was lovely to come back from Christmas shopping and find a brightly lit tree in the room. It was so nice we ordered food to the room and enjoyed the sitting area for the rest of the evening. It’s a pleasant stroll over to Grafton Street and St Stephens Green which we did in the morning. We have always found the staff very helpful and the atmosphere very welcoming. Easy parking in the multi-storey nearby. This hotel is fast becoming our favourite Hilton property. We will be back again soon!,5,2018,12,16
237,Perfect location!,I have stayed at this hotel numerous times. Its perfect location for walking to many of the noted Dublin sites makes it highly desirable.  The front desk service is excellent!  It was a lovely gesture for the manager to take the time to write a personal note thanking me for my patronage to the hotel. Pleasant breakfast buffet with a variety of hot and cold items.,4,2018,12,15
237,A nice comfortable hotel,"I’ve stayed here a number of times now and I am happy to be back. My room is comfortable and the staff are helpful. I can recommend it. Dublin is a lovely city and this hotel is very well placed in the middle on the river 
",5,2018,12,11
237,"Always a great place to stay, eat, drink in Dublin!","This was my 3rd trip to Dublin, but 2nd at the Morrison Double Tree.  You cannot beat the location - Temple Bar and most other sites are within easy walking distance from the front steps of the hotel.  Just 20 Euro trip from the airport via taxi you are set!  Staff is always very nice and professional, food is very good and there is always something going on in the lobby lounge - live music, DJ's, etc.  Highly recommend for any business or pleasure trip to Dublin!!!",5,2018,12,11
237,"Best value (location, confort, services) for money!","Very well located, at a walking distance from most of the attractions of the city, great confort and excellent services (including a complimentary warm biscuit and a bootle of water at check-in).
Breakfast is ok and also the restaurant, where you can have a decent meal without surprises (especially bad ones).",5,2018,12,09
237,"As always, a very enjoyable stay at the Morrison","Lovely hotel, best location and very attentive staff. Beautifully quiet (deluxe) room. I was very well looked after (special mention to Rhea and Sandra) and am looking forward to my next stay in December already!",5,2018,12,04
237,City Wedding,"One of the main reasons we chose the Morrison was because of its unique style and comfortable class. We held our large family wedding here and from the evening before until the evening of the day after it was brilliant, the food was simply delicious and the staff fantastic, especially Gavin who wowed everyone with his great personality and efficiency. Marion was so helpful and responsive with all queries. We had such a great time along with all who stayed and loved the rooms. Most definitely recommend. Thanks so much x Liza & Lewis",5,2018,12,03
237,Well located and modern,"My three stays over the last 10 months at the Morrison were great. The hotel is clean, modern and well located close to Temple Bar area. The only complaint is that my room was never ready when I checked in. They have a 3pm check-in time but I hate getting off a trans-Atlantic flight and not being given a hotel room. I suggest contacting the hotel in advance to tell them what time you plan to arrive. I just arrived at the hotel at 2:30pm and was told my room wasn’t ready. I wasn’t even offered a different room that may already be clean. At least they gave me a cookie and water while I wait... ",4,2018,12,03
237,Confidence restored in Irish hotels....,"Excellent hotel, value for money all the way....

Perfect location, great staff, truly great staff, helpful, problem solving...just go out of there way to make your stay a memorable one...

Piotr and Papa do a superb job in managing the day to day, courteous, friendly...

The house keeping staff were the best of all....room was spotless...",5,2018,12,02
237,Modern hotel in central Dublin,"As a long time Honors Diamond member, my wife and I stayed at The Morrison using points for our first visit to Dublin.   The location was central to most of the Dublin sites and public transportation.  The airport buses (Airlink or AirCoach) both pickup/drop off at O'Connell Street which is about a 10 minute walk to the hotel.  The hotel and room are modern and stylishly appointed.  Our room had a beautiful view overlooking the river.  The hotel service, both at reception and in the restaurants, was excellent.   The breakfast was good and provided ample options.  ",5,2018,11,30
237,"Great location, fun atmosphere","Loved this hotel! Great location, friendly staff, fun and funky rooms. Only downside is they host multiple weddings/parties and from our room which overlooked the courtyard it was quite loud - the hotel staff was very nice about the inconvenience and made it right (cheers to Fiona). Also, not all rooms are accessible. We had 5-6 steps we had to ascend with our heavy suitcases, but that is to be expected with older hotels.",4,2018,11,29
237,Great location,"Location great, breakfast good, room service poor and food arrived cold. The room was nice, the general service ok, arrival and departure service not impressive. Nicest people were the breakfast staff. ",4,2018,11,29
237,"Great location, beautiful rooms, excellent service.","I've noticed people mentioning the service in other reviews, and I want to echo their sentiments. The service in this hotel is outstanding. The staff are friendly, and nothing is a problem. The rooms have been renovated in the past few years and they're comfortable and well equipped. The hotel is slap bang in the centre of Dublin also. I'd have no hesitation recommending this hotel.",5,2018,11,26
237,Excellent,"This was my second visit to the hotel, and everything was great. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly, and even though I arrived half an hour before check in, my room was ready within a matter of minutes, and the receptionist came to find me in the lobby seating area to hand me the keys.

My room was spacious, clean and very comfortable. It included a fridge, a safe, and tea and coffee making facilities.  The bathroom was also roomy, with plenty of shelf space for toiletries.

The location is great - directly across the river from the Temple Bar area, and about a ten minute walk from O'Connell Street.  I wasn't bothered by any external or internal noise.

It will be my first choice next time I'm back in Dublin.",5,2018,11,26
237,Great stay if a little on the pricey side,"Got upgraded at check in to a junior suite which was huge. Big comfortable bed and a massive bath/bathroom.

Didn't make breakfast so can't comment on this but the bar/restaurant area looked good. Staff all very polite and you might get a warm cookie on arrival!

Will stay again next time in town.",5,2018,11,26
237,Superb hotel.,"Uniformly excellent.  Ideal central location, great breakfast (even had fresh-made smoothies and a full gluten-free selection), wonderfully friendly and helpful staff.  Even the little things were just the way I wanted:  wide hallways, quiet and solid feel of building, windows that open, wonderful bed and bedding, elevators that arrive immediately, taxi to airport in the morning was waiting for us when we came down.  Pieter (hope I've spelled that correctly) made sure that we had a room that delighted us; had a king room overlooking the river.  This was our first trip to Ireland and a big part of why I'm sure we'll be returning.",5,2018,11,25
237,Great location ,It was my second visit to the Morrison hotel. Hotel is located very central of city only few steps away from temple bar and O’Connell street. Fast check in&out.

237,The Morrison Delivered,"Beautiful hotel in a wonderfully central location in Dublin and literally, seemed like everything was within a 10 minute walk from the hotel.  Quite at night and well laid out.  We celebrated our anniversary while there and the hotel made it extra special and when we encountered a problem with the room, the hotel was able to switch our rooms quite rapidly.  Maria at the front desk was quite helpful in resolving the hotel room issue and appreciated the follow up the next morning from Piotr.  The only improvement I would note was check in which took longer to get a room than anticipated.  I would definitely stay at the Morrison again. ",5,2018,11,12
237,Luxury hotel,"Hotel was awesome, service could not have been any better.....lovely rooms and wonderful breakfast.......I will definitely stay here the next time I’m in Dublin. Very easy to get a taxi to go out on the town, many shops and restaurants in the area.",5,2018,11,10
237,"Welcoming, in the truest sense of the word.","This is the most guest-friendly hotel I've ever been to. And I've been around the world and have stayed in amazing hotels. To begin, Fiona, at the front desk was incredible. When my room was ready, she tracked me down in the restaurant and handed me my keys. Who does that? Fiona does! Then, Hugh was extraordinarily helpful in handling the tech for a day-long meeting, and in making sure we got materials printed up for the event. The Halo staff were lovely. Always attentive and fun. The room itself was immaculate and comfortable. And the location was perfect, right on the Liffey. Can't say enough about the Morrison Hotel.",5,2018,11,09
237,Pot of Gold (for gluten free eaters) near Leprechaun Museum,"I stayed with my family at the Morrison for an all-too-brief visit to Dublin. For this reason, I tried to choose lodging very carefully. As a family with 3 celiacs, research and planning are very important. Perhaps you are in the same situation, and perhaps this review can help you.

You already spend a disproportionate amount of time planning meals. Hopefully, the hotel can provide some modicum of relief from that. The Morrison does this with both location and offerings. They offer a gluten free afternoon tea, which we did not try, but just the fact that they made the gesture of offering it, was enough to make me happy.

The rooms are clean and prices are commensurate with lodging in the area. Staff are friendly and competent. We got two rooms for our family,  and they were next door to each other as requested.They were not ready one millisecond before 3 PM, but, it seems to be a seller's market when it comes to travel these days. 

The highlight feature of this hotel is the location, Across the river from the ""action"", it is not far at all and easy to navigate. It's almost directly across from the Temple Bar area. Within walking distance, we found two great gluten free restaurants which I will review separately; Boxty House and Millstone. Both of these are just across the HaPenny Bridge and are a nice walk. Wimpy me was able to do it in high heels, that's how close it is.

For our family, the real pay dirt was the proximity to a hidden shopping center called the jervis center. in this center are a M&S food hall and a Tesco, both of which are a metaphorical pot of gold when it came to gluten free groceries. We were able to load up on breads, prepared foods, anything we needed for picnic eating and snacks. Stuff we don't find in the US. The Jervis Center is not easily visible from the outside, but it's across from the Leprechaun Museum , you can find it if you look carefully and take the escalator in.

I would absolutely stay in this hotel again. As celiac travelers, we don't have as many choices, and the proximity to safe food made this a huge win in Dublin.",5,2018,11,05
237,Can I rate them higher? ,"I seriously can't say enough nice things about this hotel and their staff.  Will be my go to hotel for my yearly Dublin trips. 

Location location location: centrally located to the Temple Bar district and other attractions. 

The hotel: lobby is inviting, bright,  and modern. Restaurant and bar are right off the street.  

The room: on the small side (this part is for you Americans expecting a big room) but just enough size for 2 in a twin room.  Lots of lighting.  They have directions in the room for turning off the light under the coffee pot. Tv has chromecast so you can play Netflix and such from your phone.  Showerhead is awesome and waterfall like.  Beds are comfortable.  Towels are huge! 

The restaurant bar: good food at the regular prices you expect at a hotel bar.  No surprises.  The only complaint was the temperature? But that was every place in Dublin we went to. Extremely hot inside despite the temperature outside. Staff offered to fix the issue. Mixed bag of people which is fun.

The staff: I can't say enough about them.  Stefan (?), Jason,  Sam, night auditor (can't remember his darn name but worked on November 4/5. That were awesome and went completely out of their way to make our stay exceptional.  From dealing with our extreme tiredness, hunger,  jetlag,  and just plain obnoxious they excelled at their jobs.  We are planning on making a yearly trip to Dublin and plan on making this hotel our home base. Whatever you're doing is working! 

",5,2018,11,04
237,Excellent location!,"We arrived in Dublin at 8:00 am and our room, understandably, was not ready.  However, the front desk agents were extremely attentive, accommodating, and personable.  They offered to hold our luggage and call us when our room was ready.  Less than two hours later they called and we were in our room by 1:00 pm.  After a nap, we went out for a bit and when we returned, we found a wonderful box of chocolates and a card from the General Manager!  We stayed at The Morrison 5 years ago and returned as the location is perfect and the hotel has everything we need--a clean, comfortable room, a great restaurant/bar and staff that goes above and beyond.  While the rooms we stayed in were small, they had everything we needed. We will be back!",5,2018,11,04
237,Solid however not more. We understand this may be a newer property to Hilton and understand renovation to that standard,"As above. Rection area is not welcoming while the main resturant and bar area is quite nice indeed. As noted above, we understand this may be a newer property to Hilton and not quite at the level and value a loyalty member may anticipate.",4,2018,11,03
237,Amazing hotel with lovely staff,"A truly amazing property. Staff at the front desk are polite, friendly (kudos to Edit) and efficiant. Food in the restaurant was excellent, probably one of the best desserts we ever had (banoffe and lemon drizzle yummy) and service was superb. Rooms are big, modern and comfy and it is really great you can connect your phone to the TV. I stayed there couple of times already and plan to keep coming back...keep up the good work!",5,2018,11,03
237,Anniversary ,"We had our wedding reception here this time last year and were treated like absolute royalty. We were back for our anniversary and the customer service the second time around was just as impressive. We cannot fault the staff, and the food and fabulous cocktails have us planning a return visit already. ",5,2018,11,03
237,"Great Hotel, Thumbs Up!","We Stayed here on our last night in Ireland, after 9 days touring around the country and staying in a different hotel every night. This was by far our favorite. We had no reservations. Walked up to reception to inquire about a room. They were professional and courteous. They quoted us a rate a little higher than what we found online. My boyfriend showed the clerk his phone listing the lower rate. She went to find a manager to accept the lower rate, no problem. Room was clean, modern. Beds super fresh and comfortable. Great bathroom and shower. Great location on the river, just a short walk across the bridge to Temple Bar area with lots of restaurant and bar options. The hotel bar was really nice as well. Bartender was very friendly and gave us great advise on getting around. Wish we could have stayed a few more days. We had to head to airport early the next morning so only had the complimentary coffee in the lobby on our way out the door. Two big thumbs up!",5,2018,11,02
237,Nice Hotel! Good Location Across the River Liffey!,"Enjoyed our stay at the Morrison. Staff at hotel very nice and helpful. We did not get breakfast included in the rate. There are several good breakfast places around the corner and across the street. We did have coffee and croissants in the breakfast area one day and it looked good. Most of the Dublin activities are on the other side of the River Liffey, a short walk, Surprised hotel had no self service business center to print airline tickets. You need to get the front desk to print them. Surprising for a Hilton Hotel.",4,2018,11,02
237,Business Trip,"Great hotel, welcoming staff and a good location with lots of bars and restaurants close by.
Room was spacious and clean.
The breakfast is plentiful but rather expensive. 
Most places of interest are walkable from this location.",5,2018,11,01
237,Could not fault this one,"Spent three nights in Dublin recently after travelling around Ireland for three weeks. We were offered an upgrade to a junior suite, and glad we did because the room was just exceptional - only disappointment was no view of the river. Staff were terrific and the location meant we could wander easily to Temple Bar and key attractions without any difficulty. ",5,2018,10,31
237,A beautiful 3 days spent here,"Fantastic hotel. Very central to everything ( however I do enjoy walking). Customer service was impeccable, staff were so friendly and helpful.Food was  beautiful, their afternoon tea is a must. Very clean.   Definitely be back",5,2018,10,30
237,City that never sleeps,Perfectly located next to the river and just walking distance from the best bars and food. If you have questions ask the friendly staff for suggestions.The rooms are cozy and clean with wonderful showers. And morning breakfast selections were very wide and enjoyable.Thank you! ,5,2018,10,29
237,Great hotel in the perfect location,"We were here for four days and had a wonderful stay.
The location is perfect for access to most of the sites and transportation, yet not in the middle of the tourist heavy Temple Bar area.
The hotel staff were very friendly and went out of their way to help us.
The rooms were clean, well maintained and quiet.
The breakfast was great and had something for just about everybody.",5,2018,10,29
237,Business & Leisure,"Excellent hotel, great service, restaurant and location is close from many points of interest. I can only recommend it for business or city tourism. I was in Dublin for 4 days and I was so happy to stay at Morrison hotel.",5,2018,10,29
237,Not all Hilton properties are created equal,"We had the ""king guest room with river view"".  Upon our arrival the staff was amazing, five star treatment the entire time.  The room was your standard king with a view of whatever the property is selling (view did not disappoint).  Our first night was a bit of a mess for reasons the hotel could not control.  Tobacco smoke lingered in our room and it was unbearable to sleep in.  Papa the night manager, took care of us really well, and so did Piotr the day manager the next day.  

We we're switched to the ""king Junior Suite"" for the next night and the room was beautiful.  Unfortunately the bed was literally the most uncomfortable bed we've ever slept in, futon mattress meets foam topper for comfort.  Pillows need replacing as well. We didn't have the heart to tell the team as they we're so concerned about making our experience five star.  The bed we had in the other room (132) was very comfortable, maybe the mattress in room 234 is next on the list for upgrading?

Team was amazing - hotel needs to be combed with a fine tooth comb to be considered a luxury hotel.",3,2018,10,28
237,Outstanding!,"Central location, exceptionally well designed and spacious room, helpful staff. 
It is exrtremly rare to find such a pleasant hotel with a spacious room layout, nice desk and chair, outlets where you need them, good-sized bathroom. And, for those with limited mobility, this place actually works! Highly recommended.",5,2018,10,28
237,Perfect Locational,"Wonderful hotel with excellent location. The staff were helpful, clean rooms, great WiFi and an excellent breakfast.  I would highly recommend this hotel when visiting Dublin. Will definitely stay here during my next visit.  ",5,2018,10,28
237,Loved this hotel.  Great staff,"The staff at this hotel is so friendly and helpful, especially Giovanna and Joy at reception desk. We arrived early on a flight from New York. Our room was not ready so Giovanna stored our luggage and gave us some suggestions of places we could visit while waiting.     We enjoyed visiting Churches that were nearby and before long, Giovanna called my cell phone to tell us that our room was ready.   So helpful.      The night before we left, Joy was very helpful in arranging a cab for the next morning.  
In the restaurant, we were greeted by Roger.   We didn’t have much time before we had to leave for the airport and Roger made sure we quickly had everything we needed.     Gabriel in the restaurant was also very helpful.   
We are looking forward to visiting this hotel again.",5,2018,10,26
237,First two days in Ireland,Needed a couple of days to recoup from our flight before picking up car rental. Short taxi ride from airport. This was a perfect place to stay our first 2 nights in Dublin. Clean comfortable rooms. Super nice hotel. Location was very central and made it easy walking and getting around. Helpful staff  ,5,2018,10,24
237,Prime position,"The hotel is well-positioned on the Liffey between Temple Bar on one bank and Jervis Street on the other.  Everything seems very accessible from here.  The hotel is modern, has a nice breakfast room, and a bar and grill.  There are lots of cafes nearby.  The rooms are excellent and some have views over the river.  An ideal place for a weekend break.  ",4,2018,10,22
237,Lovely restaurant,"We met friends for dinner at The Morrison who were celebrating their honeymoon. We wanted to go to a nice restaurant to have dinner and a few drinks and I think we chose well. We could not fault our waiter on his service, it was impeccable. Our water glasses were never empty. We had the large wings to start followed by burgers, the food was delicious. We had a few cocktails with the meal and another once we had finished eating. The restaurant itself was cosy and spacious. Thank you for a lovely evening. ",5,2018,10,21
237,Great hotel,"Great hotel, good service, welcoming staff. Room are very nice, new and comfortable. Bathroom is cosy and with good toiletries. The only down is an annoying pink light coming out from the bar top. It took me 20 minutes to find the switch to turn it off. Breakfast was delicious. ",4,2018,10,20
237,"Perfect Location, Excellent Property","You can't find a nicer and better located hotel in the central business district of Dublin.  About 20-25 min from the airport back smack in the middle of the action in downtown Dublin.  Located right on the River Liffey, across from Temple Bar and surrounded by excellent restaurants, pubs and the business community.  The Morrison itself is a full service hotel with restaurants, a bar, gym, friendly staff and well appointed and clean rooms.",5,2018,10,20
237,Fantastic Boutique Hotel,"We stayed in The Morrison as we wanted a city centre location, the hotel was exceptional. We were welcomed at reception and greeted with warm chocolate chip cookies. The front desk staff was very friendly, and willing to help organise seeing the town. The room was just perfect, clean, comfiest beds and although we were in the heart of Dublin, the room was quiet and we had a fab sleep. The hotel bar was great, spacious but cosy. Breakfast was excellent, with really really good coffee! That doesn’t happen in hotels very often. There is lots to see and do in Dublin we enjoyed The Yellow Umbrella Walking tour it was a good way to hear the history and places to revisit when in Dublin, The Irish Bars and Music and lots of good eating places to visit as well.",5,2018,10,19
237,Excellent location and great quality!!!,"This hotel was perfect for our stay in Dublin as it was in the heart of the city. The staff was excellent and extremely helpful with any questions and/or concerns that we had. The room was excellent and loved the quote on the wall. This hotel was close to Temple Bar, Liffey River, and an easy walk to get on the HOHO bus. It is also close to where the day tour buses pick up their customers. The hotel is close to restaurants, bars, grocery stores, and other shops. This hotel is also walking distance to all the major sightseeing attractions in Dublin. We would stay here again and recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2018,10,16
237,Best hotel staff ever!,"When we planned our first trip to Dublin, we made the easy pick to stay at The Morrison because we are Hilton members and wanted to use points.  We expected the usual Hilton service and convenient location.  What we didn’t expect was the outstanding service offered by the Morrison staff.  We arrived through the riverside entrance, which is the restaurant and bar.  As we started to roll our luggage, a waiter stopped his work, picked up our bags and carried them to the front desk for us.  I’ve never seen a waiter do that!  One day, in the lobby, the manager came to us and asked for our opinion of the hotel.  We were pleased that he took the time to speak with us.  Another example of excellent service was the morning my husband met Stephan, the bartender.  My husband sat at the bar waiting for me. Stephan began chatting with him and offered him a glass of water.  Later, when I arrived, Stephan reminded us that it was going to rain and gave us an umbrella.  So kind!  

We were also pleased with the amenities at The Morrison.  We loved the purple, cream and grey decor in our room with acrylic lighting in the side tables and coffee bar.  There was also a cut out lamp that projected a lovely design on the wall when lit.  The breakfast room was bright with a large buffet and plenty of tables, and another team of efficient and cheerful employees. 

As others have mentioned, the location is superb.  The Morrison is located right on the River Liffey across from The Temple Bar area, which is a lot of fun day and night.  The pubs are lively and full of music, but there are also several great restaurants that offer delicious food and a quiet dining experience.  It is an easy walk up the street to the Hop on Hop off bus that provides an great tour of the city and a stop at the Guinness Brewery.

Lastly, here are two tips about the airport.  The airport bus is a quick, efficient and economical way to go to the city.  We did have to walk a few blocks to the hotel, but it is an easy stroll, especially if you stop at a pub on the way.  Also, if you are flying to the U.S., be sure to allow at least two hours at the airport because you will go through separate TSA and passport control for both Ireland and the U.S.  It works best if the airline offers check in kiosks, otherwise, you may need even more time.",5,2018,10,16
237,"Recommend The Morrison for location, quality and price!","This hotel had the perfect location for our stay in Dublin.  Right across the River Liffey (adjacent to The Millenium Walking Bridge) from the Temple Bar area and a short walk to the buses.  Facilities very modern and clean.  Pool was amazing with an area for lap swim separate from the ""play areas"", a heated spa (jacuzzi) and a kiddie pool.  Bring a bathing cap!  (or you can purchase one there)",5,2018,10,16
237,Service was second to none,"We were blown away with the service at this hotel. The staff anticipated our every need and already had suggestions and answers before we even asked the questions! I have never stayed in a hotel with better service. 
Location is great too, just north of the Liffy, close to great shops, bars and restaurants and just over the river from Temple Bar. The rooms were spotless, too modern in decor for my taste but my husband loved it. Our room did not have a view, it overlooked the restaurant, which was a shame but it didn't distract us from the wonderful stay here.",5,2018,10,14
237,Great location and equally great experience,"We like to book a few trips to Dublin throughout the year. This time we picked a very central hotel. The Morrison has great river views from the corner suite we booked. The bar downstairs has very friendly staff with a more than adequate selection of drinks.

The staff were very accommodating and made us very welcome. The breakfast was good but not as good as other Hilton group hotels we've visited in the past.",5,2018,10,14
237,"Superb location, quality room. Excellent service","A really warm welcome and 24 hours later the team remembered us and made reference to comments made at check-in. Impressive customer service. 

Room, a corner deluxe was excellent. Clean large and very comfortable. 

Breakfast buffet high quality.

Perfectly located just over the bridge from Temple bar. 

Really struggle to find any fault. 5 star stay. Thank you.",5,2018,10,14
237,Flawless,"I recently spent two nights here on business as we had an event at the hotel and I was very impressed. Although managed by DoubleTree, this is perhaps one of the better ones around and I can fully understand and appreciate why their rates are where they are. Location, service, amenties and those fantastic rooms. Breakfast here was superb each morning, staff all friendly and welcoming and they even remember your names. This was my second trip to Dublin and I have this property short-listed for my return.",5,2018,10,14
237,Brilliant hotel within walking distance of everything,"The Morrison is a terrific place to stay. Although our room wasn’t ready when we arrived at 10:30 am (and why would it be!), we were called the moment it was done at 1 pm. As a Hilton Gold, I was upgraded to a junior suite overlooking the river. The staff were amazingly kind and helpful. The Morrison Grill was lively for drinks. Best part- the hotel is in a quiet area but you can walk across the bridge right outside the hotel and hang out in the entertaining and fun Temple Bar district. Two words: stay here!",5,2018,10,14
237,Fantastic Hotel in the heart of Dublin ,"We stayed in The Morrison as we wanted city center location, the hotel was exceptional. I must highlight the front desk reception service, me and my friend were welcomed and greeted with still warm chocolate chip cookies! Followed by boxes of Buttlers Chocolates in the room. The front desk staff was very friendly, and willing to help organising seeing the town. That was super nice. Room was just perfect, clean, comfiest beds and although we were in the heart of Dublin on Saturday night, the room was quiet and we had a fab sleep. The hotel bar was great, spacious but cosy. Breakfast was excellent, with really really good coffee! That doesn’t happen in hotels very often. I recommend checking Smock Alley theatre that is located 5 mins from the hotel, we enjoyed it so much. ",5,2018,10,14
237,Penthouse,"We had our wedding here two weeks ago and it was a great day. The food was so good, we had great feedback from guests. Everyone who stayed loved their rooms too. The staff were so nice. We had the penthouse that night and it was just fabulous. Our families came up for breakfast the next morning. Would recommend the Morrison 100% - location, staff, decor, food. Sad its all over now :( Special thanks to Marion & Hugh!",4,2018,10,09
237,Perfect Location,"As this hotel is located right across the river from Temple Bar, all of the key insights are within walking distance. The service at this hotel is excellent and the staff was very helpful. Wonderful buffet for breakfast, try the Guinness bread! Rooms are very clean. And as a DoubleTree hotel, you get the famous cookie on arrival. I would highly recommend this hotel for a Dublin city stay.",5,2018,10,08
237,Stay at the Morrison,"Great location, beautiful hotel. We were upgraded to a river view room, it was the perfect setting. The room was so modern, good size, bathroom was great. Lots of little extras. Robe, slippers, large bed. Would stay again",5,2018,10,03
237,Long weekend in Dublin,"Our first visit to Dublin but definitely not our last , the hotel is in a perfect location on the opposite side of the river to Temple Bar and within easy walking distance of most of what Dublin has to offer the tourist .Our room overlooked the river and was ideal . Food was absolutely excellent both in terms of presentation and taste . All staff whether in the restaurant or the bar area are both attentive and very friendly a great introduction to the wit and charm of Dubliners .
Overall could not fault our stay.",5,2018,10,03
237,Great hotel,"We continue to go back to this hotel and have done so for many years. It is handy for the sites and is very well presented, they do very good liqueur coffees in the bar. If it is in your price range you will enjoy this hotel. There is also a very friendly pub next door.",5,2018,10,03
237,Helpful Staff,The staff are superb! Very attentive and helpful. Rooms are very large and clean. The breakfast is great. The bar and the restaurant area is really nice facing the river. Nothing else to ask for. Definitely a must stay!,4,2018,10,03
237,A few days in Dublin,"First class in every way. Emaculate and modern with a warm feel. Friendly and very helpful staff. High standard food and in a great location , walking distance to most major attractions. Would come again in a heart beat. Only neg is expensive parking and no digital clock in the room.",5,2018,10,02
237,Paul Mathews,"This Hotel is a Gem in the downtown area of Dublin.
Really nice modern decor in the foyer and rooms. The beds are very comfortable. Big bar and seating area and the breakfast room is different in the best possible way and the breakfast buffet is wholesome plentiful and mouthwateringly delicious. 
Best of all were the staff, Petra from Portugal was very attentive and charming. 
The lurgan and Dublin made some very interesting and delicious looking cocktails. 
I stuck to the Guinness myself, or should that be the other one ay round? Wonderful Guinness of course! 
I asked for directions at the front desk, one of the managers followed me out to the street and pointed me to the best way to my destination, talk about going the extra mile! Thank you everyone, I’ll be back.",5,2018,10,02
237,Great Hotel and Staff,Very nice hotel and staff! Hotel was clean and very modern. Staff was very friendly and accommodating! Location was great! Steps from the city centre.

Would highly recommend the hotel!",5,2018,10,01

Loved all the coffee options.If you love tea you must do the afternoon tea in the grill.This hotel is within walking distance to everything!,5,2018,09,29
237,Lovely night,"A few weeks ago following a friend's tip I choose The Morrisson Restaurant for a special dinner. 
I not only did not regret it as truly  recommend it and I can not wait to go back to repeat the wonderful experience.  From the moment we arrived until the time that we left, everything was wonderful.
It's  place a fancy/cozy, the menu varied and the food delicious. But for me the difference was the service. Our waiter was a young, tall, Brazilian with a big  smile that made us feel at home. He welcome us as in a very warm way, explained each dish, and even the wine that we chose was his recommendation. Thank you  Morrisson and  thank you Junior for making my special night so perfect.",5,2018,09,27
237,"Great location, and newly renovated.","Great location, within walking distance to a lot of tourist attraction and shopping area. Very convenient and easy to walk around. It is also newly renovated so it feels clean and updated. Staff is also friendly. ",5,2018,09,26
237,Best ever,"My friend and I were in Ireland for two weeks and stayed in many hotels and we both feel that this hotel was the best hotel mainly because of the great length the staff go to to make sure your stay with them is exceptional.   Pietr at the front desk made us feel like family and Shea at the bar also treated us like family.  The hotel is very chic, very modern, very comfortable with lots of little extras such as hand cloths to dry your hands in the washrooms,  many staff members taking the time to make sure you have everything you need,   large rooms with beautiful decor and fully equipped complete with a lounging bench.  The breakfast is excellent and you can select from the well stocked and always fresh food buffet and/or from the menu.   This hotel is directly across the street from the River Liffey and is within an easy walk to many restaurants, stores and tourist attractions.   Thank you to each and every staff member who made our stay a pure delight.",5,2018,09,26
237,30th anniversary,"If you come to Ireland and don’t stay at The Morrison you’ve cheated yourself! The service here is nothing short of phenomenal. Ask and it shall be given seems to be their motto when it come to taking care of their guests. The rooms are well appointed, and the restaurants are top notch, but its the service that brings us back every time we’re in Ireland.",5,2018,09,24
237,Amazing,"What a fabulous place to come to for food.The early bird menu had loads of choice and the portion sizes are HUGE.Service was fantastic ,toilets were spotless..I highly recommend a visit to this hotel for food",5,2018,09,23
237,Amazing room service ,"Stayed at Morrison for one night with my partner, room was so bright, but one small issues was our room was very close to noisy street but otherwise one of the receptionist was helpful to get a ear plus for us. Also couldn’t remember young lady for room service for our excellent breakfast. Will be back soon!",5,2018,09,21
237,Very Pleasant Stay,"Great location just across the foot bridge on the north side of the Liffey River near Temple Bar.  Very accommodating, pleasant, and congenial staff.  We arrived  before 10:00 a.m. and our room was not yet ready so we had breakfast and waited in the lobby.    We checked in early at 12:00.   Our three day stay was outstanding.  The morning breakfast is excellent.  When we return to Dublin, we will stay at the DoubleTree again.",5,2018,09,19
237,Perfect location,We just returned home from a trip to Dublin and were very happy with our stay at the Morrison . It is right in the thick of all the city has to offer. You can walk to almost all the attractions. Temple bar is the eating and drinking area and is right across the pedestrian bridge. Only a four minute walk. All the day tour companies are located on O’Connell street which is also a short 8-10 minute walk. You don’t need to rent a car if you stay here. Actually I would not recommend you drive in Ireland. It would be extremely nerve racking. The desk people were extremely kind and helpful. ,5,2018,09,18
237,Restaurant  visit ,What a lovely place passed it many a time. Went in tonight to be greeted by a lovely lad from Lurgan what a delight  he was real made the night. Prawns to start and duck even had dessert couldn’t fault it . Will be back thanks to staff and chefs who cooked my duck just perfect.,5,2018,09,17
237,Nice upgrade ,"The staff here are very good , had a very warm welcome and a surprise upgrade to a junior suite .
Anything from the Josper grill in the bar is super tasty, I had a very good T Bone steak and it was excellent .
Special shout out to the bartender who I think was from Donegal , great service and craic.
Breakfast was decent with
2 lovely young ladies in full charge of the room.
Parking is next door and 19 euros for the 24hour period .
Will stay again
",5,2018,09,17
237,Perfect place to stay,"Excellent location, value, staff, cleanliness... modern decor... it was crazy quiet but close to everything... lounge, food, drinks, & staff there great.... breakfast buffet was great plus the price was phenomenal (free)...would stay again in a heartbeat (I’m pretty picky & they won me over 100%)",5,2018,09,17
237,"Awesome Staff, Great Location!","We loved our stay, the Staff could not do enough for us when we arrived after our overnight flight.  The hotel is also located in the perfect location to see the Dublin. It is walking distance to most sights",5,2018,09,16
237,"Beautiful hotel with warm, friendly staff","My family & I stayed at this hotel the last night of our trip to Ireland. I recommend this hotel just on it's location - It's so close to Temple bar, but not too close where it's too loud. Everything in the building is completely updated. Dining offers were endless - we only had the chance to enjoy the complimentary breakfast, but the afternoon tea looked AMAZING. The front desk team was so kind & was able to offer us early check-in & an upgrade with my honors status. Thank you for the wonderful, quick stay!",5,2018,09,14
237,Great Experience!,"The experience was wonderful.  The staff was extremely helpful and welcoming.  Location was great, central to Temple District, shopping and easy access to the hop on hop off bus.  Parking was a bit confusing, but once we realized it was the garage next door everything went well.  ",5,2018,09,14
237,Great location and comfortable rooms,Great location and comfortable rooms. Easy walking distance from Temple Bar area and other sites. Quiet room.  Good air conditioning (so you don’t have to open the window and be disturbed by city sounds while you sleep. Bar and breakfast staff were very friendly and extremely attentive to our needs. ,5,2018,09,13
237,Dreary hotel- few benefits for diamond,As a Hilton diamond member I expect more. Booked this room at end of stay as friend was leaving 1 day before me. I had no upgrade and was given a tiny room with a bed fit for a child! As a diamond member I would expect at least a view of the river. Also the bed was ridiculously tiny and hard. I know this is Europe but really? The hotel lobby and bar is really dark and drabby. Would never return.,2,2018,09,12
237,Great wedding venue,Attended a family wedding here recently. We had a fantastic day. The staff were so nice from start to finish. A big shout out to Odhran who went to great lengths to look after our group and always with his charming smile. Thank you so much. We all commented on how good the food was at the wedding- very impressive. Well done to all would recommend the Morrison as a great wedding venue. ,4,2018,09,10
237,"Great location, near almost all the Dublin activities!!","Stayed here four nights on vacation!! Had a king junior suite which was very comfortable, nice to have the sofa to sit on and relax after doing all the tourist sites everyday. The hotel is within walking distance to pretty much everything ... 10 minutes to the Jameson Distillery tour, 25 minutes to the Guinness Storehouse tour, right across the river from the Temple Bar area and all its restaurants, shops and bars, 10-15 minutes from Trinity College and the Irish Whiskey Museum, 15-20 minutes from the Irish National Museum, two streets away from the Jervis shopping Mall and Henry Street pedestrian shopping and the Dublin Spire. So you can see its very centrally located making it an idela location. Our room looked out over the Liffe River (Pronounced with a short ""i"" - liff-ee, like jiffy). Room had a nice bed, TV, mini bar, hair dryer, safe, iron and board. Restaurant/bar and room service on site. Nice hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. But you will pay for the location, not cheap by any means, but worth it if you want to be near everything!!",5,2018,09,10
237,Loved!!,The moment you walk in the concierge is so friendly and helpful. The lobby always smells fantastic. They offer fresh warm cookies. The room is clean bright and well decorated. Perfect location. Across the bridge for temple bar area which is fun but loud. And close to restaurants and shopping. Would def recommend!,5,2018,09,10
237,Great location ,Very modern and nicely decorated hotel in fantastic location for seeing Dublin. It's like most Hiltons and quite pricey but good service and amenities. Very comfy beds and big pillows to help you sleep!,4,2018,09,10
237,Great location - and air conditioning!,"We had a terrific stay in Dublin at the Morrison. The rooms were updated and very comfortable. And the AC was key for us Americans!! The staff was very accommodating as well. If we are lucky enough to return to Dublin, the Morrison it is! ",5,2018,09,09
237,Wedding,"Anybody that thinks about getting married in Dublin really needs to book here,what an amazing day and night, thank you to all the staff that made our day so special, you’s all went above and beyond the call of duty,from checking in to room service you’s were totally amazing,I cannot thank you’s enough ",5,2018,09,09
237,Incredible customer service,"The customer service was unbelievable! From the front desk to housekeeping to restaurant service, we felt completely welcomed as guests. Plus, the hotel is perfectly located in the heart of the city. It was the basis to an incredible 4 day vacation in Dublin. ",5,2018,09,07
237,Fantastic in every way,"Our four days stay at the Morrison was great. The hotel is centrally located. Just across the Liffey is the Temple Bar area so you are right in the action area but still quiet at night. Trinity College, Grafton Street, O'Connel Street, St Stephens Green are all within walking distance. The starting point for day trips is at O'Connel street which also has all the shops and a big mall is just behind the hotel. Room was comfy and the air conditioning worked well. Breakfast was a treat and service was superb. We could order from a list of items which are specially prepared for the guests. The area around the hotel was busy so felt safe even at night. Reception staff was always smiling and helpful especially when the city was on lockdown due to the Pope's visit. The welcome chocolate cookie added a nice touch. Thank you all at Morrison!!!! 

",4,2018,09,07
237,"Great Staff, Great Property and excellent location","We stayed at the Morrison last week for about 5 days.  The staff was courteous, helpful and willing to help you out with whatever is needed.  The room was clean and comfortable and in a great location so almost anything we needed was in easy walking distance.  The breakfast buffer had a little bit of everything,  no one should come out of there hungry.    There was so much attention to detail.   The outside rooms can be a little noisy with the windows open but it didn't bother us.  Would highly recommend this hotel for touring in Dublin",5,2018,09,06
237,"Employees saved the hotel, otherwise poor review","First off, it took us over an hour to find this place.  The outside says ""The Morrison Grill"" or something close to that.  So we drove around thinking ""Morrison"" may be the neighborhood, not the Doubletree.  We looked for all of the typical Doubletree or Hilton signage.  Nope.  So drove and drove around the various blocks in the area.  Not being from Ireland, we drive on the other side.  This made it just plain awful.  There is no valet, no swoop to pull into, no parking in front to unload, etc.  No indication that this was a hotel.  Had to call the hotel twice.  Thank goodness they were SUPER helpful.  I've attached a photo for your viewing pleasure that shows the size of the sign.  It was about the size of a hand.  Good luck seeing that, on a side street, not the main street, driving on the wrong side, looking out for tourist illegally crossing the road.  FYI....if you see the Arlington Hotel, you've gone too far....we saw it at least six times.  :)  (it's pink)

The lobby smells like an overdone Hollister or Abercrombie store.  I get migraines from scents and the smell was very over powering.  

Paid close to $300 Euro.  Would definitely not stay there again.

The rooms were small.  I know this is Europe and that's how they roll, but they were small, just as an fyi.  

Parking is $19 and good luck getting your car into one of the spots.  

The staff were friendly.",3,2018,09,02
237,"Good hotel, fantastic location","The Morrison is a fine hotel in a fantastic location right in the heart of downtown Dublin. It's just steps away from a pedestrian bridge over the River Liffe which leads one directly to the Temple Bar district. The hotel is also a 10 minute walk from prime sightseeing locations, such as Trinity College's library and the Book of Kells. The hotel itself is what I expect from a hotel in the Hilton chain: clean and professional, with good amenities in the room. The breakfast buffet was fairly standard, but did have a couple of nice touches such as excellent smoothies and chocolate muffins. I would recommend the hotel, and would certainly stay there again if I were back in Dublin.",4,2018,08,31
237,Surpassed our expectations!,"Perfect location, overlooking the Liffey River, and within walking distance to many points of historical and cultural interest.  Pubs with great food all within proximity.
The bed was very comfortable, the amenities quite nice, and the breakfast pretty decent.
The only thing I didn't like was the lack of water pressure from the rain shower... took forever to wash my hair!
Other than that, no complaints.  The room was modern and very clean,  Service was great. 
Thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Dublin,and cannot say enough about Irish hospitality,  The people are so friendly.  We arrived on a very early flight, and the staff was able to get us checked in by 10am.",5,2018,08,31
237,"GREAT Location, Service and Physcial Property","Outstanding property with uniformly helpful and professional service.  I was in a junior suite, which was quite spacious and of contemporary design. Suffers from the current trend of insufficient drawer space; I think I am in the minority in finding this objectionable.   Perfect location on the river across from the Temple Bar. Close to a tram stop.  Plenty of very good restaurants/bars and stores very close by. Great breakfast buffet.  Decent fitness center, which seemed small; however, I was the only person in it each time I used it.  Only complaint is that outside noise (vehicles, people, seagulls which wake up before dawn…) was more noticeable than it should have been.",5,2018,08,31
237,Fun fun fun!!@,"If you want to experience peace and fresh air i suggest you pack your bags and head to dublin at the morrison hotel, great food, great service... the place is just stunning.
I had an awesome time at the morrison hotel one of the best hotels i have ever visited. Difinitely coming back with my wife.",5,2018,08,30
237,Great Location. ,"Three things are essential in a good hotel:  a good bed, a good shower and a quiet room. Throw in a perfect location and excellent service and you get a Five Star rating. Directly across the River Liffey and a five minute walk to Temple Bar is a great location, but far enough away from the revelry.  Great hot shower.  Awesome service.  Highly recommended. ",5,2018,08,30
237,Great Hotel right in the middle of everything - easy walking,"Booked this w points because I am a Hilton Diamond member.  Turns out, it's quite close ( 10 - 20 min walk ) to many things to do - Guiness, Churches, Dublin Castle, Temple Bar area is right over the river.  

Not sure of the room price but the room was nice, hotel is nice, staff is friendly.",5,2018,08,30
237,Great centrally located hotwl,Great hotel located in an ideal spot if visiting downtown Dublin. Comfortable rooms and beds. Sound isn’t bad from streets esp if AC is running as it drowns it out better. Bathrooms are large and showers are great.,5,2018,08,28
237,Wedding Day,"We had our Wedding in Morrison Hotel recently and I could not praise it enough. The Hotel has it all great location,style and great food. But what separates this hotel from other hotels in Dublin are the staff. All the staff we came in contact over the entire weekend could not be more helpful and professional. Special thanks to Marion wedding coordinator who was so easy to deal with and alwys full of great advise. To  William and Gavin and team who ensured everything ran smoothly on the day and without a hitch.

To anyone thinking of booking Morrison for wedding or other function I could not recommend highly enough,you will not regret having your day heere",5,2018,08,28
237,Close to everything but not in the fray,"A nice hotel with a Dublin vibe - great service, nice rooms, can't beat the location.  Because it's across a footbridge from the Temple Bar area, it's only a 5 minute walk, but away from the noise.  We thoroughly enjoyed the stay.  The only slight negative was that the breakfast was only okay.",5,2018,08,28
237,"Good Location, Modern Hotel","This hotel is located across the river from the Temple Bar area. It is on a quiet street, close to a mall. We were greeted by Piotr at the front desk. We were not very happy with our first room (which barely had a window) and he was extremely helpful. Not only did he get us a new room but he also had the rooms ready almost immediately (even though we had arrived much earlier from a NY flight). The rooms (we had 2) were nice with a small balcony. They were not very big but comfortable with a firm bed. The AC worked great and it was a nice amenity considering it was still pretty warm in Dublin. Breakfast was served downstairs and was very good. It was a buffet with a few items on the menu. It was tasty and offered a lot of choices. We had dinner at the hotel restaurant which was disappointing but Simon Smyth did everything he could to improve the situation and all was forgiven considering his efforts and professionalism.",4,2018,08,27
237,Near Temple Bar - a perfect central location,"The service at this hotel was great, very high quality. The location could not be better, right across the river from Temple Bar and close to italian quarter with some really nice restaurants. I got upgraded to a nice big room and it was really nice. The hotel has a nice modern design and the lightening in the rooms was spectacular, transparent pink bedtable and other exciting details. There was a little shelf to put your mobile on while loading it, nice design detail. Nice big bathroom with free products and a tub. The breakfast buffe was good but there was a lot of disposable products, not so sustainable. I never went to the gym but I took a look and it was reaaly nice with a lot of good exercise machines. I would really recommend this hotel if you can afford a little more than usual.",5,2018,08,27
237,Good but could have been better,"Hotel was very nice, located in a central location walking distance to a lot of great attractions, shops and restaurants.   I had a free night voucher via Hilton Honours so had to do 2 separate bookings according to Hilton, but was reassured I would be given the same room for both nights and the agent I spoke to on the phone made notes on the booking.  I stay in a lot of Hiltons and usually they are always good about specific requirements when told in advance.  On the day we arrived we were advised by the lovely lady at the desk that we were being upgraded to a larger room and she advised us we would be in the same room for both nights but all I would  have to do is come and get my keycard renewed due to having 2 separate bookings for the 2 nights.  The room was splendid, very large with a fantastic view.  The room was airy and very clean.  The next day when I went to renew my key card the person on the desk advised me that I would have to change rooms as I had been upgraded for my free night, but they would not upgrade me for the next night.  I explained I had a small child with me (whose birthday it was on that particular day) and we did not want to change rooms, and the decision to upgrade me for the first (free) night of my stay but the second (chargeable) is perplexing.  To be honest I never push for upgrades so I would not have been bothered if they had not upgraded me, but I really do dislike having to keep changing rooms.  Eventually after loading up emails of correspondence with the hotel etc the manager agreed to leave us in the same room.  For the birthday my child was given some small treats which was nice by European hotel standards.  I booked a hotel transfer so that they would provide a car seat for my child- this was noted on the booking.  Unfortunately both ways this was not provided.  The hotel had in emails said to me that if I get a taxi at the airport there was not guarantee of a carseat , but they would be able to get one through the company they use for transfers.  So on reflection it would have been probably just easier to use a taxi.  So the hotel is of a very good standard and we did enjoy our time in Dublin.  I feel that the above points were enough to cause some unwanted stress on a holiday that was planned for my sons birthday but not enough to deter from the good things about the hotel.  Therefore I would still recommend.",4,2018,08,26
237,Great location and smart too,"Great modern warm and welcoming hotel with first class staff, top marks for head of recruitment. 
This a great hotel right on the banks of the river opposite Temple Barr so great location for getting around and seeing the sites. 
Try it you will not be disappointed. ",5,2018,08,24
237,5* all the way,"Three of us had a light lunch - toasted sandwiches - on Thursday 23rd. August 2018 and they were delicious. We were served by Shea and Gary, who were welcoming, friendly and highly efficient - great Ambassadors for the Hotel business in Dublin. Our coffees were accompanied with lovely petit fours - an excellent addition. I must say it is wonderful to be greeted by members of staff and this happened as I walked to the Gents room, when two Ladies ( who were about to enter an elevator) said "" Hello/ Good morning"". Many thanks Shea and Gary for a great experience on a very inclement ( monsoon type rain) day.",5,2018,08,24
237,Close to Temple Bar!,"We enjoyed staying at the Morrison.  It was very close to Temple bar and Trinity college.  A quick walk across Ha'penny bridge and we were in the middle of Temple Bar. The breakfast in the morning was very good with many choices. It even had a barrista, who made special coffees. The beds were very comfortable.  The room was adequate in size with stylish contemporary furnishings. ",5,2018,08,23
237,August 2018,"Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Morrison.  It is excellent in every respect.  Paul, especially made our stay most enjoyable.  Food in all restaurants was delicious and the staff was most accommodating.",5,2018,08,23
237,"Nice hotel, hard as a rock bed","The Morrison is a boutique, modern hotel with an attractive lobby and restaurant.  Our room faced the canal, but frankly, the view was not worth the extra money. We liked the unique purple cubes emitting a glow as well as the other lighting.  As for location, it was near the bridge to the Temple Bar, so everything was within walking distance.  However, the area around the hotel itself was just so-so.   Good air conditioning, which is hard to find in Ireland.  Our bed was so hard, that it required a mattress topper to help cushion it, and it already had two cushions on, when we arrived.  The hotel is obviously aware of the hardness of their beds.  If you like an extra-firm mattress, this place is for you!",4,2018,08,22
237,Perfect location and rooms,"The staff was incredibly friendly in every interaction and certainly helped us find our way around the city.  The junior suite is worth every penny.  We had a beautiful view of the river and the Temple Bar area but it was still perfectly quiet to get some sleep at night!  This place has so much within walking distance we never needed a car or taxi.As a side note, I happen to love a firm bed so this was perfect for me...but be aware the bed is a bit on the stiff side for anyone who happens to like softer beds.",5,2018,08,21
237,Fantastic Afternoon tea,"Our Hen party (13 people I think) enjoyed the Fancy Pants afternoon tea with Prosseco last Saturday.   A few of us arrived a little early but were immediately welcomed and offered a seat at the table - we went to the bathrooms to freshen up and found them delightful, very clean and such an amazing aroma!   Once everyone had gathered drinks were served - tea was provided in pots and coffee by the cup.  The food was beautifully presented on stands (one between two) and everything was delicious.  Despite that, we ha lots of left over cakes which we took back to the apartment in take away boxes kindly provided by the hotel.  Overall a wonderful experience in delightful surroundings just by the River and close to Temple Bar.",5,2018,08,21
237,Great location,"Great location, clean hip, great rooms and super staff.We were a family of four and had two rooms they were great for breakfast could be a little better but other than that no complaints would  definitely stay here again.  Great location close to everything but just far enough away from Temple bar five minute walk or less but away from all the noise",4,2018,08,19
237,The place to stay in Dublin,Convenient location - easy walking access to major tourist sites and great restaurants; public transportation (bus service) available right outside; excellent breakfast served in the morning; and comfortable rooms.,5,2018,08,18
237,Wonderful everything,"We actually stayed at the Morrison three different times during our trip to Ireland.  The location, the accommodations, the breakfast and the staff were wonderful.  The breakfast had many delicious options for celiacs which I appreciated, in addition to a beautiful array of yummy fruits, eggs and breads.  We arrived without our luggage and the staff was helpful assisting us in calling the airlines, country codes etc.  Every staff member we met at the hotel was interesting, friendly and welcoming.  Both Fernandina and Annetta were attentive and helpful. We had a great stay!",5,2018,08,16
237,"Really great location, nice hotel","You can’t beat this location in the center of Dublin. Close to all the fun stuff. The hotel itself is nice. As luck would have it, as a Hilton Honors member I got a terrific upgrade to a junior suite with a view of the river. Loved it. While I’m sure how the regular rooms compare, I would definitely go back to this hotel regardless. 

Only one small ding: eat breakfast elsewhere. The Eggs Benedict I had was skimpy and terribly over priced. There are far better places nearby by to start your day like Lemon Jelly restaurant, not even a block away. ",4,2018,08,15
237,Not wowed,"Let me start by saying there’s nothing wrong with this hotel, just that the reviews somewhat confused our own experiences. 

As everyone says, the location is great and perhaps the saving grace. Our suite was modern and clean, but not hugely comfortable. The bed was not particularly stable and creaky on its little wooden legs. The bathroom got very hot with not much ventilation and poor light. Breakfast was pretty disappointing in terms of selection and having to chase people for things like a cup for tea or butter for toast. We went out for breakfast the next day. 

The gym was better than expected and we found the staff very friendly. 

",3,2018,08,15
237,"Perfect location, exceptional staff!","You couldn’t ask for a better location, one block/bridge from Temple Bar and you couldn’t ask for better staff! We arrived early and the staff took our luggage and gave many fabulous suggestions to entertain us until the room was ready. When our room was ready, they’d already put our bags in our room! Perfect location. My moms first transatlantic trip and she is STILL talking about how comfy the beds were. ",5,2018,08,14
237,Family Stay,"Recently stayed for 2 nights with my wife and 2 kids aged 9 and 9 months. I can’t recommend this hotel enough. The location is fantastic and is in walking distance of O Connell St and Grafton St. Temple bar is literally across the Liffey and Jervis shopping center is a 2 minute walk. We really enjoyed the food which is of high standard and with excellent service. The staff in this hotel are it’s best asset , the best I’ve encountered, unbelievably friendly and professional. Our room was spacious and trendy with a beautiful view of the Liffey and the Haypenny Bridge. Very clean and modern. 

Highly recommend ",5,2018,08,14
237,Great location,"We booked The Morrison for its price and location in Dublin.  Upon arrival one of the receptionist came outside to the car to help with our luggage.  We had about 8 suitcases since we were traveling with 12 family members.  He was very helpful because the street is very tight with a lot of traffic.  The reception staff was excellent with both the check in and check out processes.  We had 6 rooms for our family of 12 for 3 nights.  The Morrison's location makes it very easy to walk to many of the museums, attractions and the bars, especially in the Temple Bar area.  Unfortunately, the room my wife and I had was a corner room on the second floor.  We heard everything that was happening on the streets late at night and into the early morning hours.  And then Monday morning (7 am) a garbage truck pulled up below our window to collect the empty bottles from the bar.  This took 20 minutes and was very loud.  The room itself was excellent but the location was not.  Our family members had no issues because they had interior rooms.
The hotel style is very modern.  The staff was very helpful with any of our needs.  The price was very good for the hotel’s location.",4,2018,08,14
237,Great location,Was in a good location for walking to shops & pubs. Parking was off site 1 block. They off set the parking fee.Room was great. Air conditioned. nice staff.check in is later in afternoon. Will hold bags & place them in your room when it is ready.,4,2018,08,13
237,Afternoon Tea,Absolutely amazing afternoon tea here. Fantastic food. Brilliant selection. Beautiful surroundings staff are great. Definatlely recommend worth a visit to treat yourself. Can't wait to go back. My friend loved it too.,5,2018,08,11
237,Great location,We stayed for 5 nights in May.  Our room was clean and comfortable.  The location was excellent - we walked to all of the areas of Dublin we wanted to see.  We thoroughly enjoyed the bar area.  All of the staff were friendly and helpful.  Overall a great experience staying at the Morrison.,5,2018,08,10
237,Excellent Location,"We stayed as a couple for the weekend. Upon arrival we got a warm gooey cookie, was a really nice touch. The room was clean & modern. Great location for exploring Dublin, you don't need a car...we walked everywhere.
The Breakfast is totally worth it.",5,2018,08,09
237,Excellent location and comfortable room,"We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights. The check-in process was quick and efficient. The lady at the reception counter was very helpful and gave us some suggestion on where to buy some necessities as we, same as all other passengers, experienced delayed luggages due to technical problem of aircraft.

The room was spotlessly and comfortable. We had dinner at the Morrison Grill on the 1st night and the food was tasty. 

The location is excellent and is within walking distance to a huge shopping mall and lots of restaurants at Temple bar.",4,2018,08,08
237,Perfect hotel for Dublin ,"Excellent location. Not very busy area, yet short walk to everything. People were wonderful here. Parking was very reasonable and just one block away. Get it stamped by the hotel reception for your discount, and then make sure you pay at the window to a human and not thru the machine. 
For Dublin, if you stay here, you don’t need a car. The furthest attraction is probably Kilmainham Jail, which is a quick bus ride away at only 2.1 Euros. 
Breakfast was perfect here. ",5,2018,08,08
237,Way above average,"As others have noted, the location is excellent, within walking distance to many attractions.  I loved the very large room, the modern décor, the separate shower (yeah!) and the excellent breakfast.  Originally, I booked without breakfast but when I tried it on the first day, I decided to add it to my room rate, even though there were other cafes nearby.  The hotel is not very large so there isn't much of a view, but the room was quiet and the housekeeping was impeccable.  I highly recommend this hotel. Dublin hotels are pricey, but location is really important because some attractive hotels in Dublin are in business areas that are absolutely dead at night.  The Morrison is in the lively City Center which was important to me as a solo traveler.",5,2018,08,07
237,My Favourite Dublin Hotel,"This is my favourite place to stay, in Dublin. What can I say, the warm, gooey, cookie on arrival, just wins me over, every time! 

Other than that, the hotel is also really nice, with comfortable beds and lovely staff, in a really handy location. I'll always stay here when I'm visiting Dublin.",4,2018,08,07
237,Great location,"Booked here due to reviews and location. Just across the river from Temple Bar.  Wonderful modern hotel, great views of the river and a fantastic room.  No noise issues, especially due to location. Rooms spacious, well appointed and probably the most comfortable bed I have slept in. If I could I would have bought the bed and transported home. Impeccable staff, always willing to help and welcoming. Stayed in many 5 star hotels across the globe, but this one is in the top 5. The Morrison has the perfect location for the City. Thanks guys, can’t wait to stay again. Highly recommend. ",5,2018,08,06
237,Fabulous Location,"I just spent 2 nights at this hotel. I loved the location which was so close to Temple Bar, Trinity University, Grafton Street, O'Connell Street etc.
The rooms were very modern other than the bathroom. I would have truly loved a walk in shower which they did not have. I also didn't rate the towel size/quality.
The bar area was lovely. The breakfast which was included was very nice.
I would stay there again, although a little overpriced.",4,2018,08,06
237,Business and pleasure ,"Location is ideal. Right in the middle of anything you want to see. The staff were all very friendly. Room always cleaned promptly. The bar staff was especially great. Shea the food service manager was a gem. Made us feel like we had been friends forever. 
The rooms are on the small side but very nice. ",5,2018,08,06
237,Superb Staff! Great Location!,"I can't rave enough about the lovely representative at the desk of the Morrison who found a room for me when I arrived at 7:00 am, after a long flight. How rare it is for a hotel to stray from policy by more than an hour or so. I am so grateful for this courtesy!

The Morrison was a wonderful, boutiquey hotel located just far enough from the crowds but so close to O'Connell, Temple Bar, Trinity, etc. Fabulous restaurants nearby, an interesting area to say the least...a bit off the beaten track which made it more peaceful. The room was spacious, immaculate, included necessary bathroom amenities, bottled water, and most importantly, fabulous air-conditioning (Dublin has been quite hot the last month). Staff members from the beginning to the end of my stay were so helpful and genuinely pleasant. Do not miss the array of brilliant quotations (Irish writers, of course!) on the walls throughout the public and private spaces.",5,2018,08,06
237,Amazing Time,"Great location, near to some really amazing attractions. Good food and service. Restaurant had a good selection of food for breakfast and dinner. Room and bathroom are well styled and good sized. Staff were really nice, friendly and helpful.",4,2018,08,05
237,"Lovely hotel, excellent restaurant but parking is terrible!","This lovely hotel is comfortable, well located and has an excellent restaurant!  I would have given it 5 stars except for two issues:  the signage and visibility with no numbered address AND the parking charges.
The hotel refuses to put a number in their address on the Quay so impossible to locate with GPS (it’s 14, by the way) and at night the signage is invisible since the hotel entry is actually not on the Quay, but on a side street.  We drove in and absolutely missed the hotel and took an hour to find it winding around on one way streets.
The parking for the hotel is in the next block and is terribly expensive!  The rate which was negotiated for Hilton actually ended up HIGHER than if we had just used the hourly rate because of some insane policy, agreed to for the Hotel, that charges for 24 hours starting at 7AM so we managed to get to the hotel at 2:40 AM and were charged an entire day for that 4+ hours.  The hotel management really needs to make a more reasonable policy with the parking garage.
Now to the good news:
The lobby and staff are friendly and welcoming.  It’s a very modern hotel and it was clean and well maintained throughout all the public areas.  
The rooms are pleasant and modern.  There was not a lot of space in the double with two beds but it was adequate and quiet. The view from our room was to a side street but it was not noisy and it was still bright.  The airco was effective and quick to work.  There was a small fridge and a conveniently located safe as well as adequate closet space for two people.
The bathroom was clean, a tub shower was present and a bit hard to get in and out because the tub was raised, but there was a handhold.  The soaps and shampoo were good quality.  The bath was a bit small but adequate and stylish and clean.
The steakhouse was very good and surprisingly reasonably priced.  The breakfast is rather expensive but is convenient and choosing the continental option (juices, breads, coffee or tea, yogurt, cold sliced meats and cheeses, fruits) is almost the same as the more expensive full breakfast.  
The location is very, very good and within easy walking distance to all the touristic areas.  Probably 15 minutes walk to Grafton St and Trinity College as well as St Stephens park and the history museum.
It is surrounded by a number of pubs and eateries as well as little shops.  (Beaders beware!  There is a wonderful bead and crystal Store just up the street on the quay!  Lots of great, unusual stuff and a good selection of Celtic charms and pendants).
Overall, quite highly recommended as a stay for your visit to Dublin!",4,2018,08,04
237,Excellent Stay...  Thank you Fernanda,"We had an excellent 3 night stay recently at the Morrison in one of your suites.  This is our 3rd time staying at the Morrison, and we love the hotel.
Fernanda, the manager, went out of her way to ensure we had a great stay.  Thank you Fernanda. You are a gem. The staff were excellent.  The rooms and hotel were as beautiful as always.  Love the breakfast buffet and your restaurant.
I missed that Darren was no longer working there at the front desk.  However, your front desk staff were very nice.
Will definitely stay at your hotel again. Looking forward to it.
Thanks...",5,2018,08,03
237,Amazing Night,Staff and room was first class. My room was not ready at 3pm so the girl at the desk gave me a upgrade! I was trying to  get a room for this weekend as Loved it so much. If you need a place to stay in Dublin try it.. Each room has a different feel to it but all amazing and so clean ,5,2018,08,03
237,Flawless Stay,"I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel- Check in was quick and efficient with a complimentary cookie also given to us on arrival which was a sweet touch. The hotel has a wonderful location right in the heart of the city centre. The lobby and rooms are both beautifully decorated. Our room was clean, spacious and also had a balcony. There was complimentary water also in the room. We were celebrating our anniversary and a wonderful plate was also left in our room when we returned from dinner which was a very thoughtful extra. We dined in the restaurant for dinner which delivered fast service and tasty food. Our waitress (Portugese girl- sorry don't remember the name) was very nice and super friendly! Breakfast the next morning also had a great selection - and an a la carte menu which gave you a choice of an omelette/French toast etc that you could order. 
All the staff I encountered were beyond helpful and friendly in all outlets including, evening/morning food and beverage team, accommodation and in room dining. 
Will definitely return to this hotel.",5,2018,08,01
237,Neglected details,"We stayed five nights in July. On the whole the staff were very friendly and helpful. However, our stay was spoilt by small things: the water drained slowly from the washbasin, the toilet flushed with difficulty, the thermostat did not appear to work, the phone also did not function correctly. As we did not want workmen coming through our room we tolerated these minor inconveniences. The fire alarm went off at 2.30am on our final night. The hotel should ensure its facilities work, particularly when charging a high room rate.",3,2018,07,31
237,Love this hotel!,"It was our first time in Dublin and we were unsure of what to expect in a hotel, but everything about The Morrison turned out to be fantastic.  We had just flown in from California and we arrived before our room was ready, but the front desk employee was more than accommodating.  He offered to hold our bags for us and even escorted us downstairs to a room where we could take a shower and change (the service from everyone at this hotel was outstanding).  We went for a bite to eat and the hotel called about a half our later to let us know our room was ready.  When we got back, our bags had already been delivered to the room.  The room was large with a very comfortable bed and an assortment of pillows.  We had a great, unobstructed view of the river through two large windows.  The bathroom was big with a glass shower, separate tub, and dual-sink vanity.  Breakfast in the morning was a full Irish breakfast buffet and you could also order from the menu.  The food was great and the service friendly and quick.  The full bar was a great place to hang out after a full day exploring the Temple Bar area, which was only a short 5 minute walk across the river on a foot-bridge.  The bartenders were always super friendly and we met lots of other travelers there.  Other employees would stop to say hi and check to make sure everything was going well.  The decor of the hotel was very modern and stylish.  I can be a little picky, but I really have nothing negative to say about this hotel.  We will definitely stay here again if we ever make it back to Dublin.",5,2018,07,30
237,7 star hotel,"it was my first time in Dublin , my wife booked the hotel and we have no regrets very good central location easy to get to from the airport.

a clean hotel modern look and lovely fragrance as you walk in the staff are very helpful and will go the extra mile to make you feel like a King or Queen.

the reception staff was the first thing that made me rate the hotel , they gave very good directions and a quick check in. The following day we went for breakfast the staff take you to you table, after a few minutes they asked us for tea or coffee this was served in no time we got our breakfast and ordered extra's on the menu.

The service was world glass , some one was always there to assist and no request was turned down, my wife requested fruit tea and they provided this and some crackers for her salmon and the manager made sure she brought some. I have travelled but the service at this hotel is the best I have received and I wish all hotels could offer such service. It makes you feel valued unlike other hotels were once you are given a table its see you later.

I would recommend this to anyone without hesitation at all could not fault anything at the hotel and I rate them a 7 star you wont regret its not a hit and miss. I could go on and on but to the management and staff well done you have really set the standards in the sky , keep it up and keep your staff happy they are every smiling and happy to serve.",5,2018,07,29
237,"Conveniently located, great food, good service and Neo - modern art","The Morrison is just a stroll across the Liffey river; from the famous Temple Bar district. Trinity College and the Tourist office would take about 15 minutes to reach by foot, while some of the shopping areas are right behind the hotel.
Art work seems to the theme of the decor; the most impressive piece being the 'Bird Man', though it may not be wise to sit at the table which it overlooks.
Food is great and the staff were most friendly and helpful.",4,2018,07,29
237,Surprise Boutique Experience,"I stayed in The Morrison on Thursday the 28th of July and was properly impressed. Very welcoming staff and was given a lovely surprise of being upgraded to a Junior Suite when I checked in. 

Lovely room on the 2nd floor, spacious, clean, quiet and very relaxing. Had a drink in the hotel bar, possibly a bit more expensive than a pub close by but that was to be expected considering the hotel brand and the location of the hotel.

Breakfast was top notch. It was a buffet but everything was fresh and hot and a very good selection. Staff were very friendly and helpful. 

The hotel was fantastic and I will definitely be making a return visit. It’s central location, 200 yards from Temple Bar, 5mins walk from O’Connell St. and Henry St. area and 15mins walk from Grafton St. Also the LUAS, Dublin Tram service, is just behind the hotel.

I will bring my wife on a weekend away next time and hopefully I’m lucky enough that I get the same lovely room upgrade. 

Superb hotel",5,2018,07,28
237,Phenomenal service & food,"Highly recommend this hotel. They are superb all across the board. We hosted an event & the staff was amazing. Big shout out to HUGH! He took care of our every need. The food was delicious as well. You can't beat the location, it's across the river from the pub section & you can walk everywhere easily. All the staff was helpful & friendly, thanks to Aneta in Halo for greeting me every morning with a smile. 

Rooms are spacious, shower had good pressure. I really enjoyed my stay, thanks for a great visit.",5,2018,07,26
237,"Convenient location, great staff, clean/comfy hotel","This hotel was perfect for us.  First, it was the middle of the crazy heat-wave in Ireland, and this was the ONLY place we stayed in 2 weeks that had air conditioning....blessed, sweet, AC!!  Location was convenient just over the Haypenny bridge, within walking distance to a lot of Dublin.  They let us know about a partnership they have with a Hop-on-Hop-off bus tour which we bought for the low price of like 8Euro and used it a couple times to get around.  Breakfast was good.  Staff was very friendly and helpful, especially the concierge who gave us advice about Kilmainham Gaol and the Hop-on tour.  Great final place to stay for seeing Dublin.",5,2018,07,24
237,Great Stay in a Great Hotel,"We had a GREAT Stay at this GREAT Hotel!!  The staff was amazing, and very helpful!  The bar, had a great cocktail menu.  Every staff member acknowledged you as we walked past.  That made you feel welcomed.  ",5,2018,07,23
237,Excellent location!,Nice Doubletree Hotel in great location.  Rooms a nice size and employees very pleasant and helpful.  Great breakfast buffet.  Convenient to hop on tour buses and you can walk to almost all tourist destinations.  Temple Bar area right across the river.  ,4,2018,07,22
237,A great place to stay in Dublin.,"We chose the Morrison out of several that our travel agent suggested to us, and we are very glad we did. This modern hotel was perfectly situated near O'Connell Street and right across the bridge from Temple Bar, but far enough away that it was not noisy at night. We were in Dublin during a heat wave, and thankfully the Morrison had air conditioning. The buffet breakfast was delicious. Great choice if you are visiting Dublin!",4,2018,07,22
237,Great Hotel & Location,"We stayed here for one night before flying home early the next day. This hotel has a very modern feel that was perfect after having been in the Irish countryside for ten days. Our room was great and had a very large bathroom. The location of the hotel is only minutes from Temple Bar. In room air conditioning was great since we were there during Ireland's ""heat wave.""",5,2018,07,18
237,"Great central location, clean, bright, comfortable, welcoming staff","Our recent stay at the Hilton was fantastic, and we thoroughly enjoyed being there. Apcoa car park nearby was very convenient. Breakfast area was slightly odd in its decor and layout but staff were quick to assist. Hotel is well positioned near many good restaurants and pubs, and it is a short walk to the courts which was important to us on this occasion. Highly recommend this hotel and look forward to returning next time we need to stay in Dublin. Only possible improvement would be for integrated USB ports with electric sockets in bedroom.",5,2018,07,18
237,"Unless you are into hot pink 80s decor, strage quotes on the room walls/elevator, and burnt cookies - stay elsewhere.","I stay in Hilton hotels almost every other month for work. This was by far my worst stay. The rooms were strange, didn't get the room I selected when checking in the day before, front desk person had an attitude. The fan in our room was so loud we just turned it off and slept in the heat. The only positive thing about this hotel was the bar area. It's well decorated and the bar tender was very  helpful with recommendations for our stay in Ireland. ",1,2018,07,16
237,Fantastic Hotel,"My wife and I love Dublin and The Morrison Hotel so much that we just scheduled another trip to Dublin. This will be a third year in a row that we’ve flown over and stayed at The Morrison—we even brought friends last year. The location is fantastic, the staff is amazing, and the rooms are perfect. I’ve stayed in hotels all over the world and this remains one of my favorites. We will keep coming back!",5,2018,07,15
237,A Fantastic Hotel,"We arrived on the Thursday afternoon for a long weekend.  We were quite early for check-in so had to wait for around 20 minutes but we were provided with warm cookies and bottles of water while we waited for the room to be available.  We had only booked an ordinary room but were given a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite which had plenty of room for my wife's electric wheelchair.  The hotel is in an ideal central location for all the local attractions.  Because of the central location we ate out most of the time but we did have afternoon tea in the hotel which was delicious.
The bar and grill were up some stairs from the lobby, but there is a wheelchair lift so that wheelchair users have no problems with access.
We would definitely stay here again if we return to Dublin",5,2018,07,13
237,"Great location, clean room",The Morrison Hotel was the first stop on our tour of Ireland.  We were in Dublin for less than 24 hours and the hotel was in a great location to explore Dublin. We arrived early and had no trouble checking in right away. The room was clean and met our expectations.  We were there during a late June(record breaking) heatwave so it was great that the Morrison had AC.  We were a little uncertain about the parking situation but the car park was right around the corner and it was easier than we thought.,5,2018,07,09
237,Second stay at the Morrison,"We will gladly return for a third visit.  The location is perfect and the hotel accommodations are excellent.  Staff is friendly and helpful - breakfast, bar, room service, desk, everyone!  Our rooms were spacious, clean and well equipped.",5,2018,07,09
237,Loved this hotel - great service and location!,"My husband and I stayed here recently on our first night in Ireland before we headed to the country. We are Hilton Lifetime Diamond members so have experienced all levels of the Hilton family. This property is a Doubletree, but like no Doubletree I have experienced! It is hip, with a young, fun vibe even for us “older folks”. Our room faced the river and the hotel is right across the river from the lively Temple Bar. The windows opened but when closed - completely shut out all noise from the celebrations below. The staff is wonderful - Alijia checked us in and was so welcoming and lovely - rushed housekeeping to get our room ready. We were exhausted from our flight but waited in the lobby which was outfitted with low cushy couches for relaxing. Our room was European sized but equipped with anything we could need. Peter the House manager was very accommodating and so helpful - he pointed us to the fun and delicious Brazen Head pub for dinner along with some other sights and ordered a car for us to get to the train the next morning. We sat and had a few drinks at the very cool bar which faced the river people watching before turning in. A short visit but we will be back!",5,2018,07,07
237,Friendly great hotel ,Front desk staff are excellent and friendly  so are the wait staff at the restaurant.  Located near the heart of the city- close to Temple bar and shopping. Large bathroom unlike our hotels in London with tiny bathrooms. Large rooms as well.,5,2018,07,06
237,Beautiful motel,"Stayed here for four days touring Ireland.  The rooms are excellent, clean, new.

Close proximity to temple bar and Ireland tour bus departure locations.  Many options for food and drink.  We walked to the church pub up the street which is also excellent.",5,2018,07,06
237,Amazing family experience right on the river. Nice Junior Suite overlooking the river. Great restaurants close by.,We booked this trip with points on my Honors account. The hotel is well positioned to easily see all of the sites you could want in Dublin. The restaurants close by gives plenty of choice of food types and at a reasonable price. ,5,2018,07,04
237,Great hotel in a great location,"This hotel has great amenities, is close to the Luas and just across the Liffy from Temple Bar. The staff are friendly, the rooms are comfortable and I would definitely stay at this hotel again whether in Dublin for Business or Pleasure!",5,2018,07,04
237,Exceptional central location,"Spacious room, ingratiating hotel staff, wonderful location to all sites and transportation. Strongly recommend to all visitors. Bar, restaurant, and Fitness center area excellent. Easy walking to most sites in central Dublin, especially Temple Bar area, Trinity College and Guinness/Jameson, and museums. Close to Phoenix Park and Zoo. ",5,2018,07,03
237,"Location is the selling point, not the rooms","This is a terrific location for touring Dublin and walking around.  That said, the rooms in the hotel are very small.  As HHonors gold, I was “upgraded” to an interior room facing the “courtyard.” Pictures speak louder than words.  However, to be fair, I had requested a quiet room, and it was quiet, even on a very busy weekend.  It was the Pride Parade weekend, so availability was limited.  That said, I was underwhelmed by the room.  At 250+ Euros per night in high season, felt the value for cost was not favorable. ",3,2018,07,01
237,Just wonderful,"At first we were put in a room with 2 twin beds but when we asked for a room with a King bed, they found us one.  They didn't have any rooms with a river view for our first night but they were able to move us to a river view room for our second night.  The staff went over and above to make our stay delightful.  The next time we're in Dublin, we will absolutely stay here again.  Can hardly wait.",5,2018,06,30
237,Great Hotel Centrally Located for Exploring Dublin,"The Morrison location is unbeatable for exploring Dublin.  It is centrally located across from the Temple Bar area.  We are able to walk to just about every tourist attraction in the city.  In addition, the Hop on, Hop off bus was a short distance away.  The hotel itself was very nice.  The room and bathrooms were very functional and modern.  The breakfast buffet was fantastic.  There was a wide selection of options available to meet anyone's preferences.  The food was very good.  Finally, the staff at this hotel were extremely friendly.  We really enjoyed our pre cruise stay here.  Incidentally, the cruise terminal is about a $20 cab ride from the hotel.  They were gracious enough to arrange a larger size vehicle to accommodate all our luggage.  In addition, we were able to store our luggage in the morning to give us another day to explore the city before traveling to the cruise terminal in the afternoon.  Overall, we had an outstanding experience at this hotel.",5,2018,06,27
237,Candy for the eye and easy to get to,"Went to Dublin for our cruise and wanted a hotel close to Trinity college, hop on hop off bus and a straight shot to the cruise port. Cab from airport to hotel approx 26 Euros. Great cab driver. Beautiful modern hotel. Real eye candy. Nice employees, they watched our luggage as we walked a couple of blocks to the hop on hop off tour bus and saw Dublin that day. Walking back we found an inside mall to look through and passed a McDonalds to pick up ice tea from. The next morning we ate their breakfast that was included with the room. Sorry to report that it was not good. A lot of the food  tasted like cleaning agents so we didn't eat it. Good thing we were getting on a ship where we had a great lunch. So pros, hotel is pretty, employees and room were nice, location is good. Cons were bad breakfast and the cost was way too high (400+ euros).",4,2018,06,27
237,"Wonderful Hotel, Great Staff, and Disco Lighting!","We had such a great time at The Morrison!  It's a beautiful, centrally located hotel with clean, comfortable rooms and the nicest, friendliest staff.  And what we affectionately called disco lighting (glowing pink lights from the end tables and entryway) . . . so cool!  Coming in from the airport, we were speaking with the taxi driver about the sites we wanted to see while we were in Dublin.  At the top of our list was Kilmainham Gaol and we were disappointed to hear that reservations were required (of course, we hadn't made any and only had a few days in Dublin).  When we arrived at the hotel, we mentioned this to lovely Rachelle who immediately got on her computer and got us tickets for later in the day (she gave us maps to the jail and directions on how to use the tram to get there, too).  We also had the pleasure of dealing with fun, friendly Darren who helped us so much with mailing off a package.  Truly, everyone at The Morrison went out of their way to make our stay memorable.  We would recommend the hotel to everyone and we'll definitely be back.",5,2018,06,20
237,"Great location, great service, comfortable surroundings","My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 9 days just recently on vacation (love Dublin and Ireland). I am a Hilton Diamond member, so stay at way too many Hilton properties. This is one of the Hilton properties that is a pleasure to stay in and is highly recommended. The current decor is fresh, modern and comfortable. Check in was fast and pleasant and we were allowed to get into our king river view room early. The room was ample in size for European standards and was very clean and tidy. The bathroom was also spotless, well-stocked and relatively large. Our room was VERY quiet at night even though our window overlooked a busy street and the river. For those who have to have some fan noise and a cool room at night (like me), the air conditioning was effective and kept the room very comfortable - you could adjust the fan for very little or more noise as desired. The property is about as ideally located as you can find in Dublin - O'Connell Street is just a couple of blocks away, there is a shopping mall for travel needs a block away, and all the major city sights (museums, Temple Bar area, excellent restaurants) are an easy walk from this hotel. There are 3-4 bridges across the Liffey very close including one half a block away. I was very impressed with the service in the hotel - very pleasant, well-informed, and efficient. A special thumbs up to the bartending staff (one was a middle-aged Irish gentleman who was very funny and helpful - beard and mustache - he worked in the evenings while we were there - terrific). The breakfast was generally well-prepared with a buffet (or menu choices if you want something else). The wait staff was very friendly and accommodating and the manager (relatively tall blonde lady of, I think, eastern European background) was especially attentive and friendly. We did eat dinner in the hotel once and the food was very good and of high quality. I also had the Morrison Ice Cream Sunday (specialty there) at the urging of the bartender - really good. The concierge made every attempt to be helpful but was somewhat hard to understand at times (non-Irish - many of the staff are non-Irish - very international staff which is great). He made good restaurant and attraction recommendations and was very professional.Overall, this hotel is definitely at the high end of the Hilton properties and I would gladly stay there again without hesitation. Excellent.",5,2018,06,20
237,Hotel with a cool factor,"This hotel has been totally revamped in recent years to now have all things cool. Neat painting on walls, slogans projected on walls, lots of charging stations in the rooms, the latest in plumbing fixtures, fun bar scene. Hotel rooms are quiet however. Great location across the Liffey from Temple Bar. Bar and restaurant on ground floor, which may be convenient, but we didn’t find it very appealing - too many other options nearby. If you are driving, they offer discounted parking in a garage 1 block away (although it can be full on busy periods and then ???). More expensive than other Dublin Hilton properties which I guess covers the cool stuff. Would stay here again for its convenience and great facilities. ",5,2018,06,18
237,Great location,"Very good hotel. Nice rooms with excellent beds. Nice staff. Breakfast supervisor remembered next day how we drank our coffee. Little cold in public areas and specific part of breakfast room. Life music in the bar was too loud.. (or maybe we're just too old..). Purple interior design is not everyone's taste. Funny thing is that hotel has been refurbished not too long ago, but lots of previous dated interior parts had to stay (funny tables in breakfast room).",4,2018,06,18
237,"More than above average hotel, EXCELLENT location","This was my second stay at the Morrison this year, and I was very satisfied. The staff is friendly, the hotel/rooms are nice and clean, and the location is EXCELLENT.

The beds are still quite firm, so keep that in mind.

Just on the north side of the River, it's 2 blocks from the Temple Bar district. Feel like a movie? The cineplex is about 4 blocks north. You can get to just about anything you would want, in under a 10 minute walk.

Overall, I was very please (again) with my stay at the Morrison and will continue to stay here for my work trips.",4,2018,06,18
237,Nice location but small room,"We had a very nice room with river view, but the room was very small.
Location of the hotel is excellent, 2 minutes away from the Temple bar area, but not noisy.
Good attentive front desc.
Good service ",3,2018,06,18
237,One of my favourite hotels! ,"Absolutely love staying here when im in Dublin . Its in a fantastic location on the river Liffey . The staff are always helpful and the hotel is decorated lovely.
  This was my 3rd time here and the first time using the gym facilities which I thought was fantastic.",5,2018,06,18
237,location location location,"Hotel was great, the staff at reception was miserable. Sort of set the tone for the Stay. not Very welcoming. Didn’t spend much time other than sleep. Plenty of restaurants in n walking distance, that would appreciate your business. Rooms were overpriced for a Hilton property. If it wasn’t for location I wouldn’t have stayed. ",4,2018,06,17
237,Excellent location and hotel,"Across the river from Temple Bar, which meant excellent location and people watching without all the noise.  We could easily walk or take public transit anywhere we wanted to go.  Helpful and friendly staff, very comfortable room, wonderful breakfast.  And, of course, the Doubletree cookies :-)

My only challenge was insufficient AC, so I was a bit too hot to sleep.  However, we asked the staff to unlock the windows (which they will readily do, but you must ask) and then used the fan that was provided.  Others might not have the same issue, because I seem to weirdly like a very cold room in order to sleep.  My husband seemed to have no problems.",5,2018,06,17
237,Clean Modern Great Location and Lovely Staff,We stayed here for over a weekend to attend the Taylor Swift concert. The rooms were super clean and modern and the beds were comfortable. The location was 10 minutes walk from all the places you want to see and the best thing was the staff. So polite and friendly they made us feel welcome from arrival to departure. The warm chocolate chip cookie is always a treat too at a Doubletree. We have stayed at hotels more expensive and well known but would recommend this over the others.,5,2018,06,17
237,Incredible,Super helpful staff. Great location. Walk across the bridge to temple bar but not all the noise associated with. We did have a wedding while we were there but the band was done by midnight so no worries ,5,2018,06,17
237,"Great Hotel, Great Staff","A very, very comfortable place to stay, the staff was very nice. Breakfast buffet was great food, Irish breakfast. Was able to exchange money, was able to have a taxi wait for me. Very helpful on places to go, and how to arrange. Going to stay there in future. Arrived at 930am, let into my room, no problem. ",5,2018,06,16
237,Disappointed,Booked at the Morrison a couple of weeks back for our first trip to Ireland. Especially paid extra for a room with a view of the river. Arrived after a long day of traveling. Checked in and went to our room which had an awful view of the back lane behind the hotel. After heading back to reception to find out why we were not given the room with a view we paid for they apologized but said they unfortunately had no rooms with a view left as they were all occupied. Very very annoyed and disappointed - especially as we are staying for three nights. ,2,2018,06,15
237,Great Location,"This hotel was stylish and modern. Our room was clean and ample sized.  The location was fantastic. We were able to walk almost everywhere (we did walk 8 miles one day). Temple Bar was right across the river and so many sites/attractions within an easy walk.  

The front desk was very friendly and helpful.",5,2018,06,13
237,Wonderful location!,"Hotel is lovely, clean and modern.  Hotel staff is extremely helpful.  Good location for shopping and sightseeing.  Lots of great restaurants in the area.   Buses, tours and taxies readily available for guests to choose from.",5,2018,06,12
237,New year break,"Quiet hotel...but just across the river from all the action. Near to public transport. Great bars, pubs and res just a short stroll away. Central location. We stayed bed and breakfast. Lovely breakfast choices.",5,2018,06,10
237,"My ""Go To"" Dublin Hotel from now on","I can't say enough about this hotel from the location, rooms, service, and amenities. The location is perfection. Right near the river, surrounded by everything, including public transportation. The staff is incredible, particularly Maria who helped me not only upgrade to a suite when I figured out that I had been incorrectly booked in a standard room that wouldn't accommodate our 3 guests, but she also got us into the room early after an overnight flight from NY. The bar is beautiful with great service, open late, and had live music. We returned to our room one day to find a note explaining that there was a wedding happening in the hotel one of the nights we were there, indicated we may hear the celebration (we didn't hear a thing) and offered to change our rooms if we wanted. The suite by the way was surprisingly very large. Everything is immaculate and I truly can't say enough about the stay. Oh - warm cookies daily is a nice touch. :) This will be the hotel I stay at any time I'm in Dublin, and the hotel I recommend to friends.",5,2018,06,09
237,The perfect stay....,"The Morrison is in the perfect location situated on the North side of the River Liffey and yet cross over the bridge and you are in the centre of Temple Bar and within walking distance of many tourist attractions.  The hotel itself is beautiful with thoughtful little extra's including a warm chocolate chip cookie on arrival, small bottles of water to take with you when exploring the city and a fluffy bath robe and slippers!  The hotel has it's own bar and restaurant serving delicious food and the staff are very friendly and helpful.....I can't wait to come back!",5,2018,06,08
237,"Fantastic, Great Experience",My family and I arrived 7:00 am to the hotel after a long and frustrating flight. Our check in time was 3:00 PM and our room wasn't ready. The manager told us that he would do what he could to get us the room earlier. We slept in the lobby and waited for our room. I was awaken by the manager at 10:30 AM and was given the key to our room. Incredible customer service. I highly recommend.,5,2018,06,07
237,Overnight in Dublin,"The only disappointment would have to be the parking, it's not explained  how the fees work, for the price to stay I would have expected free parking. 
Apart from that, everything else was perfect. The staff were amazing, friendly, helpful 😀
The room was very clean and spacious, when we came home from our night out there were called left out for us",4,2018,06,03
237,"Great hotel, great location","This hotel is in a perfect location for sightseeing, Restaurants etc. The onsite bar is fun, lively and serves amazing drinks. Breakfast has many offerings as well. Upon arrival we had an issue with our ac. The staff was kind and understanding and remedied the situation as quickly as possible. I would highly recommend this hotel to those traveling to the area.",5,2018,06,02
237,Great hotel,"We have been to Dublin many times but this was our first time at the Morrison. The rooms and restaurants are great. The staff is spectacular, so warm and welcoming! All in a perfect location in the middle of Dublin.",5,2018,06,02
237,Within walking distance of Temple Bar,"I'm so glad I chose this hotel for my mom and I. We stayed here after finishing a tour of Ireland and wanted more time to explore Dublin. I couldn't be happier with this hotel. We were able to walk to all the sites we wanted to see. Temple Bar was an easy walk - much closer than I expected even, pretty much right across the river from the hotel. The beds were comfortable and I liked the modern feel of all the spaces. Front desk staff were very helpful - stored our luggage on arrival until our room was ready and arranged for an early morning taxi for us the next day.",5,2018,06,01
237,A pleasant and memorable experience.,"Overall a pleasant stay. Checking in was made really fast and simple. We stayed for 4 nights and the location is really convenient to explore Dublin city even with a stroller. Concierge was really efficient at making sure a taxi was ready for our departure to the airport and it meets all our requirements especially we have a toddler in tow with carseat, stroller and 3 luggages. ",5,2018,05,31
237,"Convenient location, great accommodation","Hotel is just off the Luas red line, and near several bus routes, making transit to far off areas of the city a breeze. Room was spacious and comfortable, although seating was a bit limited. Staff were accommodating and professional. Great hotel experience.",5,2018,05,31
237,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful location","This hotel by far is in a wonderful central location. the rooms are very well appointed, breakfast delicious-  lots to choose from, staff can't do enough to assist. We ate in the adjoining restaurant and also enjoyed room service - all food were of the highest quality. We are planing another trip to Dublin and will be staying at the Morrison again. I would recommend this hotel.",5,2018,05,30
237,Quality hotel near city center ,"Really nice hotel right near the city center of Dublin. I stayed here for a conference and appreciated that I was still able to collect Hilton points overseas. Rooms were relatively small compared to other Doubletree suites (as to be expected in Europe) but had everything I needed and I also loved the purple theme (my favorite color). Breakfast was good though I didn’t realize until the second or third day that ordering from the menu was actually included in the breakfast pricing. Only downside was having to wait for a room after arriving early upon a long overseas flight, but I was finally able to check in a couple hours earlier than normal. ",5,2018,05,29
237,The best hotel in Dublin!,I was so happy to check in to the Morrison.  The hotel staff were very attentive. I especially appreciate the bar staff for not only making the best drinks in Dublin but also providing top notch customer service.  My room was immaculate and the atmosphere was fantastic!,5,2018,05,29
237,"Good location, food available onsite, comfortable stay","I used my Hilton Honors points to defray the cost of our room at this hotel in Dublin. Overall it was a good experience but room was fairly basic. Ate dinner in the hotel, comfortable restaurant, good food and helpful waiter. Lots of young people. Hotel is convenient to some great nightlife. ",4,2018,05,27
237,Great location for visiting top sights,"We spent two nights here earlier this month. We arrived from the airport late morning and they were able to accommodate early check-in but only for a room on the Mezzanine level. We gladly accepted (any room would be fine!) but note that this floor is definitely louder. The room itself was comfortable although a fuse blew our first night and it took a few different staff members to reset it. The lights take some getting used to - the key card system is a great idea but there was a lot of trial and error to find the right switch for the lights you wanted!

The location can't be beat - it's right across the river from Temple Bar (which means it's loud - more on that later). We weren't renting a car until later in our trip, but we didn't even need to take taxis, we walked everywhere. It's 5 minutes to Temple Bar, 20 minutes to Trinity College, 25 minutes to Guinness Storehouse, 20 minutes to Jameson, etc. As long as you don't mind a bit of walking, you can save money on taxi's by staying here. 

The downside of the location is the noise. Not sure if we were just in a noisy room (since we were only on the Mezzanine level) but especially on Friday night, the music from the pubs and bars was thumping way into the night. Felt like we were next door from a nightclub!

But other than that (and it didn't bother us too much!) it was a nice hotel. They graciously called a taxi for us to go to the airport, which was convenient. Staff was great. Hotel is very clean.

I'd stay there again!",4,2018,05,24
237,Fourth stay!,Great location.   Across the river from the Temple Bar area. The staff has always been very helpful.   This was our fourth stay here and it will continue to be our landing spot when visiting Dublin.  Furnishings are very contemporary.,5,2018,05,23
237,Wonderful experience!,"I did a lot of research into hotels in Dublin before choosing The Morrison and I was not disappointed.  

I emailed with them before our arrival and they answered all my questions and arranged a transfer for us from the airport to the hotel. 

When we arrived, we had to wait about an hour for our room but that was understandable since we arrived around noon.  We were offered water and waited in the lobby.  We were given room #230 which is a lovely 1 bedroom suite with a view of the river.  It was quiet and we enjoyed the view.  They offer great toiletries and the bathroom was very large.  There is a coffeemaker in the room.

We had breakfast in the buffet and it was very good.  Loved the Guinness bread!!

We also had dinner one night in the grill and it was very good.  The service was great as well.  

The location of The Morrison is great.  Central to everything!

I wouldn’t hesitate to return to The Morrison hotel!

Thanks for a great experience in beautiful Dublin!!!",5,2018,05,23
237,Three excellent nights in Dublin,"Excellent location, unique rooms that are very clean. The buffet breakfast was delicious and well stocked. They have a server who will make cappuccinos and flat whites, etc upon request. 
We stayed on the Hilton Honors floor. Corridor was always very warm and we weren’t sure why but thought I would mention as the hotel may be wasting money there. 
We had a great stay. We would love to come back. ",5,2018,05,22
237,First class hotel!!,"We stayed only one night and wish we were there longer. The room was large and spacious with a beautiful view of the mountains near Killarney. The fireplace was a nice added touch and the room was clean as a whistle! Be sure to include breakfast which is a full delicous buffet in another beautiful dining room.  Parking is below the hotel which is a bonus and very easy to access. Can't say enough about this hotel, loved it!",5,2018,05,21
237,Excellent,"Just returned from a 2 night stay. Everything was just what we needed. Great location 5 minute walk from temple bar and o connel street.
We were lucky enough to be able to check in before the allocated check in time.... greated with great service and a warm chocolate and walnut cookie.
Public area of the hotel very clean and welcoming.
Rooms spacious and have all the amenities you need. Including bath sheets in the bathroom which we particularly like been tall!
Bar service good and friendly staff.
Will definatly return for our next trip to Dublin and would reccommend this hotel.",5,2018,05,20
237,Not worth the points - other Hilton hotels must be better,"Disappointed on two separate visits.  We started and ended our awesome trip to Ireland at this property. Luckily the other properties we stayed at were much better than this one.
We were aware that Check in was at three. Our flight arrived early and we waited for our room to be ready. We were told that we would receive the first room that was ready. The staff changed and so did the fact that we would receive the first room. My diamond status with Hilton did not really make a difference. 
Instead of waiting in the lobby for hours we decided to start exploring Dublin. The second team at the front desk said they would call us when the room was ready. After several hrs we did not receive a call and returned to the property.  We inquired about the room and was told that our room had been “upgraded” and it was ready.
The room was not an upgrade, it was next to the staff service doors and we heard every single opening and closing of the doors all day long. It was disappointing.  The housekeeping team even left a rag in the duct above the bathroom door. Not sure if it was there to stop a leak or something but we didn’t want to touch it. When we were checking out I explained the situation to the manager and expressed my disappointment in the room.  He assured me that it would not happen when we returned at the end of the week and upgraded us to a suite.
We returned at the end of the week and yes received a beautiful suite however the bathroom sink pipe was not connected and when we turned on the bathroom sink water poured out all over the floor!
The a/c also didn’t work properly in the suite, the room was really warm.  Engineering  repaired the sink, but housekeeping did not follow up to replace towels that were used to wipe up all of the water on the floor .  We were tired of calling for assistance .  Not worth it because we were leaving early the next morning.
Very disappointed.",3,2018,05,18
237,Nice place ,The hotel is a 20 minutes taxi ride from the airport and is right on the river. My room however faced a back alley so the view wasn’t so great.  It’s in a good location for walking and I made it to the old churches very easily.  The staff was very nice.  My room was a pretty standard hotel room. It was very clean. A nice hotel.  ,4,2018,05,17
237,Great hotel,Loved the hotel. Good bar. Food is excellent . The room was clean and comfortable and had all the facilities that were needed. Staff were friendly and efficient. Couldn’t ask for more really! Hope to stay here again! Well done to all.,5,2018,05,15
237,Unexpectedly Large Rooms with Extremely helpful Staff!,"This was only a 3 story hotel, but noise was never a problem. We had 2 adjoining joins, ready on time. Very clean and recently updated. Even had a mini fridge. Great location;within walking distance to so many attractions. Adequate continental breakfast and pleasant dining area as well.",5,2018,05,14
237,Great location,"Loved the location & the room.  Blackout curtains made it possible for us to sleep late—loved it.  Beautiful crisp, clean rooms. Quiet. Appreciated baggage storagewgen we arrived too early to check in. Wonderful little cafe on the corner, Mochaland for breakfast & lunch.",5,2018,05,13
237,Best location in the ciry,2nd time staying here and the location is perfect for doing anything in the center of the city.  The hotel is modern and chic and the service is good.  The gym could use an update with newer and more equipment.  The lights in the room are strange and we struggled to find out how to turn off the pink mood lighting. ,4,2018,05,12
237,This Hotel made our holiday,"The location is excellent, right on the river and close to everything you want to see.  It is also far enough away from Temple Bar (the other side of the river) that it wasn't too chaotic on a Saturday night.  From the moment we arrived the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful.  They made us feel very welcome and looked after my Mum (we were there as a special break for her).  They even sent her a small plate of cakes to welcome her.  The rooms were spotless and well equipped.  The breakfast was really good quality and the staff could not have been more helpful.  The bar staff were very efficient and friendly and our best meal of the whole weekend was the steak in the hotel restaurant.  I cannot thank the team enough for making the weekend so special for my Mum",5,2018,05,12
237,Weekend ,"My wife and I stayed at the Morrison and we could not fault this hotel. The location is superb, the staff are very friendly and efficient, the food is great and the rooms are very spacious and very comfortable. We will definitely return.",5,2018,05,08
237,Wonderful !,We stayed there for four nights while exploring Ireland.  Location is walking distance to all of Dublins tourist spots.  A friendly staff that will greet you with a warm cookie and a smile.  Easy place to call home for a vacation.  ,5,2018,05,07
237,Peaceful hotel in a great location,Nice and cozy hotel by the riverside in the heart of the city. Short walk to all sights around and to the Temple Bar area. Very good beds and clean rooms. Extremely helpful staff. Excellent breakfast.,4,2018,05,07
237,Lovely hotel with great location,"Loved this hotel, great location with friendly and welcoming staff. 

The room was modern with a boutique style feel with a big comfy bed and pillows.

I would definitely stay here again next time I come to Dublin.",5,2018,05,04
237,Nice modern hotel,"Nice, clean, modern hotel with public car park very close by. Clean fresh rooms, nice breakfast, a bit pricey for both the side of town and the establishment itself in my opinion but have had pleasant stays here.",4,2018,05,02
237,Good with One Major Issue,Pluses —great location....very nice and lively bar.....very clean rooms and nice sized bathroom.....quiet rooms.  My issue — I booked a tour through the hotel and was supposed to get a tour with someone who would provide details on the sights and accompany us on all our tours.  Our tour guide simply dropped us off without any real background and history.  He didn’t even have the right visiting hours for Trinity College.  This bad experience dropp d my rating to this hotel by one star.  The hotel should do a much better job screening their recommendations.,3,2018,05,01
237,Night out.,We stayed in the hotel Sunday night. The Reception Staff where excellant. They where very nice.We got up to the room . It was a very nice room. The meal in the Restraunt was very good. I would only fault the apple pie was not nice.The staff in the bar and restraunt where excellant.It is a very nice hotel would definately recommend this hotel to anybody.Thanks to all the STAFF for a lovely stay. My wife and I had a night stay.,4,2018,04,30
237,Excellent situation,"On arrival and checking in we were presented with warm cookie each, very welcome and tasty, our rooms were excellent, spacious, spotless, good en suite, quiet although not looking onto the river it did not matter as we were situated away from any road/people noise, all the staff were courteous, informative and very pleasant, we ate in the Restaurant and enjoyed a very good meal and would have eaten there again if there was not such a huge choice of eateries in the vicinity, although not required I did notice that car parking was available only 30 yards away, very pleased with our choice, and next time we visit we will certainly use this hotel again. Well done to the Management and Staff.",4,2018,04,30
237,Great place for our Business/Personal trip!,"We were able to easily walk to many different sites, stores and restaurants, and the hotel itself was in great condition with a very professional staff!  Personally, I did not eat at the restaurant, but it had a great lobby bar / social area, and the gym in the basement has everything you would expect in a stay!",5,2018,04,29
237,Great hotel and location but BAD breakfast,"We enjoyed our stay at The Morrison. Great hotel and location. Rooms clean and lovely.
Sadly breakfast was disappointing.... one of my two eggs Benedict was boiled and the muffins not fresh... 
Scrambled eggs were not good either in fact most of my colleagues left them untouched. There is clearly a problem with how they cook the eggs...? 
Service was good but hit breakfast can be improved. This is the only reason why I don’t give 5 stars.",4,2018,04,27
237,Fantastic Hotel in the heart of Dubin!,We loved his hotel! The rooms are trendy and bright. The hotel bar is way more than a hotel bar - it is a restaurant / bar that we would actually want to go to even if we weren’t staying at the hotel! The food and drinks were fantastic and the service was very hospital at the bar. Our breakfast was delicious - including an in house barista! The location was close to everything! We would definitely choose this hotel again! ,5,2018,04,25
237,Nice hotel ,"We stayed here using our Hilton honours points. The location was great and the service was really good. The hotel is only a 5 minute walk to Temple Bar, is right by the river and is about a 10 min walk to most attractions. 

The hotel and the room was modern, clean and stylish. The room had all the amenities you’d expect, including Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries in the bathroom. 

Our bags didn’t get brought up straight away - so the hotel sent us chocolate and water to say sorry, which I thought was a nice touch. We also got a tub of gummy sweets from the general manager! 

Amazing shower, with good pressure. Comfy bed with nice sheets. The aircon got the room to a nice temperature too. Plug sockets by the bed as well! Which is always good!

The only thing that disappointed us was that we were told breakfast was included as we were Hilton honours club members and then when we got to breakfast we found out this was only for a cold breakfast, which was quite limited (but still good), we would have had to pay an additional €7 each for a hot breakfast. I feel like this could be made clearer - and is also a little stingy for loyal members. 

Overall a nice stay and a nice hotel in a really convenient location. ",5,2018,04,20
237,Great Staff and Unbeatable Location!,"My first visit to Dublin and I chose the Morrison because of location and as a HHnors member, I hoped for a free upgrade and good service.  However, the booking on the HHnors website was not a happy experience.  The rate dropped after a couple of hours on an external site.  I called and was told that since I already booked, it was non changeable.  However, the reservation manager, Renata, was very gracious and matched the lower rate so on to a fresh start.  After getting off the airport bus on O'connell street, the hotel is about 15 minute walk toward the Temple bar area.  There is a tourist office by the bus stop for direction if needed.  From the hotel it's a 5 minute stroll across the bridge to the famous Temple bar where there are loads of pubs, restaurants, coffee houses, shops and galleries. The hotel is also within 15 minute walking distance to Trinity college, Cathedrals, Dublin castle, St Stephen's green park, famous shopping Grafton street etc and just around the corner, Henry street with a shopping mall, dept stores, and M&S.  It seems like you never run out of places to eat, drink and shop around the hotel.  Despite the drizzles and a longish bus journey from the airport, my outlook was brightened by seeing the clean, modern look of the hotel and an upgrade to a quiet king size bed room as requested. The reception highlight was Darren of Guest relations who was so friendly so I ended up having a very nice conversation to start my visit.  Darren continued to be a delight during my stay with helpful recommendations and friendly chats. I noticed that he was courteous with everyone and he seemed to very much enjoy his contacts with the guests.  Such a people person! The only downside to the hotel is the lack of internet connection. Even with the technician's changing out the gear in the room, the line stopped working every day after a while so I gave up when it was time to depart. For my visit, I used the 48 hour pass of the Hop on Hop off bus and found it to be a great way to get the gist of the main Dublin tourist attractions. You can get off and on as often as you like to visit your sites of interest since the bus comes around every 15 minutes.  The bus drivers provide interesting tidbits and amusing commentaries along the way.  All and all, my visit was too short to fully explore Dublin but would like to come back and happily to the Morrison !",4,2018,04,19
237,"great staff and location, some inconsistancies","The location of the Morrison cannot be beat - you're close to everything, all of the sights of central Dublin, while being just far enough away to get a good rest.  I was a little disappointed as a HHonors Gold member for the constant push for an upgrade of the breakfast.  Continental breakfast was free with status - but I felt we constantly got the upsell to a hot breakfast for 7 euro more per person.  I was also surprised for such a funky, modern room to have such an old and outdated layout in the bathroom.  As a HHonors member, would stay here again - the location cannot be beat.",4,2018,04,16
237,"Super location and clean, modern, comfy room","Terrific location - walk everywhere. Clean, modern and confortable room with all needed amenities - love the slippers. The breakfast was delicious and the service was superb. We will definitely be back.",5,2018,04,16
237,"A great location, great room, excellent personnel","The Morrison Hotel is on the other side of the River Liffey across from the Temple Bar area - you are five minutes walking away from everything without the night noise - for us this was perfect! All of the must see places are walking distance except for Kilmainham Gaol (which you can reach by the Luas) and maybe the Guiness Storehouse (we did walk there anyway).  You have a shopping mall two blocks from the hotel with everything from clothes, accessories, food (food hall and a Tesco), coffee places, and the area is full of small restaurants and bars. The Jameson Experience is on the same side of the river.  Across the river you have the Temple Bar area full of pubs, coffee houses, restaurants, stores.  You can walk to Trinity College, Christ Church Cathedral, St. Patrick´s Cathedral, St. Stephen´s Green, the Irish Whiskey Museum, the Chester Beatty Library, Dublin Castle, etc. The location is great!
We took one of the airport buses to the hotel which left us across the river, just a five minutes easy walk.  Upon arrival the hotel staff greeted us warmly and were going to store our luggage until our room became available but five minutes later they had our room ready.  The room was ample, clean, quiet, with a large comfortable king size bed, a good size bathroom, a chair and ottoman and a desk.  Our only complaints would be that the closet for hanging clothes was small and that it needed usb ports or more plugs near the bed to be able to connect all of our devices (readily fixable with a multiplug, though).  The included breakfast had many selections to choose from - eggs, ham, black pudding, sausages, tomatoes, mushrooms, potatoes, fruits, cereals, pastries, breads, juices.  The service staff was very attentive.  Check out was swift and with no problems.  Will definitely return.",5,2018,04,15
237,Great hotel,My third visit to Dublin and so far this is way far the best hotel I've stayed in.   Staff friendly and very accommodating.   Great location for city centre and everything within walking distance.  Could not find any fault with the hotel at all.,5,2018,04,12
237,Great Stays!,My wife and I began and ended our 10-day Ireland trip in Dublin. We stayed at the DT-Morrison one night on arrival and two nights prior to departure. The hotel is conveniently located near city center and is staffed by an exceptionally friendly and helpful staff. They went out of their way to make us feel welcome both times. Would definitely stay there again. ,5,2018,04,08
237,Great location and services in Dublin,Here for work so 5 min walk to the office or temple bar. Staff bends over backwards for you. Sure there are a couple of drunken yellers at five in the morning but that comes with the territory. Breakfast onsite or across the street are both great options ,5,2018,04,08
237,"Location, Location, Location"," 

Love, love this hotel. From the moment we entered the building to the time we left it was outstanding!! The check in process was quick and easy. I asked for an upgraded room which made a big difference for me. Jane was amazing! She made us feel so welcomed and inviting. She greeted us every morning with a smile and always asked about our day. Her kind nature made us feel at home.  A tub of candy was sent to us by the manager with a hand written note as well, this was a hit with my children.

We had breakfast there everyday and it was delicious and had so much variety...it never disappointed.  The staff that worked the breakfast was great and very accommodating...we looked forward to it every morning. 

The close proximity to the city center and to Temple Bar was the primary reason in choosing this place. Wow! The Hilton looks across the river Liffey. It’s a short walking distance to many attractions. Trinity College, Temple Bar Area, Merrion Park, Grafton street, St. Stephens Green park, Dublin Castle and many more. ",5,2018,04,07
237,Amazing Stay!,"My family and I stayed at The Morrison for  5 days. As soon as we got to the hotel, they gave us free water bottles. The staff was extremely friendly. Jane was very helpful and always asking us if there’s anything she can do for us. The manager even gave us some candy to welcome us. They also helped us book a taxi to the airport. The staff definitely made us feel like home.

The hotel room is very spacious. We had a small balcony. Our bathroom was huge, the only problem was that the door didn’t lock. 

Continental breakfast was delicious. We enjoyed Eggs, Muffins, Juice, Coffee, Tea, Croissants, Cereal, Pastries, etc. 

The Morrison Grill has afternoon tea, I recommend the Gentlemen’s Tea. They even have a kids menu for your children. 

The location was perfect. You just need to cross the river to get into the City Center. We walked to and from wherever we needed to go, no rental car needed. 

Another note: The WiFi worked great, and it was not slow at all, like most of the hotels  I’ve stayed at.

Overall, I give this hotel five stars. It is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at.",5,2018,04,06
237,Amazing Hotel,"We recently had our wedding here Saturday March 3rd.

Everything was exceptional, from our first enquiries with the hotel. Marion answered all of our questions, and put our minds at ease, she even gave us a recommendation for a celebrant which turned out to be great on the day. Marion completely took the stress out of the planning as she came up with suggestions for some of the finer details of the wedding that we were stressing about!

The week leading up to the wedding was hampered by the Beast from the East, and heavy snow conditions. With doubts over so many things, guests travelling from abroad, musicians availability, all business closed the entire week, the hotel re-assured us early, that they would be there regardless for our wedding, and arranged to get supplies in earlier in the week to ensure we had all we needed for our wedding day.

Prior to the wedding we visited the hotel for the tasting of the food. We were looked after so well, by Jason, Sarah and Junior, and chef Sushil was so helpful in helping us make decisions on our menu for the day. He also tailored vegetarian/vegan options to suit some of our guests.

On the day itself, we were so well looked after by Jane, Paul, Sarah and all the staff. The room looked amazing. The food and wine on the day was exceptional. Probably the best fillet steak that i've eaten in Dublin. Most of our guests commented on this and we’re still getting feedback from them regarding the amazing food and service. The whole evening was superb and went on until the early hours in the Residents bar. 
Prior to the wedding Marion and the food and beverage manager, even brought in certain drinks that our guest wanted. Nothing was too much trouble. The day was so easy for us, as the staff were so professional and thought of absolutely everything.

Even the following day, Jane and Sarah were superb in managing our needs, and also all of our guests. There is such a relaxed, calming feel to the hotel, which is down to the amazing staff. We’ve visited since the wedding as the food is so good at the restaurant, and service always top class. 

As part of the great package we got to stay in the Penthouse which was spectacular!

This place has it all. A great place to go for a quiet drink at the cool bar, perfect for evening meal with the amazing steaks! A great place to stay, and a great venue for a wedding!

We are so glad we chose the Morrison as our wedding venue, and we cannot wait to go back many times in the future!",5,2018,04,04
237,Wonderful Boutique Hotel,"The Morrison is a wonderful boutique hotel in the heart of Dublin.  We stayed for 2 nights from the 23rd March 2018. The rooms are lovely, clean and modern with all the amenities you will need - albeit a bit too hot sometimes!  There is a great bar which had a good singer/guitarist on the Friday night of our stay and the cocktails were marvellous!  The breakfast provided was more that substantial - we went for the continental one - the food was of great quality and there was a very good choice.  
All of the staff were extremely professional, polite and friendly which made our stay even more enjoyable.  The location of the hotel is great - especially if you want to be centrally located as it is in walking distance of Temple Bar, Trinity College and the shops!",5,2018,04,04
237,Quick break!,"Great hotel. Helpful, friendly staff. Room was clean, spacious and modern. Location was spot on and central enough to get everywhere by foot. Bathroom was clean with a large shower. 👍🏼. We were given an upgrade and even handed a delicious warmed freshly baked chocolate cookie each.   The room had a mini-bar, safe, hairdryer, umbrella, tea making facilities, ironing board and iron, slippers and dressing gown. Oh and not forgetting the usual toiletries (even a small mouthwash was provided). Hotel bar was well stocked and an enjoyable place to pass the time. 
",5,2018,04,04
237,Bit too much for me,"Arrived with my partner at 1pm, to the Receptionists credit they got us a room almost immediately. Brilliant start. All went downhill from there. Room was freezing- heating would not work and despite reporting this numerous times, nothing was done. My partner found a hair in the sink, the glass in the room was dirty. Breakfast was laughable it was so bad. Staff all looked stressed and unhappy. I don't blame them- hotel seems to be style over substance. Shan't be returning here. Much nice Hotels to stay whilst in Dublin.Tried to give feedback on departure. Receptionist didn't even pretend to acknowledge what I said",1,2018,04,03
237,A  very  special place,"I have being involved with conference organization  over the years in several different locations for groups ranging from small groups of 20 or so  to groups of over 100 . When my daughter chose the Morrisson Hotel in Dublin for her wedding reception I was a little surprised. Her choice was made on a number of factors. She was totally correct. The end result   was far in excess of what I could have wished . Led by Jane, the Morrison team performed to the highest level making the day and the night a stress free occasion  and a wonderful and enjoyable  memory for all who attended.Every aspect including location , facilities, food and  service was of the highest order. That personal factor abounded with all the staff. 
    Six months later we happened to return for dinner. The atmosphere and friendliness in the bar and restaurant was terrific. Food was more than enjoyable. The staff in a very courteous yet personal way recognized us still recalling memories of our celebration in the hotel . I was astounded and chuffed.
   Yes for the traveler or stranger to Dublin I can confidently say that you will get a very special welcome  and service here in the care of the Morrison and their terrific staff",5,2018,04,02
237,Excellent Stay,My wife and I really enjoyed are stay last year. Front of house staff were very welcoming and prvided some great advice for our stay.  The room and king bed very comfortable and made our stay a delight.,4,2018,04,01
237,beautiful,"Room was great, modern, clean, quiet. Common space (lobby, bar, restaurant...) very nice. Warm welcome at the reception. Dinner at the hotel restaurant also good. 
But during check in, they pre authorised my credit card for 100 euros (the room was fully prepaid with the some card) in case I would spent something from the minibar of the room!!! They explained that this is their practice with all their clients. During check out they told me that they would check the room and arrange it. In my credit card report, which I can check from my mobile, this was stated as 'charge' not 'pre authorization' (and even now, 9 days later, in my card report, it is still stated as 'in process'). After 6 hours when I went back, just before I left the city, to take my luggage from the Baggage Storage of the hotel (not the room) I asked again about this. I had to talk with 2 persons at the reception for 15' and insist to persuade them that I needed some kind of receipt that there was no charge, until they gave me the 2 receipts of the card, the first 'pre auth' and the second 'void' which means that there is no charge. I found it very annoying. Especially the fact that they didn't trusted me and they pre-authorised my card for this amount but I had to trusted them without any receipt that this was arranged and there was no charge. I think that they must provide the relevant receipts without the client asking for it. I would also like to know from other clients if this is a common practice of the hotel or they did it only to me, for a reason I ignore. Apart from this the hotel is excellent but I am very sceptical about going again.",4,2018,04,01
237,Excellent stay,My husband and I enjoyed our stay in this hotel last year.  The front staff were excellent  and provided great service and advice.  Although the hotel was quite busy it had a great atmosphere and lots of space!  It didn't feel overcrowded. The room were beautiful.  It was a affordable and good location.  We loved it,5,2018,03,29
237,"Great location, clean and nice",Terrific service upon checking in and calling us when our room was ready and wanting no tip to store our bags. Comfortable king size beds and nice bathrooms. Appreciate the in room bathrobe. Great location for walking everywhere...near tgw bridge and easy taxi ride from airport. ,5,2018,03,27
237,Flying visit,"Stayed for just one night using Hilton honors points, I'd probably not have ""paid"" as the dates are quite high, and we use the room very little. We've been to Dublin 6 times so have done all the touristy stuff. This visit was for a gig at Vicar Street. The hotel is in a great location, right on the river, therefore a stones throw from temple bar, and only a short walk to all other attractions. They stored our luggage and ensured our room was ready a little ahead of check in which was appreciated given our early flight, the hotels very modern the room is quite stark, and white, but clean and comfortable and not a bad size for Dublin. We stayed on the 4th floor which had a side view to the river if you looked for it, but otherwise looked out onto flats, it was quiet though with natural day light.
Bath with shower over, all the usual facilities in room. Didn't otherwise use hotel- why would you in Dublin? A Few decent food options on the door step. 5-10 minutes walk to air coach stops",4,2018,03,26
237,Bar is great for pre dinner cocktails ,The bar just beside the quay entrance is great for pre dinner cocktails. Everyone in the party ordered their own favourite cocktail and everyone agreed that they were very well executed. The place is quite lively and atmospheric and a dj was setting up for the evening to play some tunes as well.  ,4,2018,03,25
237,Wedding,Attended a wedding here at the week end. The staff were fantastic from start to finish.Very friendly. From arrival to leaving they were super. Food excellent. Nothing was to much trouble for them. As we didn't stay as this hotel (bit pricey for me)  i can't comment on rooms. But if rest of hotel is anything to go by i reckon there lovely.,5,2018,03,25
237,Great Hotel for Seeing Dublin,"Based upon 5-star reviews selected this hotel and was not disappointed and these reviews were accurate and not inflated -- location cannot be beat to see sites, have a drink of grab a good meal.  A $25 USD cab ride, easy 20-min walk to almost all sites and access to rail for getting around town.  Rooms nice size, bathrooms large and offer a good night sleep -- there is a gym but did not use.  There is a very nice bar and place to grab food and the quality and size was worth the price.  Service excellent and recommendations offered on places to go & how to get there were all used and perfect.

Tip:  Visit pubs and restaurants outside of Temple Bar as this is where ALL tourists go and it is more expensive.  Instead go to other places to have a pint with locals and enjoy the Irish hospitality.  Ask concierge on best way to get to specific sites to save time and see all that Dublin has to offer.  Be advised this is not a cheap hotel in Dublin given location -- we used points for our 2-night stay as cost would have easily been $600 USD for our stay.  But overall a great hotel choice.

Tip:  If coming to Ireland and Dublin is a stop on your plans -- two full days is enough -- use majority of your time to get out into the countryside and see the beauty that is Ireland. 

Tip:  If coming for some time consider flying into Shannon (small and West Coat) and then out of Dublin for home -- we followed this advice and it was perfect for our visit.",5,2018,03,25
237,Style over substance,"This is the only Hilton brand in Dublin not stayed at. Was looking forward to it. 

Staff. Well I am used to friendly welcomes at both Hilton garden inn and Hilton in Dublin. This hotel has not got friendlier side of the Irish charm. 

Rooms. Look great. If I book a double bed I expect a double bed. Not two twin beds pulled together. Sleep quality was awful due to crack in middle of bed 

Breakfast. Oh well shocked. As a diamond member i normally don’t pay for breakfast it is one of the perks. Here if you go breakfast and have any of the non continental breakfast goods you are whacked with a breakfast charge. Never seen this before. 

For my next stay think I stay at the sister hotels",3,2018,03,23
237,Great hotel at a brilliant location,"We stayed here for St Patrick's day 2018 and had a wonderful time. The hotel is comfortable, clean and spacious. The staff was super friendly and accommodating to our needs. The location is just perfect, right on the river in the center of town. All of Dublin's attractions are within walking distance. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel (the price seemed too high), so we found a wonderful little breakfast cafe right around the corner (Lemon Jelly Cafe).",5,2018,03,23
237,"Modern hotel, great location ","We loved the Morrison!  The location was so convenient to all the sites and scenes in Dublin.  The hotel was modern and clean.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  We did not eat in the restaurant but room service food was good.  And of course, the cookies were delicious!
I would definitely stay here again. ",5,2018,03,22
237,Lovely hotel,"The Morrison is a welcoming, modern hotel in a fantastic location.  Our room was nice and the public areas were clean.  We enjoyed our stay and found the staff to be very friendly and helpful.  I would definitely stay here again. ",5,2018,03,22
237," Highly recommended!","I had a very pleasant stay here. Front staff were very friendly and helpful and the rooms looked fabulous. The beds were also very comfortable. This hotel is in a fantastic location, I would highly recommend it!
",5,2018,03,22
237,Overall nice hotel/location. Staff ok,"Nice hotel& location. Manager was a bit rude/haughty and not accommodating, which created further inconveniences for our 3 day stay. I would consider staying at this hotel in future, but likely would prefer to look at other hotels, which is Shane because generally prefer Hilton brand hotels",3,2018,03,22
237,Amazing Hotel,"I can't imagine a better place to stay in Dublin, the hotel itself is beautiful - and immaculate; it's location allows you to walk to more attractions than you're likely to have time to see. The staff are friendly and helpful, we didn't eat there often but when we did the food was amazing. I've stayed in many Hilton Hotels (I'm Hilton Gold) while I'm loyal to Hilton, I expect a certain level of quality in return, what I received at The Morrison far exceeded my expectations.",5,2018,03,22
237,Simply nice,"First of all thanks to security who managed dealing with two a little bit drunk people, we couldn't find our room couple of times and receptionist with security didn't made us to feel awkward and security guy direct us. Lovely hotel, our room was just gorgeous! ",5,2018,03,22
237,A lovely hotel albeit a disappointing concierge experince,"It's a modern and well kept hotel walking distance (20 mins) from most things you would like to see in town. Lovely restaurant and service attached with gym and good rooms. Overall expensive but that's the case throughout Dublin. Regretfully I had an altercation with a member of staff at the front desk trying to get back to my room that affected my visit with you. There was no attempt to bring the conversation round to a positive conclusion, I was spoken too rudely and I had to walk away. Needless so say it upset me and it left a lasting memory. No breakfast included which seemed a shame given the cost of our stay.",3,2018,03,18
237,Great first night in Ireland!,"The Morrison Hotel is a great facility with a great staff.  The room has more than enough amenities, is a large room in the middle of Dublin.  The front desk staff gave helped us via phone to find directions to the parking, which is not easy to find, saying if need be they would meet us in the street and park the car for us....which did not need to happen.  They also gave us great suggestions as to where to eat and which pubs we need to explore and which ones to avoid.  Highly recommend The Morrison!",5,2018,03,18
237,Nice stay a few big problems,"We had to delay our arrival here by one day due to Storm Emma. Since my reservation was booked on points and money, it took a few phone calls with the hotel and corporate to get it straightened out. Once we arrived, our room was not ready yet, so we went to explore for the next 1.5 hours.  We showed back up shortly after 3pm and got our room.  It was on the 1st floor overlooking a roof.....not great but maybe more quiet then street side.....until there is a note in your room saying they are having a function and there will be loud music playing until 130AM!!!  Oy.  Breakfast is really really nice, if you are willing to pay for it (typical Hilton).  I get free continental with my status but they wanted an extra 7 euros for the hot stuff.....was it worth it, not sure, as the same exact items come ""free"" at a B&B at a much lower price. The drip coffee is TERRIBLE, I mean GROSS. My travel companion said it tasted burnt, to me, just, like dirt, so after the 2nd day we started utilizing the barista. Now, I get on to the fun stuff. After napping the first day, I broke out in a rash/hives all over the one side of my neck from the pillow. By the second day, it was all over my neck.  Asked the front desk to have the housekeeping change out the pillow cases, if they did, it didn't help. This NEVER happens to me. So I spent my days in Dublin, on Ireland's versions of antihistamines and cortisone cream. Then comes the second night of our stay, very strong smoke smell starts coming into our room.  We got concerned when it kept getting stronger, looked into the hall, called downstairs, and the girl who answered said there was no fire in the building, just the ""grill"" coming on from the kitchen.  WHAT!!!!! You know about this and think it is ok?!?  She offers to change our room and I am like (in my head) ""do you want to come repack all our stuff and move us.""  So every night for 3 hours, our room fills with smoke smell.....oh the joys. The bathroom is a good size as well as the room.....very retro.  They need to change out the shower head, although great water pressure, it hurts to shower, like pins and needles.  Upon checkout I bring up the issues we had, not to get anything because of the issues, just to let them know for the next people that stay in that room. The young woman had no idea what I was talking about.....so she brings in the manager.  He is very kind and seems concerned, had NO IDEA what the smoke smell was about and seemed baffled by it and more concerned about my rash.  He offered me tea or coffee (thanks but we are leaving for the airport) and then offers to pay for the taxi (30 euros).  They order the taxi, and it take THIRTY minutes to get to us!!!!  I could have ordered one on the myTaxi app and been on my in 2 minutes.  The manager (maybe Stephen) said he would call and follow-up with me in a few days about it all, HAVE NOT HEARD FROM HIM!  Also, took two days of Benadryl to completely clear up the rash after not being on those pillows. Not staying here again! And after the nonsense of the taxi and no follow-up, I want my points back!",2,2018,03,16
237,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel. Staff couldn’t do enough. Really clean and I’m a clean freak. Room facing river a little too noisy as window didn’t seem to seal out noise but staff moved us no problems.
Rooms really modern and clean. No issues.
Will definitely return.
Free cookie too!! Stayed at a few of these in this chain. And the staff have all been lovely.
Thanks again Doubletree :)

237,Perfect hotel in downtown Dublin,"I'm very happy with my 6 night stays at the Morrison. The hotel has been recently renovated with very good taste and everything is still in mint condition.

Twice I found a little surprise in my room (once a bag of chip and once a selection of chocolates).

Location can't be beaten. My room faced the busy Ormond Quay street but street noise was never an issue.

Looking forward to staying again.",5,2018,03,14
237,not great value for money at all.,"Came over for the rugby the 9-11 March.  Booked via Booking.com and was told the price was £530 but for some reason was actually £573 for the 2 nights. When i called to query after returning home I was told its probably something to do with the banks or exchange rate which seems extremely excessive. The hotel itself is nice enough in a good location with the rooms small but adequately equipped with all you need. But for over £280 per night, it really is poor value for money and probably the only low light of an otherwise great weekend in a great city. Finally, when checking out at 4.30 am to catch an early flight, i was told by a gentleman on reception that he couldn't actually check me out as ""he was too busy"" ??!!!  I work in the hotel trade and this left a very poor final impression  especially as the hotel was deserted at this early hour. Amazing city but i will not be staying at this hotel the next time i visit.",3,2018,03,13
237,Rugby Trip,"Great hotel with friendly staff. We used to stay every second year for the Ireland Scotland Rugby game but have not done for a few years so good to see standards remain high under Hilton Doubletree brand.

Like most hotels there is an international staff  but all have embraced the typical Irish Hospitality.

Jane the food and beverage manager very helpful and bar staff great.  Nothing too much trouble for the smiling breakfast team .
 Great band on Friday night!!

A wee bit pricey but worth it and will be back in 2 years.",5,2018,03,12
237,Great location in Dublin,"I primarily picked this location due to the location and being a long time Hilton member.  I was very pleased with the location of this hotel.  We had two rooms for the nights of March 7 and 8.  We arrived at the hotel around 1 p.m. and were advised that our rooms were not yet available.  They were very accommodating and stored our luggage so we could explore Dublin.  When we returned to the hotel at 7 p.m. our room were available and we quickly got our bags and made our way to the rooms.  The rooms were spacious and clean.  Upon check in we were given a business card that stated ""care line"".  Basically it encouraged you to call the care line should you need any assistance or have any questions.  I tried calling that evening on two separate occasions but no one answered the call.  I eventually figured out the WiFi and we made our own dinner reservation.  I also tried to call the care line the following day to answer a power cord question/issue in the room, again no one answered.  My advice would be if you are going to hand out a care line business card, someone needs to man the phone. Lastly, parking at this hotel is reasonable and just down the street.  It was a fairly easy check out process when we left the hotel.",4,2018,03,11
237,"Great location , lovely staff, superchoice ","Ideally located as just  a hop skip and a jump from a temple bar ! It’s location means that you’re never  too far away from a diddly diddly bar, but far enough to enjoy a break from it , to recharge the batteries !

There is a lovely feel about the hotel. It’s bright modern and very clean. Check in was quick and friendly and the rooms are a good size. The only observation I had was there are limited sockets in the bedroom, so trying to find somewhere to dry my hair was a real challenge .
We didn’t have breakfast as the restaurant was packed , but then you have ample choice on your doorstep.
Definitely stay again top choice. 
",4,2018,03,11
237,Great place right where you want to be,"We stayed here for a night before moving on to other parts off the country.  It was a great location for walking and getting around the Dublin area sightseeing.  You are less than a nice 5 minute walk to the other side of the remover where a lot of activities are.  You are also about a 7 minute walk to the mall in case you need anything.  The staff was really helpful and informative.  They worked hard to get us an early check in so we could clean up after an overnight flight.  The room size was fine for a night or two.  Amenities are as expected.  Towels are good sized.  My wife liked the robe being available.  The air conditioning was a little interesting to figure out but it worked.  I would recommend this hotel to others when traveling to Dublin.  We walked from the hotel around the south side of the river, St Patrick’s Cathedral, rode a bus to the west side of town to Nancy Hands for a meal and walked back. Easy enough.   ",4,2018,03,07
237,EPIC Weekend stay in Dublin,"Perfectly located hotel right across temple bar. As usual, I appreciated the warm welcome with a delicious cookie at the front desk. Despite arriving during the red weather alert in March 2018, the entire place was running normally which was not the case of the rest of the city. Very professional and efficient staff. Check-in was very fast. Room very modern (maybe a bit too much) with sort of neon lights everywhere and very comfy. A bit tough to figure out how the lights are working. Went for an Irish Coffee at the bar which was delicious. Had a huge and perfectly cooked T-Bone steak at the Grill. Next day went to the fitness which is the only reason I am not rating my stay as ""excellent"": The place was not heated properly and felt like I was standing outside but overall the facilities are ok. Good breakfast buffet with option to choose items from menu but a little bit expensive and disappointing compared to what I had at other Double Tree hotels. The highlight of my stay ( on top of the cookies of course) was the night auditor offering me a bottle of water when coming back at 3 am after a night of heavy Guinness tasting in Temple bar. Probably reduced a little bit the hang over.  The place may seem a little over priced but the quality of service is clearly amazing and the location is just perfect.",4,2018,03,06
237,"Good location, excellent staff","Great location for the main sights of Dublin. Room was nice, clean and modern. Decent air-con. Staff are very friendly and helpful - at breakfast any little extras were no problem. The cookie at check-in was a nice welcoming touch.",5,2018,03,05
237,Great value,"Great location, close to everything. Very friendly staff and spacious + very clean rooms. 

The breakfast was a bit of disappointment. First of all I think it’s quite expensive for what there actually is available at the buffet. But the thing that bothered us the most was that the staff at the breakfast area didn’t seem to have a clue about what they were doing. All of them were just bringing omelets and coffees randomly to tables. I don’t understand why they bother to ask people what kind of coffee or omelets they want when they just randomly bring food and drinks to tables. And it was annoying to be asked for the 6th time if we were waiting for an omelette. ",5,2018,03,05
237,"Great location, very nice hotel","This is the second time we stay at The Morrison. The location is very good and the atmosphere in the hotel is very nice (modern, fresh). As for the room: The airco was not working, I guess due to winter, but also there was no window to open and during night we always sleep with an open window to get some fresh air. So during the night it was way to warm in the room! Second; we both remarked that the bed (mattress) was quite tough, not comfortable & soft. As for the bathroom, only one sink and directly next to the sink there is the toilet, this is not convenient. But overall, a very nice place to stay! (price during this period was quite high!!) We will certainly come again.",4,2018,03,05
237,Return visit February 2018,"We stayed here in 2015 & were delighted to return for 1 night. Our junior suite, bar experience & restaurant food were just as nice as we remembered. Thanks for the complimentary bubbles & cookies! We received a hand-written note & treats from the manager to welcome us back. It is a little expensive compared to similar hotels in Dublin, but we like it & will return next time. My only niggles - more vegetarian options in the grill please & the breakfast room could be more luxurious for such a stylish hotel.",5,2018,03,05
237,Great hotel right in the City Center,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel during the Beast From the East storm. Our room was modern, clean and comfortable. We couldn't beat the location - right across the river from the Temple Bar area! The staff was also incredibly helpful and accommodating  when we needed to extend our stay one night due to the weather. The food at the Morrison Grill was top notch. I have zero complaints and would definitely stay there again.",5,2018,03,05
237,Fantastic Location,"Location Location Location as the programme says, this is it, perfectly situated on the other side of the Liffey to temple bar and all it's surroundings, great hotel nice staff, only gripe was came back Saturday afternoon around 3:15pm and room had still not been made up.",4,2018,03,04
237,Dublin hotel prices ,I had the pleasure of visiting the Morrison hotel Dublin on Saturday. We attended a wedding and everything was 5 star. From the reception we got to the staff. The hotel itself is very modern and spacious. The rooms are small but very nice. The only thing i have to complain about is the prices at the bar. €6.70 a pint it's what to expect in Dublin these days. The greed is back but the recession lingers on. ,4,2018,03,04
237,The Morrison has it all!,"When I was stranded at Dublin Airport during the 'Beast from The East' snowstorm this week (February 2018), my wife was able to get me a room at the Morrison. Given that the city was in 'lock down' mode with no public transport and taxi services at a minimum, the city hotels were all booked up - but I was lucky to get a room at the Morrison. The location, the service, the food, the rooms couldn't have been better in this modern, Irish cultured filled hotel!  Thank you to the Front Desk for getting me a taxi back to the airport when all of the local taxi services opted to stay off the roads - you were a 100% life saver experience!",5,2018,03,03
237,Irish charm couples with a modern luxury experience,"We decided to go for the weekend to Dublin and it was a breath of fresh air to arrive at just after 9am at our hotel and to be serviced and treated with such respect and care from the start. Those choc chip cookies were a delight, our bags were kept safely while we got on the Local Dublin hop on hop off bus. When we got back to the hotel, we were so delighted with the warm smiles and caring nature of the staff. Violet in particular was extraordinary. I dont think we have ever come across a genuinely helpful smart and witty hotel receptionist ever like Violet. From great suggestions for local eateries and pubs to taking care of our charging cellphones. Our rooms were comfy and spacious. The restuarant downstairs was really lovely too. Well done The Morrison and well done to Dublin for being up there with the best of the best for making epic memories.",5,2018,03,02
237,Solid stays to bookend Ireland road trip,"Stayed here for 3 nights in Jan/Feb before and after a three week road trip around Ireland. First stay of two nights in a first floor room allowed time to recover from 30 hour trip but location meant only short walk to Temple Bar to re-charge and re-acquaint ourselves with this vibrant area.  Room was spacious and well lit. Buffet breakfast was adequate and appreciated on first morning, but more affordable options abound nearby.

Returned for one night before flying out and had a more spacious room on the M level. Handwritten note from management welcoming us back was much appreciated. The checkout procedure was smooth and staff were keen to ensure that our stay had been a pleasant one.",4,2018,03,01
237,First stay at The Morrison and was impressed,"It has been a year since I have been to Dublin on a trip for work. Normally I would have stayed at a different hotel however my colleague recommended this one. I'm glad he did.

When walking in one gets the impression that it is quite new and modern; however I was told it has been there for quite a while. The reception, gym, dining area are very nice and the room was decent size. Only thing that would have been nice was a room that faced out but not something that is a big deal.

I tried out the gym which has enough equipment, weights and space. Also had breakfast which was good. You have continental and the option for the chef to cook you a number of dishes. All good quality in my opinion.

The location is central which is another plus given I could walk to the office.",5,2018,02,27
237,Love this hotel,Great location near LUAS and Temple Bar. Modern and clean. Big room and bathroom. Fun lounge. Good food. First rate. Freiendy and helpful staff. Buzzy atmosphere. Will definitely be back. Our friends enjoyed it too! ,5,2018,02,25
237,"Average property, with much room for improvement.","Stayed 3 nights in February. I should also mention I am Hilton Diamond, and this stay was on points.

Pros:
- Good location, close to sights and the Jervis Luas (light rail) station.
- New(ish) hotel and everything appeared clean and in good shape.
- Grab-n-go breakfast option worked flawlessly for our early departure to catch a flight.

Cons:
- No warm cookies at check-in. This is a DoubleTree property, so need I say more?
- Hotel check-in time is 3pm, yet room was not ready. I was told flat out by the desk agent that junior suites were available, yet I was not offered any upgrade. After much back and forth on the computer and trying to see what rooms were ready, I was given room 325. The agent said this was nearly identical to 426, which I had pre-selected through the mobile app for its size and partial river view. Upon getting to the room though, I found it to be cramped and with no view of the river.
- No hot breakfast for Diamonds. Really? Despite a €4.50 difference in menu price (15 continental, 19.50 full breakfast - if I was a paying customer), I was told it would be an upcharge of €7 per guest to get a hot breakfast. No Executive Lounge at this property either.
- Poor bathroom configuration. Behind the bathroom door is a curved wall (maybe to make the tiny rooms seem larger), yet the bathroom door is blocked by a doorstop at 90 degrees, leaving much wasted space. The toilet is also connected to the vanity, making it virtually impossible for 2 people to get ready at the same time.
- Uncomfortable beds and pillows. Perhaps part of the minimalist style, but the platform bed left me with a stiff back and neck each morning. The pillows did not help either.

All in all, a substandard stay. If I found myself in the area again, I would not return to this property.",3,2018,02,23
237,Best hotel yet!,"So I have visited Ireland more than 10 times in my lifetime. I have stayed at so many different hotels within Dublin as well as outside of Dublin. I can honestly say that The Morrison is my top hotel in Dublin. That's right, its better than Westburry, Shelbourn, Conrad and Raddison!

Staff were fantastic. Really warm and friendly. They were more than happy to go out of their way to help you too. 

Food was good too. I didn't dine at the restaurant within Morrison but I had room service and breakfast everyday and I can say my tummy was happy. 

Room (one bedroom suit) was great. Great size, clean and modern. Noise level was ok. Nice furniture - wasn't dirty or run down at all. 

location wise, I really liked this place. Very close to all the shopping areas and 5-10min walking distance to Grafton st. Parking space just down the road for additional guests.

I really enjoyed staying here for a week. Thank you very much and I will definitely come back again soon.",5,2018,02,23
237,Quality,"I stayed two nights this time for business so didn’t spend too much time in the hotel. I had an excellent welcome and was upgraded without asking because I’m a Hilton Honours member. The place is clean, fresh and the rooms, on the Mezzanine floor, very spacious. A little niggle is the size of the shower gel and the shower itself. Like a small hand shower and too powerful. The restaurant has lots of opposition locally but is very nice, but a little pricey. I had an omelette for breakfast, fully loaded, but it only tasted of egg, and there were no beans!!",4,2018,02,22
237,Excellent hotel with the perfect location in Dublin,"This hotel is has the perfect location in Dublin city. Near shops and cross the pedestrian bridge and you are right in Temple bar. Hotel staff is friendly. I like the design of the hotel. Spacious rooms with good amenities. The breakfast presentation was impressive, lots of food choices.",5,2018,02,20
237,Great location,Stayed for one night recently. Upon arrival.we were given 2 cookies. No questions asked if we were allergic to any food types. The reception girl was ok not overly friendly and a bit hard to understand. Our room was nice but the heat was ridiculous. The room air conditioning was blowing out hot air instead of cold. We asked for a fan which was provided and helped a bit. We asked for the patio doors to be opened but this created lots of noise as we were situated beside the main street. We complained and were offered our car parking fee free. We wouldn't stay again.,3,2018,02,20
237,Delightful!,"Just had a 2 night stay here with my 17 year old daughter. She was over the moon with how cute the rooms were, we also loved the lobby and the breakfast was amazing. Staff were all very friendly. We hope to stay here again the next time we are in Dublin as it exceeded our expectations.",5,2018,02,19
237,An excellent choice in the city center,"We stayed in the Morrison for a night recently and we were impressed. The location may be the main attraction but the hotel and its staff really are of a high standard. Situated on the River Liffey, a few steps from the Ha'penny bridge and Temple Bar, with a car park and a shopping center only a few meters away, this is an ideal base in the city center. 
Check in was fast and painless, and of course there was a free cookie. The bedroom was large, spotless and designed to be ultra accessible. The bed was comfortable, the TV had a large choice of channels and there was tea/coffee options available. The bathroom was also large, had 2 sinks and there were 2 different showerheads in the shower, a fixed one and a moveable one. There was no bath though. The only complaint about the room at all is the the lighting is poor - and not at all helpful to applying makeup I am told! The bar is very modern, with a good choice of beers, wines and cocktails. The staff are professional and polite. We ate in the bar that night and it was excellent. Junior, who looked after us, was superb and we were very happy with the service. Breakfast was lacking a little I thought, but the coffee was good and there was natural honeycomb available (A first in Ireland for me) - and it is available until 12 at weekends, which is brilliant. Checkout was seemless also. All in all, a very enjoyable stay.",5,2018,02,19
237,Very good location,"An excellent hotel which is very close to all the tourist attractions.
We were a stones throw away from temple bar and the shopping district. The medieval area was close and all there is a massive choice for breakfast/brunch/lunch/dinner nearby.
The air coach was a 15min walk away which made travelling to and from the airport very easy. If you are going to get the air coach I would look at a map as we found a shorter route on the way back (handy if it freezing)
The hotel itself was clean, spacious and had a lot of 5 star amenities in the room (bed is a bit hard)
The restaurant was good, lots of choice and very tasty.
The staff were polite and helpful",5,2018,02,16
237,Clean Hotel in a Great Location,"My wife and I stayed at the Morrison hotel for two nights, a Tuesday and Wednesday.  We chose the hotel due to its close proximity to the Temple Bar district as we wanted to be within walking distance of the nightlife.  It was a perfect choice for this reason.  Overall, the hotel was very clean.  Our room had a large, comfortable bed, and plenty of space with a chic modern decor.  The front desk and room service was also very good.  Our room was pretty well insulated from the outside noise, but the closing doors of nearby rooms was much more noticeable.  The only other issue was one of their two elevators was out of service during our stay.  Although there were stair options, the bottom doors were for emergency exiting only.  This essentially forced us to have to wait for the elevator.  Aside from those minor inconveniences, it was worth staying at and we would stay here again.",4,2018,02,15
237,Wonderful! ,"We had originally booked an apartment for our family mini-break in Dublin, but it turned out to be very disappointing, so we moved to The Morrison- and it was the best decision of the holiday! No trouble for the Reception staff at all- and a delicious warm chocolate chip cookie each on arrival, and really lovely-smelling candles in the attractive lobby and entrance- just the welcome we needed! The rooms are so comfortable and tastefully decorated, nice toiletries and a great bed. Tea and coffee facilities in the room, and an excellent TV/info set-up. We didn’t use the restaurant or have breakfast in the hotel, because it’s in such a fantastic location, with plenty of lovely cafes and restaurants nearby, and Temple Bar just a short walk away across the bridge. When we checked out we were offered a bottle of water for our travels-very thoughtful. Highly recommend this hotel for the perfect place to stay and enjoy the sights of Dublin. ",5,2018,02,15
237,Valnetines day,"We had a great time here at the Morrison double tree, when we arrived at the reception we received warm welcome from Marie ( special thanks ) after that we went to the restaurant to have the afternoon tea which was great and there we was served by Maya ( outstanding service, you should be proud to have such employee), on the evening night we had diner at the same restaurant and we was served by Stefan the bartender ( super service received, great job !) we want to say thanks to Simon from the restaurant! ( 5 star service ) , I would recommend for anyone who want to experience great service and very good location.",5,2018,02,14
237,"Great Hotel, Position and  Fantastic Staff!","This hotel is situated in the most ideal position for a visit to Dublin. Overlooking the River Liffey and just a short stroll over the bridge an you are in Temple Bar.  All of the things to do in Dublin are at your doorstep. GUINNESS , JAMESON the lot.  This is not a 5 star establishment but should be because of the position, staff and warmth.  Extremely well run!
Breakfast is amazing!",4,2018,02,07
237,One of the best Double Tree I've even been in.,"Lovely hotel. In the central part of Dublin, close to all shops, restaurants, public transport and sights. Nice, cosy, modern, with good wifi and very good room service.The breakfast was very nice as well.
And I can't not to mention, that there were very beautiful Christmas decorations.",5,2018,02,06
237,"decent hotel, but overpriced","Pretty, elegant hotel, with a bar with OUTSTANDING cocktails and great bartenders.  But, overall overpriced.  Our room cleaning was inconsistent, the bed was rock hard and not comfortable at all, no Nespresso machine, just bad instant coffee, and the wifi was super slow.  Decent gym, which was nice.  But no way was it worth 350 euros a night.  I've paid less than that for a Four Seasons, and it was definitely not the Four Seasons.",3,2018,02,05
237,"Visited family for Xmas, and spent the lead up week to Christmas here again","This is my second time to the Morrison this year. Once again it was wonderful. I arrived on a cold / wet / blustery day, and was welcomed with a warm cookie when I arrived after 24 hours of flights from Australia.

The staff member who checked me in recognised me from a trip earlier in the year. This place always feels like home. This time I had a room overlooking the Liffey, and it was lovely waking up to that view.

It's a great hotel, right in the middle of everything. It's all a short walk away without feeling like you are being rushed. With it being Xmas, Dublin was a alive with Music, and Decorations, and every one doing their shopping. It has a magically quality about it.

Once again the staff out do themselves, always willing to help, always with a smile. From having a quiet drink in the bar, to eating in the restaurant, everything is top notch. 

With family and friends in Ireland I'll be back again for sure.",5,2018,02,05
237,Another excellent stay,"This was our fifth stay at the Morrison, and every part of my earlier review (Comfort, Convenience, Class - September 2016) could be repeated here.  In summary: excellent location, comfortable beds, outstanding staff.  

Obviously we have chosen to stay at the Morrison on numerous occasions, and not without reason.  I really cannot emphasize enough the level of customer service we have experienced every time we have stayed on property.  Our visits have included couples trip, family trip with teenage children, and a large family celebration where we were able to avail ourselves of the wonderful event facilities.  Each time the professionalism, courtesy, and warmth of the staff surpassed our expectation.

We treated ourselves to a slightly larger room this trip and I am sharing photos of this delightful, comfortable room.  That said, we have been pleased with every room in which we have stayed.",5,2018,02,05
237,Lovely central hotel.,"We stayed for 2 nights at this lovely hotel in the centre of Dublin. Our flight arrived at 8am and we were in our room by 9am - a very welcome start to our stay.  All the staff we encountered were helpful, friendly and went out of their way to ensure we had everything we needed. There was a good choice of food at breakfast and the service was attentive. We wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again. ",5,2018,02,05
237,Lovely hotel and close to everything!! Fabulous helpful staff too!!!!,"A warm welcome on arrival with friendly staff and the offer of a very welcome warm delicious cookie!!! Room was spacious and warm and the decoration of song lyrics by Irish singers is a nice touch. Breakfast in the mornings was absolutely delicious and the staff were always in hand to see if they could get you anything else. I would definitely stay here again if I ever take another trip to Dublin!!! Nice surroundings, nice decor, warm and friendly staff and a delicious breakfast with plenty of choice in the mornings!! Five stars all round!!!",5,2018,02,04
237,Magnificent Property,"It is very hard for me to hand out 5 stars to any property. I truly feel this property deserves it. As a former Hilton employee, and a current Gold Member, I have felt the experience on both sides of the fence. I know what staff deals with, yet I know what is a possible. This property was 100% well deserving of all 5 stars. 

The staff was outstanding, we were greeting by the front reception and offered cash to pay our taxi (we were not informed from our driver that most cabs in Dublin do not take card). They gave us cash for the driver and billed it to our room. We were given our complimentary upgrade and had the most pleasant view of the city we could have hoped for. Within 30minutes we were treated by another staff with a personal note an a bag of chips. ( we immediately felt the most welcomed ) The breakfast was superb and even though we arrived at the tail end the staff continued to pump out food for us and gave us a lengthy amount of time and made sure there was nothing else we wanted before they started closing the shop. 

What the staff never realized is this was our first impression/experience  of Ireland and after a few weeks of touring the whole UK we decided to label Dublin as our favorite city, one of the biggest reasons was our experience at The Morrison. ",5,2018,02,04
237,"Lovely hotel, the staff make it a gem! ","We stayed here for one night at the end of January.

Location: You couldn't ask for a better one, only a minutes walk to temple bar and the red line luas. Very central, perfect for shopping or going out at night.

Hotel: The facilities were all very modern, the bar was very nice. We didn't eat here but the menu looked good. WiFi wasn't the best and the bed was a little hard.

Staff: The best part about this hotel was the staff. They were extremely helpful and genuine at every point of contact especially the reception and bar staff. All went the extra mile to make our stay amazing! ",5,2018,02,03
237,Excellent Stay,"This was our first time in Dublin and we didn’t know anything about this property besides the other reviews.   Everything about this hotel was excellent.  The entire staff... reservations, front desk, housekeeping, room service, wait staff all excellent.  The Morrison is in an excellent location in the middle of City Center.   The rooms are very clean and well appointed with a modern flair.   Great week-long experience.  ",5,2018,01,30
237,Excellent Hotel! Fit the bill for what we were looking for...,"We mainly selected this hotel because we are Hilton Honors Members. Stayed here the first night on our week-long adventure through Ireland. The Hotel has everything a traveler would want. Centrally located just a few minutes’ walk over the bridge to the Temple Bar area and other attractions. Clean, comfortable, modern décor. We didn’t eat at the Hotel, although the dining areas looked quite nice. For breakfast, we opted for a cute café right next to the hotel called the Mochaland Café, which was quite good and perhaps more economical. Parking is in a nearby garage.",5,2018,01,30
237,"Great stay, exceptional service","The Good.

1. Great location. Would normally prefer Grafton St. To stay but this hotel.on the Liffey is just across from Temple Bar, near the shops in Henry St. and O'Connell st. Also it is only  10 minutes from Grafton St.

2. The modern and minimalist decor in public spaces and rooms was great.

3. The rooms were comfortable and well equipped with good bathrooms. Free water and toiletries by Crabtree and Evelyn.

4. The highlight was the service. A welcome with a yummy chocolate and hazelnut cookie is always good. We arrived just after 3pm and our room was not quite ready. We didn't mind but we're very impressed by the staff response in reception. They offered a room upgrade and free drinks in the bar. After 20 minutes, the room was ready and our bags were already there. Turned what could have been a minor niggle into a massive positive.

5. The bar had loads of interesting Irish whiskies and gins.

6. The room was great value at around  £150.

The Bad.

1. One minor quibble was the need for room service to be vacuuming at 8.40 am on a Saturday.

Overall.

Great hotel stay and very impressed by the  reception team in particular. Will be keen to return.",5,2018,01,29
237,Lovely Hotel,"The rooms were exceptionally clean, easy check-in and got a free delicious cookie. We had dinner at Morrison Grill and the staffs were lovely, we received a complimentary Prosecco from the room at dinner. The steak was fabulous, very delicious! 
We had our breakfast and the service was ok, from our understanding, you can only have one order from the menu because they took it after we ordered. They did not explain the breakfast procedures properly. We ordered Egg’s Benedict and Vanilla Scented French toast, they were nice. The cappuccino was bad, the milk was burnt. But overall, it was a lovely stay, would definitely go back here. ",5,2018,01,28
237,Best spot in Dublin,"I have stayed here 5 times, everytime I'm in Dublin its my last stop.  Great location, right across from Temple Bar.  Dublin airport in 25 mins away.  The bar usually has great entertainment on weekends, and my favorite restaurant, Bar Italia, is next door.  The roomz are always clean and tidy, showers work great.",5,2018,01,24
237,Nice !,"We had a great week end in Dublin, we stayed 3 nights.
Bedroom was clean and bed very comfort
Very well located, you can do everything by walk
Breakfast was good ! Dearrr I ate too much during three day !!!
Sercice was also very good",4,2018,01,23
237,Great hotel in convenient location,"Set right on the north side of the river Liffey - this hotel is well located for attractions, shops and plenty of bars and restaurants. 

Staff were friendly and welcoming and room was well equipped.

Breakfast was really impressive although there are many alternatives nearby.

Would happily stay again when next in Dublin.

",5,2018,01,22
237,Great,This is a great hotel.. its in an ideal location..right in the middle if town. The  Interior and rooms are modern and spacious! Definitely return when in Dublin next time.. the restaurant attached it beautiful for a nice meal- staff are so helpful ,4,2018,01,20
237,Fab contemporary hotel in a great location,"We had a great weekend celebrating a big family birthday. The hotel is in brilliant location - so central. Staff are great, rooms are spacious, clean, modern and comfortable. Would thoroughly recommend this hotel.",4,2018,01,19
237,Top end Doubletree in Dublin,"This is the best hotel from the Doubletree brand that I've stayed in. Very friendly welcome, great location and good quality rooms. Breakfast has a good al a carte selection as well as the buffet with no extra charge which is a bonus. Good bar too in which to take an obligatory pint of Guinness  (or two). 
As a hilton gold member I got upgraded to a junior suite which I really appreciated. I paid just over 200 euros which I think is about right, if you have a higher budget go for the sister hotel Conrad or top of the range The Merrion. 
The Morrison was a great quality leisure or business hotel and I would definitely return.",4,2018,01,19
237,Would Not Recommend,"So so gutted about this as I had high hopes of a good stay guaranteed when I read reviews and did my research. The good points first, the location was perfect, the room décor was beautiful and the deluxe double room is a good size. The reception staff upon arrival, were both welcoming and friendly. Room service ordered one evening - was great, food was delicious and everything ordered arrived perfectly! Now for the downside... The food in the restaurant was no way up to scratch, even after complaining and brought out again - not good enough. Wine was extremely over priced and not worth it. Service wasn't good either! The first nights sleep was extremely disturbed by loud and rowdy guests, which really upset my daughter in particular, and this went on from 3am until at least 5am. The last night stay was the worst! Extremely bad management when a wedding had taken place, meaning a move to an alternative room at 11pm, which in turn was no better as the room was beside a lift, so from 2am constant disturbance from more rowdy and loud guests!! The result in my complaint on check out was very very unsatisfactory!!! The manager almost overcharged me for an upgrade, until I was able to provide proof that I had managed to find our deluxe room at the lower rate than we had already paid. The manager had also lied to me stating she had received an email from our holiday agent claiming we had to pay extra!! I was lucky enough to have written proof that this was not the case, so I proved she lied to me! Not good enough! And not a considerate compensation given, considering the amount I paid, and the experience I had! Disappointed doesn't come close!!!!! I love Dublin and visit often, I had hoped to find a hotel I could rely on to stay on our regular visits, bu, it seems I need to continue my search!! Would not recommend!!",2,2018,01,16
237,Birthday Weekend,"Hotel was lovely - very central location, can walk everywhere. 
The staff were amazing - they can’t do enough for you. Unsure of the lady on receptions name but she had a managers name badge on - so helpful and friendly. 
Would really recommend staying at this hotel, if you want a nice weekend away with attentive staff. 
Only about a two minute walk to Temple Bar (if that) but the hotel is just over the river so ideal to go out but also for a good nights sleep as you can get away from the noise. ",5,2018,01,16
237,Great location and huge bed!,Stayed here for a weekend in Dublin and the location and staff were perfect. The bed was huge and the room was so quiet. I lost my credit card and the staff went searching and they found it for me and called me after I checked out to get it back which was super. The rooms themselves were very nice and the bar has some lovely cocktails. ,5,2018,01,16
237,Ideal location,"We booked this hotel last minute for a weekend break.  The location suited us perfectly as it is close to both Temple Bar and the Henry Street/Jervis Street shopping areas.  There is also a Luas stop nearby which is very useful if looking.  The hotel was spotlessly clean, staff were very friendly.  There was some noise from events being held in the hotel on both nights of our stay but this was not very invasive and the hotel notifed us of this beforehand and offer any assistance if required, I thought this was very considerate and a nice touch.  I will definitely return!",4,2018,01,16
237,Fabulous,"I would have no problem recommending this hotel, Breakfast was lovely, room fabulous, staff we were very attentive, cocktails were lovely but bit expensive, location right in the heart of everything highly recommend",5,2018,01,15
237,Great location on the Liffey and easy walk to Temple Bar.,"The Morrison was our ""home"" for a week where we celebrated Christmas. The staff was extremely helpful and made our stay wonderful. We opted for a junior suite and were fortunate to get located on the River side. Views of the Liffey and easy acces to the Ha' Penny bridge. Having the extra room of the suite was a plus. Given the possibility of ""weather"" they even have umbrellas in the rooms. The restaurant was comfy and food was terrific. The bar was a great place to hangout and the bar staff knew their stuff which we sampled extensively. Highly recommend this Hotel, a Double Tree and Hilton Honors member",5,2018,01,13
237,Business Visit,"Always my first choice hotel in Dublin. Great location for walking into the city which is very close.

The hotel is bright, modern with lots of space in the bedrooms. Always clean and great reception staff. Breakfast is good and love the layout of the breakfast area.

Great hotel for business, family and if there for tourism.",4,2018,01,13
237,"Great hotel, perfect location, like the rest of Dublin - expensive","Stayed in January 2018 as a weekend birthday treat for the wife.

This hotel is in a great location to get out and explore the many sights of Dublin and just across the bridge from the famous Temple Bar part of town.  That said, it is far enough away to not be affected by it in any way.  

Reception was seamless, felt sold in to a suite upgrade though which I shouldn't have taken.  It was of course me who said yes so I'll live with that, but we had already paid extra for a King Corner Room and ended up being sold a suite which looked miserably on to the rooms of another hotel.  I wish I'd kept the corner room.

The suite was modern and well laid out but the balcony was locked shut with a bolt so it seemed pointless to have it at all.

We didn't use the restaurant so can't comment on the food but it looked modern and well resourced.

We did use the bar, the staff were excellent, very friendly, very knowledgeable about the local area and didn't push opinions which was very professional, the couple of suggestions they made turned out to be excellent.

The prices in the bar are the same, if not slightly cheaper than the most local area in which the hotel sits - let's just classify this very easily into obscenely expensive.  The couple of old fashioned and cocktails we had were truly amazing so it felt we were getting good value for money compared to other bars.

All in - a great hotel, 4 stars only because of the upgrade which I'm not sure was given the balcony and all that.",4,2018,01,12
237,"Extraordinary hotel, very good service and great location","This hotel is located close to the shopping area and other great places in Dublin.
Outstanding hotel staff - service oriented with an authentic behaviour and real commitment. I have seen a lot of hotels, but only very view with such staff.
Spacious rooms with stylish design.
Recommendation for couples, business and singles.
If you get an acceptable rate - book it!",5,2018,01,11
237,The friendliest hotel in Dublin,"I’m always bowled over by the warm welcome I get whenever I check in here. The genuine friendliness of all the staff here is lovely and it makes it feel like a home from home. Nothing is a problem and they are most generous with the warm cookies too.

Rooms are clean and stylish yet functional with lovely crisp linens and cozy beds and a choice of lighting features which is a really nice touch. Some rooms even have balconies!

Breakfast is plentiful at the hotel and there’s a really nice touch with a barista doing coffees to order both to have with your breakfast and to go!

The hotel is literally across the bridge to Temple Bar and central for all the sights, restaurants and shops of the fair city of Dublin.

The only downside (and it’s a small one) is that the airport coach is a good 10 minutes walk to/from O’Connell Street so just be aware of that if you have luggage - this is far from the hotels fault though and hence why they get 5 stars from me! You can always jump on the Luas to Jervis and the hotel is just round the corner! 

You won’t be disappointed choosing this hotel for your stay be it for business or pleasure",5,2018,01,11
237,Perfect stay,"We stayed at The Morrison when we planned a 23 hour layover in Dublin on our way back from Italy. The staff were very helpful, the room was very clean, and the location was perfect. We were able to walk to see many area attractions in one afternoon. The proximity to the restaurants and pubs of the Temple Bar area allowed us to have dinner, take in some live music, grab gelato and have a quick walk back to the hotel. Highly recommend staying at The Morrison if you find yourself planning a trip to Dublin.",5,2018,01,11
237,Great Situation,The hotel is just across the river from the Temple Bar district with its many restaurants. we were upgraded to a Junior Suite due to Hilton Honours status. Very comfortable room. Great breakfast No car park.,5,2018,01,10
237,More-reasons to stop at the Morrison,"We spent 3 nights for a City Break in a Deluxe Double Room which was spacious and very comfortable. My wife likes a bath and the shower in the room was OK but this is only a minor niggle. The staff were all very helpful, enthusiastic and friendly.

The Breakfast Buffet and supplement menu were extensive and there was something for everyone. Food was fresh, nicely presented and tasty. We had booked through last minute and took advantage of a winter break deal.",5,2018,01,09
237,Felt Like Our Home Away From Home,"The Morrison in Dublin is by far one of the greatest hotels we have stayed in to date. Although the Hotel is fabulous and inviting/entertaining in its own right it is by far the people running the hotel that make it such an amazing place to stay. If you want Irish hospitality you will most certainly find it here.  We descended (literally) on the Morrison for Christmas and stayed a week, taking up four rooms on their fourth floor.  We added to this three different groups of friends from Europe that dropped in and out over the eight days we were there.  I mention this because the staff made sure that everyone in our parties were within a room of each other and at one point I think we had half of the top floor. This is something that actually takes care and planning on their part, especially now with the automatic check in and choose your room with Hilton.
 Pieter and Darren were stuck with most of our odd requests and answered all of our questions, set up private tours, ordered cabs, planned outings, acquired tour tickets for our entire party and anything else we needed. Darren is an authentic Irish Character and Pieter has the heart of an Irishman.  The girls at the front desk not to be outdone were gracious and friendly and equally accommodating. I spent some time in the lobby and took note that they always greeted each guest warmly and had them checked in and taken care of quickly.  Morrison although not small has a very boutique feel.  One of the things I noticed during our stay is how attentive the entire staff was and that they all smiled and therefore the guests were always smiling, no one was ever to busy to help you or have a chat.  I inquired of several people who worked there and asked why everyone was so happy all of the time, they all responded that the management was great to work for and everyone got along.  I have often found the inner workings of a company ultimately project itself onto the face of the company and in this case it most certainly did.  
I have focused on the people here because most reviews deal with the room or the food (which by the way were both outstanding) but the people in my opinion are what make or break a stay and make for a truly memorable experience.  
  I had the opportunity to speak with the managers and they were as charming and engaged as the rest of their staff.  Paul was concerned and aware of each and every person who worked for him.  You will find people from all over the world (as is common with most hotel chains) working here and each and everyone of them had a story.  The breakfast was amazing by any standard but that has been mentioned many times here, what I found truly remarkable was that within a day or so the staff all remembered what you wanted to order and the way you liked your coffee (coffee being the most important thing).  They were so good in fact that within a day or so all I had to do was walk by the dining room hold out my hand and the girls would put a Vanilla Latte in it as I passed by!!!!!  Thank you girls, you are most likely the reason my family and friends didn't drive me truly insane.
 The restaurant where we spent Christmas dinner was festive and bright, the food was excellent the service impeccable and they went to great lengths with pies and mulled wine and gifts to set the mood.  The decorations were quirky and inspiring and everything Christmas I could have asked for.  
My mother was ill a day or so while we were there and they cared for her like she was family. They checked on her, sent food to her room, made sure she had enough to drink and she never went without anything she needed.  The entire hotel seems to know what you need before you need it.  
For those of you looking for a review of the area and where the hotel stacks up from that stand point here you are; Morrison Is in the absolute perfect spot.  You are a short walk across the bridge to the Temple Bar Area which is the center of the nightlife in Dublin and the mecca of shopping during the day.  Being across the bridge you don't have the noise you would staying in Temple Bar but you do have almost immediate access.  On the other hand O'Connell Street is where all the tours start, the on and off bus and most of the public transportation around the city.  The Morrison is about a ten minute walk from that point. Again the hotel puts you in a very central point for that.  There are also many museums, attractions and historical venues on this side of the River.  
If this is your first time to Dublin, may I make a suggestion that your first activity be to take the On and Off tour it will give you your bearings in the city and after the two hour tour you will know where everything is and what you want to see.  The tour will take you through the history of Dublin and right through Guinness and the Whiskey distilleries and most of the major landmarks and attractions.  
In regards to the hotel, as I said it has a very boutique feel.  You are made to feel like a guest or member of the family rather than a number.  The rooms are large by European standards but splurge on the one bedroom or the penthouse they are magnificent.  The view from the balcony overlooking Dublin is memorable.  The food is excellent, the breakfast is by far the best we found.  The bar and live music are a lot of fun as well and as I am sure you have seen the staff is second to none.
The one thing to keep in mind, although we had a wonderful Christmas if you are only going for a couple of days and want to actually do things, you might want to avoid Christmas, the day before and the day after as the entire country shuts down.  Unless you can find an Irishman to take you home with them there is not a lot to do.
Hope this helps.",5,2018,01,08
237,"Terrific location, modern clean, and quiet with excellent facilities","We stayed here for 3 nights and really enjoyed our stay. They had fresh baked cookies at the front desk that were to die for. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The hotel restaurant and bar were very nice. They had a beautiful buffet breakfast. The service was first rate. The location was incredible, just across the street from the river and just across the river from the Temple Bar area where the night life happening.",5,2018,01,06
237,Stay at this hotel,"We stayed here for a weekend in December. We have stayed at a few hotels in Dublin and this has to be the best. From we arrived to we left, each member of staff was very friendly and helpful. At check in they were aware it was an Anniversary and some treats were delivered to our room. The room was really great. There was an issue overnight with noise from a party below but this was handled really well when I rang and later when I went to reception - I was actually shown a new room but decided to leave a move until the nest evening. The next day whilst we were out and about all our belongings were move to an even better/bigger room and again some treats left. I have to mention the breakfast - good selection, limitless coffee and items made to order. Again the staff were amazing. As been said this hotel is central and most things within easy reach. I would recommend anyone considering staying in Dublin to have a look at this hotel.",5,2018,01,05
237,Excellent stay at The Morrison by Hilton,"Checking staff was outstanding.

Room was super clean, location of the hotel perfect, and breakfast really good.",5,2018,01,04
237,"Amazing, luxury, perfect location! Brilliant all round.","Where do I start? This hotel was amazing from the minute we arrived. Location was perfect and we got the airbus from the airport for around £7 return.. Hotel was in the best location for bars (less than 5 minutes walk to temple bar), restaurants all over, nice bakeries and McDonald’s local, several shopping centres from high street to designer all within walking distance. Just amazing on location for everything! 
Reception staff greeted us with the nicest warm cookies which melted in the middle and gave us a map of the city with areas of suggestions. 
The rooms are so lovely and the bed was so comfy! I had the best sleep. We had room service and we asked for extra toiletries which was never too much for the staff. Everybody greeted you with a smile. 
Drinks in the bar were lovely and there was a nice selection of cocktails, right on the river front aswell! 
Breakfast was yummy! Good choice of food including bacon eggs sausages tomatoes, cereals, pastries. Lots of choices with hot and cold drinks also. 
I will definitely be hoping to return to this hotel this year and I can’t wait! ",5,2018,01,04

237,"Perfect Location, Decent Hotel","There are so many things that are great about this hotel:  the location, the restaurant, the staff...

My wife and I stayed here for 7 nights, and don't regret it at all.  There were some things I wish we'd been prepared for, though...

The hotel is very popular for weddings, and they go hard.  You won't hear noise, really, but you will hear thumping and people talking well into the evening.  We were on the second floor, and this was the case for us.  It won't really keep you up, but it's there.

Also, while the room itself is great, and clean, and pleasant, the beds are incredibly firm.  

Again, a very good hotel, and a perfect location for seeing the city of Dublin.  But know what you're getting into...",3,2018,01,02

237,Fantastic stay and great location,"Stayed for 3 nights with a friend for new year. Really good hotel. The staff were all very friendly and welcoming and went out of their way to assist with recommendations for NYE. A particular thank you to Darren on reception. 
The location of the hotel is perfect, just across the river from temple bar - so it's easy to access but not noisy. Rooms are modern, very clean and had everything we needed.
Many attractions are within very easy walking distance- trinity college, st Stephens green, Grafton street etc. I also walked along the river for about 15 mins to visit EPIC, the emmigration museum - lovely walk and really recommend the museum, absolutely fantastic. 
Other attractions are a little further, about 35 min walk to Guinness. We got the hop on hop off bus there which was good. We got a combo ticket for 27 euros, which then included 747 airlink bus from the airport and 48 hours for the hop on bus. Took about 35 mins from the airport. 
Great first time visit to Dublin and fantastic hotel stay.

237,Wonderful hotel in ideal location,"Short stay in this hotel that we immediately wished we could have made longer.
Hotel is ideally situated close to Temple Bar but not so close as to be noisy and disruptive. Beautiful modern, clean esthetic and the service and customer care was exceptional.
Great hotel that I look forward to revisiting ",5,2017,12,23
237,Good hotel with friendly employees,"I have been in this hotel for nine nights during december 2017 for business purpose!

Their employees are very friendly and the Irish people is a very nice and friendly people as well! 

However, the hotel have few things they need to be carrefull:
1) the room temperature is around 18C, which is cold. It is you concern, please ask for a duvet;
2) the windows have some gap whist allows the external noisy to enter in the room from the road (which can be very noisy in early morning). On some period, the hotel is not full and the receptionists will be happy to change your room withan internal one;
3) change of bed linen! The cleanning lady (or man, why not?), change the bed linen once or twice a week ? Please check with the reception to change it more often (such as every two days)! They will help you on this issue! Do not only ask it when you checkin at the hotel! Otherwise, they will not do it! Please, ask it each time during your journey! Is too easy to forgot something !

Please, with the recommendation above, enjoy your stay in this hotel! This is a good hotel!",4,2017,12,22
237,A home away from home,"Love staying at this hotel! The staff are always amazing. The relaxed chilled vibe of the bar/ restaurant is a winner. 
Centrally located and a warm cookie at check in. The rooms are spacious and well presented with a trendy boutique style interior. What's not to love 😊",5,2017,12,21
237,Excellent customer service,"I have stayed at this hotel a couple of times now and it is consistently good. The location is perfect - and i found the hotel bedroom to be relatively quiet despite its central location. The rooms are clean and housekeeping do a great job. Every member of staff we came in contact with was helpful and pleasant, the breakfast wait staff were particularly attentive. This hotel offers excellent service and good value for money. I look forward to staying here again on my next visit to Dublin.",5,2017,12,20
237,Not so hot,Cold the hot. Cleanliness questionable.  No extra blankets which was a factor..heat at maximum with room still cold. Handicapped with room 1/2 mile from elevator   Food often tepid. Waitstaff insufficient ,3,2017,12,19
237,Fantastic friendly hotel!,"We have just spent my birthday weekend in Dublin at three different hotels and the Morrison was easily the pick of the bunch.
The location is great, it's a very quick walk to Temple bar and has nice views of the River Liffey with bars and restaurants in abundance near the hotel.
The staff were so warm and welcoming throughout and it really felt like they all had time for you with nothing feeling rushed and the hotel had such a friendly/chilled vibe througout.
Our room was upgraded to a Junior suite which was stunning, lovely views of the river and lots of space with a really modern design feel to it, there was a handwritten card from the asst manager welcoming us and also a tub of sweets, all nice touches.
Breakfast was great and once again the service was spot on, a good choice of food was available and it was all piping hot.

Overall a fantastic stay and out of the three hotels we stayed at in Dublin this weekend we would only return to the Morrison which we definitely will in the future.",5,2017,12,19
237,Great hotel with a friendly staff,"This is a great hotel with a wonderful staff. We had no problems dropping off our luggage so that we could see the city before check in. We were able to pre-check-in. The staff was able to show us all of the locations we wanted to see...very helpful and nice. When we arrived back to the hotel around 3, our room was ready to go. Great room with modern touches. Ikea style furniture made for a lot of great storage. The location of the hotel is convienient to the local tram system...about a block away. Short walk over the river to the Temple Bar area. About a 10-15 minute walk to Grafton Street/Trinity College and to the Jameson Distillery.
We did eat in the restaurant...the food was very good...We were just too exhausted from our flight over to fully enjoy it. Great staff in the restaurant and bar...again very friendly and helpful.
Thank you to the staff for making our visit to Dublin so comfortable and enjoyable!",5,2017,12,19
237,Nice Hotel and Family Friendly!,"Enjoyed my stay here - the room was great, the bed was SO comfortable, breakfast was included and the perfect mix of offerings - fruit, cheeses, bakery items, different juices, infused waters, etc, people who worked here were very helpful and friendly!",4,2017,12,18
237,Very good,Staff were very friendly and helpful. A nice and very modern hotel with a good vibe and nice bar. The bar man put a lot of effort into making cocktails/coffees with extra little details on the side. Would definitely recommend. ,5,2017,12,18
237,Great location,This hotel is in walking distance of everything you need to see or do in Dublin. Rooms are modern and unique compared to a typical Doubletree property. Stay was fine but when we realized we had left something behind it was tough to go through the lost and found protocol. I had to raise the fact that I was a loyal Hilton guest with status in order to escalate any response. Would recommend the hotel for their location and rooms. ,4,2017,12,18
237,"Fantastic, modern hotel in the heart of the city","We stayed here midweek in December 2017 and simply couldn't fault the hotel. The rooms are spacious and well fitted out with a unique, contemporary feel. Checkin was smooth and easy and the fresh cookies were a lovely touch. The bed was comfortable, wifi worked faultlessly, the bathroom was bright and clean and the room had all the expected touches such as safe, tea and coffee facilities, mini-bar etc.
Breakfast was fresh, tasty and offered plenty of variety. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,12,17
237,Small problem brilliantly resolved! ,"Stayed in the Morrison Hotel on 14/12/17 and had a very enjoyable time! Our stay could have been hampered as we were given room 101 which is right on top of the function room where a christmas party was on until midnight. Before dinner, we contacted the front desk and informed them we were concerned about noise and needed to be up early for work. The team handled our issue very well. We were offered a room move or ear plugs and we were made to feel that we were not a nuisance. 

The lady Front Desk Supervisor moved us to the much quieter mezzanine floor and everything was great from then on.

Our waiter for our meal was friendly and attentive! 

All in all, it was a great stay!",5,2017,12,14
237,"Excellent location, good service but bathroom needs an update","A nice modern option in the center of Dublin. Beds are comfortable and housecleaning quick. Room was quiet as it faced the back, but bathroom feels old. Good WiFi. Lobby bar is nice and staff is helpful. A little pricy for what you get, but that seems to be an issue with Dublin in general. ",4,2017,12,13
237,"Great Value, Great Experience","The hotel is modern, very clean, great wifi, exceptionally good location (right on the river) and for the price its an incredible value. Room was 30 minutes late getting ready but staff was very friendly then and throughout the stay. And don't hesitate to get in-room dining. The food, timing, value and service were outstanding.",5,2017,12,13
237,Is this a Hilton,Like i read in other reviews other members i was not greeted as a Hilton Honors as they had problems with my reservations. The rooms are small and I was not given access to the nice rooms which they reserve for Hilton Honors members on the 4th floor. If you have a car it is a nightmare to get to this hotel as it is stuck in the middle of the Temple bar district and you can only drive one way.  Is this a new hotel to Hilton standards?.,2,2017,12,13
237,Dublin’s Best Hotel😎😎,I have just returned to the Kingdom of Kerry after another amazing stay at outstanding Morrison Hotel in Dublin. I have stayed here many times over the last few years and it’s about time I did a review on this mighty establishment👏🏻👏🏻 It’s location is unreal and the staff in all departments were the makings of our stay. From the reception staff to the restaurant staff in breakfast to the staff in the Morrison Bar & Grill all I can say is you were simply the best and the welcoming and friendly attitude you have is a credit to the training and advice that management instill within you all. Well done and keep up the good work. The variety of foods on offer at Breakfast has to be seen to be believed and so many staff on hand to help. I love to eat in the evenings in the Morrison Grill as the menu offers a very varied selection of all kinds of food and what a lovely staff led by the amazing Sarah. Keep up the good work. Another wonderful stay and we will be back soon. Paudie . Castleisland Co Kerry. December 2017.,5,2017,12,12
237,Location is perfect!!! ♥️♥️♥️,"Located at the Ormond quay street in Dublin and close to important things we wanted to see in this historic city. Very modern and clean hotel with good specious rooms. We enjoyed our stay very much at the Morrison and would love to go back one day.

NOTE: If you plan on visiting Dublin don't forget to carry umbrella with you 24/7 because it rains and then stops every 15 minutes. There are lot's of little shops everywhere and it seems that the big chains have not attacked Dublin so hard as they have done with the rest of Europe.",5,2017,12,10
237,Great Location...and Pretty Nice,My daughter and I each had a room here. It is very convenient to the Temple Bar area without the noise. They treat HHonors members to a very nice breakfast and upgrade. The service was excellent. My daughter's room had an issue with the patio door and they sent her up a drink as a token of apology. All of the employees truly seemed to care.,5,2017,12,10
237,Perfect location,"We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of November and had a really good experience. The hotel is perfectly placed to visit all the Dublin tourist areas but not in too busy an area. We stayed in an Executive room on the 4th floor which was a good size with a well appointed bathroom with good lighting. Breakfast was good with a variety of hot and cold food available.
All the hotel staff were great, very helpful and always had a smile. We had one minor issue which Darren sorted for us with great efficiency, he is a credit to the hotel.
The bar was a good place for a drink in the evening and the whole hotel was very welcoming. Would definitely stay here again if we returned to Dublin.",5,2017,12,08
237,"Fine Hotel, not great","If you're only staying for a night or two and want a clean place within walking distance of Temple Bar, Trinity College, Grafton St, or St. Stephen's Green then this is a great place. Very friendly and helpful staff.  If you're staying for an extended period and need a good nights sleep, explore other options. The beds were some of the hardest I have come across in a hotel and left a lot to be desired.  I had the misfortune of being on the first floor and near the elevator. I got some car doors, dumpsters, sirens, and noisy patrons throughout the nights. Not ideal if you have a choice.  Restaurant was mediocre. Good if you need a close bite, but wouldn't write home about it.",3,2017,12,06
237,"Large, Modern Rooms","We spent multiple nights at the Morrison.  Rooms are large and clean and they provide wash cloths.  The light switches are definitely wonky and URL ports never worked.  The purple lights WILL go out once you know the trick!  Annoyances:  the light switch to bathroom is outside so it wakes up your companion if you don’t travel with a flashlight, the doorstop in the middle of the bathroom floor is aggravating, and the hair dryer requires a power button be pressed the entire time.  Housekeeping walked in on us two different times before we could get to the door.  The restaurant does decent food if you don’t want to go out.",3,2017,12,05
237,Front/ reception area,Extremely helpful and friendly front desk staff. Very willing to recommend places to go in Dublin and how to get there. The map provided was really a good one to use in Dublin. Nice restaurants and well done remodel. ,5,2017,12,03
237,Morrison hotel Dublin,"Great hotel in the heart of Dublin, we have been staying here for the past 4 years during the working week and as such you want it to feel like Home. The staff are great and nothing is too much trouble. The customer service comes from the General Manager to the most junior of the team. Great hotel - if you are in Dublin this has to be the place ",5,2017,12,03
237,Top Class,"We stayed here for two nights in late November, the hotel is lovely the staff are excellent and the standard of the hotel is superb, get a suite if you can, they are huge. We have our own full-size Christmas tree in ours!!

You can't fault the hotel, the surroundings, everything is excellent. We had a slight problem one morning at breakfast and the Deputy Manager (Paul Joy) went out of his way to sort it out for us even though we were not making a fuss.

Thoroughly enjoyable experience and we would definitely return, next time we would like to try and eat in the restaurant which unfortunately we did not manage this time.",5,2017,12,02
237,Great stay at the Morrison hotel!,We enjoyed our stay at the Morrison. We travelled with our 11 month old and the hotel was so gracious to provide us with a travel crib. It helped us by saving extra luggage on the trip. The hotel is centrally located and we found ourselves walking everywhere (which was perfect when traveling with a stroller). Our whole family stayed in different rooms and everyone loved our experience. We hope to visit again!!,5,2017,12,01
237,Vacation in DUblin,Ideal location.  Exemplary service and staff.  The room was spacious and modern.  Very clean.  Comfortable beds.  Great climate control.  The bar was lively.  Room service and food was fair priced and delicious.  The breakfast was good with good service.,5,2017,11,30
237,Very comfortable and great location. Front desk staff was very friendly and breakfast was great.,"We were for a weekend in Dublin and we found this to be a perfect location- close to Temple Bar but not in Temple Bar, just across the bridge. We walked a ton and walked from our hotel to Guinness and to Kilmainham, although that is a solid 45 minute walk along the river. We also walked to Trinity. So well located, and quiet. Breakfast was very plentiful, with a choice of main courses. Front desk staff was helpful and friendly and we found the rooms to be quiet and comfortable.",5,2017,11,30
237,Great Stay!!!,"We stayed at the Morrison this past November, 2017 in the penthouse suite, and it truly made that portion of the trip.  Amazing views of the River LIffey and Temple Bar and easy walking to every where from Fleet St, to Christ Church, Trinity College, and Guiness.  The room was of course pricey, but the wrap around balcony and rain head shower was amazing, and the spaciousness of the room elevated the comfort.  Definitely do it if you will pay more for a really great room.",5,2017,11,28
237,brilliant from pre-arrival to checkout! 5*,"brilliant stay, had emailed before hand and had prompt replies from a member of staff, i was asking for early checkin and was told on arrival that a room had been clean and held for my arrival which was excellent! and the service throughout was so attentive, everyone constantly asking if i needed anything or they could help which was amazing! we had a problem with the air con in the room not getting warm enough and the gentleman that works nights promptly brought us up a portable heater, such great service, i will 100% stay again! ",5,2017,11,28
237,Great hotel in Dublin,"Had a super stay at The Morrison. 
We stayed here because we really enjoyed earlier visits at Doubletree by Hilton and like before was we not disappointed. 
Really friendly and helpful staff, the location is perfect and the standard in the rooms are perfect as well, also very comfortable beds.  
We also received an upgrade of the room because of my birthday which also was very appreciated. 
I would definitely recommend The Morrison when travel to Dublin and Doubletree by Hilton in general.",5,2017,11,27
237,Great Hotel!,This service at this Doubletree is better than a super high end hotel. Darrin at the front desk goes above and beyond to make you feel welcome. He had great suggestions for activities for us to do! The rest of the staff does a great job too. Perfect location!,5,2017,11,25
237,"Great Location, Slow Check In ","Just checked in to this hotel and thought I would share our experience. (Originally we were going to stay at the Conrad but decided on the Double Tree for its excellent location) 

As a Diamond Member currently down to a Gold Member as i have not traveled much this year compared to others. I usually expect nothing but great customer service from any Hilton Property. 

Check in was definitely not speedy. As I arrived My husband and I were there only guests checking in. I provided the front desk clerk my name advising of our reservation. she walked over to a box and pulled our info with a pack of keys. When another front desk clerk removed what i assume would have been our room keys and had our front desk clerk re check us in. She took all our information again which took roughly 10-15 minutes. While we waited we were also advised they were out of cookies so we would not be receiving any.  

Once she completed our check in we were handed our keys and sent on our way. I originally booked a king guest room. Expecting an upgrade or a room in the Honors Floor as we always do at any Hilton property we stay at. When we walked in our room which is on the 2nd floor. Not the honors floor which is floor 4.  We realized we had no upgrade and no view whatsoever. Making us wonder if we had actually been downgraded from the original room we were suppose to have been given. 

The room is fairly small with a king size bed a desk and chair. The restroom is very small with a bathtub. (I was really hoping for a walk in shower).  At first I was upset at no coffee pot. But then as i was unpacking realized the missing coffee pot was hiding  in the closet. 

After we returned from dinner there was a tub of gummies with a welcome card which was nice to snack on before bedtime. 

If you are looking for a hotel near all the main attractions. This is it. You can’t get a better location than this. ",4,2017,11,25
237,Excellent Stay,"Fabulous hotel, fabulous staff.  overall we had a gorgeous stay and would highly recommend this hotel, in fact we have already and are looking to book again in January with friends.  We couldn't of asked for a more relaxed and perfect stay!",5,2017,11,24
237,Great Hotel  -  within walking distance to pub area,"What a pleasant surprise when you check in.... you get a warm cookie !!
When you check out they ask if you want a bottle of water for your trip   -  I have NEVER experience such service before so no need to say anything between check in and check out was equally fantastic :) 

Great friendly staff,  large rooms and modern decor.   Good breakfast area and there is a good bar as well and small conference rooms. 

You are withing a 10 min walk for the pub area - just across the bridge. Super location in the heart of Dublin.  
This is a place I would go back to any day.",5,2017,11,22
237,Lovely hotel,"This was a really lovely welcoming hotel in the heart of Dublin City centre. Everything was very comfortable, just a bit noisy but you can expect that from being near temple bar. Lovely food and great service. ",4,2017,11,22
237,Best in Dublin....,"This hotel ticks ALL the boxes for Location, Quality, Friendliness, Ambience and Cocktails....! Give this one a try and I guarantee you won't stay anywhere else when back in Dublin.... Parking in Jervis Street Carpark and a 1 minute walk and you are at the hotel Lobby....Perfect..",5,2017,11,21
237,One night ,"Great hotel, stayed here for just one night with a friend of mine.
We had a twin room. 
Location is excellent, 5 min walk to city centre.
Parking was available next door to the hotel and very reasonably priced.
Check in was effortless and staff were very friendly. 
Room itself was beautifully finished and extremely clean.
Really enjoyed our stay here.
Breakfast was also excellent. 
Would be very happy to stay here again. ",5,2017,11,21
237,modern hotel in great location,"This is a contemporary hotel in a great location, walking distance to major sights in Dublin.  The room was more spacious than expected and it was newer and clean. Restaurant food was good.  I would stay here again.",5,2017,11,20
237,Quiet and Comfy,"In the heart of Dublin, but quiet. Everything I needed to enjoy the weekend. I forgot my toothbrush and was given a dental kit. Room service took a bit longer to arrive, but they called to apologize. Loved the romantic poetry on the walls! A great, easy stay.",5,2017,11,20
237,Fabulous staff!,"We had an overnight stay here as our usual hotel was fully booked.  Our room was big and spacious with everything you would need.  We felt the room was a bit chilly on arrival and Darren sent maintenance up.  There were no faults with the heating - It was just a case of waiting for the room to heat up (it was a big room) however in the interim Darren sent up blankets, hot chocolate, an Irish coffee, nibbles and a heater! The room is big so it took a while but an hour or so later we were lovely and cosy. The breakfast is excellent - I’ve stayed in many hotels but would say the breakfast at Morrison’s has been one of the best.  The hotel is very central to everything, the staff are extremely helpful and I can’t fault it.  Will definitely be back.  It will be our hotel of choice now. ",5,2017,11,19
237,Exceptional hotel,"Exceptional hotel very clean rooms and extremely comfortable bed Room service was amazing best I’ve had. 
Staff we all very help pleasant and nothing was too much effort would definitely recommend hotel",5,2017,11,17
237,Fantastic Staff and Location,"The location of the Morrison is fantastic as it is right across from the Temple Bar area, Trinity College (Book of Kells), Dublin Castle and St. Patrick's Cathedral.  We were able to visit all of these areas by just walking across the bridges that go over the river.  The bridges are very short to walk across.  The concierge at the Morrision went over and beyond helping us pinpoint areas within the walking distance.  He brought over a map and went over all the areas we were questioning.  As for the hotel itself, I would say it was modern and adequate.  Not sure if we would have stayed had we not used points as it is a bit pricey for rooms.",5,2017,11,15
237,Superb everything for my VIP corporate group,"Excellent stay, outstanding service from staff. So friendly, efficient, responsive and knowledgeable. Food better than most hotels I use internationally. 
Conference facilities and rooms exceptional. 
Will be back with more corporate groups when Dublin is the destination. ",5,2017,11,14
237,"Super Hotel, Location and Service","Very good location right across the river from Temple Bar. Staff was helpful at every turn - front desk, housekeeping and restaurant. Breakfast was great. Recommend highly for business and leisure alike. Will stay again.",5,2017,11,14
237,Some of the best staff I've ever seen in any hotel,"My husband and I just got home yesterday and spent 6 nights at the Morrison.  We attended a wedding in another part of Ireland and decided to make a vacation out of it and visit Dublin.  My husband is a gold Hilton member, and prefers to stay in Hilton brand whenever possible.  Beforehand I reached out to the hotel with a ton of questions, esp about the wooden floor jr suite (which we booked) and requested a quiet room with a good view, etc.    I have bad allergies and usually reach out to hotels beforehand to make sure I book the most updated, etc room so not to have allergy issues.  

We arrived last Sunday and were given a beautiful suite on the 3rd floor.  I have to admit I was a bit cranky and there was a slight issue with the room.  Edit at the front desk was amazing and showed me a few other rooms, but we decided to stay with our initial room ( which actually was the best one).  Sorry Edit for being so difficult, your patience with me all with a smile was amazing.

The room ended up being perfect for us and we looked forward to coming back exhausted to this well kept, clean and comfortable room.  Also, the Morrison is in the perfect location for touring Dublin.  We walked everywhere, I mean everywhere from  the hotel and never once needed public transportation or a taxi.  

As far as the food, we only ate breakfast here and OMG, delicious.  Everything was grea,t but  the eggs benedict in particular had to be the best I've ever had.  We really loved talking with Aneta, a very warm and friendly person.  She helped make breakfast one of out most enjoyable meals.  

Also, a thank you to Paul Joy.  I contacted him beforehand with some requests and the rooms he chose for us was perfect.  

The whole time I don't think there was even 1 person at the hotel that wasn't both professional and friendly.  Whoever is in charge of hiring is doing a great job.  Nothing was ever too much trouble and I'm amazed how professional and caring Edit was all while I was complaining initially.  Thank you to everyone. 

I noticed reading reviews initially complaints about the mattress being too firm.  The mattress is on a solid platform and feels firm but we found it comfortable. No complaints there. 

If management is reading this I have 2 suggestions.  It would be nice to have a clock next to the bed (at least I like one and most hotels in the states have this) and maybe purchase some non feather pillows that are a bit softer.  In the scheme of things this is minor and by no way affected our stay.

Just a quick thanks to everyone at the Morrison for making our stay perfect.

237,Wonderful stay,We loved staying at the Morrison! The staff was so friendly and helpful. Our room was spacious and had a huge bathroom. This was the nicest hotel we stayed at in all of Europe in our opinion. We would love to come again soon!,5,2017,11,05
237,AMAZING STAFF! S/O to Sara & William,This was one of the best hotel stays I have ever had. Breakfast every morning was delightful - although I must suggest that they add beans to the full Irish breakfast!! But overall the experience was absolutely delightful. The two employees that went the extra mile to make my stay great were Sara and William. Both of them greeted me with a smile every day. Sara was a delight to see in the mornings at the HALO and William was a comfort to see at night! William gave my friends and I warm cookies every time we came back at night. We wouldn't even have to speak - he would read our minds and know we wanted cookies! That is prime customer service. We LOVED our stay here.,5,2017,11,03
237,Modern hotel in Dublin City Centre,"This is a very modern hotel by Dublin standards. We stayed for a weekend to celebrate our wedding anniversary and had a very enjoyable weekend. Lovely modern rooms, close to a lot of amenities in the city. Staff very good as well.",5,2017,11,03
237,Amazing Hotel,I've stayed at this hotel a few times and it never disappoints. The location is perfect- just across the Liffey from Temple Bar. It's surprisingly quiet at night with excellent amenities. The staff is top notch and incredibly helpful.,5,2017,11,02
237,Great Location & Still Within Walking Distance of Temple Bar,"Cool, modern, Euro-vibe hotel.  The location is across the river from Temple Bar so you can easily walk to the district and just as easily miss all the volume of the Temple Bar district.

We were treated like royalty here.  They went out of there way to be of assistance from putting postage on post cards to delivering ""chips"" to our room at midnight.  The staff is a great mix of young, international people who could not have been friendlier or more customer oriented.

The room was clean and well designed.  We had a fully stocked refrigerator as well.  The breakfast area was amazing with an unlimited buffet for 20 euros per person.  Unfortunately we are not huge breakfast eaters.  They allowed us to eat ala carte which served our purposes.

The only issue I had was the height of the toilet was designed for a leprechaun.  Other than that, we were very pleased with our stay, and I would certainly look forward to going back.  It was just that good.",5,2017,11,01
237,Excellent experience,"What a stunning hotel in the centre of the capital. Beautiful room, ,great staff and dining experience was superb. There is no area in which I could find fault. I would highy recommend this hotel to those visiting Dublin.",5,2017,11,01
237,This hotel is a find,"We thought it was perfect for our three nights in Dublin.  Loved the staff.  We could not have been treated better.  They were super helpful with all of our questions and we had many! We followed all of their suggestions and had a great time in Dublin.  Their breakfasts were very good, you could have the buffet or order off the menu.  The location was near the Temple Bar area and it was very easy to catch the Hop on Hop off bus from the hotel.The bus from the airport dropped us off about 4 or 5 blocks from the hotel. It was an easy walk even in the rain.  The rooms were not too small, the bathroom was a good size.  The rooms were clean and the bed was very comfortable.  It costs about 30 euros to take a taxi to the airport and is about a 20 or 25 minute ride.  The bus was 7 euros each.",5,2017,10,31
237,Three days in Dublin,"Spent three days in Dublin with my brother. The hotels is very well located across the river from Temple bar. The room size was excellent for a European hotel, very clean. the staff were exceedingly friendly and kind. I would recommend.l",5,2017,10,31
237,Another Amazing Stay,Another amazing stay at Morrison Hotel. Room was beautiful and check in very efficient. Loved the cookies. All the staff we encountered were friendly and polite. Special thanks to Paul Joy who made our stay so special. Nothing too much trouble for the staff. Will deffo be back again.,5,2017,10,31
237,Basic but nicely done great food,"When I was researching the hotels in Dublin a lot seemed quite dated or needed a refit /some attention.  I wanted to be central so the Morrison was the only one that seemed to have good reviews.  The hotel is just across the bridge from temple bar.  The hotel itself is nice its quite compact but for me it was a business trip so this was perfect.  The room was very clean nice new bathroom, everything you want - nothing outstanding but perfectly acceptable.  Where it did come into its own was with the food.  I returned back late and had room service which was really very good I was very impressed with the quality of the food.  At breakfast it was exactly the same - a small amount of options but everything was very good, nice quality and a little of everything you might want.  Lovely coffee and the service was amazing.  This was far from the standard Hilton service which is perfunctory but friendly and really helpful.  I would definitely recommend staying here if you are spending time in Dublin and especially if the hotel is not the central part of the holiday the views from some of the rooms is a little grim.",4,2017,10,30
237,Hotel stay experience,The morrison has always been an hotel of choice for us from Temenos. We were well looked after as always and the service was second to none. I will always recommend to vistors to use the Morrison when visiting Dublin either on holidays or business trip. The morrison is also well located and easily accessable by private and public transport,5,2017,10,30
237,"Excellent hotel, great staff, great location","The Morrison Doubletree is a winner all around. The staff was so kind, helpful, accommodating, generous, and made us feel right at home. They had left a fruit basket in my room, and some finger desserts, and the whole experience made me feel cherished, welcome, and really special. They made us feel like they were really happy to have us stay there. The rooms were very chic, boutique-like, interesting furniture, and they were clean, cozy, and the bed was so comfortable. In addition, if that wasn't enough, the location is stellar. Just a quick walk across the water to the Temple Bar area, and Trinity college. I never had an opportunity to try the restaurant, because my stay was really short, but I would love to come back in the future and stay longer. Morrison Hotel, thank you for your hospitality, and your generosity!!",5,2017,10,30
237,Safe and comfortable with thoughtful touches,Stayed two nights. A safe and comfortable base while exploring the city and attending a concert. Decor really nice throughout. Nice touches in the room include an umbrella (well it is The Emerald Isle!) and a plug socket near the full length mirrored wardrobe (drying hair). Also I borrowed an adapter from reception and they even had earplugs (lifesavers!) drinks very expensive in bar with surprising lack of atmosphere (note to entertainments manager: a loud band does not equal atmosphere) did not have breakfast  due to price and plenty of good options nearby. Had dinner out too so cannot comment at all on the food. Would consider staying again though would not use the bar next time. ,4,2017,10,29
237,"For a business hotel, this was perfect.","The hotel is modern and well appointed. It is centrally located, walking distance to Temple Bar area and the other tourist destinations like Guinness and Jameson. A little pricy, but you get what you pay for.",5,2017,10,26
237,Stylish and a great location,"The hotel is conveniently located by the river. Easy to walk across a pedestrian bridge to restaurants, pubs and shopping. 
Hotel restaurant is good. 
The staff were always kind and friendly.
Hotel room was stylish and spotlessly clean. Great bathroom too.
I would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,10,25
237,A great short meeting venue,"This is really one of the best coffee table informal meeting spots. Great staff. Really good choice of coffees with truly excellent little sweet/buiscuit things. Good location. Nice atmosphere and good value.
Check it out.",4,2017,10,25
237,"No business Center, poor customer service",No where to pen a laptop in/near lobby. Front desk staff does not understand Hilton Honors system.  Check-in staff matching my name to another person with a different middle name a different address. Even showed me other person's address (privacy concerns).,3,2017,10,25
237,Great hotel in Dublin,"Lovely stay at DoubleTree by Hilton in Dublin Very good facilities, clean and comfortable room, lovely dinner in the restaurant, lovely friendly and efficient staff - thanks for a good experience It was a business trip, but made very pleasant indeed by the hotel",4,2017,10,25
237,Stay at the Hilton Morrison Ireland,"Everything about this hotel was perfect, from check-in to check-out.  The food and service was excellent.  Easy walking distance to Temple Bar area, as well as shopping, multiple restaurants and tourist sites.  When we arrived our rooms were ready for us, and after a long flight we were given warm cookies.  Appreciate the cleanliness of the hotel and the environmental friendly lights/temp controls.",5,2017,10,25
237,Sisters long weekend,Stayed at the Morrison in October for a long weekend. The location was pretty ideal. It is right on the river with a shopping area a few blocks away and the Temple bar area right across the bridge. The hotel staff is very helpful and the breakfast was exceptional. Like most European hotels the rooms are smaller but because the hotel is more modern it seemed very clean.,4,2017,10,24
237,Great location for the city center in Dublin.,"We stayed here for one night before we took a tour around the island. We took a taxi from the airport to the hotel and it cost about 40 Euros. We hit a lot of traffic in the morning, so at off times it wouldn't cost as much. The hotel had a very modern feel. The rooms were average size, clean and comfortable. We had arrived from the United States, and were hoping we might be able to get into our room early, as we have in other European Countries before, but that was not the case here. They did take our phone number and did call us once our rooms were ready -about 4 hours later. We were allowed to change clothes and they took our bags for us so we could go walk around the city. The Temple Bar area is a very short walk over the River Liffey, where there are numerous pubs and quaint stores. Very close to shopping and Trinity College. We were able to walk to one of the ""Hop on, Hop off"" bus stops. They had a very nice Buffett breakfast as well, where you could choose from a hot breakfast or just a continental breakfast. The staff was very helpful and friendly and offered suggestions for places around the area to eat.",4,2017,10,24
237,Superb professional but friendly service as a Wedding Venue,"Our son was married at City Hall and their Reception was at The Morrison. We stayed there for 4 nights in total.
I cannot emphasise enough how well the staff treated the wedding guests, the bridal party and those who used the Hotel as their place to stay.
The service was personal but still professional, friendly without over-familiarity and pitched perfectly to the spirit of the day.
Mass-catering for 150 guests is never easy, but they managed to pace the meal perfectly to allow plenty of conversation, but also to produce >100 fillet steaks perfectly cooked to order. Amazing.
When Hurricane Ophelia prevented some of us departing, they were pro-active in checking flights and holding rooms for those of us marooned an extra night.

I've got to say that, when my son and (now) daughter-in-law said that they had chosen a city-centre hotel as their Reception venue, I had visions of an impersonal, production-line,airless subterranean venue. I could not have been more wrong.",5,2017,10,17
237,"Morrison, on the Quay and a lovely stay","My travels to Dublin for business coincided neatly with the arrival of downgraded Hurricane Ophelia, a blustery bit of weather business that set off a national holiday. Staying at the friendly and chic Morrison Hotel on the Quay, and just across the river from Temple Bar, put me in fine position for walking and for finding many open cafes and restaurants while the rest of the city hunkered down for the Apocalypse.
I expect small rooms in European hotels, and my room at the Morrison did not disappoint in that regard.  But it was very nicely appointed and comfortable. My neverending complaint, the windows do not open. WTF? 
Overall the Mortison is lovely, with super friendly staff who seem to truly enjoy hospitality. The food is good, too. I ate various meals there during my stay and enjoyed them all. And the wi fi works quite nicely thank you.
The  Mortison is a damn fine hotel. I woukd happily stay here again.",4,2017,10,16
237,Very Nice Stay at The Morrison,"I enjoyed my stay at the Morrison. Staff is very nice and helpful. The hotel has very good housekeeping; bathroom was spotless and that's an important item in my book.  Breakfast was good; I like that the fruit was offered in prepared cups; (sometimes with a help-yourself-bowl) people pick out all the grapes or berries for themself, and all that is left are the apples and honeydew.  Location is good, too.  Easy access to key attractions in Dublin.  ",4,2017,10,15
237,"Decent Hotel, Great Location",My husband and I were in Dublin for two nights earlier this year and stayed at the Morrison. The hotel itself was nice and our room was large and comfortable. Not our favorite hotel by any means but the location was perfect for visiting the attractions.,4,2017,10,15
237,Great stay,"This hotel was in a great location for our short visit in Dublin. Located just across the river from the Temple bar area with easy walking to all parts of the city and the train. Rooms were large, updated, clean, and well appointed. Bathroom was huge and very clean. The only downside for me was the bed which was like sleeping on a plank. We included breakfast in our room price and ate there both mornings. The food was excellent, service was great and they even made my husband a glass of iced tea!  The concierge was very helpful in guiding us for a train outing which we enjoyed. All in all a great stay. Gave it a 4 only for the bed. ",4,2017,10,15
237,Doubletree Excellent,The Morrison Doubletree is conveniently located in the city centre.  The room was excellent (river view!).  The hotel staff were professional.  The Irish breakfast was great.  Close enough to walk to all the major sights in Dublin but away from the nightlife noise of the Temple Bar District.  This is not an inexpensive stay but worth the money.,5,2017,10,14
237,"Amazing staff, clean and comfy rooms, and great breakfast","My friend and I came to Ireland for a much needed girls trip and getaway. We arrived to the hotel rather early and our room wasn't quite ready. I am currently breastfeeding and needed to pump. They allowed me to use an empty guest room for privacy and comfort. Not only did they give me a place to pump, but my plugin required a transformer and their maintenance staff went and purchased one for me and made sure my pump was going to turn on before he left(I paid him for the transformer plug). So, very helpful and insisted that I let him know if anything went wrong with it or had anymore problems. Geez! So sincere and considerate. 

 Our trip turned sour a couple of days into it due to some health issues that my friend experienced. The hotel staff was MORE than helpful, considerate, understanding, and genuinely concerned about her. They definitely made a very bad and scary situation that much easier for us. 

When I visit ireland again one day, I will be returning to this hotel! 

",5,2017,10,14
237,Good location and stylish - but needs improvement,"We stayed here as a couple during a congress. As Hilton Diamonds with 60+ nights annually at this chain, we usually get some extra attention and an upgrade. We e-mailed in advance to let the hotel know that we were two people staying but got only one set of slippers and a single bathrobe. The shower gel was not replenished during our three-night stay. We received a welcoming letter but this was only addressed to the male in the couple despite previous e-mail emphasizing that we were there as a couple. We got a room at a higher floor but no upgrade per se, as the hotel was obviously fully booked.

The hotel is very stylish and modern and the location was good for our purposes. The breakfast spread is somewhat bland with a lack of vegetables and we had to seat ourselves the first day and received no menu, nor any information regarding the à la carte offerings. The staff apologized the next day and did what the could to make our stay as good as possible and everybody we talked to were very helpful, except the person checking us in. He completely disregarded questions and seemed confused and inexperienced. 

With better recognition of loyalty (including e-mail communications) and some green alternatives for breakfast, this could be a great alternative in Dublin but we will most probably choose another hotel next time.",3,2017,10,13
237,Lovely experience ,Great rooms great staff . Highly recommended. We had a lovely stay here and would definitely recommend this hotel . It’s a bit expensive but if you can afford it then go for it . The room were lovely and staff made us feel very welcome . ,4,2017,10,13
237,Lovely place with Excellent Customer Service!,"So, I visited the Morrison in September and decided to return in October with a friend as part of a sightseeing trip to 3 locations in Ireland (Kinsale, Killarney and Dublin). I received a very nice email from Jane Bridge welcoming me in advance of my return. First, let me say that the Morrison is a very nice, updated hotel and part of the Hilton brand that I just love. It is located on the Quay not far from the Ha'Penny bridge with easy access to O'Connell Street, Temple Bar and all the other areas that Dublin is famous for.  We were upgraded to the 4th floor (room 406) which is part of the Hilton Honors program.  The room included a safe, slippers, bath robes and ironing board, full mini bar coffee/tea.  Paul Joy, another general manager at the hotel was kind enough to send up a hand written welcome note with a gift welcoming us back to the hotel. Breakfast offered us the option to order from the menu or select from a variety of breads, scones, and other buffet options. I was simply amazed at how friendly and accommodating the staff were from reception, to the restaurant and cleaning staff - a smile was always found! On our last morning, we discovered that one of the gifts my friend purchased still had the security tag on it so we decided that after breakfast we would have to walk back to the shop to have it removed. We ran into Jane Bridge as she visited our table to ask how we were doing and shared the story with her. Imagine our surprise when she immediately offered to send one of the staff to the shop to have the tag removed so we could finish packing without being rushed! I was amazed that she not only offered but the task was taken care of by Derek in a very short period of time.  I appreciate the Hilton focus and particularly the efforts by Jane, Paul and Derek to provide such a high level of service to me and my friend during our visit to Dublin. Thank you so much for being so interested in making our stay enjoyable and stress free!  Roberto was also very kind and attentive as he waited on us for dinner at the Morrison Grill the night before we left.  Wonderful location, and I can't say enough about the staff at the Morrison! Thank you again!!",5,2017,10,13
237,Loved this hotel and close to Temple Bar,This is a fabulous hotel and so close to the Temple Bar area as well as many of the famous attractions in Dublin.  The staff was very helpful and the rooms clean and bed was very comfortable.   I will definitely be staying here again.,5,2017,10,13
237,Great Stay,"My husband and I loved staying at the Morrison.  Our room was large, modern and very well kept.  The hotel's location made it easy to walk to shopping, restaurants, pubs and museums.  My husband was working during the week so after we enjoyed breakfast, I would talk to Darren or Jason to help plan my day around the city.  They were so helpful and knowledgeable that I always have an awesome day of sightseeing activities. I have to say that the staff at the hotel was amazing.  Everyone was kind and helpful.",5,2017,10,11
237,Perfect,"Everything about our stay in the hotel and Dublin was perfect! The location is ideal for the city centre but away from noisy Temple Bar evenings! The staff were friendly and professional. Loved it here, can't wait to go back.",5,2017,10,11
237,"A great place to stay in Dublin, Ireland","right in the heart of things, we got the Dublin Pass as transport from the airport - then as a Hop on Hop off to see Dublin. From this hotel probably did not need the Hop on Hop Off as everything was a 20 to 30 minute walk.",5,2017,10,10
237,Beautiful,"What a lovely hotel. The rooms are amazing, large and very clean.  We stopped here for one night and i wish we could have stayed longer. The staff are wonderful and so helpful. Highly recommended. It us expensive but if you can afford it then do it. A short walk from temple bar and the main attractions.",5,2017,10,09
237,Fantastic Staff,"We arrived very early one morning and our room was ready and the staff pleasant. Our room was at the end of a long hallway, noisy and we did not feel comfortable! Manager Jason was very gracious and moved us to a much more desirable, larger room overlooking the river! He also provided a fruit and sweets basket that were very much welcomed! Jason made our day and our trip.
Daren the concierge was the best I have ever come across.  He was very knowledgeable, but even more gracious, kind, professional and very warm as a person....Id like to take then both with me.
Thanks Jason and Daren, our trip would not have been the same without you!",5,2017,10,06
237,Perfect for our needs,"This hotel was perfectly located (close enough to Temple Bar to be an easy walk to touristy areas - while far enough way not to be loud).

Rooms were clean and well appointed.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was outstanding (buffet and cooked to order choices were included in our rate - and everything we had was delicious).",5,2017,10,05
237,Six out of Five Stars!,"We had the time of our lives in Dublin and this hotel was a big reason for that.  First, the concierge, Darren, was the epitome of helpful.  He shared a wealth of knowledge on what to do and see while in the country as well as valuable insight on the best ways to navigate from one location to another.  Whenever we had requests about anything to make the stay in our room more comfortable, he took care of it in a flash.  This guy was simply awesome!!!

The hotel itself is very modern, very comfortable and perfectly located for walking to a lot of nearby tourist sites.  The food in the restaurant was good and all the staff was friendly and helpful.  We're especially thankful to the front desk person who got us into our room as soon as we arrived.  She'll never know how much being able to immediately lay down and recover from the transatlantic flight meant to us.

Speaking of the room, it was HUGE!!!

If you want a good view, be sure to request a room that faces the river.  It's something to behold at night.",5,2017,10,05
237,In the Heart of Excellence,"A fantastic spot, especially for Hilton Honors members on Floor 4.  Plenty of room, comfy large bed, and a hot shower...our recipe for excellence.  The concierge (Double D, you know who you are!) was top end for suggestions, directions, and local lore.  The only shortcoming, in our opinion, was the breakfast.  It was average, especially for the price, and the friendliness exhibited throughout the rest of the hotel wasn't quite the same.  Lastly, the location is close to almost everything and there's long-term parking only a block away.",4,2017,10,04
237,Pleasant stay,Very pleasant hotel with a city centre location. Spacious bar and lounge/dining area. Quiet and un assuming entrance and lobby during my stay. would recommend this hotel in Dublin. staff very pleasant and helpful.,5,2017,10,04
237,Great hotel in a great location,"Was visiting Dublin on a short trip.  I chose the hotel because it was located near Jameson's Distillery and Temple Bar.  The hotel was very nice and right on the Liffey river.  The room was very spacious, and it included most of the amenities that a typical American hotel would have, which is rare in Europe.  I would definitely stay again.",5,2017,10,04
237,Perfect stay,"Everything at the Morrison was perfect; I could not have asked for a nicer stay. I would be happy to stay again, and would suggest the property to others. The staff was excellent and so kind, and the property recently redone and well cared for and very clean.",5,2017,10,03
237,Nice place - avoid a couple of things however next time,"There have been no Diamond benefits, although me and hubby are both Diamond members. Reserved 3 rooms for our family travel. No Lounge and invisible Diamond benefits. Rooms to the inner yard where really very quiet (insist of these) and were very well designed and equipped. Special cudos to the entire service staff at breakfast - you were perfect and handling everything greatly !!!",4,2017,10,03
237,Marvelous Morrison,"Stayed here recently after our son's wedding in County Cork and it was delightful. The location is perfect, the room was great and there is a terrific restaurant space/bar. The front desk was incredibly welcoming. My only issue was that for whatever reason, I had to leave my room after 2 days despite having booked it for three. That said, not sure if I got an upgrade as a Diamond member initially for 2 days and then had to move or if they simply overpromised my room. I had booked 2 rooms (one for us and one for my daughter), a king with a view (booked for 3 nights) and a king (booked for 2 nights). Regardless, the staff is excellent and we will stay there again on our next visit, whenever that might be.",4,2017,10,02
237,Great location,"The Morrison offers the most central location of Hiltons in Dublin.  It's very close to Temple Bar and an easy walk to most of the tourist attractions in Dublin.

The rooms are small and other than the bed, don't offer many places to sit (there is a desk and desk chair).  We were on the back of the building.  I would imagine rooms on the other side (toward the Liffey) get more street noise.  The bathroom was relatively large considering the small size of the room.  I found teh bed to be very comfortable and the environmental control for the room was great.

The only American style outlet was in the bathroom (a shaver plug, so no grounding).  International chains should probably either install outlets to serve American plugs or have USB outlets for cell phones.

The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful and made things work in the lobby.  This was particularly important in terms of getting people cued into taxis when things got busy.

The breakfast was excellent and, again, the staff in the breakfast room were friendly and helpful.",4,2017,10,02
237,"Great Location, Great Service",We were pampered from arrival to departure. Very nice room with comfortable bed. Breakfast buffet was full of delicious choices and the staff ready to bring anything you wanted. The location allowed us to walk everywhere.,5,2017,10,02
237,Over priced room. Bed was way too hard. Stains on the bench and tub was gross. Handle on bathroom fell off.,"Will not return to this hotel. Overpriced for the quality. Location is good, but everything else fell short. Bed was way too hard and uncomfortable. It was hot and smelly in the room. The tub was gross. There was a big stain on the furniture we were supose to sit on in the room. Such a turn off.",2,2017,10,01
237,Another great stay,We decided on a night out in Dublin for our 21st wedding anniversary and booked into The Morrison. We have stayed here on a few occasions and have always had a great time. We received a very warm welcome and check in was quick and without any hassle.  We were even given an extra cookie for our son who had accompanied us but was not staying. Room 224 was lovely with decent aircon and a very comfortable bed. As it was our anniversary we were presented with a pretty dessert plate. We didn't eat dinner in the hotel but popped into the bar for a quick cocktail before bed. Breakfast is served until midday and with no feeling that you are being rushed even if you choose to eat about 11.40am. There is plenty of choice and a great selection of hot and cold foods. On hearing that it was our anniversary our server Agnes(?) brought us out glasses of Bucks Fizz. Had another chat with Violetta(?) on the reception desk as we were checking out. Staff were all so friendly and efficient and added to our stay. We will definitely return soon.,5,2017,10,01
237,Perfect wedding day!,"We had our wedding reception at the Morrison and wanted to thank all of the staff for making it a truly memorable day.

We live abroad so had to arrange everything from far away but thanks to the excellent staff, everything went perfectly.    The venue itself is huge - you get your own entrance on the quays and a private courtyard leading to a lovely room for the drinks reception.   The main function room also leads off the courtyard so there is a great feeling of space - all of the guests raved about it.   From the very start the service was excellent; efficient without being too intrusive.  Everyone loved the food - a lot of people commented that it was the best wedding food they had ever had.   The excellent service continued all through the night and everyone had a fantastic time. 

As for the staff during the rest of our stay, again, they were excellent.   It was nice that everyone seemed to know who we were, who our parents were, and went out of their way for us.   We were upgraded, given photographs and all of these touches really made our stay.   The rooms are clean and modern and very comfortable.   We had 20 rooms booked out and everyone loved it.   The breakfast is also very good.   

I wouldn’t hesitate in recommending the Morrison as a wedding venue and also a lovely, central hotel from which to explore Dublin.

Colin and Colin",5,2017,10,01
237,Great Stay!,"We had a wonderful stay at The Morrison Hotel in Dublin.   It was in a good location, within walking distance to the places we wanted to get to.   We ate in the restaurant and it was amazing!   The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.",5,2017,09,30
237,Great location,"The Morrison Hotel is conveniently located just across the river from the fun-filled Temple Bar area of Dublin.  Just across one of the foot bridges and you're there.  So, you can enjoy the night-life a short walk away and then return to the comfort and quiet of the hotel.
The decor is modern.  The rooms are clean and comfortable.  And the dining is good.  Thumbs up.",4,2017,09,29
237,Quirky hotel in heart of Dublin,"The decor is love it or hate it (not personally my taste but not a deal breaker). Check-in was smooth and they give you free cookies which were delicious. Nice tv in room and good room layout. I didn't explore the rest of hotel (gym, etc) so can't comment on those parts. 

Cons - Food was an issue.. Breakfast is a rip off (especially a la carte). Salmon cost £11 for literally 3 tiny slices (equivalent of £2 @ tescos down the road). Burgers from the restaurant were really dry and overcooked.",4,2017,09,29
237,Really Nice,"Great location right on the River Liffey near the Millennium Bridge - walk to everything.  Room on HH floor was very stylish, new and very nice - although small.  There was no view.  Nice bathroom with Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries and thick towels.  Nice shower in the tub - just be careful stepping out.  One of the nicest breakfast buffets with lots of choices. If you have to leave early just ask for a to go bag!  Our only problem was with the internet - it was extremely slow both days.  Reading email etc was difficult.  I tried to buy tickets to the Book of Kells twice and it never went through.  So we bought them at the door - then noticed we had three charges to our credit card.  I was able to get refunds from them after emailing about the charges.  I did inquire at the hotel desk twice about the internet as we encountered no other problems in three weeks of traveling.",4,2017,09,28
237,Great Hotel by the Liffey,Wonderful modern hotel on the banks of the Liffey. Great location. Extremely helpful staff. They go out of their way to make sure you have a great experience. Book a river view room for the added experience. Highly recommend the Morrison!,5,2017,09,28
237,Love this hotel except for....,"I do love this hotel. The staff, the location, the rooms, the extras, the beds...I'm a fan. But alas again I can't go the full 5 star review. No noise distractions from the Street but from other guest bedroom doors. My neighbours specifically coming in late and when those doors close you know it...bang! My only annoyance with this great hotel.",4,2017,09,28
237,You will not find a better hotel,"The location is perfect. You are on the ""correct"" side of the Liffey. By that I mean you can walk to Temple Bar over the bridge in two minutes, but you are away from the craziness. So when you are ready to go to sleep, you can. When you want to party you can! And since you are on this side of the Liffey, the airport is only 20 minutes away. Several cool bars, shops, and malls near the hotel. Staff is second to none and hotel has a very cool vibe.",5,2017,09,27
237,Service is second to none here!!,This place could not have done more for me and my family during our stay in August. From the Reservations desk who made sure me and my family could stay on the dates we wanted to front desk and the breakfast and dinner staff. They definitely know what 5 * customer service is. Great place would stay again soon.,5,2017,09,27
237,"Great location, small room","Great location, quiet on 4th floor.  Didn't much like decor of hotel - with edgy (but not especially meaningful) quotation on our room wall, and other areas with words on walls.  Our room was smaller than expected.  It was clean, well thought out, good lighting choices, lux bedding. Wifi was room specific with password, so it may have been safer.  Grateful for bathtub. Room also had a safe.  The stand out was the eggs benedict - made to order as part of breakfast buffet.  We both agreed they were a stand out.",4,2017,09,27
237,Two Night Stay While Sight-Seeing,"Giving this hotel a ""Very Good"" rating opposed to an ""Average"" because of how polite and professional they were.  One issue we experienced was that they had over-booked due to a wedding (on a Thursday night?) and the room we had originally booked was no longer available.  We opted to wait and were eventually put into a very tiny (New York-sized) room, directly across from the elevator bank.  Wife asked if we could be moved, took them a while, but they were able to accommodate our request. GREAT location in Dublin.  Beds are ROCK hard, and I mean ROCK HARD.",4,2017,09,26
237,Great location ,"You can't beat the location being across the bridge from Temple bar so it's quieter than being in the neighborhood. In house restaurant the Morrison does a great steak as we ate here the day we landed. Staff was excellent and took our phone number and called us as soon as the room was ready. Rooms are large, small fridge with mini-bar in the room. Walking distance to every single tourist site in Dublin. Only complaint is the shower head. You can't mount a rainhead shower to the wall it's suppose to rain down on you. 
Beds are on the firm side with both soft and firm pillows on the bed. Was a perfect stay. Thank you",5,2017,09,25
237,Short but Great Stay,Our stay only allowed us to be at the Morrison for one night being on transit to the US but we look forward to coming back and enjoy Dublin and the hotel Bar one evening.  The hotels breakfast staff was truly amazing. I would certainly return.,5,2017,09,25
237,Perfect location!,"Stayed here for a long weekend+ business. 
Perfect location-no less. Walking distance to just about everything. 
The room is not big but reasonable compared to other European chains. 
Breakfast is great and the staff is very friendly. 
Definitely recommended. ",4,2017,09,24
237,Perfect location with an upscale vibe,"We spent five nights here recently (on points). My S.O. is a Hilton gold so we had free breakfast daily in their restaurant which was fairly lavish. This hotel downplays its institutional Hilton identity in that it goes for a more unique and hip vibe with its fuchsia color scheme in the public areas; the modern furnishings in the room; and the signage throughout. The front desk clerks were very friendly and helpful, above and beyond the usual. All of the women serving breakfast were super friendly and attentive, always checking to make sure we had everything we needed. Arneta (not sure her name is spelled correctly) was particularly helpful. 

The hotel's location right on the Liffey River was perfect for sight-seeing. I highly recommend this hotel for pleasure or business. You can't go wrong.",5,2017,09,20
237,Dublin's Best!,"We could not have been more thrilled with our recent stay at The Morrison Hotel by Hilton! The location is absolutely ideal for all of your day trips and very handy to The a Temple Bar area and  walking distance to all of the sights including Guinness and Trinity College
The staff is superbly efficient and very helpful and very friendly 
The concierge Darren is your man to hook you up with everything from day trips to history of Dublin chats and Aneta will ensure your every breakfast is ideal each and every morning, we were impressed with the food, the bar, the meals and most of all the amazing staff! Thanks for the wonderful memories! Request rooms with a view of the River Liffey either 234,334 or 434! Beautifully appointed junior suites! ",5,2017,09,19
237,Stay at The Morrison Doubletree in Dublin,"The Morrison Doubletree in Dublin is ideally located next to public transportation, shopping, and famous pubs.  The hotel is attractively decorated, comfortable bed and bath, with a good food selection for all meals.  Staff was extremely friendly and helpful in recommending sites to see and how to get around the city.  Quick walk across the bridge to the Temple Bar and the Hard Rock.",5,2017,09,19
237,Great location for sightseeing,"Location is great! Across from the River Liffey so you can't get lost.  You are within walking distance to: Temple Bar area, Molly Malone Statue, Dublin Castle, Christ Church, Trinity College/Book of Kells, Grafton Street, Guinness Storehouse, Jameson Distillery to name a few.  Pubs & shops are everywhere.  Fun city to visit.  Bring an umbrellla and dress in layers, you will experience 4 seasons in one day! Loved it and hope to return some day🍀",4,2017,09,18
237,Excellent staff and rooms,The employees here are really service minded and proactive. Highly recommend to business travellers. Reception and the staff in restaurant very constantly paying attention to guests and checking in if we needed anything. Good breakfast and really comfortable beds,4,2017,09,17
237,"Stylish, modern, and well-located","I had a very nice stay here. The checkin process was quick and easy. The style is clean and modern. The room is large and comfortable. At the end of the hall is a large window which overlooks the River Liffey.

Located by the Milllenium Bridge, across the river from Temple Bar, one block from Jervis Shopping Center and the Luas light rail.",5,2017,09,15
237,Terrific location!,"We stayed for 4 nights in this hotel in late August. The location is terrific, just a 2 minute walk across the River Liffey on a foot bridge and you arrive in Temple Bar. The rooms are adequately sized, lighting / wifi was good and beds were comfortable.  Breakfast was one of the best we had on the whole trip. Even gluten free bread as part of the breakfast buffet. The service level from the front desk staff and concierge was somewhat inconsistent.  Some days we had an excellent customer service experience and on a few occasions we were not as impressed, mostly when it came to them arranging for dinner reservations or taxi pick ups. 
Definitely would recommend this hotel as a great choice if staying in Dublin 😊. ",4,2017,09,15
237,"Nice hotel, GREAT location ,","If your looking for a great place near by everything you want to do in Dublin, this is the place to stay out. We walked everywhere.  Easy to arrange day trips outside of Dublin.  minutes from Temple Bar yest the hotel is across the river in the quiet area . Clean, Quiet, nearby pubs , music, etc... My only issues - Check in - Since it was early morning when we arrived , we knew our room would not be avail and they stored our luggage for us.  Were told that the hotel was completely booked but was then offered a room at an additional 60 Euro/night that was immediately avail. I am a HH member but that had no advantage at this Doubletree thats for sure. We decided to wait for the room we reserved and the staff told me they would call me when its ready. Call never came, we returned 5 hrs later to find out they forgot to call us , room had been ready for awhile.     Room Ammenities - No place to put our clothes in the room . a small closet only, no drawers .  We put what we could in the closet and everything else stayed in our suitcases.  I mentioned this at the front desk later and they just apologized. I would like to know where a guest ( 2 people in a room) are to put clothes at for a 7 night stay. Room more suited for stays of a few nites, for a 7 nite stay provide a room that has storage space for clothes",4,2017,09,14
237,Excellent food and staff,"Was visiting the restaurant on an empty stomach and a similarly constrained budget.
The bar menu is wonderful and the quality is amazing, we ordered four or five starters between two and everything was top notch.
I have complete confidence that the real restaurant menu is even better.
The staff are helpful, attentive, intelligence, interested and good fun.
I would definitely recommend this either for a nibble or the whole hog.",5,2017,09,14
237,Excellent hotel & staff,"Extremely happy with our stay at The Morrison, DoubleTree Dublin.  Excellent location for visiting Dublin, just across the river from Temple Bar and central Dublin.  Also on the road where all three hop on/off tour buses pass with a bus stop just two blocks away.  All the staff were friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was superb with a more personal touch than the usual buffet style breakfast.  Barman on the evening bar very helpful and friendly.  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,09,14
237,Disappointed ,We were not greeted as Hilton Honors members. We were told to go out for a walk because it was 5 minutes before 3:00. We came back to find our bags in the smallest hotel room I've seen in years. I thought it was the entire hotel but then on day two we noticed that the fourth floor was for Hilton Honors members. Guess I could have complained but we were checking out 10 hours later and just wanted to go to bed. Definitely not up to Hilton standards. Look elsewhere. ,1,2017,09,13
237,Weekend in Dublin,"The Morrison fabulous hotel located a block from the Temple Bar district.  Close to bus lines and easy walk to many of the local site seeing hot spots.

We flew in from the US and got to the hotel at 10 am.  They tried to book us in early but a room wasn't ready. They took our bags and said they would call us once a room opened up.  We got a call at 12 checked in early and had our bags waiting.

Rooms are very comfortable, new and clean, beds were a bit firm.",4,2017,09,13
237,Customer Service Extraordinaire!,"From the check in, to anything we needed and any questions we had, we were treated like royalty. Darren Derwin, the concierge, was the best. From suggestions to arranging anything we might need at anytime of the day, with the most positive and humble attitude peppered with good humor, was priceless.  The location is perfect and right on the beautiful River Liffey. You can walk to the shopping in the north and the Temple bar area is just over the bridge. The beds were very comfortable and the hotel lovely. 
Stay here if you can. ",5,2017,09,12
237,"Fabulous stay, staff goes above & beyond!","First, The Morrison is in a terrific location in Dublin. You can walk to Temple Bar in about 5 minutes, just across the bridge. Rooms are spacious and light. The staff is superb! They clearly care about their customers. The TV remote didn't work in the room (we couldn't change channels). They sent someone up right away who tried to fix it. He called the guy they use for AV issues - & it was 9:30 on a Sunday night! Amazingly, the guy picked up, worked with the housekeeping guy for about 1/2 hour, but it couldn't be fixed. We would have been ok with them just fixing it the next day, but the housekeeping guy went down to reception & came back with keycards for a new room. And what a room it was! Huge! We were so surprised & appreciative. They really go above & beyond. Breakfast is terrific too, fabulous selection of items, & they were very helpful with my (non-life threatening) dairy allergy. They clearly care about their customers!",5,2017,09,12
237,JW,"Location was close to Temple Bar area. There was a wedding party in hotel and guest were coming in and out of there rooms all night slamming doors, and music was loud till after midnight . We had to catch a early flight in the morning and were absolutely shattered from no sleep",2,2017,09,12
237,The fine print,"No parking, no valet, no help with bags.  This hotel is not of Hilton standards.  Pillows and beds were terrible.   The Morrison restaurant had could not make the first 3 cocktails I tried to order with dinner as they were out of ingredients.  Two items on the menu were not available.  Hilton this is not a good location to have your brand attached.",1,2017,09,10
237,Excellent Central location Hotel,"Modern, contemporary decor. Rooms are spacious, the staff are helpful and friendly.  It's a great breakfast, plenty of choice, leaves you full all day, waiting on staff are well informed about the local area attractions.  Ideally located on River Liffey, just cross over the Millennium Bridge and you're virtually in the Temple Bar area.  To the right of the hotel it's a 10 minute walk to the Jameson Whiskey Distillery.  Be sure to visit the Emigration Museum, interestingly  informative and  the technology used is amazing.",5,2017,09,09
237,What they don't tell you!!!!,"In the second day of our stay at about three in the afternoon we had a single knock on the room door and a hotel staff guy enters the room as my wife is changing.  Unapologetically he leaves a paper that announces that there will be a party that night, that it will be loud, and it will go on till 1:30 am.  It was and did! 

It repeated the next night (w/o the room invasion)

We were on a high floor in the Hilton Honors section .  If we had been informed we certainly would have chosen another hotel.

On the plus side it did have a roof and kept the rain out",1,2017,09,09
237,"Modern, stylish hotel.","Good location north of the river.  Professional, helpful staff.  Decent restaurant and bar.  Very awkward using the bathtub, but the bathroom was otherwise fine. No other complaints, but the overall style has to be to your taste.",4,2017,09,09
237,What's not to like,"Spent a night there. Newly refurbished, modern and cool. Location great, TV, mini bar, toiletries, bath robes and slippers, great shower. For my taste, only a few flaws - pillows are too big, bathroom can't be closed from the outside, not enough hooks to hang the towels, no toilet brush. When we came into the room, there were a couple of hairs in the the shower so perhaps cleaning standard could be upgraded.
I'd recommend and stay there again for longer.",4,2017,09,09
237,The best customer service!,"I am a long term trip advisor user first time reviewer. I wanted to review this hotel as it has the best customer service I have ever experienced thanks to Edit one of the Senior Receptionists. We arrived at this hotel after being given the name by our travel agent. Unknown to us there are a few 'Double Tree by Hilton' hotels in Dublin and it turned out we had the wrong one. Despite not staying in this hotel Edit called around for us and worked out where we were staying. She was so kind and patient and helped us out in a sticky situation in a foreign country. She then organised a taxi for us and even gave us a cold drink and warm cookie whilst waiting for a taxi. Edit gave the taxi driver directions for us and we were then on our way to the correct location. I cannot rate her customer service highly enough and we were not even customers at this hotel so I can only imagine the service you would receive staying here. When next in Dublin we will definitely be staying at this hotel and will recommended it to our friends and family, thank you again for your kind hospitality 😊",5,2017,09,08
237,Fantastic,"This was my first visit and in a business context.
Receptionists hugely helpful on arrival. The fact that they greeted me at 9pm with a warm, freshly baked chocolate cookie also added a surprising but very welcome twist.
The room was excellent. Modern, tasteful decor, spotless.  
Lots of electric sockets about.
Good hairdryer
Good iron & ironing board.
Fridge contents excellent (if required). Coffee/tea facilities higher than usual standard.
Good shower & bathroom.
Excellent TV selections
I worked at the Morrison the next day in a suite next to the bar.  The service was second got none. The young man on duty was super helpful, warm & welcoming. He did all the 'technical stuff' for me. He ensured I had top class refreshments immediately. 
The refreshments supplied all day were top class. Pastries and chocolate chip cookies in particular were divine.
The concierges were multi tasking & brilliantly helpful.
Washrooms spotless.

Ok some disadvantages.  This was very expensive for work - more than I'd normally pay.
Nothing to do with the hotel but the cab ride in from airport isn't cheap.
Unsure whether they have parking on site.

Summary - be prepared to pay a bit more but the service is awesome.  The food is great. The rooms are great. I loved staying there.",4,2017,09,08
237,Well located and friendly staff,"good location across the Liffe from Temple bar area and lots of shopping and dining.  I made this the base for a tourist weekend in Dublin.  Short walks to all the interesting sites with plenty of options for dining and shopping nearby.  The restaurant and bar in the hotel were top notch with many options and a very friendly staff.  The breakfast buffet was a bit pricey at 16Euro/day if prepaid but quality was high and large selection.  Parking is down the block but easy access.  Good fitness center, not great with good quality equipment.",4,2017,09,07
237,City chic in old dublin,We spent our first night in Ireland at the Morrison.   It is a beautiful modern property right in the center of Dublin.   We were able to walk to all the attractions and enjoyed the time at the hotel as well. The breakfast was delicious and beautifully presented.  The service was wonderful from the front desk to the wait staff.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would love to return someday!   ,5,2017,09,06
237,Great Location,We arrived early and staff were very friendly and accommodating. They took our bags and when we returned in the afternoon all we did was pick up the key and the bags were in our room. The hotel is located very close to Temple Bar where we enjoyed the food and drink.,4,2017,09,06
237,Almost a boutique hotel,Great location in Dublin. Friendly helpful staff who go out of their way. Breakfast was great. We arrived after a 9 day hike on the Kerry Way and it was like an oasis. The poor guy on the desk spent about 1/2 hr Booking our tickets for  Riverdance. ,5,2017,09,06
237,"Location, location, location...and little else","One glance at the map and its clear The Morrison's main benefit is its central location.  It's within10 mins of almost everything in Central Dublin.  Otherwise, the hotel is unremarkable.  Its not bad, just nothing special - regular rooms and efficient service.  All in all location justifies the price.",4,2017,09,05
237,Wonderful place,This place was excellent location was perfect right across the river from Temple bar area very clean and staff were very friendly and accommodating will definitely stay here when I return the restaurant was good and the rooms clean,5,2017,09,05
237,Great location," Found this location to be optimal. Hotel and rooms were ultracontemporary which were not to our  liking. However, rooms were very comfortable and clean. There was some noise late at night from returning partygoers. ",4,2017,09,05
237,Love this hotel ,"Excellent stay at the Morrison. We stayed for 2 nights on points. They recognized me as a Diamond member and gave us a nice upgraded room. Service and breakfast was fantastic. Highly recommend their on site restaurant. I would definitely stay her again, very close to the temple bar area. ",5,2017,09,04
237,Excellent Stay,"We spent 3 nights at The Morrison. The hotel is in a great location, within walking distance of pretty much all the tourist attractions in Dublin. The staff was just wonderful. We arrived early from an overnight flight; and while our room was not ready (we didn't expect it would be), they consigned our luggage, provided cookies, and took our phone number to call when room was available. Our room, and the entire hotel, was spotless. Our room was nicely decorated, the bathroom was huge, and the beds were very comfortable. The breakfast buffet was the best I've ever encountered. There was a huge variety of quality food, and the service was amazing. Very well-run breakfast operation. It was pretty much a perfect stay, with the exception of a wedding held there our last night. The music was extremely loud and went on until about 2 a.m. It was impossible to sleep, and we had to rise at 6 a.m. for an early morning flight. I'm not sure why the hotel would allow such noise, as it most certainly annoyed other guests as well. However, I am still rating the hotel as a 5. The front desk apologized and offered us some Hilton points, so we were satisfied.",5,2017,09,02
237,AMAZING PLACE,"We stayed two nights here and were greeted by very friendly staff and warm cookies after a long day. They took pur luggage up as we went directly to the restaurant for a late bite. Then, even on a moment's notice they were quick to accommodate our desire to have our ""king"" bed separated into two twin beds. The restaurant and breakfast were amazing and little extras everywhere. The earlier comment in the early August review  about the bathroom door I agree with, but the electricity comment on the same review may have been a guest's error. The electricity is powered by your room key (pretty standard in the UK). They are very professional and one of the floor managers came over to chat during breakfast. They will call you a taxi and hold your bags for a late check out wander around the city before your final departure.  Plus the lift is secure, as you have to use your room card to operate it. Lovely place. Will definitively be back!!!!",5,2017,09,01
237,Disappointing Hilton Hotel,We were surprised to discover that this hotel is not in the best part of town.  Our first night I got stuck in the bathroom (the door gets stuck) and then the lights went out - very scary.  The location is in close proxsimity to many attractions and it is pedestrian friendly city   We did buy the hop on and hop off 3 day ticket but really only used it twice so not worth the money for us.  During our stay the hotel had booked very loud parties for Friday and Saturday night with very loud music laughing and yelling until well beyond 3am - the bar is not customer friendly - the breakfast is buffet and good and the restaurant is ok.,3,2017,08,30
237,Great Place to Stay!," This is a great hotel in Dublin Center City. The most amazing part of this hotel was the staff. They were all very pleasant, personable, and accommodating. They also have great, warm cookies when you check-in!",5,2017,08,29
237,Wonderful Stay In Dublin,"The Morrison is a wonderful boutique hotel in the very center of Dublin. It very modern with very large comfortable rooms. It is also a Hilton property, so Hilton Honors members get great upgrades!. What makes the Morrison so special, however, is not the excellent facility and location, but the staff!. I have never met so helpful, friendly and caring hotel staff. All were excellent, but Darren, the concierge/manager, was extra-ordinary in his incredible help. He turned a disaster into a wonderful stay. Thank you Darren.",5,2017,08,29
237,Good location. Nice new hotel with large and modern rooms and bathrroms,"The hotel is nice and on the bank of the river. the location is very central and you just cross the river on one of the bridges and you get to Temple Bar area. I had a congress in Trinity College, which is not far away either, something like 10-15 minutes walking. It is easy to get the buses to the airport if you are not with a lot of luggage you just walk to the central boulevard near by. The hotel is quite expensive. The rooms are nice and the bathrooms are big. Everything is clean and modern. It is not noisy in the rooms. Reception is helpful, I would rate this hotel 4-4.5 and not 5 for the only reason it does not have the personal touch, it is more like a big hotel from a big chain. The breakfast was very good as well.

However, I am rating this hotel at 3 stars. My card was inappropriately charged about 600 Eur. It happens. I raised this with reception. Was told they will investigate, they did, said it was an error and I will be refunded. I was refunded indeed. It happens.

Due to exchange rates differences the refund was 15 Eur short. I send an email on 12/7 to info@morrisonhotel.ie explaining the situation. Nothing, nothing, ever came back. Well that is unacceptable. So 3 stars on average from me.",3,2017,08,29
237,Vacation stay in Dublin,"My friends and I booked this hotel on points, I can tell you we were treated the same as a paying customer. Staff was extremely helpful and accommodating. Rooms were what you would expect for a Hilton. In my opinion you can't get a better location. Easy walking distance to most city attractions. Highly recommend!",5,2017,08,28
237,Wonderful hotel to visit Dublin,"We spent 4 nights at The Morrison when sightseeing in Dublin.  It is centrally located and very comfortable.  The staff was exceptional in helping make our stay perfect.  The beds were very comfortable.  The breakfast was a little expensive, but you do not have to eat here.  The Morrison was close to shopping center that has almost anything you could want to buy, including a Boots drug store.  One employ, Darren Derwin, was always trying to go ""one step above required"" in his helping with us.  He got all of the luggage in our car, which was a major accomplishment.  Had a great time",5,2017,08,28
237,Beginning of honeymoon and service was fantastic!,"We were on the mezzanine level. It was very quiet and peaceful. The room was beautiful and so clean. We were treated so specially from the minute we walked in. Jason made sure we were very comfortable and had everything we needed. As far as the location goes, it couldn't get much better. A short walk to Temple bar and other sights, and a very short walk to the Jervis luas station. We would recommend this hotel to everybody.",5,2017,08,27
237,The Morrison hotel ,Nice place.   Hilton properties are always nice and this is nice but a little over modern for the building being a little older.  Great air conditioning since I like it cooler.   Blow dryer was broken but they were up within minutes with a new one.  Bar in hotel was very nice with friendly staff.  Check in was simple.   Staff was very nice room clean and comfortable   Just plain looking.  Enjoyed it,4,2017,08,27
237,Excellent hotel and excellent location,"Located a block from HaPenny bridge, this is a stylish and comfortable hotel.  We only had a day in Dublin and loved this place.  We will seek it out on our return trip.  The staff are eager to be helpful.  ",5,2017,08,26
237,Way more than I expected.,"We had a great extended family stay here with my elderly mother and my sister and her husband. The staff were great and the waiter at lunch time could not have been more helpful suggesting what to see that afternoon and even going and getting brochures from the concierge desk so we could look at them while we waited for our meal, which was very good. We ate in-house each meal of our stay and were very impressed with the standard of the restaurant food, it was nothing like the humdrum (usually fairly good) meals I have come to expect in larger chain hotels. If It is possible for food to have 'character' that would be how I would describe the meals at the Morrison. The actual menu items are not all that unusual but it is the cooking style and presentation that sets them apart.
Check in was friendly and competent and as we were very early they were only able to offer us entry to one of the two rooms we had booked but the young woman on reception rang me as soon as the second room was ready. She even suggested I phone her to let her know my o'seas sim phone number as I was scrambling to find it on my phone, thereby making the process much easier. Rooms were very clean. Hotel decor is modern and sharp.
It is apparent that a lot of effort is put into ensuring every aspect of the customer experience is top notch. Congrats to the management of such a well run hotel.",5,2017,08,25
237,"Updated, mod hotel ","The Morrison Hotel is near the Temple Bar area, a vibrant nightspot suitable for younger guests or those looking to venture out and experience some Dublin nightlife.

The hotel is bright and modernized, with air conditioned rooms, comfy beds/bedding and newer bathrooms. Love the Crabtree & Evelyn bath products in the bathrooms! One bathroom issue is the flushing device for the toilet. It is located on the wall above and behind the toilet and needs to be pushed in to flush. Maybe it's the awkward location of the flusher but I had trouble using it.

The restaurant was just okay--the breakfast was satisfactory and plentiful but overly salted. The other food tasted a bit more ""commercial"" than I've come to expect in Ireland, where everything is normally freshly prepared.

The staff is incredibly welcoming and friendly. They are always available and willing to assist. 

Overall this is a nice hotel in a busy area of Dublin.",4,2017,08,25
237,Very comfortable room and in a good location.,"Stayed here for five days.  One can either take a taxi (about 30 euros) or take the Airlink 747 and walk about five blocks and cross a bridge.  The room was really quiet and the bed was so comfortable that I did not even want to get up : )   Granted I did not get a cookie when I arrived, but they were not made at the time.  I checked in a little early.",4,2017,08,24
237,Great place to stay,"We stayed there for one night and it was perfect.  Botanical gardens across the way are awesome and some near by pubs had great food and drink.  All walking distance.  We would definitely stay here again, hopefully for a couple nights next time we are passing through.",5,2017,08,23
237,We loved this place!!!,"The Morrison is wonderfully located right in the middle of everything.  My bag didn't make it on the plane, so I needed to shop as soon as we arrived and they were very helpful. Our room was ready early and our bags were there when we got to the room.  We felt very taken care of and almost everything was seamless for the 2 nights we were there.  We were put off by the cramped check-in area, but after that it was a really great stay!!!",4,2017,08,22
237,Very nice hotel in a good location,"Stayed here for 2 nights while visiting Dublin.  The staff were nice and the hotel is very clean.  The rooms are updated and are very modern.  This place is within walking distance of most of the major attractions in Dublin and is just across the river from the Temple Bar area. 
Would recommend and would definitely stay here again.",4,2017,08,21
237,Family re-union,"Morrison Hotel more than met our needs for a location and venue in which to have family ranging in age from 2-85 years meet, socialize, dine and socialize. Rooms are spacious and well laid out, restaurants and bars suitable for both intimate and larger groupings, staff at all levels are exceptionally gracious, friendly and helpful.",5,2017,08,21
237,Great Location and great Service,"Our weekend in this hotel was very ""noisy"". First night our room was too closed to the patio where they had a wedding and it was really noisy. We asked them to change it and they gave us a new room ( quiet and calm!) and free breakfast! The second night, by external accident, the fire alarm sounded! It was crazy. But the service was very firendly. Not cheap but good place",4,2017,08,21
237,Not the place to stay to get a good nights sleep.....,"We arrived at the hotel after a delayed flight, and as part of the online check in I'd made sure the Hotel were aware we'd be arriving late.

On arriving check in was efficient, though as with all hotel check-in's longer than it needed to be. No mention was made of my status with Hilton Honors or any of the benefits that should come with my status.

As we were making our way to our room we became aware of a function with loud music. As we entered our room the room was overlooking the courtyard where there were people smoking and the music was playing loudly. The music was so loud there was no chance of sleeping, in fact it was so loud you could have sung along to the words of Abba. 

As it was getting close to midnight and we thought the music may end around that time, but we phoned down to reception to check and we were told the music would continue to be played at the same level until 1.30am! They offered us to downgrade us to a quieter room which we had to accept as it was the only way to get some sleep an not be kept up for another hour and a half.

They said they were busy so we'd might have to have our original room for our second night despite there being a wedding scheduled for the next night  and music due to be being played again until 1.30am. 

Fortunately they did find us another room for the second night, but we had to pack up all our things and it wasn't very convenient. 

On returning to the hotel for our second night, after being out for the day, we returned to be given our new room keys. Our new room was spacious, but we were kept awake by an odd clanging noise, it seemed we were next to some of service area, which meant we had a second night of fairly poor sleep.

This is a hotel that clearly cares about the functions that it hosts, but doesn't think about the affect these functions will have on guests that are staying in the hotel, who are not attending these functions. 

The room we booked was fairly expensive and the very least you can expect is to be able to get a good nights sleep. A hotel to avoid.

",1,2017,08,20
237,We saved the best for last.,"We stayed in 2 other hotels in Ireland before we got to The Morrison- both small and very basic-   The Morrison was completely updated, bed was comfortable, good shower pressure, decent sized room, very attentive staff. yummy, warm cookies - everything about this hotel made us feel welcome.",5,2017,08,20
237,Upscale Boutique Hotel with Central Location,"Great location, short walk to many attractions & restaurants.  Hotel is upscale with clean, modern rooms.  Staff are very friendly and service is excellent.  I would recommend to anyone seeking somewhere other than the traditional 4/5 star tourist hotels.",5,2017,08,19
237,Disappointing Experience - Great Hotel,"My wife and I visited in August 2017 for our ten year anniversary.  In an attempt to do something special for my wife, I contacted the hotel in advance and they offered to upgrade the room and provide a special arrival gift for my wife and I (offered by Darren).  Upon arrival, we were in a standard room and the arrival gift was not presented.  But this would have been the hotel going above and beyond what I expect, when it was offered in writing prior to arrival (and I let my wife know to expect something special), this was extremely disappointing.

The room was very trendy and modern.  The bed was comfortable.  The AC was extremely loud and there was a light in the room (below the coffee maker) that would not turn off.  This kept the room bright throughout the night.  We informed the front desk of both of these issues but neither was resolved.

Overall, this was a disappointing stay at a hotel that clearly has higher standards and much more potential.

The bright spot was the daily breakfast.  The staff was excellent and the food was amazing. Don't miss the french toast.",2,2017,08,18
237,Above and beyond!,"My 3 day stay at the Morrison was for a special family celebration and I would like to commend the staff.  They were quick to help with any requests and these were handled so smoothly and courteously.  It made our family gathering feel very relaxed, well looked after - a home from home for us gathered from around the world to be together. A special call out to Duty Manager, Jason, who seemed to be always on duty, and had a wonderful way of subtly checking in that all was well and offering suggestions. The hotel itself is well positioned in the city centre and the rooms and facilities of a high standard.  ",5,2017,08,18
237,Highly Recommended,"Really enjoyed the stay. Staff friendly, and very efficient. Very impressed indeed. From the booking, through to booking. Really liked the calm and naturally sincere staff. This was the first time that I stayed having know the hotel for years. Looking forward to the next stay

237,Best stay in Europe trip!,"Traveled to two other countries on our trip and The Morrison was by far the best. The staff were amazing and our room was very accommodating, clean and spacious!! When we go back to Dublin will definitely stay at The Morrison. Very good location to the City Centre and very good shopping and restaurants. ",5,2017,08,16
237,"Has it all, and location could not have been better!","We stayed here for 6 nights in a king sized room, on the 4th floor, with a river view! Amazing experience! Room was quiet and bed very comfortable. Location was amazing as so close to walk to Temple bar area, and other areas as well.Transportation was easy to use, from the Luis to Hop on, Hop off buses. We walked all over the city from our hotel.  Buffet breakfasts were really good, with a nice variety of food. Staff was amazing , so helpful from Darren at front desk, to Anita at breakfast, and all others too! Definitely will recommend to everyone!",5,2017,08,16
237,"The location is great ,the hotel is so beautiful inside and the staffs are wonderful. I will recommend this hotel",I really love the location you can walk to everywhere. A very busy area with tourists transportation is good you can use the bus or the train. The Hotel is so beautiful inside. The staffs are amazing so nice. ,5,2017,08,14
237,"Great location, average hotel",As we found in most places in Ireland the big hotel chains are not worth the money. They nickel and dime you for everything. The room was about the size of a closet and for close to 300 a night I wasn't to thrilled. The only plus was how it was centrally located to most tourist destinations.,3,2017,08,13
237,Comfortable bedroom but...,"Stayed here with my husband last month as we were going to the U2 concert at Croke Park. Booked a junior suite, which was large - with a big super king bed, separate seating area and bathroom with bath and shower - and quite cool; think lots of white with accents of pink in the lighting. We were on the second floor and our room looked into the inner courtyard so we thought it would be nice and quiet but unfortunately the noise from the function room/smoking area (music, shouting etc) was so loud we actually checked the windows were closed properly as the noise levels were so high! Luckily breakfast is served until midday on a Sunday so we could have a much needed lie in. The staff were all friendly and it is a lovely hotel but not sure we'd stay again as we like our sleep too much!",3,2017,08,13
237,"Excellent location, average hotel ","Pro's - Quaint and modern hotel, in an excellent location. A quick walk over the river to Temple Bar and other tourist attractions. Within walking distance of the financial Centre too, as well as high street shopping. Staff are generally friendly and willing to assist when required. The design of the hotel is cool and rooms are modern, spacious and clean. 

Con's - There was no porter to assist with luggage. The breakfast was below average.Tables are cramped close to each other upstairs and the service/food options are average. The AC in the room is very noisy though. They don't offer express laundry (first hotel that I've been to that don't) and it's an inconvenience for business travelers who pack light and require dry cleaning of clothes for early morning meetings. 

On the whole it was an above average stay.",4,2017,08,12
237,Right next to the river,"Great location to be able to get into Temple Bar and other areas of Dublin
Bar is well stocked and bar team all know what they are doing. Good service , same with the rooms
Parking is next door but easy to find",4,2017,08,11
237,"Central, comfy and stylish","Our stay started in spectacular fashion: We arrived, exhausted, around 8 a.m. after traveling from the states. Our room wasn't ready of course, but we asked if another one was. Indeed a upgraded room was available right then, so we happily paid the $50E/night surcharge, went to our spacious room and had a magnificent four hour nap. 

We had a great bed; sofa and TV; desk area; ample closet; mini-fridge and kettle. The bath was spacious with a strong Swedish shower head. 

Quiet is extremely important to us. We were right over the road by the Liffey river, so there was a little noise but the windows had pretty good insulation and traffic dwindled in the evening. Actually more annoying were the hardwood floors, which creaked when we walked and when our neighbors upstairs walked.

We had breakfast one morning; thought it was good but not outstanding. There is a pretty simple buffet of breads (usually very coarse), juices and cereals. You order hot items off a menu--standard Irish breakfast, omelettes, pancakes, etc. (Then again, we were never thrilled by any of our breakfasts over 17 days! This isn't France or Italy...)

The staff was friendly and helpful. I wanted to print tickets for Dublin Castle and after I emailed it to them, they said, you don't have to wait around. We'll put the tickets in your room. And they did.

The location was terrific: easy walking to all the major sites but not in a crowded location. 

We did feel the price was a little steep, but weighing all the pros, it was well worth it. We stayed in 11 hotels on our trip and this in the top 3!",4,2017,08,10
237,The best location in Dublin,"The hotel is located right in the city center, walking distance from many attractions.
The service is really good and the staff were very helpful. The rooms are decorated in a modern lite style, which I really like.
",5,2017,08,10
237,Still As Good As I Remember,Stayed here 4 years ago. We were impressed then and again this time. Our daughter had a bit of an issue with a plugged sink but other than that it was great. Located near the Temple bar area plus a large shopping center. Staff treated us very well & the breakfast was excellent. Beds were also very comfortable. Only there 1 night but good preparation for the long flight home.,4,2017,08,10
237,In the heart of Dublin,"My sister and I stayed a night here when visiting Dublin to attend a concert in Vicar St and were very impressed. Loved being able to walk out on the quays and Temple Bar and Grafton St just a bridge away. Lovely room, great breakfast and friendly helpful staff. Very enjoyable night away.",5,2017,08,08
237,Great location. Comfortable.,"We wanted to stay at a hotel that was close to the Temple Bar area but not too close that it would be too loud at night. This place was it. Easy walk to the Jameson Distillery and all the pubs we wanted to check out. Close to where the tour buses did their pick up for day tours. Plus it had air conditioning, which was important to us. The food at the downstairs restaurant was really good (try their fish and chips). And the manager really went out of her way to make sure that you have a comfortable stay. The only down side was that they seem to be a popular place for wedding receptions and we could hear the guests when they were out at the courtyard/garden area. But we were exhausted from all the day's activities that the noise did not keep us from sleeping. I'd stay here again.",5,2017,08,08
237,Noisy and overpriced,The hotel is in a busy part of town but there is no noise insulation so you won't get a full nights sleep. Very expensive and poor choice in restaurants.  Bath will not fill more than 3 inches and there are no seats in room to relax on.,1,2017,08,07
237,Modern Gem in the heart of Dublin,"We researched a lot of hotels on line, and we found the Morrison checked all our boxes.  An easy walk across the bridge over to the Temple Bar district, the Morrison is close enough to have fun, yet far enough away for a quiet night's sleep!  Modern decor is fun and inviting.  Staff was super!  Worth the price!",5,2017,08,05
237,Short break ,"Stayed at the Morrison - found it to be very central for shops, restaurants and bars - the hotel is located very close to ha'penny bridge and across the river from temple bar - it was very clean and modern - the staff were all excellent and really helpful especially Darren at reception.   We received cookies on checking in which is apparently a doubletree thing (though I've stayed at other doubletrees and never received them) and they were amazing!   The breakfasts were also really good - would definitely stay at this hotel again when back in Dublin.  ",5,2017,08,04
237,Surprisingly good,"I often stay at Hiltons, but not as regularly at Doubletree hotels.  This hotel though was fantastic; modern, clean, very good staff who were helpful and courteous at all times, great breakfast.  An overall thoroughly enjoyable stay",5,2017,08,03
237,Beautiful hotel,"Clean, friendly and unobtrusive but efficient service. Lovely bright room with all amenities and in a great location for town. Nice presentation of food and drinks.  I hope I get the chance to stay again. ",5,2017,08,03
237,Wonderful Hotel with a Great Location!!,"This hotel is beautiful!  It is located within walking distance to several restaurants, pubs, local neighborhoods and attractions.  The rooms are spacious and well kept.  They have a wonderful breakfast buffet or you can order from the breakfast menu.  They do a happy hour in the bar as well.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  We would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,08,03
237,Back again,"I was in Dublin visiting family, and friends. Once again the staff looked after me very well. 

I was in a smaller room this time, but it was quiet, comfortable, and everything was great. 

It is close to everything, great food, bars, and good times :)",5,2017,08,03
237,So far so good....,"Checked in today, first time in Dublin. Very well located, walking distance to the bars and restaurants. Nice friendly staff. 
The bar needs extra staff though,just one guy trying his best- that's not good enough.
Another minor gripe- rang room service for milk carton to make tea. "" it's on its way"" one hour later, nothing. I got fed up of waiting and went a restaurant. Called into front desk to ask them for the milk. Still waiting -20minutes on. 
This is a nice hotel, ultra clean and well maintained but I got a feeling it's under staffed. Will try the breakfast in a he morning- if I don't comment here- take it as good....",4,2017,08,02
237,Good hotel in perfect location. Very friendly and helpful staff.,"It's not the first time I was in Dublin, seen a few hotels already and found the Hilton Double Tree a very good hotel in perfect location with very friendly and helpful staff.

Will go back next time I'm in Dublin.",4,2017,08,02
237,"Great location, friendly helpful staff","Location is great, right on the river across from key visitor sites. Staff was friendly and helpful - very service oriented. Hotel is modern and nicely decorated. Only down side is that it was a little noisy - seagulls and street noise. I would definitely stay there again. ",4,2017,08,02
237,No cookies,"Stayed four nights in July. Room was small, but clean and had great A/C and windows that open. Good location that was close to Temple Bar and O'Connell St. 

Check in wasn't great. We arrived after 2pm for a 3pm check in, but the room wasn't available until after 4pm. Staff provided no explanation for the delay, no updates between 3 and 4pm, no apologies and no cookies that are supposed to be part of the Doubletree experience.",3,2017,07,29
237,Location is splendid -- you can walk everywhere you want to go!,"Started out with a snafu -- hotel was supposed to have car service meet us at airport -- but it never came so after waiting over 20 minutes we took a cab to hotel.  When we got to the desk, the chap there asked who arranged for that car?  And it was him!  He was quite embarrassed and to make it up to us paid for a cab to a restaurant later in  our stay.  The room on first floor with a view of the river was a bit larger than other rooms and so worth the extra money.  Paid to include breakfast and that was well worth it.  If you ask for them to make eggs a certain way, they accommodated it so that was quite nice.  For us as Americans, the biggest drawback was the bathroom.  The flush for the toilet is a metal bit sticking out of the wall and to push it into the wall (for a small person such as myself) meant standing and leaning over toilet to push full body weight on thumb and then you got a pretty weak flush so you had to do this multiple times for not a great result.  And the tub (again for a short person) was a challenge to get into to take a shower -- it was up too high and quite a step over and down to reach back to the floor.  Maybe if they have a shower stall in a room that is safer and easier. It was very quiet, no road noise despite being right over the traffic.",4,2017,07,28
237,The Perfect Hotel,"Great location, nice rooms and good restaurants. I've stayed here several times and continue to come back to this hotel whenever I'm in Dublin. Starting to get a little pricey but still good value. Just be sure to get a room on the upper floors because it can be noisy on the street, especially on a weekend.",5,2017,07,27
237,Ideal city centre location,"Booked king room with river view, a bit pricey. Very clean and smart, imaginative decor, but bathroom disappointing, shower over bath, I would have thought a smart hotel would have made bathrooms as smart as the rest of the hotel.
Very clean tidy cleverly decorated and furnished public areas, staff equally smart and efficient.
Smashing breakfast, a la carte choices such as eggs benedict were best I've ever had, well done chef!!",4,2017,07,27
237,"4.5 starts - Great location, fantastic staff, good breakfast and nice rooms","Overall our experience here with a family of 6 in 3 rooms was great. Rooms as small, as you might expect in a European city, but they are nicely decorated with plenty of outlets and lighting, etc. The staff was amazing, particularly when the city experienced a sudden power outage one morning while we were at breakfast. It seemed like every staff member ran around the floors of the hotel physically guiding people to stairs and generally offering any and all help that they could.

Breakfast was buffet style, but you could also order additional items from the wait staff. Food was good and prompt and on our very early departure morning, they offered ""to go"" bags so you could pack up some food from their buffet to take with you.

Hotel has air conditioning, which in an unexpectedly warm July was a great relief from our hotels in smaller towns in Ireland. Hotel is a few blocks from a hop-on, hop-off bus stop (you can buy tickets at the front desk) and walking distance to the Temple Bar area.

I'd give this 4.5 if that was an option because I am hard-pressed to think of any complaints other than small rooms with no fridge (but that last thing is such an ""American"" expectation!)",4,2017,07,27
237,The hotel is very nice and staff is great,"I would stay here if you are cabbing it in from the airport and you want to be in a lively nightlife are. If you want to drive in, park and rest, I'd probably pick somewhere else. My room was very nice and all of the staff I dealt with were friendly and informative. ",4,2017,07,26
237,Location .. location ..location,"Great hotel .. great location ..
The modern room are a bit small for North American standard but with in the standard of the European city ...
A little bit expensive but worthwhile if you want a premium hotel in a premium location ",5,2017,07,26
237,Great Stay,"Beautiful, comfortable, and well appointed. The rooms are generous in size. The beds are comfortable and the linens soft. The breakfast in the morning is fantastic! I love the location right by a pedestrian bridge over the River Liffey, across from the Temple Bar area. Dublin is a great city and The Morrison is a perfect place to stay.",5,2017,07,25
237,Fantastic location and very helpful staff,"We had a great stay here.  Not only was the location fantastic, right across the bridge from Temple Bar, but the staff was very helpful and nice.  In particular we landed very early in the morning from an overseas flight, hours prior to being able to check in, and they were able to provide us with a ""freshen up"" place to shower so we could get started on our day prior to even being able to check in.",5,2017,07,25
237,Great location,The staff was friendly and helpful. We were not able to have an early check in but they held our luggage while we explored Dublin. The room was clean and nicely decorated. Would be nice if the room had a fridge. The hotel is in a great location. We were able to walk to the Temple Bar and many other places without having to call a taxi.,4,2017,07,21
237,Dublin Doubletree,"The Dublin Doubletree (Morrison's) was very well located for seeing Dublin. The staff could not have been more welcoming, helpful, accommodating. They ""bent over backward"" to make us feel welcome, offering suggestions for sightseeing and simply making  
sure our stay was superlative. The rooms were very nice, clean with GOOD beds and GOOD pillows. One morning the electricity went out in that section of Dublin for a period of time. The staff was scurrying around making sure that everyone was safe, apologizing profusely for the inconvenience and trying to help as much as possible. We were extremely impressed by their actions. We were a family of 6 (5 adults and one child age 9) with 3 rooms.",5,2017,07,21
237,Great spot with tremendous service,"Plus side: Loved the location, the staff, and the included breakfast (wonderful selection).

Downside:  Expensive for a decently sized room with a crap view of the roof and another wall a few feet away (no sky or direct daylight), bathroom was just average, and only instant coffee in the room",3,2017,07,20
237,EXCELLENT SERVICE AND LOCATION,"This hotel couldn't be better. Extraordinary location, withing short walking distance of the city centre and yet not in the middle of crowds. The rooms are impecably clean and all the staff makes you really feel at home. The breaksfast is superb! Especially by the warm welcome of the staff and the delicious home made style food.",5,2017,07,19
237,"Amazing Stay, Great Rooms, Friendly Staff, Awesome Location and Terrific Food","My partner and I, along with two friends recently enjoyed a 10 day holiday in Ireland. We started just north of Shannon in Doolin and then drove south along the coast towards Kinsale. Then we drove north east towards Dublin our last stop before heading home to Boston. We stayed the the Morrison by Double Tree Hotel. We initially thought it was an older hotel, especially by outside. However, it is quite modern and fully furnished with everything a hotel guest would need. We loved it here and will definitely be back.",5,2017,07,19
237,Business Trip with the Company,"We stayed 3 nights in Dublin and enjoyed the city. The hotel is very nice, central, and quiet. You can walk to the city center and make excursions. The river is just nearby and nice for a walk. The breakfast is recommended.",5,2017,07,18
237,Great Location and Excellent Staff,"If you want a great leisure or business location in Dublin, do not hesitate to consider this property for your stay.  Rooms are very modern and comfortable.  Staff was extremely accommodating and the breakfast was outstanding with a choice of buffet or hot breakfast.    We were able to walk most of Dublin and see what we wanted to see including St. Patricks, Jameson Distillery and most of the pubs in Tavern Bar area.   We also walked to the train station to see Howth and enjoyed a pleasant afternoon by the sea.   Will not stay anywhere else in Dublin when we return.",5,2017,07,17
237,Nice hotel,We were in Dublin with a travel group and arrived a day early to tour the city. The staff was very friendly and willing to help with any questions we had. Hotel is in a great location to walk and take in the city. Room was clean and plenty of space for two. We would stay here again if we come back to Ireland.,5,2017,07,16
237,"Fantastic location, very nice overnight stay (and warm cookies)","The location while being able to use Hilton points was the main incentive for us staying here during a long layover in Dublin.  The location is ideal. The hotel is within walking distance of most major attractions including the Temple Bar area  just across the river. However, because it is just off the main tourist drag the location was quiet.  We took the bus in and back to the airport and the O'Connell Street stops are within a few blocks of the hotel. The room was decorated similar to the photo in a modern style.  While comfortable and containing all the amenities we needed I found the room somewhat spartan (but this did not affect our high opinion of the hotel). Staff were friendly and helpful and provided some ideas for dinner locations outside of the hotel.  Very satisfied with our short stay, if we return to spend time in Dublin I would plan on staying again.",4,2017,07,16
237,"Modern, clean, and great location!",Amazing location right in the city centre. Beautiful view of the river. Small window in the room and a little noisy are my only complaints. Food is good (considering it's Ireland) so great chefs but not my favorite menu items... Felt very safe and I was traveling alone.,5,2017,07,16
237,Amazing hotel - great location- super comfy beds ,"Stayed here for one night for a work trip , great location , staff helpful and knowledgeable and then beds were
Super comfy - just what you need when away for work. 
One point the air con was not great so the room was hot , but if that's the only problem your onto a winner .
Would definitely stay here again!!! ",5,2017,07,16
237,Best Hilton in Ireland,"Fantastic hotel, exceptional service, great location, stylish without being over the top.

Our favourite hotel in Dublin, from a wide variety of options.  A different league from Hilton general expectations.

Corner rooms worth the extra, exceptional view of Dublin skyline.",5,2017,07,16
237,Great hotel and location,"Used Hilton Points to stay at this location.  Room was really nice, very clean, bathroom was spotless.
Two minute walk to the Ha Penny Bridge and across to the main area of Dublin.
Easy walk to Trinity College, Book of Kells, and Grafton Street plus the National Archives.
There is a nice place to eat and bar in the hotel, but lots of options within a 5 min walk.
Front desk staff very friendly and helpful with questions. Car parking is at Jervis which gets a discount from the hotel and now has 24hr a day staff on hand.",5,2017,07,15
237,Nice hotel,"Modern hotel in a great location.  Rooms are well appointed with large beds.  We did get upgraded to a corner room.

The downside for us was that most of the staff was not well trained, with Renata and Darren and the breakfast staff as pleasant exceptions.  For example, we were not told that their delicious breakfast was included until the third morning.  We were not told that the Wi-Fi connection instructions were via the TV, so the first night we keep getting kicked off.  The first 24 hours or so, the room was extremely cold regardless of the thermostat setting, so someone was sent up with a portable heater and another was sent to fix whatever was wrong.",3,2017,07,15
237,Great location for tourist,"We wanted a great hotel right along the River Liffey and we found it. We arrived at 5am from the airport and they graciously let us check into our room right away. The room was very modern, clean, comfortable, and you walk out the front door & you are right on the street that runs along the river Liffey. You can walk to the Temple Bar district easily in a few blocks or hop on the Belfast City Hop on/off tour bus just right down the street. From here we walked to the bus stop & boarded a  bus to Galway for under $20. Would definitely stay here again. ",5,2017,07,15
237,Made me feel like Royalty!,"Not sure what it is about going over seas and staying at a good hotel but they know how to do it right.  The staff was incredibly friendly.  Answered all our questions and we had a lot, also helped with good directions when we were leaving.  We were before our check in time but they go us right in.  Rooms are clean and comfortable.  We had an issue with our door.  The batteries had died and we couldn't get in.  The woman at the front desk dropped everything to help me out.  Breakfast is to die for.  Everything you could possibly want.  The eggs Benedict was incredible.  I love the welcome on the TV when we come in, the letter from the staff welcoming us, and then the extra water and chocolate bar on the bed when we've gone out.  Thank you so much, not only is the hotel in a great spot, the staff is truly what makes it the best.",5,2017,07,13
237,"Excellent location, clean rooms and extremely helpful staff","The hotel's location is perfect for anyone on business or is on holiday, it's walkable to all major attractions. The rooms are large, well equipped with everything you would need and are very clean. My only gripe would be that the shower wasn't that powerful but If I came back to Dublin I would look to stay here again for sure.",4,2017,07,12
237,"Great property, great staff, great location","Family of 4 thoroughly enjoyed a 1-night stay here. Booked 2 rooms using points.  I was Hilton Diamond at time of booking but only Gold as of arrival date. 

Arrived at hotel approx 10:30 am.  Rooms were not ready, as they were connecting rooms and one of the rooms had a very late checkout for the previous guest.

Staff kept us posted as we snoozed the time away in the lobby. Room 324 was ready at 12:45pm.  Room 325 still wasn't ready as of 3:45pm, but staff had offered us the use of a different 3rd floor room until 325 was ready. This wasn't necessary, so we didn't take the hotel up on the offer. 

The signature Doubletree chocolate chip with walnuts cookie tasted a bit different - was it a double chocolate dough instead of the usual (in the US) cookie dough?  Good cookie, just not quite the same as I've had in the states. 

The staff at front desk were excellent, giving us good advice on sites and hop on/off bus.

Breakfast was high quality. Honeycomb was a great surprise. Baked goods were very good. We received buffet and also ordered from the menu at no charge.

Great location, 50 meters off the River Liffey and near lots of the action - 2-3 minute walk to Halfpenny Bridge. 

Rooms very well done. This is branded as a boutique hotel under the Hilton umbrella, and that's exactly what it felt like - in a GOOD way. 

Smaller property, NOT a high volume tour bus type location.

Beds were very comfortable as one would expect of a property in this caliber.

Overall, a great stay. One of the better stays in our several European trips across various Hilton, Starwood, and Radisson Blu properties. Although we booked with points, we were treated as valued guests just the same.

No complaints. Highly recommend.",5,2017,07,12
237,Top Hotel,"The whole experience at the Morrison was most enjoyably.
Rooms were clean with a modern design theme and we found them very quiet.
Apart from learning about Dublin and seeing the sites, we attended a wedding just over the border in Co Wicklow.
The staff (Darren in particular), were most helpful in organising taxi's to and from the event and we were told to contact them should we have ANY problems. As it happens, everything worked out perfect.
The Morrison, overlooking the River Liffey, is in a very good position for seeing all the sites. Just minutes from O'Connell Street and Temple Bar and about 10 minutes from Grafton Street.
There are good hop on-hop off bus tours on Grafton Street which allow a flavour of the city and sites.",5,2017,07,12
237,Great Hilton Property!,"I am a Gold/Diamond Hilton Honors member so I have stayed at MANY Hilton properties. The Morrison was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. We arrived early from a ""red-eye"" and they did not have a room for us. However, they took our luggage and held it for us. When we returned a few hours later, they had it waiting for us in our room. The room was very nice and very quite (particularly since it is on a busy street). The breakfast was AMAZING! They had a real honeycomb!!! It was exceptional. The staff were very helpful and it is close to everything. Highly recommend!",5,2017,07,10
237,Great location,We loved our stay here. Wonderful service and the room was perfectly situated in Dublin. Couldn't have asked for a better stay. The only annoying thing is that you need to use your key to use the elevator...kind of inconvenient.,5,2017,07,10
237,Morrison Bar and Grill a horrible experience,"The hotel itself was very nice with good accommodations and clear rooms.  We rented two rooms for 3 nights and ate breakfast at the hotel every morning.  The experience that ruined the stay for us was at the Bar and Grill run by the hotel.  We went for their afternoon high tea.  We were treated rudely by the waiter, sat at a dirty table and he did not take our order for high tea but simply gave us two cups of tea with three small items to eat with each cup.  He never gave us silverware or napkins and never asked what the third member of our party wanted to eat.  When I complained to the hotel concierge I was first asked to come down to the front desk.  I declined.  I told what happened.  Then the Bar and Grill manager called.  I was again asked to come down.  I declined.  I told the story again.  They contacted me 3 more times - said they would pay the $7 bill for the tea and at 8:00 PM told us to order anything on the room service menu.  Since we had already eaten dinner by that time we did not do that.  When we left the next day, the front desk again mentioned this experience when we checked out.  When I checked the bill later they had not taken the $7 off the bill.  It was a horrible experience and the hotel handled it very badly.  I had to talk to 3 people about an experience that I found embarrassing and humiliating.  We spent over $2000 at the hotel and they did nothing for us after this experience. I am a Hilton Honors member and expected better.   I also tried to find an email where I could send an email once I returned home and there is no email on the website.  Very frustrating.  I would not recommend this hotel.",2,2017,07,08
237,Morrison Hotel by Hilton,"this is the  perfect location if you want to be in the heart of Dublin but across the River Liffey from Temple Bar area which I highly recommend.  Easy walking distance to everything you wan to experience but not right in the middle of the ""tourist"" section of Dublin",5,2017,07,08
237,The perfect spot in Dublin,"Regrettably, we only stayed at The Morrison in Dublin two nights. They get all the major things right: comfort (large, comfortable bed, roomy bath and shower), style (chic lobby and bar) and location (close to Temple Bar and other attractions, yet far enough away to be quiet). There are also lots of small touches that make The Morrison stand out, including an excellent staff. (Our barmaid provided some excellent dinner recommendations!). I couldn't imagine a better base from which to explore Dublin!",5,2017,07,06
237,Look No Further When in Dublin,"By far, the best hotel in Dublin. The hotel itself is impeccable, extremely clean, and the staff welcoming and professional. The location is perfect. You avoid the noise and activity associated with a stay in the Temple Bar area, yet a 2-minute walk across the bridge and you're in the heart of Temple Bar. For those with a car, the public parking garage is a block away and the hotel validate your ticket for reduced rates. We won't stay anywhere else on future visits. And of course, the fresh warm cookies top it all off!",5,2017,07,06
237,Overnight stay at Morrisons hotel,"We stayed here on the 2nd July. The staff right through the hotel were excellent and so friendly, nothing was too much trouble, any member of staff greeted you beat at reception, hallways or cleaning rooms.  Felt the bedroom was very tight on space and for the price I expected more, also the room had only one chair to sit on,two would be nice but then where would you put it. The bed was very comfortable",4,2017,07,04
237,"Perfect location, great hotel","The Morrison is perfectly located at the heart of Dublin just a hundred meter from the famous temple bar street and few hundred meters from the Dublin castle and 15 min walk from the Guinness store house. The hotel is very chic, nice clean modern rooms and great service. Highly recommended.",4,2017,07,04
237,Perfect location,"Only stayed one night, but would recommend the hotel. It is well located to walk all the major sites. Comfortable room and bed with nice Crabtree & Evelyn toiletries. Staff were helpful. Did not sample any food there during our stay. ",4,2017,07,04
237,"Two different stays, different experiences, overall good","Stayed here for two separate two night stays. 

First stay was a bit tough. We arrived early and were able to check in early and headed to our first room, a king junior suite. It was December and cold outside, but we expected the heat to keep us warm, but it never really warmed up. Hot water was also a bit challenging, not sure why! 

Second stay two days later was exceptional. Was during New Year's Eve and day and opted for the king one bedroom suite. Boy we're we surprised. This ended up being a MASSIVE suite with a full dining table, complete with its own Christmas tree, a very large sofa sectional and living area, and a huge bedroom with a giant shower and large luxury soaking tub. Full size fridge and giant minibar too, to go along with the built in stereo, mood lighting, and seating all along the windows. 

Oh and did I forget the corner wraparound walkout balcony? Overlooking the river! Just a short walk to temple bar area and easy to get to! 20 minutes from airport via taxi. The extra couple of bucks was definitely worth it to enjoy this massive suite! Would stay here again, but go for the one bedroom suite only! 

Note - room service menu is limited late night, so be sure to pick up snacks if you don't like the selection!",4,2017,07,03
237,A great hotel in central Dublin,This doubletree is beautiful and the staff is great. The food and ambiance is fantastic and the location just off the river Liffey is a perfect place to navigate the city. You are close to great pubs including temple bar and also sites like trinity college and st Stephens green. It's a perfect place for a business traveler or family esxcursion.,5,2017,07,03
237,Great!!,"Perfect Dublin location! Great service ( chocolate chip cookie at check-in a plus). Comfortable rooms, nice view of the river and beautiful decorations. It has a small gym (which we could not find in other hotels). We would definitely go back! ",5,2017,07,03
237,Perfect location!,"The Morrison is the perfect location to stay in Dublin!  It's within walking distance to Trinity College, Guinness Storefront, Temple Bar, and many other attractions.  The hotel itself is great...very modern & chic.  The staff were very friendly.  I would recommend this hotel to anybody looking for a place to stay in Dublin.",5,2017,07,03
237,Hilton Morrison,"Hotel is billed as one of the most notable visually but it looks like a hang out for pre-teens at a mini mall. Staff was fine.  They didn't have an extra blanket - said it was because they were ""full"" - I guess you only get the basics if the hotel isn't booked. Despite high quality coffee across Ireland, theirs was not drinkable. ",2,2017,07,02
237,"Great hotel, great location ","I'm staying here for a week on vacation and have found this hotel to be great. The staff is extremely friendly, the location is perfect, and the hotel is modern and clean. I'll definitely be back on my next Dublin getaway. ",5,2017,07,02
237,Stylish and well-located for tourists.,"Pros:  elegant and stylish hotel, super helpful staff, conveniently located for tourists.
Cons:  poor use of closet space for hanging clothes, lack of drawers.

Beautifully appointed hotel with staff that couldn't be more friendly and helpful.  Husband there on business; I played tourist.  Despite poor space-planning in room for storage, I would certainly return.  It was a minor inconvenience overall.",4,2017,07,01
237,"Nice room, great location","The hotel is located just across the river from the Temple Bar area. The rooms are comfortable and well appointed. The front desk staff was very helpful. Nice place to stay in Dublin. One problem, though, is that the signage is very poor. Drove past the place twice before we stopped.",5,2017,06,30
237,Dublin,"We had a grand visit to Dublin, our excuse was seeing Jackson Browne at Vicar Street but who needs an excuse for a weekend away anyway?
We flew in and caught the airport bus, all very straightforward. The Morrison overlooks the river opposite Temple Bar. Fir us this was an ideal location, close but not too close!
The hotel was smart, clean and comfortable. Reception staff were very friendly and the traditional warm chocolate cookie (a Doubletree special ) was very welcome after our journey. 
Breakfast was plentiful and it was great to be able to visit the breakfast bar with its assortment of breads, cooked foods, cheeses, yoghurts etc as well as order from the breakfast menu.
We would definitely return to The Morrison. ",4,2017,06,30
237,Morrison Double Tree in Dublin,"Double tree  morrison
Convenient location to Guinness storehouse, Trimity college, Temple Bar. Parking lot half block away. 
Enjoyable stay. Nice restaurant and breakfast room , complimentary WiFi, even an umbrella in the closet if you need one ( we didn't).",5,2017,06,29
237,Great location!,"My husband and I stayed here for three days recently. The hotel's location is great as a home base for exploring Dublin. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. Our room overlooked the street/river, but it was not noisy at all. 

The hotel staff members were great. We only had one minor service issue in the bar, but otherwise everyone was wonderful. We'd gladly stay here upon return to Dublin.",5,2017,06,29
237,A lovely hotel,"The Morrison was my home during a ten-day visit to Dublin  The rooms are very attractive and modern looking, and the staff is superb--friendly and quick to help with
needed services.  Thank you to all the staff, and especially to Anna who went out of her way to be helpful.",5,2017,06,28
237,You can't beat this location for a trip to Dublin,"First time in Ireland and was recommended this hotel by my brother.  He was right.  The location is excellent.  We walked to Temple Bar, Trinity College, and even to the Guinness store.  We did take a local bus (for 2 euros each) to the Kilmainham Jail though.  Rooms were clean and comfortable with nice amenities but no wonderful views.  Upgrades weren't available because it was sold out.  However the  friendly and helpful staff and breakfast buffet stick out as major reasons to come back.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Morrison to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2017,06,28
237,Awesome Hotel in Dublin,"This hotel is awesome.  The hotel is super clean and the location can't get any better - walking distance to the temple bar and Grafton street area with  many shops, restaurants and pubs.  The hotel is very modern with minimal but very chic décor. I highly recommend this hotel and plan to stay here the next time I'm in Dublin.",5,2017,06,28
237,"Great location, great hotel","Stayed at this hotel for business a few years ago, so knew what to expect, although it is now even better than previously.  Location is great for getting around easily and rooms are spacious, modern and quiet.  Food in restaurant is good and breakfast exceptional.  What really makes this hotel stand out is the staff.  They are all extremely friendly and also polite, but not in the least stuffy.

Thank you and will definitely stay again.",5,2017,06,27
237,Perfect location,"Stayed here for three nights last week and would certainly return.  Front desk staff are friendly, helpful and efficient, rooms are a generous size and amenities are good quality.  The location is hard to beat, just on the riverfront across from the Temple Bar district ... walk to everywhere.  Lots of positives for this hotel, and really only one major negative - the free in-house wifi is extremely weak and was generally not connectable during our stay.",4,2017,06,27
237,Great hotel - great location!,LOVED this hotel. Extremely clean!!  Updated rooms and decor. Staff was very attentive and helpful. We ate in the bar and restaurant while there. Food was great. Salmon and filet worth going back for. Will stay here again!!  Great short walk to Temple Bar area and shops.,5,2017,06,26
237,Superb Hospitality,"I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights just over a week ago.  From the moment you walk into the hotel the staff can't do enough for you.  They are so helpful and polite.  It was a pleasure to stay here. Lovely rooms, excellent service, good food.  What more could you want.",5,2017,06,26
237,Great Location,"The hotel is walking distance to most attractions in Dublin. It is on a busy street. The rooms are comfortable, our room #304 was looking at an alley. The rooms are small and a bit cheesy modern with lighted with colors. It has a wide range of coffee and teas but no cream or milk. ",4,2017,06,25
237,The Best of Dublin,"This hotel has everything you need right where you need it.  Its location in the center of Dublin is a short walk to Temple Bar, the North Side, and every possible attraction you need.  The hotel is super clean, modern and very comfortable. The rooms are clean, comfortable and very nicely decorated (very contemporary).  Best WIFI I have had in a hotel. You could not find a better place to stay when visiting the wonderful city.",5,2017,06,25
237,Nice stay,"We had a nice weekend stay in this hotel. Conveniently located from airport bus stop (5 minute walk) and DART train station (10 minutes, we were lucky with the weather and had no problems getting around. Our room was quiet, although we heard some complaints from other guests about noise bleed from Saturday evening live music downstairs. Restaurant is excellent.  And the wait staff was kind and helpful. The only negative was air blower in the room directed on bed making a draft when it was turned on. We will likely choose this hotel again on our next visit to Dublin.",4,2017,06,25
237,Loved the Morrison,"Hotel was clean and well maintained, rooms nicely fitted out, breakfast was tasty and well presented, complete with excellent barista-made coffees.  Location is central, but a bit removed from noisier nightlife.  The best part is the staff, who were unfailingly kind and helpful.  The best of this excellent group was DARREN, Concierge, who was kind, energetic and determined that we should have the best possible Dublin experience.  It means a  great deal in a strange city to feel that hospitality!  I would not look elsewhere for accommodations when I visit Dublin again!",5,2017,06,23
237,Great accommodation in a great location ,"We stayed over the long weekend as part of our six weeks travelling the UK and Ireland.   Room was very spacious and comfortable.   Great bed.   Good car parking option nearby.  Very good service from all the staff.  Fantastic location - easy walk to most of the city sites and areas.
Would definately stay again. ",5,2017,06,20
237,Second visit to the Morrison and will go back every time,"Wonderful property in Dublin - great location across the river from the Temple Bar scene, shopping, and attractions.  Convenient to walk everywhere.  Hotel has nice rooms, comfy beds, nice bathrooms.  Staff is super helpful and friendly.  The bar is my favorite place - David, the bar tender makes wonderful drinks and is a sweet nice person to chat with.  Food at the bar is really good too.  I've had curry both times and it was delicious.  ",5,2017,06,19
237,It's been better,Stayed here quite a few times but seems to have gone off the boil. Rooms beginning to look tired and common areas definitely need a refresh. Great breakfast and good staff good location for Temple Bar and walk to city centre. ,3,2017,06,19
237,Beautiful Hotel ,"My wife and I just are in the middle of a three night stay at the Morrison Hotel Dublin and my only regret is that we aren't staying longer. The staff had been amazingly helpful, accommodating, friendly and welcoming. The room is neat , clean and comfortable. Our little oasis in central Dublin. The food (breakfast and dinner so far) had been very good. The Jospeh grill makes for some extremely tasty grilled meats. Really, really VERY good. And I don't think one could find a better location in central Dublin. I highly recommend The Morrison and will definitely stay here on my next visit to Dublin. Slainte!!",5,2017,06,19
237,Experience the FULL IRISH at The Morrison,"Being a frequent guest at various Hilton properties it was time I used some of the points for a free stay and The Morrison was the perfect property for the points to be redeemed at for my parents 50th wedding anniversary trip starting in Dublin.
Located on the north side of the Liffey, The Morrison allows you to be in the heart of the action but with none of the unpleasantness that can sometimes come with being in the heart of the action.  The hotel is refined and sexy in every way, from lighting to the bathroom to the clean lines in the rooms.  We had peaceful sleeps, good water pressure and our multiple requests for extra glasses or the like were all met with smiles from the accommodating staff.
The Morrison is a block from a SPAR, Starbucks, the DART, Temple Bar district and bus lines to the Guinness Storehouse and more.  Starting and ending your day in Dublin by crossing the Liffey over the Ha Penny bridge allows your senses to reset and for you to realize how lucky you are to visit such a great city.  The Morrison fits perfectly into the dream that is Dublin.",5,2017,06,17
237,Great location in the heart of Dublin,"The Morrison is a terrific property for location, value and accommodations in the heart of Dublin.  The rooms are spacious and clean, the staff is extremely courteous and helpful.  The breakfast was terrific and there is a really nice restaurant on the premises.  I did not have dinner there, but it looked and smelled delicious!  The Morrison would be my choice if I visit Dublin again.",5,2017,06,17
237,"Dublin, Ireland",Hotel was right on the river and accessible to everything Dublin has to offer.  The staff was extremely personable and very knowledgeable about all the places to visit.  Rooms were very clean and quiet.  An outstanding experience!,5,2017,06,16
237,Outstanding property and service,The staff at this property is outstanding. They are very accommodating and friendly. The location is ideal and the facility has top notch amenities. Darren who  works at the front desk could not do enough to help us. I travel often and would rate the service world class.  If staying in Dublin I would make this your preferred location to stay.,5,2017,06,15
237,Double Tree Hilton - Dublin,Centrally located. An easy walk from train and shopping and dining. The property is well maintained and very efficient staff. Breakfast was well presented and offered a great selection of good. food.   The Internet in lobby was fantastic. In the room it was slow and spotty though...  The only thing that was a bit strange the toilet is part of the sink unit; where the bathroom had all sorts of unused space.,4,2017,06,14
237,Lovely location ,"The hotel is located near the river and it's easy to reach everything in the city. The hotel is very smart and the staff were really helpful. The room was a good size, with a massive bed. It was a bit more expensive than some other hotels in Dublin but it was high quality and worth paying a little extra.",4,2017,06,14
237,"Very nice, but standard DoubleTree","If you're looking for something with a European or Irish flair, this is not it.  If however, you're looking for a standard DoubleTree property, this is it.  It was clean, well-staffed (with VERY helpful staff!), and a reliable location.

One thing to note, it's a bit difficult to find due to the signage.  Be sure and look for the Morrison, not DoubleTree.

The breakfast buffet was plentiful and fresh, with meats, cheeses, breads and fruit.",4,2017,06,12
237,"Excellent, Centrally-located Hotel in Dublin","Very fine rooms, excellent staff, an especially good location in Dublin.  Breakfast very good with  wide variety of offerings.  Excellent wi-fi.  Literally a few steps from the Millenium Bridge, and then a few more steps into the heart of Temple Bar....5 minutes max.  A cab to the airport for 4 people with plenty of luggage should be ~€23.",5,2017,06,12
237,"Amazing hotel, amazing staff!","The Morrison is in an ideal location overlooking the Liffey, literally steps from the Millennium Bridge. I had a room overlooking the river and I highly recommend this option! The room was extremely quiet even though there is a busy street only 3 floors below which really amazed me. The room is beautiful with a very unique layout and color scheme. I had breakfast at the Halo restaurant on site each morning and was very impressed with the options, including the in-house barista!  As great as the hotel itself is the best feature by far was the staff! Everyone from the Concierge at the front desk to the hostess at the restaurant went above and beyond my expectations at every turn.",5,2017,06,12
237,Great visit to Dublin,We recently stayed at The Morrison in Dublin Ireland. The location is perfect. Easy walking distance to many tourist attractions. The staff was wonderful. Very friendly and helpful. And our breakfast at the hotel was delicious. My only issue was the bed was very hard. ,4,2017,06,11
237,Great hotel with excellent stagf,"I stayed in the Morrison for one night as part of a visit to Dublin to watch a concert at Slane Castle. 

On arrival (9am) my room wasn't ready but the receptionist / concierge (Darren) was excellent, took my bag, gave me my cookie and water and couldn't of been more helpful. I explained I was going to the concert at Slane and he offered shower facilities if required and told me my bags would be taken to the room once ready. I called back at the hotel before heading to Slane at 1pm and the very friendly and professional lady on reception advised the room still wasn't ready but I was offered a different type of room but chose to stick with the room I had chosen...as I was heading out of the door on the way to Slane the receptionist caught up with me to offer an umbrella, a few extra bottles of water and another cookie for my trip.

Once checked in My room had a view over the river, large double bed, huge wide screen tv and a very modern look. The room and bathroom were spotlessly clean and had a number of amenities that were a nice touch. I called reception to see if I could keep the room until 2pm and my request was granted with no extra charge.

Not cheap but very nice hotel in a perfect location with brilliant staff..",5,2017,06,11
237,Last night in Ireland,"We ended our 9 day trip in Ireland at The Morrison prior to flying home.  This hotel is located in a great area to explore the downtown area of Dublin, see the sites, walk the historic streets and find a great pub or restaurant.  The accommodations are very nice, clean rooms, quiet.  And of course the cookie was warm and tasty.  The only thing is to be aware there is no valet service so you will have to self park in a nearby offsite parking garage and carry your luggage to the hotel at check in and back to your car when departing.",5,2017,06,11
237,Amazing Hotel!,"First time in Dublin.  I did not know anything about this Doubletree except that it was centrally located in Dublin.  The room photos looked beautiful.. Flight got in from NY  one hour early 6 am.  Arrived at the hotel by 7:30 am.  We were accommodated with an early check-in by 10:30 am.  Concierge gave us cold water bottles and directed us to the lounge for a light breakfast.  Amazing pastries, coffee and tea all for a small fee.  Room was sooo beautiful.. Totally contemporary, softly lit with pink led lights, completely brand new.  Not much drawer space for a week's visit, but adequate.  Bathroom was amazing with rainfall shower head. Crabtree and Evelyn shampoo, conditioner, soaps and lotions.  Fell into a deep, restful sleep.  Bring a US electric converter for the plugs.  Hotel will supply, if you forget.  Breakfast was part of our stay and was the best ever.  Endless choices from Euro style to full American all included.  Wait staff could not do enough for us.  Really, sincerely out to please.  Impeccably clean hotel all around.  Located on the river and within walking distance to everything imaginable.  Best shiopping ever when you turn left going out of the hotel.  Food choices everywhere.  Hotel staff went out of their way to help book tours and guide us about what to see and do.  They actually came out from around the desk to map out our day!  This level of service is to be commended!  They even arranged our 5:30 am cab to airport a week later and sent us off with a grab and go breakfast!  Warning!!  Get to the airport 3 HOURS before your flight  You have to be interviewed before you start the check-in process.  You better know specifics about what you did in Ireland all week, because the interview if pretty intense.  You then go through security twice and customs once.  Can be a lengthy process.  Some people were panic stricken thinking they were going to miss their flights!  Anyway, Morrison is the best hotel I ever stayed in worldwide!",5,2017,06,10
237,Great Location for Exploring Dublin,"Would I stay here again?  As a long-time Hilton Honors member, absolutely.

As expected at a Hilton Doubletree, the staff was extremely courteous and cooperative Hilton’s are always clean and comfortable, something that is easy to take for granted for those who use Hilton’s frequently.

The Morrison is obviously a property bought and retrofitted by Hilton.  It sits directly on the north bank of the Liffey River directly across from |Temple Bar on the south, Our room, 431, was a bit smaller than is normally associated with Doubletrees in the US, but very acceptable for an urban European setting and with a great view of the Liffey River, the bridges and the south bank.

The eating area for breakfast is very modern, pleasant, two tiered and spacious with good selection and large screen televisions for the morning news.

Because it is in the heart of Dublin, navigating the one-way traffic pattern is a bit of a struggle, especially for the U.S. driver who just rented their right-hand driver car from the airport;-}  The hotel does not have a true formal front, but the reservations desk is inside a double door off of the Jervis Street side, with two street-side spaces available for loading.  If driving, I’d advise unloading your things before parking your car.

Parking is at the public Jervis Street Garage ½ block up the street.  There is a daily fee, but the Hilton desk can stamp your ticket so that you receive a discount when you pay at the garage. Be warned.  Parking garages in Ireland are much tighter than in the US, and require considerable care when negotiating turns, etc.",4,2017,06,10
237,Location,"The Morrison is in a great location, it is Walking distance from Temple Bar, and bus stops. The room was very nice, clean and very little outside noise. Beds are very comfortable. WiFi was good. Staff was very professional and accommodating at all times. Our stay was for 3 nights.",4,2017,06,07
237,Second visit to the Hotel and it wasn't as nice.,"Returning for a second stay at this hotel, I was very disappointed.  Granted the hotel is in a great location and the rooms are very comfortable but all this comes for a price.  It isn't cheap to stay here and unfortunately I had a misunderstanding with the front desk and they did not make an effort to appease my displeasure.  I won't be back. Dublin has so many wonderful hotels that it's no great loss.  The Morrison is off my list.",2,2017,06,06
237,"Comfortable if slightly quirky hotel, in a convenient location","The Morrison is very well located. On the riverfront opposite the Temple Bar district. O'Connell Street and Trinity College are all withing easy walking distance.

We found the staff more than helpful and friendly. The room itself was of a ""standard"" size for Europe. The decor a little quirky with the decoration of hand written poetry on the walls (I have no issue with that per se, but it was a little different).  The hotel offers a discount for parking at a garage about 50 metres along the street - very handy as we had a car.

The breakfast was excellent - great choices all round.

Price wise Dublin appears to be an expensive city in which to stay. The Morrison, whilst expensive in itself, was more than competitive relative to other hotels I looked at in Dublin.  

Overall, a very pleasant stay.",5,2017,06,06
237,Romantic getaway to propose to my partner ,"From the minute we walked into reception on Friday at 9.30pm to leaving at 5pm Monday we were so impressed with everything. The staff were more than helpful always willing to help with where to visit and the best things to do. The duty manager Jason went out of his way on numerous occasions to make us feel welcome and helped planning my proposal and when we returned the room was done out amazing.... the food was of the very highest standards and we enjoyed 3 meals in the restaurant. On a down side we had to endure the noise of the tv from the bar area while our romantic meal on Saturday and the bar prices are rather expensive but we found that in Dublin they were everywhere maybe this is just at weekends for example pint of bitter half of lager in England  £3.60 dublin €10!!! 
We would love to return and recommend the Morrison to anyone 
",5,2017,06,06
237,Perfection!,"From the moment you arrive you will feel the Irish hospitality.  The hotel couldn’t do enough for you.  Although the room wasn’t ready for us (we arrived early) our bags were tagged and locked away while we had an excellent lunch in their coffee shop on the ground floor.  The room was clean and comfortable with robes and slippers and replenished toiletries etc.  The hotel is very well run, the staff are helpful and cheerful and it’s in a central location. I wouldn’t hesitate to return and would recommend this for business or pleasure.",5,2017,06,05
237,Great location and friendly staff,"Stayed here for 4 nights.  Twin room was big enough to share, which is a pleasant surprise in a European city.  Very friendly and accomodating staff in the bar and restaurants, although some seemed a little new to the menus and or systems. Breakfast was just ok and the set up was confusing.  Morrison Grill was terrific for dinner.  The Gentleman's Tea wasn't quite a ""tea"" experience, but wow, was the food delicious!  Enjoyed my stay very much!",4,2017,06,04
237,Enjoyed all 6 nights here recently.,We had nights here on both ends of our trip to Ireland.  So we enjoyed two different rooms but each one was great.  It is on the north side of the River Liffey and so just a little removed from some of the noise and bustle.  We had the option of breakfast each day and found it more than adequate as it had a buffet as well as a menu you could order  from.  The hotel allowed us a later check-out on the day we were leaving which made our travels more convenient.,5,2017,06,04
237,One night stay for two,"My husband and I stayed here for one night  whilst visiting Dublin. I am glad that I chose this hotel over others. It was clean, modern, comfortable with incredibly friendly and attentive staff. I am a Hilton honours member which obviously helps but aside from that the location is perfect and the rooms very spacious and clean.",4,2017,06,01
237,Thank you Darren,"My husband (a Hilton Honors Diamond Club Member) and I recently stayed twice in the Morrison Hotel and have to say nothing but great things about it.  What stood out during our last visit at the end of January was Darren.  Darren was not only helpful, he portrayed excellent Customer Service.  His recommendations were greatly appreciated.  Darren is a real gentleman.  We look forward to returning to your Hotel again at the end of June for our 30th Anniversary and having a chat with Darren.  Thank you Darren, you are a real role model for others in the Hotel Industry.",5,2017,05,31
237,Epic Stay on the Liffey,"We had a wonderful, albeit too brief stay at the Morrison Hotel. The entire staff, from the concierge desk to the Halo restaurant staff, to the cleaning staff, were gracious, kind, and welcoming. The hotel is very modern and clean. Our room had a gorgeous view overlooking the Liffey River. The location is perfect, a minutes walk to a bridge and Dublin's south side. The hotel offers multiple restaurants and complimentary WiFi. I highly recommend staying at the Morrison and will definitely stay the next time I am visiting Dublin.",5,2017,05,30
237,Top Notch!!!,"As a Hilton Diamond member I stay at a lot of hotels. The Morrison's staff is the most accommodating and welcoming I've ever experienced!!!

They helped make my first trip to Ireland unforgettable!

I truly look forward to returning...",5,2017,05,30
237,Very nice hotel and staff in a great location,"My wife and I planned a nine day excursion to Ireland.  We started in Dublin at this hotel and were so happy the reviews, photos etc. were what we were hoping for after a long flight from the US.  The staff could not have been more friendly.  The hotel is very nice and in a perfect location.  We were able to walk everywhere to see the Jameson Distillery, Guinness storehouse, temple bar district with more restaurants to satisfy your every need.",4,2017,05,29
237,5-star Service and a Delicious Breakfast,"We were very pleased with the Morrison. Starting with our hot cookie at check-in and continuing to the ultra-modern room with pink, led-lighted accents, amazing shower and very friendly and helpful staff, our visit was near perfect. 
Everyone was very friendly and the service was truly superior. We ate dinner in the restaurant there one night and the food was delicious, although the service was a little less amazing there. I think our waiter had something else on his mind as he was not as attentive as we would have liked. I'm still giving the hotel a total of five stars as overall, our experience was one of luxury, kindness and comfort.",5,2017,05,28
237,Great location and amazing breakfast buffet!,"We spent 2 nights at The Morrison during our Dublin stay. What I loved about the hotel was the location, which was just across the bridge from Temple Bar, the great breakfast buffet selection, and the wonderful beds. The bathroom could have used better lighting and our view was the back alley. I tried to get a room with a view on the river side, but there weren't any to choose from. ",4,2017,05,28
237,Perfection!,"My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights and were completely amazed! The staff went out of their way to assist us including carrying in our luggage upon arrival. The room we stayed in; king suite, was HUGE! The room was super clean, loads of room for all of our clothes and the room temperature was great. The bathroom was truly amazing; spa like with a large soaking tub, walk in shower and a VERY long counter for all our toiletries.  We ate in the Morrison Grill twice and really enjoyed the excellent service and great food! We even got a copy of the recipe for Guinness bread!!! The location was PERFECT! Walking distance to Temple Bar, Trinity College, Grafton Street, St Patrick's Cathedral, Brazen Head Bar, and many, many more sites we visited. I cannot imagine staying anywhere else when we return. Thank you for taking such great care of us.",5,2017,05,28
237,Great hotel at a great location,"Stayed in this hotel for 5 days during my trip to Dublin. The best thing about this hotel is its location. Right at the center of the city, next to the river, walking distance from the Temple bar. The staff here were very friendly and courteous. The breakfast was good, but had the same menu all days I stayed. The room ambience was very good. Overall had a very good stay in this hotel",5,2017,05,28
237,Great Hotel with Excellent Staff,"I recently stayed at the hotel with my best friend while on vacation from Florida.  We both work for hotel companies & it takes something great to impress me.  Every staff member we encountered was amazing and they all went above & beyond to make sure we had a great stay, from making restaurant suggestions to helping us arrange transportation and anything in between.  The room was very comfortable.  I have to mention that the housekeeping staff was fantastic.  Their attention to detail was the best I've experienced.  Hotel location was perfect for everything we wanted to see.  I would recommend The Morrison to anyone that was traveling to Dublin.",5,2017,05,27
237,Great Place to Experience Dublin,"Having arrived on a 5:15 A.M flight from the U.S, I had inquired when placing my reservation, whether I might be allowed an early-early check-in time.  I offered to pay extra, but was told the prospect for early check-in was unlikely. When the front desk attendant went out of his way to allow me into a room, I knew there was little that would sway my instant high opinion of The Morrison. The room was well appointed, and the hotel's location did provide ample distance from the rowdy nightlife of the Temple Bar area, yet was within easy walking distance of all other Dublin sights I wished to experience.
The best asset The Morrison has is the front desk gentleman named Darren(?). This red haired Irishman exuded warmth and friendliness.  Nothing seemed to be too much to ask of him as he responded to any request with enthusiastic action. When I asked for clarification on how to work the room's security safe, Darren promised to meet me in the room to demonstrate how it worked.  I told him not to bother, but by the time I had gotten off the elevator and found my way to my room, there was Darren, huffing only a little after his sprint up the stairs. Darren should be used by Hilton Hotels as a model of what excellent customer service is all about.",5,2017,05,26
237,A wonderful stay at The Morrison...,"We stayed at The Morrison over the weekend of the 20th May 2017 as part of a larger family group. Our stay was totally enjoyable, the staff were wonderful, helpful and attentive at all times. As a city centre hotel it was busy yet unhurried and the staff and management were very much in evidence and helpful. The food was first class and arrived promptly, bar service was quick and friendly, all in all, a wonderful experience.Thank you.",5,2017,05,25
237,"First stay, will be my first choice for business","I'll be a regular visitor to Dublin and this hotel will be a regular feature in my visits. Everything you'd expect - clean rooms, freindly staff, excellent location, good wifi. Had a room with no view and little natural light but knew this when I booked and not important for a business trip and with the City on your door step not a big issue. Breakfast could be cheaper (or included) but this is propably on trend with similar hotels in the City.",4,2017,05,24
237,Amazing hotel,"From the moment I walked into this hotel I knew I picked right! Check in was quick easy very helpful, the warm cookie was a lovely touch! Entered our beautiful spacious bright modern twin room greeted with name on tv! Room had bottled water mini bar fridge all the mod cons you could need! The bar downstairs has some amazing cocktails on offer & all staff that we met was very welcoming & made sure we were well looked after. We didn't have breakfast included in the room price, but we went down for breakfast anyway it was an expensive breakfast but very much worth it! Loved the smoothies in the old styled milk bottles! Location of the hotel is perfect you have a luas stop right behind the hotel (we used that to get to the 3 arena for a concert), main shopping area within walking distance, Temple bar straight across the water& grafton street just another short walk from there.",5,2017,05,23
237,Breakfast of dreams,"After waking up slightly worse for wear after a Dublin night out with the colleagues, we all headed down for breakfast. The spread was unbelievable! Everything you could possibly want. My favourite was honey straight from the hive. Only the appearance of avocado could have made it better. If you named any other brunch/breakfast option they would have it in some shape or form. I still have dreams of this breakfast! The hotel itself was lovely, and staff very helpful. Rooms exactly as expected. They even have freshly baked cookies at reception.",5,2017,05,23
237,Greg from SoCal,"Great hotel experience and a good 1st impression of Dublin  excellent amenities, most e,tensile menu for breakfast that rivals or exceeds one found on an luxury cruise. Staff was friendly, efficient and nice",5,2017,05,23
237,Amazing Hotel!,"My partner and I stayed in this hotel when we visited Dublin for his birthday and the hotel made the trip even more fantastic than it already was. The location was fantastic (a 10 min max walk from Temple Bar), the staff were brilliant from the moment we walked in until the second we left, the hotel and room were beautiful and spotless with everything we needed and more! The breakfast, restaurant food and bar was amazing (would definitely recommend eating in the restaurant one evening and having the breakfast)! I would recommend this hotel to anyone and will 100% be staying here again when I next visit the fantastic, lively city of Dublin. Could not fault my stay at this hotel.",5,2017,05,23
237,Awesome ,"Our first night in Ireland we stayed at The Morrison. The staff was wonderful and very accommodating. We arrived early in the morning and our room was not ready and they held our luggage so we could do a little sightseeing. Our room was decorated very modern, immaculate and extremely clean. The bar and restaurant was fantastic.This is 5 star hotel and highly recommend for your stay in Dublin.",5,2017,05,22
237,Morrison hotel anniversary night,My self and my wife stayed here for our first anniversary and we had the best experience ever we  were met by the manager on duty I think Jason was his name  when we arrived he got us a drink from the bar he checked us in really looked after us sent out bag to the room even sent chocolates up to his soon as he heard why we staying there all the staff were fantastic the only regret I have is. I should  have eaten  my dinner in the restaurant as the breakfast and all the food was amazing  I ate in a local restaurant but should stayed in the hotel we returned to the hotel and had lovely drinks in the bar that night in a great atmosphere I would recommend this hotel and best service to anyone you won't regret staying there ,5,2017,05,22
237,Warm and Caring Hospitality,"My second stay at The Morrison and I was once again delighted with the perfect location, right across the footbridge over the Liffy from Temple Bar, the well appointed rooms, excellent food and the best staff on earth. The warm and caring attitude with which they care for each guest makes this property my forever home in Dublin!",5,2017,05,22
237,Smart hotel,"A perfect location for our trip to Dublin.  Gorgeous decor, lovely welcoming staff.  We only used the room as a base so can't comment on the other facilities.  Spotlessly clean.  2 down points - patchy wifi and it's a pretty pricey place.  Would stay again but request a room away from the front - Dublin being a party town, the street noise increased the further into the weekend we got.  A small point for the benefit of other fellow light sleepers.",4,2017,05,20
237,Great Location,"Contemporary and very client-centered.  Our travel agent didn't make sure that my roommate and I had separate beds, so when we arrived, we found one bed.  But the hotel staff quickly rectified the situation and the lead front desk person moved our luggage herself.  Amazing.  Very helpful staff on other occasions as well that week.  Would definitely recommend this place...great location along the River Liffey.  Love love love Dublin!!!",4,2017,05,19
237,I Would Return Just For The Warm Cookie,"I booked this hotel as my mum wanted to visit Dublin for her birthday, and the location sounded perfect. Prior to arrival I emailed and asked for balloons and prosecco to be in the room for when we arrived. This was all done without any issues at all and when we arrived in our big spacious room lovely balloons, drink and a chocolate plate were on the table in the middle of the room. It wasn't the hotels fault that my mum was so in awe of the big, light airy room that she didn't even notice them!! Oh and the warm cookie on arrival was totally lush, stayed here for 4 nights and was hoping they would give us another one. 

Location of the hotel is great, the right side of the river and a short walk to Temple Bar (there are some fab pubs there with live Irish music during the day) and the hop on/off bus stop. 

We ate in the Restaurant one night and they had live music playing. You get a free glass of proscecco each (there is a theme here) if you are staying in the hotel and eat here. The food was delicious and service great. 

The only slight let down was that we asked Reception for recommendations on restaurants with live Irish music and/or entertainment and they couldn't come up with anything even though we said we were willing to get taxi's to places. On the way back to the airport the taxi driver was telling us about lots of restaurants with live music that we could have gone to that were great fun :(

All in all we had a great time and this is a lovely hotel, would recommend.",4,2017,05,17
237,Location! Location! Location!,"I stayed overnight at the hotel as part of a wedding event.  It was most comfortable and the staff was great.  Every effort was made by the staff to make the occasion memorable and enjoyable.  The event coordinator was particularly accommodating and did her best to make everyone feel welcome.
The hotel room was perfect with an interesting bath shower arrangement.
The location for tourists is particularly good as the hotel is in the center of Dublin City within walking distance from many attractions.",5,2017,05,16
237,Perfwct,"This hotel is perfectly situated for Dublin City centre!
The rooms are spacious and the breakfast is lovely. The decor in the hotel is also lovely. 
Whilst some may feel the hotel is pretentious it really isn't and feels very relaxed and informal. 
My only criticism is the evening restaurant.... having eaten here once before I won't be returning. The (possibly) Russian waiter was rude and very abrupt. 
I will happily stay here again !!
",5,2017,05,16
237,"Great Hotel, Wonderful Staff","My husband and I spent two nights at the Morrison during or honeymoon trip and were delighted with warm welcome we received particularly from Jane. Our room was not ready as we arrived early so we decided to have lunch and a drink at the bar. Our bartender, I believe he was from Italy although his name slips my mind, was great. He was very friendly and gave us recommendations on what to see or skip in the area. While at the bar we were greeted by Jane who was absolutely lovely. We informed her we were there on our honeymoon and she immediately went to tend to our room. She personally came to get us when it was ready and let us know she was unable to grant us an upgrade since the hotel was booked, but put us in a spacious room overlooking the courtyard. She even sent up champagne and little desserts. It was such a sweet gesture and little things like that make all the difference in customer service. Overall my husband and I were thrilled with our stay, it was very calm and quiet, the room was sleek and clean, and the room service was delicious. If we are ever back in Dublin The Morrison will definitely be our choice hotel!",5,2017,05,15
237,First time in Dublin,"Great hotel. Location was perfect. Just a short walk to all the major sites. Almost everything was within 20 minute walk including Guinness, Jameson, Temple bar district and trinity college.

Staff was amazing, especially Careline.",5,2017,05,13
237,Location,"We checked in with Violet.  She was very helpful and informative.  She has a great personality, bubbly - great for working the front desk.  We ate dry aged beef for supper.  I had mine medium.  If I could reorder, I probably would have gotten it medium rare. Still great.  Make sure you do breakfast.  It is a great start - Jason made sure to that.  Violet made our stay memorable.",5,2017,05,12
237,Beautiful hotel and great location,"My husband and I stayed at the Morrison for 2 nights. The location is perfect. It is quiet but close to the action. The rooms were modern,comfortable, and clean. The bar area was a nice place to relax after a day of touring the city. We would stay here again.",5,2017,05,11
237,Excellent Hotel,"My wife and I stayed at the Morrisson Hotel for a night, recently. The staff on reception were friendly and welcoming. This is a modern, luxurious hotel. It is close to the centre of Dublin. 

The room was spacious. The bed was king size. The room was quiet. 
Breakfast was of exceptional quality and variety. Again the serving staff were friendly and efficient. All and all a great experience. ",3,2017,05,11
237,Great location,"I've stayed in The Morrison on a number of occasions at this stage,the most recent a 3 night weekend stay. The location of the hotel is ideal,minutes from Henry Street and just over the historic ha'penny bridge from Temple Bar. Cinemas,restaurants and a Luas stop very close to the hotel so ideal for concert in the 3 Arena. Check-in was quick,staff are ever so efficient and welcoming  in this hotel,and on this occasion I was allocated room 340. The great thing about this hotel is that even though it's close to just about everything,the rooms are so quiet. Large bathroom and good choice of tv channels too,what's not to like. Well away from the roadworks also,very pleased. 
Can't really fault The Morrison,it's not cheap but one of the best in the city centre. ",5,2017,05,08
237,Nice hotel at the centre of the city,"It is little expensive but good quality and location. Everything is conveniently located: bars, restaurant, shopping, transportation etc. I stayed in a junior suite which was large and had a nice bathroom with huge tub.",4,2017,05,08
237,Dublin trip ,"Location, location made this hotel as a excellent choice for our stay in Dublin. It was a walking distance for all ours places and attractions we planned to visit. Very friendly hotel staff from check-in till last day. Room was very clean and for European standard big enough. Window can be open and is pleasant to have fresh air in the room. Mattress can be more comfortable and pillows are pretty big. Will be nice to have at least one smaller as a choice. Bath has a curtain and nice wide shower head. Was pretty quiet, no any noise to affect good night sleep. Nice selection of variety food including menu selection for the breakfast. Very good choice to stay in Dublin.",5,2017,05,08
237,"Great hotel, great location","A lovely little hotel in Dublin, just opposite the Temple Bar area over the river. 

The hotel is quite modern but warm and comfortable. The rooms are a good size, very well outfitted and laid out. The service is good. 

Definitely recommended. ",5,2017,05,07
237,Fantastic Location ,Modern hotel across the footbridge from Temple Bar area. Great location without the noise. Hotel is beautiful with very high ceilings in the common areas. Staff was friendly and very helpful with any issues. Breakfast was awesome! Highly recommend!,5,2017,05,07
237,Cool Hotel,"As far as DT Hilton's go this is one that is a little more up market.  Very good, clean rooms.

Bar is cool to have lunch and a drink but make sure you get out and about as there are lots of really great restaurants around.

Parking is in a public carpark, they do an overnight rate but it's about a 200 yard walk from the hotel and there is no valet parking.  Fine if it's sunny but not if it's raining.",4,2017,05,06
237,"Excellent hotel , excellent staff","I have stayed at the Morrison a few times and it never fails to deliver. While the location is great and the rooms excellent what stands out for me are the staff. In all areas they excude a great professionalism from the first greeting at reception to staff in the bar/grill , breakfast team etc. Breakfast is excellent with a wide range to suit all tastes. When you walk out the front door you are simply a few minutes away from O'Connell Street , Grafton Street , Temple Bar etc.",5,2017,05,05
237,Love it lov it lov it,"All was grate the location is one of the best shopping on one side and bars and resturants on the another side / room grate and staff I give them 10 out of 10 , I will stay on this hotel next I come to Dublin and I am thinking about to take my children next time , I recommend all to look at this hotels for couples or for companys to take the staff over weekend , this hotel and Locations is the best .",5,2017,05,03

237,"Above and beyond, seriously impressed!","The hotel staff were brilliant, we arrived a little after 9am and we were checked into our room (6 hours before our check-in!). This made such a difference to our first day,  allowing us to freshen up and relax before heading out to explore Dublin.

The rooms were very clean and modern, I will be honest the bed bases weren't the best and made noise just sitting on it, however the mattress was incredibly comfy! The bathroom was clean and nicely kept, on the whole a high standard.

The reception staff were brilliant, on hand with advise, giving little tips on where to catch busses and things similar.

Breakfast at the hotel, highly recommended and of a high standard, again nothing was too much trouble for the staff. I think it was very good value for money within the price. 

Ate at the restaurant in the hotel on the first night as it was Good Friday and had a brilliantly cooked steak, top marks!

Little tip, drinking is banned on the whole on Good Friday across Ireland and it's difficult to get a pint, however as resident of the hotel you're able to get a pint or two! 

Location is spot on, within striking distance of Temple Bar and really couldn't complain.

To get to the Hotel I would recommend the Green Bus/ 747 from the Airport, get the pass from the ticket office in terminal for as many days as you're there! As this also allows you on the hop on hop off city tour which I would recommend to get to know the city and takes you to all the places you would want to go to such as: Guinness Store House, Dublin Zoo and Kilmainham Gaol (book in advance and definitely worth it).

On the whole great stay and hard to pick fault with. If we were to return to Dublin, The Morrison would definitely be our 1st choice!",5,2017,05,02
237,Fabulous Hotel,"This was a great hotel!  The location was perfect. Close to temple bar district and yet far enough away for some peace and quiet. We had a river view room, beautiful views. Violet at the front desk was extremely helpful with assisting us getting a tour!  She was great!  Loved this vacation!",5,2017,05,02
237,Morrison,Perfect spot for the vacation traveler that's not for sure where to stay. The front desk was very helpful and was eager to please. Short cab ride to the Heuston train station. Had a river view room and was very pleased,5,2017,05,01
237,First Day in Dubline,"Fantastic experience. First of all, this hotel is in the perfect area of town which is across the bridge from the Temple Bar Area, which was the district we planned on staying in for the Dublin portion of our trip. The rooms are excellent but is is the staff that made this visit the best. The bar manager, bartenders, breakfast staff and reception staff were so friendly and gave the best advice.

We really didn't have much of a plan when we got there but they gave us everything we needed. We would absolutely stay here again with pleasure.

P.S. The hotel is one block from the National Leprechaun Museum. So fun!

237,Excellent hotel in every way (except restaurant),"Excellent hotel, superb service but skip the restaurant, food quality is poor and service isn't as good as hotel staff, our server seemed uninterested and abrupt...

I do still stay at this hotel on a fortnightly basis because it's definitely one of dublins best for the money, ",4,2017,04,28
237,Three nights at The Morrison,"We spent the first 3 nights of our vacation at The Morrison and couldn't be happier with our choice.  The location was excellent, right on the river and a block from a pedestrian bridge to Temple Bar.  We had requested a connecting room for our teenagers which was a perfect set up.  Rooms were clean, plenty of room and comfortable.  And the front desk staff was fantastic.",5,2017,04,28
237,"Great location, great hotel!","Stayed there for five days in late April 2017.
Cannot think of one complaint.
The location is outstanding, directly across the river from Temple Bar via walking bridge, so, it's quieter than staying in Temple Bar but only a couple hundred feet away from the activity. 
The hotel itself is very upscale with a sense of quaintness because of it's modest size. We upgraded to a corner suite overlooking the river (which I recommend if possible) the suite was roomy with a good sized sitting area plus a nice sized bedroom with king bed.
Each morning they have a wonderful breakfast menu in addition to a buffet of Irish breakfast items. We often would finish our day of touring with a night cap in the friendly modern bar.
We ate dinner at the Morrison Grill one evening, food was outstanding with service to match.
Walking distance to many attractions. Taxi to airport was 26 euro. Taxi to Connolly train station was 10 euro. 
Every staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful.",5,2017,04,27
237,Business trip,I liked a lot the decoration and the location is convenient. The stuff is very polite and professional.Breakfast is of very good quality and enough options. Faced some difficulties with the wash basin but they fixed it as soon as I notified them. I will visit again in the next business trip.,4,2017,04,26

237,Great Location,"The Morrison has a great location and a good value for a top notch hotel. It is near the Temple Bar action, but our rooms were quiet and we got a good night's sleep.  

Our family stayed for 3 nights. We walked to Temple Bar, O'Connell street, Grafton Street and Trinity College. 
The breakfast buffet has a nice selection, so even picky kids could find something to eat. 
The hotel staff were very nice and accommodating. ",5,2017,04,26

237,"Clean, modern, friendly, central. My new favourite hotel in Dublin.","A great find in the center of Dublin, The Morrison was recently renovated and is clean and modern. Personally it's my favorite hotel in Dublin, and I've stayed in many over the years.
The staff have been wonderful on every occasion that I've visited, the rooms are nice with good facilities, the breakfast is very good, the Morrison Grill is better than most hotel restaurants I've dined in (although it has some quirks - see separate review).
I have to say that I noticed a ""Terrible"" review from a guest saying he stayed in room 407 and felt boxed in. Well, I'm writing this review from that very room, have stayed here now for 8x nights, and I don't have a single negative thing to say about it. How anyone can rate this hotel as ""Terrible"" is beyond me, and it's simply wrong.
If I was forced to complain about anything I would have to say that the coffee served at breakfast is very bitter, even when ordered from the Barista. It's not a once off either, but every day they serve acrid coffee. I can brew much smoother, tastier, filter coffee at home in my 30 euro coffee maker. Must be the brand they use?",5,2017,04,25
237,Fab Hotel and staff,"Staff gave outstanding service, breakfast was delicious, with a wide selection to choose from. I had French toast and my sister had pancakes both were delicious. We got a complimentary warm chocolate cookie upon arrival which was also yum and an unexpected treat. In a brilliant location right beside Jervis st and the Luas stop. ",5,2017,04,24
237,Nice Stay,"I was able to spend a few nights in Dublin, and chose this hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews. I did not disappoint. After much frustration finding the hotel amid all the traffic, and then not having anywhere to park in front of the hotel to check in due to the crowd there, the rest of my stay was pleasant. The front of the hotel faces a side street that only has room for a few vehicles to park for check-in. There is no parking at the hotel, and no valet service. You have to park down the street at a public car park. The hotel does discount the parking rates there. My room was nice with adequate space, complementary bottles of water, a tea pot and a stocked minibar. The desk area had the power outlets located underneath the base of the TV, which was not convenient. The bathroom had space near the sink for my overnight articles, and nice shower with a curtain to keep water contained and away from the floors. The wifi was free and worked well. I only ate breakfast here, and it was nice, with some menu options available as part of the buffet. I also visited the bar one night, and the service was really bad. Eventually a manager had to take our order, and bring us our drinks. No other employees of the bar even looked in our direction.",4,2017,04,24
237,fantastic customer service,"This hotel , in my wife and I opinion is in an outstanding central location. But , to us , it has a customer service vibe that is over the top. From the minute you enter to when you leave you are aware of a genuinely warm welcoming feeling and a sincere willingness to do whatever can be done to make your stay outstanding. From an outstanding breakast buffet to a wonderful comfortable room , we just loved it. Two individuals stand out in our memory although everyone was great. Violeta really helped us in our decisions on where to tour as there is so much to see in Dublin. She made a call for us to get on a day tour the next day to Cliffs of Moher. Just the type of trip we wanted. We would never have gotten into the Kilmanheim Gaol without her encouragement to book online and her help in doing it. She is outstanding. Also a huge help to us was Darren, the conccierge. I would never stay anywhere else on my next visit.",5,2017,04,22

Wonderful location to enjoy the historic centre of Dublin ",5,2017,04,17
237,2 weeks,I selected this location due to a reasonable rate and centrally located hotel which offers points. They didn't treat my Diamond status with much regards but the staff is helpful and friendly. Parking is half a block down the road and 12 euro a day with validated parking. Rooms are decent but the bed could be a little more comfortable. Offers wifi for the hotel and for the room. Internet speeds are acceptable as I witnessed download speed at 11.93 mbs and upload speed at 9.04 mbs on a Thursday evening at 8:30pm. ,4,2017,04,16
237,"Nice Hotel, Good location.","Nice clean hotel in a good central location.  Bar staff were friendly and nice food was served in the grill restaurant. We stayed on the third floor at the front but no street noise with window closed. Down side was a very hard bed, even to sit on.",4,2017,04,15
237,"Nice little touches, excellent location and service","We stayed here on our one year anniversary trip to Ireland. The room was great, clean and well appointed, if a little bare (it seemed like it needed some more furniture) We also found the bed to be on the hard side, hence the four stars. But these were only minor issues, the service and overall experience was excellent. 

The staff made us feel very special by giving us a complimentary glass of bubbly and chocolate cake upon arrival in our room to celebrate our anniversary. 

Location is fabulous for exploring Dublin.

237,Weekend visit to Dublin.,"Hi all,
Cousin and I stayed over the weekend in M06. 
As always reception staff so welcoming and friendly, and chocolate cookie so tasty!!!

Room fabulous, comfy beds, lovely bathroom , and housekeeping extremely nice staff.

We hit the bar on Friday night, and the bar man, can't think of his name, advised us on low cal vodka and the rest, lovely guy. He was on again till 9'pm on Sat night and made us Cosmopolitan cocktails, diet forgotten......
Breakfast was wonderful, the manager a small slip of a girl with a lovely, friendly, and professional manner took great care of us, she is one great asset to The Morrison Hotel, I can't think of her name, but she is a star.
ThT was my 4 th visit , I just love this hotel so much, location, friendly service, great accommodation, tasty food, everything about it is just perfect. The staff make it what it is.👌",5,2017,04,10
237,Morrison Doubletree by Hilton,"Great location/hotel - perfect! You can walk to all activity - pubs, bars, and shopping. Hotel staff is great. Must visit hotel restaurant for dinner, the food is GREAT! Breakfast at hotel very good. Very clean hotel. 

GREAT, staff - very accommodating, willing to help. Dorian Yavanagh was a great help to us. Extremely knowledgeable about the area, and great suggestions on activities for us. Everything he recommended we do - we had a great time. Restaurant suggestions were very much appreciated. We will absolutely stay at this hotel, again. Will recommend this hotel to everyone.",5,2017,04,05
237,Great Location & Amenities !,"Great location, right on the river and walking to all of Dublin's city center bars, attractions, etc... Modern lobby and rooms.  Staff was very accommodating and helpful. Very nice bar and resturants located right in hotel.  ONe of the better fitness centers in a downtown location.",5,2017,04,03
237,Great location,"We stayed for a couple of nights.  We loved the location, the morning breakfast staff were awesome.  The room was good and they needed to make some changes to our reservation.  Would definitely stay here again.",4,2017,04,03
237,"Lovely hotel, bit ott with te decor","Great nights stay, spotlessly clean, well situated close to temple bar and Olympia theatre, beds comfortable, shower great, very charming and friendly staff, breakfast was good, and plentiful, offered us a bottle of water for our return journey to wherever, which wasn't anything to crow about, but the small things count, free parking a few yards from the hotel of Jarvis centre, woukd stay there again, ",4,2017,04,02
237,Modern yet traditional,I have stayed at the Morrison in two different rooms including a Junior Suite. The hotel is very pleasant with well renovated rooms and comfy beds yet bathrooms need refurbishment and better maintenance. All in all proper 4* hotel with nice staff. ,4,2017,04,01
237,In the hearth of Dublin but too expensive,"Good and nice hotel in the hearth of Dublin, very close to the Temple Bar area. I didn't like that they organized a party in the hotel until late night. This is not acceptable if you are hosting people travelling for business who have to wake up very early. 
The breakfast is good but not very special. The price is too high, and because of this I don't think I'll come back in this hotel in the future.",4,2017,03,31
237,Outstanding Service from the Staff,"The room was comfortable and pleasant - the only thing stopping me from giving it a 5 rating was the fact that there was no comfortable chair in the room.  Ended up sitting at the desk to watch TV.  HUGE kudos to everyone on the staff for their helpful and pleasant service...  specifically to Adam at the Front Desk; Jane, the Food and Catering Manager; and Sarah in the restaurant!  The location was convenient to many restaurants and pubs, as well as our meeting location.  Definitely would stay there again!",4,2017,03,29
237,Excellent Hotel with First Rate Staff,"Hotel is clean and modern. Rooms are well appointed and all of the staff were professional, courteous and very friendly. Location-wise, it is right next to the Liffey. So it's only 5 minutes walk to Temple Bar and about a 20 minute walk to the Guinness  factory. It's also two streets away from the LUAS tram which we used to get to the Point for a concert and up to Kilmainham Gaol. We took a bus transfer from the Airport to O'Connell street which is only 15 minutes walk from the hotel. All in all, a great, cool  boutique hotel for your stay in Dublin.Would definitely recommend.",5,2017,03,25
237,Weird Hotel in great location,"The location of this hotel is great, but the rooms are ultra modern to the point of being weird..at least to my husband and my taste.  Nice large tv in room, however, there is no place to sit and view, except on the side of the bed.  Husband is Diamond level, so we were ""upgraded"" to delux room.  If this is delux, I certainly would not want to stay in a normal room.  Very disappointing not only for a 4.5 star rated Hilton property, but is a tremendous disappointment for our first time in Dublin, and we will be here for 7 days.   Would not stay here again.",2,2017,03,25
237,Brilliant stay,"Highly recommend this Hotel! Charming staff good size rooms modern, clean great service all round. Great location for Dublin city within walking distance of Temple Bar and O'Connell Street, the Guinness factory and Stephens green.",5,2017,03,25
237,Comparison,"Location wise good but comparison rate and other facilities it should be more nicer in all way, like breakfast should have more items considering all reason foods. As far as business concern the speed we get fm the internet service that was not sufficient so we expect to get more speed in internet service. Room should have complimentary water at least as we never ever get such hotel where not supply water as complimentary for each & every day from the room service.",3,2017,03,23
237,We love this place!,I almost don't want to write this review but it probably isn't fair on the staff if I don't. This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel and on both occasions we have received the best customer service from Jane and her colleagues. Great location for getting out and about. Of an evening it is possible to spend time drinking with other guests (friendliness of the staff rubs off on customers) without the need to venture further afield. we'll be back next year!,5,2017,03,22
237,Another great stay,"This was our second stay in this fantastic hotel. In the past year we have, for various reasons, stayed here twice and in two other nearby hotels and it was a pleasure to return to The Morrison.  Beyond its ideal location in the center of Dublin, the hotel is fresh and very comfortable. As a Hilton Honors member, my daughter and I enjoyed a memorable complementary breakfast.  It is clearly a well run hotel - everyone we encountered - including the desk clerk, bell service, room attendant, and restaurant staff - was courteous, friendly, and efficient.  Highly recommended.",5,2017,03,22
237,Dublin stay with bae,"Great stay within a short walking distance to temple bar, will definitely be back to give the city another rattle.  Its hard to beat the Hilton Group for a good stay and the cookies are reception are mint  blah blah blah 200 words minimum  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz",5,2017,03,22
237,Third stay - Consistently flawless!,"Recently had my third stay at the Morrison..on all occasions the service provided by this hotel and it's staff have been flawless! Each time I have visited this hotel all of the staff have been super friendly and welcoming, nothing is too much trouble and always smiling. As a gold Hilton Honors member I received a complimentary upgrade on my most recent stay as well as some treats and a welcome back note in the room on arrival. The decor of the hotel in bright and modern, and the individual script on the walls in each bedroom are a lovely touch. The bedrooms are bright and spacious and feature all the mod-cons you would expect from a luxury hotel. Large TV with lots of channels, good tea and coffee supply, good quality toiletries, fluffy towels, bath robes, comfortable beds - even an umbrella in your room which is a necessity for Dublin's unpredictable weather! For anyone traveling to Dublin for leisure purposes, you will fail to find a better location than this hotel! Very central to the main shopping streets, temple bar and all that Dublin has to offer. I live locally and work for another Hilton hotel in Dublin, so I enjoy the benefits of being a Hilton staff member - the Morrison is always my top choice to stay in Dublin. The only thing that surprised me was that this hotel is only number 8 on TripAdvisor! Already looking forward to my next visit! :)",5,2017,03,21
237,Weekend Break with Fruends,"Fab trip away with our friends, loved the hotel, the breakfast, the rooms and the staff, location was also brilliant would definitely return.  Everything was so clean and nothing was too much trouble. Thank you The Morrison",5,2017,03,19
237,Fab ,"Stayed here for 3 nights with friends.  The check in was quick and efficient.  Hot cookies were given! 
Room lovely and well thought out. I had a king to myself it was really lovely.  Staff very pleasant.  The band on sat night were fantastic for such young people. Really talented. Great atmosphere.  Would go back although I'd ask for a room not near to white cleaners keep their cart and supplies as was woken so early each morning (6:30). I'm sore had I asked they would have moved me. Just a tip! Other than the staff noise it really was an excellent stay x ",5,2017,03,19
237,WONDERFUL HOTEL! No Extra Charge for Being Just Plain Nice Folks!,"Stayed here over St. Patricks Day -- one of the most chaotic, insane times to be in Dublin in the Temple Bar area. In spite of being busy with a variety of people all checking in at the same time, the Morrison staff were all pleasant, patient, helpful and even spoke English. They happily stored our luggage in the back when we checked in early, and were very helpful giving directions and suggestions.
     The room and facilities were clean, updated, and for an area of Dublin that can get questionable ... the Morrison is across a bridge an safe, quiet and a great refuge from the  all the commotion which is within walking distance.  Will stay here again anytime",5,2017,03,19
237,Perfect,"I do not understand some of the reviews on here that say this is a noisy hotel? I stayed here for St Patrick's day / 6 Nations rugby weekend. I did not experience any noise disturbances despite Dublin being busy. The location is fantastic, the rooms are clean and modern, the wifi is super fast. Good quality shampoo and soaps that were renewed each bay and tea making facilities. Just perfect!",5,2017,03,19
237,Great hotel & super friendly ,"I've now stayed here a few times on business trips and can't fault it - will be continuing to choose this hotel for rest of my work trips in coming weeks. Comfortable beds, good wifi and the usual amenities you would expect in a Hilton hotel but what makes this place is how friendly and welcoming all staff are from reception to housekeeping to the bar.i was even offered to leave some belongings there week to week which is such a help when you're a regular (toiletries, and trainers to encourage me to make good use of fitness room left and in my room when I arrived for next stay - super service!).  As a solo female business traveller, I also love the bar and restaurant area. Feel totally comfortable there on my own if I don't have other evening plans, comfy bar stools, nice ambient lighting, a bit of buzz about the place, but also relaxing if just want some quiet time to finish some work or read a book, and comfy bar stools! The food is delicious and all served with a friendly smile...my only very small gripe is that the evening food menu doesn't have many lighter options for main courses - I've often had a starter as a main (clam chowder is fab!) but would be great if at least one of the lunchtime salads made an appearance! ",5,2017,03,16
237,Nice location and good hotel,Stayed here for 2 nights. Hotel is very nice and modern. Checkin was very quick with friendly staff. The room and bathroom are modern as well. I had a room facing the inside of the hotel. The problem with this room was that the window could not be opened and due to semi-transparant pastic on the window you could not look outside. I think this was a downside of the room which was for the rest very good. For the rest great hotel on a super location.,4,2017,03,16
237,Great location and nice property,"This is a wonderful property that is in a prime location. The hotel is modern and immaculate. The front desk clerk was very welcoming upon check-in and even moved the two rooms I had booked next to each other. 

I would say that this is the nicest Doubletree I have ever stayed at.

My only complaint was the bed was a little firmer than I would like, but I think that is a British Isles thing since I have seen that at every hotel in the UK and Ireland.",5,2017,03,16
237,Warm and Welcoming!,"We loved our stay at the Morrison!  From the front desk staff, concierge, bartenders, everyone was fantastic!  We were coming off an overnight flight and were greeted with friendly faces and a warm cookie.  Daryn at the front desk gave us a complete run down on the city and offered us his cell phone in case we needed help at any time.  Our room was cozy and clean.  The second morning we awoke at 10AM our time and went downstairs looking for coffee and breakfast, to our surprise it was 2PM!!!  A general manager that seriously was like Mrs. Potts in Beauty in the Beast took me by the arm, found me a comfy space at the bar and in 2 minutes was there with coffee and croissants for my husband and I, all complimentary!  So nice!  We went to the restaurant at the hotel for 1 dinner and it was delicious.  We often started our night at the bar with exceptional bartender Gary!  We loved Dublin and this hotel made our trip, great location and even better staff!  Thanks!",5,2017,03,15
237,Fantastic hotell,"We was in Irland and stayd on this hotell. Its great. The beds ar a little hard. Service top. We will stay on this hotell next time too. Its in the middle of town, you can walk to the things you want to see.",5,2017,03,14
237,Our waitress made the visit great,"Lovely hotel , warm welcome, easy check in. Rooms very well stocked and furnised. We ate in the Grill and our waitress Sarah could not have been better, She was friendly and efficient and really made me smile. Lovely girl and an asset to your establishment. Another grumpy looking waiter , tall well stocked guy, was the opposite, grunted and looked like he would rater be at home.",5,2017,03,14
237,The best hotel in Dublin. ,"I stayed here for a business trip from 04MAR-12MAR.  I've stayed in many hotels across the U.K. and Ireland, but this one is my favorite. The staff is wonderful. The most helpful and polite concierge staff I've ever dealt with. The rooms are very good. The breakfast and dinner are wonderful. The bar and lounge had better live music than half the pubs I visited. This is the only place I will stay in Dublin from now on. ",5,2017,03,14
237,Lovely hotel,"Have stayed in this hotel on numerous occasions, would love to stay more often but it is very pricey most of the time to book so can only stay if I get special offer. Great location. Rooms modern.  Bar is lovely with great selection of drinks or barman will make you up one of his own concoction's!! ",4,2017,03,13
237,"It's al about Jane, and then some!","If Aretha Frankin could change the song to ""Jane, Jane, jane ...🎤  Maybe she would once she met Jane -one of the floor managers of the Morrison.  She was so lovely and always seemed to be there when you needed her. In fact the whole staff was delightful. After our red eye from JFK they did the best to get us an early check in so we could have a little rest before we hitt the town 
Our entire experience was delightful and we will return! Highly recommended.  Great location right on The Liffey and walking distance to everything.  Have Jane give you a list of the best pubs and bars in the area!",5,2017,03,12
237,So friendly ,"The reviews said the hotel was friendly but I didn't believe it until I'd seen it. Reception were great fun yet professional, bar staff were great, anything we asked for was delivered. I asked where the best massage place was because my neck was hurting and the staff said save your money and gave me a massage. Brilliant. My third stay in Dublin this year and I will never book another hotel. X",5,2017,03,12
237,One of the best and most unique hotels that I have every stayed in.,"As a Hilton Diamond member this takes a lot for me to say, but this is one of the best hotels that I have every stayed in.  Stayed here with my family in February and I have to say that this hotel knocked our socks off.  Not only is the location great but the staff here is some of the friendliest you will find anywhere.  I LOVED this property and every trip I make back to Dublin I will be staying here.",5,2017,03,11
237,"Nice, but birds are loud","The Morrison is a great hotel.  Once you walk in your greeted immediately and everyone is polite and eager to help with anything you need.  Hilton Honors room is very spacious and beds and super comfortable.  Don't not sleep with window open for fresh air, you will wake up at crack of dawn to screaming birds.  Also only small complaint I went to the bar for lunch and because I was working I ordered a water and burger, which burger is great.  The bartender looked at my empty water glass several times without asking if I needed anymore.  Another waitress walked by saw my glass was empty and filled it up.  Needless to say she got my tip not my original bartender.",4,2017,03,11
237,In the heart of Dublin,"Stayed in the hotel for 4 nights. I'll want to be specific and explain why not 5 stars. Be honest expect more on a hotel by Hilton.  The location is excellent. It is located across the river to Temple bar district. Rooms were (I stayed in 2 different rooms) OK, but not so perfectly clean as in Clayton (I stayed a day before here) in Cork. Breakfast was had less choice again in comperancy with Clayton.  I expected to see more seefood. Service is good. They welcomes with warm biscuits, by the way they are delicious.  Bathroom has static shower. I don't like that. Used to wash with watering-can with hose. Every night I heard a lot of nose on pathing by drunk people through the closed window. They have 10 euro per night car parking in the next building.  In very close distance Jervis shopping mall.",4,2017,03,07
237,Customer Service Excellence,"You absolutely cannot find a better place and people when looking for a hotel in Dublin than The Morrison, conveniently located on the River Liffey across from Temple Bar area and close to the downtown Dublin sights and sounds. We had no need for a car or any type of public transportation save the simple shuttle bus from the airport (there are several and all very competitive at about 6 euros one way).  The bus tours we took were within easy reach all on O’Connell Street near The Spire.  We were very impressed by the cleanliness of the hotel, but more importantly by the excellent service and attitude of the employees - notably two that we really wanted to highlight….Darren, who worked the front desk, was a self-proclaimed “local lad” and we appreciated all of his excellent tips and generally just his friendly and customer-focused attitude and helpfulness; we also had excellent service from Jane both at dinner and during breakfast…her smile and friendliness to make sure the guests felt comfortable was contagious.  It appeared to us that all the employees in this hotel are well trained and truly enjoy working at this establishment.  The restaurant food was quite good, clean, and fresh.  The smooth and simple live music was also quite a treat.  The rooms were very clean and up-to-date.  The only recommendation would be to change the shower heads as they were very painful in trying to keep on.  All in all, an excellent location, stay and would highly recommend this to other customers.    And when I’m in town, I will certainly stay here again!",5,2017,03,06
237,"Great service, but problems shouldn't have happened....","We stayed here for 4 nights in December for a weekend away after a busy few months at work. 

We chose the hotel based on its reviews and location, and were after a relaxing break as a couple in Dublin.

Upon arrival we checked in pretty late (around 10pm) and noticed that there seemed to be a function on, but didn't think too much of it and went to our room exhausted after a long day and a late flight, looking forward to some sleep.

Upon arriving in the room we saw a note on the bed saying that there was a function on in the hotel and that we could expect noise in from this until around 1.30am, so we thought that's not ideal and odd it wasn't mentioned but ok.

However trying to get to sleep was impossible, so after about an hour or so I rang reception and asked what was going on and if we could be moved. The chap said we couldn't and that they would see what they could do the following nights as they had functions on all weekend.

So long story short...

Positives:

- We were moved the following night to an upgraded room in a quieter part of the hotel (still not great noise wise but better) as well as given free breakfast for the rest of our stay.

- Concierge came and saw us at breakfast to apologise and ask us if we needed anything. 

- After a discussion with the hotel manager and a bit of back and forth we were refunded the cost of our first nights stay.

- Concierge was very helpful through the rest of our stay with restaurant and activity recommendations.

Negatives:

- Inevitable noise from the hotel functions should have been mentioned at the time of booking, as we wouldn't have stayed there if we had know as even in quieter room you could still hear the noise.

- If you want a quiet break make sure you ring the hotel and check if they have functions on when you are planning to stay. If they do I would advise against. 

So all in all a nice hotel and if there are no functions on would highly recommend, but if there are functions on and you want a quiet break best to avoid.",3,2017,03,01
237,Wonderful stay at The Morrison,Again we stayed with The Morrison for our brief break in Dublin. The Hotel and it's staff are superb and keep us coming back. Service is wonderful and breakfast sets you up for the day. Location to all amenities is excellent.,5,2017,03,01
237,Afternoon Tea,"After browsing the internet to see where in Dublin does a good afternoon tea, we decided on the Morrison Hotel on Ormond Quay. I had pre-booked the afternoon tea for myself and my daughters to celebrate a birthday.  On arrival we were met with a very pleasant waitress who told us that our table would be made ready for us and if we would like to enjoy a drink from the bar area.  We did. We then were called at our allocated time and had our Afternoon Tea served to us with a glass of Prosecco.  We asked for a mixture of the gentleman's tea and the afternoon tea as we preferred a more savory selection.  We were pleasantly surprised by the high standard of presentation of the platters and arrangements of the dishes.  The food was simply delicious and the tastes and textures of each dish complimented each other.  The quality of the food was high class and cooked to perfection.  The scones are just amazing!  We asked that our compliments were passed to the chefs who came out and was delighted to say hello to us.  Thank you for a wonderful afternoon of culinary delights...",5,2017,02,27
237,fantastic hotel - 5 stars!,"Everything from the staff to the location to the food to the cleanliness to the decor - this was a first rate hotel in every sense of the word. If I can get back to Dublin, I will definitely stay here.",5,2017,02,26
237,A credit to the Hilton brand,"This was the first time I had stayed at this hotel, although it is used extensively by my company.  The friendliness of the staff is exceptional and nothing is too much trouble for them.  The rooms are comfortable and very clean. I travel extensively and this is a credit to the Hilton brand",5,2017,02,24
237,Average Accomodations,"The best thing about this hotel is the location and the breakfast. Unfortunately, the rooms leave many things to be desired. The room was small and noisy, even though it was considered an 'upgrade'. I highly doubt that we would stay here again. ",3,2017,02,24
237,Best Hotel to stay in the city!,"Fabulous hotel right in the city centre. Arrived late in the evening and was welcomed by a very friendly gentleman who gave me a warm cookie :) I was even upgraded to the executive floor, nice treat! Beds are very comfy and bathrobes and slippers a very nice addition. The power shower was amazing! Delicious breakfast with a la carte options included in the price. Highly recommended!",5,2017,02,23
237,Fabulous upgrade ,"I am a Hilton diamond member, I opt when I can to stay within the Hilton group.  I have stayed in other Hilton group hotels in Dublin, but this was the first time at this specific doubletree. 

By far the nicest doubletree I have stayed in, of course the icing on top was the upgrade to the penthouse suite which was a pleasant surprise. 

Pleasant and helpful staff, delicious food, great attention to detail. ",5,2017,02,22
237,5 star service,"What differentiates this hotel from its competitors is the level of attention all members of staff gave to its guests. The room, location and food were all excellent. We were attending a wedding and managed to check in really early (10am) which was great as we could get ready in the room. From housekeeping to reception, all members of staff took the time to say hello and have a chat. If you're not interested in engaging, that's fine but unlike most hotels the staff at least made an effort! 

",5,2017,02,20
237,Great Location and the friendliest staff in town,"We were greeted on arrival with warm chocolate chip cookies so that was a welcome surprise! The hotel is very modern and the decor tasteful. As there was a wedding party in progress the receptionist upgraded us to a river view on a quiet floor. The service at breakfast was particularly good and the barista made us both coffees, one to takeaway as well. I don't normally like a buffet breakfast but this one was better than expected. We parked in the Jervis St Multi-storey overnight and got our ticket stamped for a discounted rate. The room was small but the view made up for that and there wasn't too much noise from the busy road below. We would definitely return when visiting Dublin as location was great.",5,2017,02,19
237,Hilton's gem of Dublin,"We booked three rooms here, on a family vacation. I have to say, this hotel exceeded our expectations (never really knowing what to expect of a Hilton--the quality varies so much). I would even venture to say that this is our BEST Hilton stay, as a rewards member we have stayed at very many Hilton Hotels--including their partners. When I first booked our reservations, I thought it was going to be a hokey experience with the pink or purple Austin Powers ambient lighting, but I though what-the-heck, we had a bunch of young adult family members in their twenties--they might be into Austin Powers hokey--it was a gamble. 

However, it was far, far from hokey. The rooms were very comfortable, fantastic amenities, nice deep soaking bathtub with spa-like feeling of bathroom--robes included,and an amazing and accommodating staff. The food was great, and the Dublin city location ideal. I had a niece who was planning on going into the hospitality college curriculum--this was a good role modeling experience. Our only regret was that we wished we had booked all of our Dublin stay here (instead of splitting it up with another Dublin Hilton--not as nice, but located in another part of Dublin to explore). This hotel and location is recommended, we will definitely revisit.",5,2017,02,18
237,Superior customer service hotel,Every employee we encountered shows superior customer service skills. They went above and beyond anything we expected. All of our needs were met and exceeded during our stay. This is an excellent hotel and I would definitely stay here in the future and recommend to everyone. Location is in a perfect spot. Close to train and walking distance to all sites.,5,2017,02,18
237,Excellent Hotel in Dublin,"This hotel is very warm welcome, you can select your room before you arrive. Staffs are very nice people. Super bowl was in the bar and bar was open till 3;30 AM. Very accommodative. Location was best place.",5,2017,02,18
237,Fabulous staff and excellent conference staff,"A large, modern and beautifully designed hotel right on the river and just 10 minutes walk from O Connell Street and the City centre. Front entrance requires you to walk through a low-light bar area - there is a side entrance straight to reception at the rear.

I arrived late and received a warm welcome and a warm cookie. Reception has tasteful low seats - more sitting room than hotel. Candles in the evening make it very calm.

My room on the 4th floor was a good size. Very high ceiling with an electrically operated curtain and nets that slide into place. View over neighbouring houses though.

Great design - lights as bedside tables and subtle lights over the bed. Plenty of concealed power points at the desk and by the bed. Interesting built in sort of chaise-longue window seat.

Full mini bar and tea/coffee making facilities. Hairdryer, iron, robe and slippers. Super clean and good sized bathroom. Good TV and tech options. Liked there's a 'grab and go' option for breakfast. 

Conference centre reached through a restaurant with an amazing Bird Man sculpture that's a bit scary.

Meeting room long and narrow but good. We had 14 delegates. We did suffer a bit from heat although staff did everything to cool us down including standing and holding the street door open.

There was an issue and I needed a laptop for my presentation. Patrick on the banqueting team kindly gave me his laptop to use for the day. That really was above and beyond the call of duty. He did everything possible to make it a great conference. He was a real pleasure to deal with and an asset to the hotel.

Lunch in the restaurant was something else. Huge bowls of salad, creamy mash/colcannon and root vegetables on the tables. Then we each received individual chicken and ham pies with perfect puff pastry crusts. I ate way too much as it was delicious. But they turned us round quickly.

Loos downstairs - so a little way from the meeting room. I spied a large  covered gallery and a huge hall which look good for major events.

I work in lots of hotels around the world and this was one of my favourites. And very good value.
",5,2017,02,18
237,Fantastic experience! ,I won a competition for an overnight stay with dinner at this hotel - what a treat! Location is brilliant - ideal for shopping! Parking very nearby. Staff were friendly and efficient. Bedroom was beautiful and modern. The food - both breakfast and dinner - was tasty and plentiful! Wonderful singer in the bar on Saturday night gave a relaxing atmosphere! Thank you! ,4,2017,02,17
237,Posh hotel near Temple Bar,"The location of this hotel, across the bridge from the Temple Bar district of Dublin was why we chose to stay there, but was very impressed by the attentive customer service by the the staff, from the front desk, to the restaurant staff and finally to the porter who made sure to provide us with bottled water on our way out the door of a short, one night stay.

As a Hilton Diamond member, we were upgraded to a suite, which was roomy and poshly decorated and had a very comfortable bed for our post trans-atlantic flight from the US. We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Dublin!",5,2017,02,16
237,Nice stay,"We were only in Dublin for one night and this hotel was great. We are gold members and we're able to check in quite early. The staff made it known there was a wedding that night and it might be noisy in the courtyard. It was raining so I don't think anyone was outside and if there were, we didn't hear them! The a/c worked great, the fan drowned out any noise if there was any. The shower had the best water pressure I have ever encountered in a hotel. The amenities smelled so nice! The French toast was awesome. Never had it prepared like it was. The hotel is in a convenient location. The staff could not have been nicer. I would definitely recommend and stay there again. We had a king room, it may have been a superior room but it was quite large. Don't forget your power converter.",5,2017,02,16
237,Beautiful hotel in a fab location,"Friendly, funny, helpful staff! 
Lovely modern rooms (bathroom not as modern)
Wide variety for breakfast buffet and freshly cooked menu to order from! We also dined at the restaurant attached to the hotel, very yummy! (slightly expensive) 
This is our 2nd stay at The Morrison and we would recommend highly for the location! Thank you! ",5,2017,02,16
237,Surprise 40th weekend away,"Dunno where to start, hotel was amazing. Staff were so helpful friendly and welcoming and nothing was too much trouble, even gave us warm cookies on checking in :-) They decorated the room for us arriving with balloons and cakes for a 40th birthday and a few minutes in our room we were brought complimentary prosecco and strawberries. Asked for advice about how to get to Guinness storehouse and a member of staff, I never caught his name, actually took us to the tram stop and got our tickets and showed us on map where to go/get off. Couldn't be more helpful. Room was fantastic really modern and spacious with a river (side) view. Walk in shower massive bath, bed was huge and room had sofas and a lounger. I booked a deluxe double but I actually think this was a suite. On check out we were offered tea/coffee to take away and another warm cookie - couldn't resist as they tasted amazing!  Really really enjoyed our stay here and Dublin was amazing! Bit rainy and cold but we walked for miles exploring this amazing place. Would return in a heartbeat! Thanks so much for making our stay at The Morrison such a good one xx",5,2017,02,15
237,Wonderful stay,"We recently stayed at the Morrison on a girls trip and it was the perfect place to stay.  The staff was wonderful, the rooms were lovely and clean and the location can't be beat.  I would highly recommend.  We ordered room service one night and it was fast and delicious.  I wish we would have tried the breakfast but we were out the door pretty early every morning.",5,2017,02,15
237,Parking is off property,hotel is clean updated the parking is off property and doesn't open until 9 am daily if you have an early flight out this can be a problem there is a number to call but did no good just a recorded message with no response . we had to wait until 9 am to get the car . The rooms are very modern the beds are very hard the bathtub sits up high and is deep making it difficult to get in and out of. room service food is just ok. walking distance to temple bar area it was ok I will stay somewhere else next time . I travel a lot and am a Hilton honors member .,3,2017,02,15
237,Great Hoyel,"Great place to stay in Dublin, excellent service and a stone's throw away from the action.
Staff were very helpful and the hotel has an overall nice ambience. Would definitely go back if we were in that part of the world again.

237,"Fabulous location, great stay","The Manager who is currently in charge of this hotel needs a round of applause. Check in is smooth and efficient, friendly staff and a giant chocolate chip 🍪 cookie.we were informed that there was going to be a wedding in the hotel and there may be noise downstairs so they gave us a room on the 4 th floor. Lovely crisp white rooms and subtle decorations -hairdryer, coffee and tea facilities and a stocked mini bar. Large shower lovely verbena products and fluffy bathrobes. So central in Dublin walk everywhere from here. Checkout was slightly more chaotic- as everyone was checking out but we were apologised to and offered complimentary bottles of water 💦 for our trip home! Nice touch....really nice and thoughtful.",5,2017,02,14
237,Great Location,Great location easy walking to buses and Temple Bar area.  Nice quiet  spacious room with very comfortable bed and large bathroom. Staff was very friendly and helpful with all of our needs.    Very pleased with our choice to stay here.  ,5,2017,02,13
237,A week in Dublin,"First time to Ireland and definitely planning to come back. The people were so friendly and helpful. The hotel was so close to many attractions, restaurants,and great for just evening walks. The room was clean, spacious and well stocked. The restaurant was just perfect for a special evening. The food was delicious and the staff very accommodating. Great overall experience.",5,2017,02,13
237,Amazing Staff!,"The team from the Reception are just amazing. They are nice, courteous and friendly. They will really let you feel welcome and at home.  
 
Darren, who always has his smiles ready is extremely helpful. F&B staff are worthy to be mentioned too. 
 
Their location is perfect if you want to be in City Center and Morrison Grill is superb as well. 
 
Looking forward to my next visit. 😊",4,2017,02,13
237,Great spot for a night away in Dublin,"Stayed in the Morrison for our Christmas party in January 2017. Rooms were just fab, nice and modern, clean, lovely toiletries etc Bed really comfy too. The function room was great, lovely 3 course dinner, exceptional bar service.Staff were great, not one bit pretentious just genuine nice people, Loved the cookies on arrival. Great rate for parking. Would definitely book another corporate event here or would highly recommend for anyone visiting Dublin- class act!",5,2017,02,12
237,Great Dublin hotel for business or leisure,"Great location in city centre, walking distance to business centre & tourist sites. 25 mins from airport and 10 mins from main rail stations. Luas stop steps from hotel. On site fitness centre, parking available close by. Freindly prefessional staff, good choice for business trips or leisurely weekend break. And nice cookie at checkin!",4,2017,02,09
237,Great value in the city center,"A good experience when visiting the Morrison. Close to everything, great attention to detail & extremely helpful personnel. A good place to go on business, as well as great location to entertain in the evenings.",4,2017,02,06
237,Girls weekend!,"Very modern hotel, very central to shops, bars and restaurants. Staff extremely friendly and helpful. Special mention to Darren who provided us with cookies and water for the journey back to the airport 👍🏼. 

Only criticism (and it is small) is breakfast wasn't very well organised. Room is an odd layout and when at capacity I'd imagine it'd be difficult to a move around freely. Service was slow and I put that down to too little staff rather than poor service. 

Oh and no baked beans on the breakfast which was a little disappointing 😉. 

Would return if we visited Dublin again. 

",4,2017,02,05
237,Lovely Stay,"From check in, with a warm cookie through to check out our experience was excellent. It was my partners birthday weekend, we entered our room to find a lovely plate of cakes with happy birthday written in chocolate - a lovely touch. All the staff were extremely friendly & would bend over backwards to help. A special mention to a bar man who made us a strawberry daiquiri despite it not being on the menu & added his own special twist to a sour whiskey - it was divine. The room was lovely with all those little extras you want, location excellent & a good quality breakfast with plenty of variety. Can't wait to come back.",5,2017,02,05
237,Good Place to Stay,"I have stayed here multiple times and the quality and service are always very consistent. The hotel is clean, modern and the staff are extremely helpful and professional. The location is convenient to temple bar, local golf courses and restruants. ",5,2017,02,03
237,Excellent location,"Very central location, staff were very friendly and helpful, couldn't do enough for you, they even walked us to a brilliant wee pub they recommended. Room was out of this world. Breakfast was amazing. Will most definitely stay here again. ",5,2017,02,03
237,Best hotel in Dublin,"Staff are amazing, they always make it a real pleasure to stay at the Morrison. The location is central and the facilities are great. Breakfast is especially good - best bacon in Dublin, and that's saying something!  I couldn't be more complimentary about this hotel.",5,2017,02,03
237,Very central location,"I spent one week in The Morrison Hotel during my business trip and I enjoyed it. The room was pretty and very clean, the staff kind and helpful. I received a nice welcome-note from the manager and also some chocolates. The bathroom was spacious and had a bath. The bed big and comfortable. The airconditioning was a bit noisy. The last day I had my flight in the evening but it was not a problem to store my suitcase at the reception for a couple of hours after checking out. You can have a nice, filling  breakfast at the hotel's restaurant or in one of the cafes nearby the hotel as a less expensive solution. The location is excellent - close to the restaurants, shops, landmarks and the tram (luas)/ buses.",5,2017,02,02
237,I didn't want to leave,This hotel was so amazing. The staff was awesome and very helpful. It was right in the heart of everything. I had easy access to all the local attractions. The hotel helped me get tickets to a hop on hop off bus and that was great. I had such a wonderful time. I can't wait to get back. I miss it already.,5,2017,02,01
237,One of the best hotels I've stayed in,"This hotel is in a great location.

Staying on the Hilton Honours floor the rooms were clean tidy and so comfortable.
The staff were amazingly attentive at every step of the way.

Even when I requested some peppermint teabags for the room rather than the earl gray and camomile while I don't care for... minutes later smiling guy knocked at my door and handed me a handful of them.

The gym is nice and clean but I feel could do with some more equipment/size.  There were 4 of us in there at one point and it felt a little cramped.

Can't fault the hotel at all... hoping I can get another room on my next visit to Dublin in our travel policy!",5,2017,01,31
237,Takes some of the pain out of being away from home for Work.,"The staff are always really friendly.  The food is great, and bar is a nice place to hang out. I am always welcomed back,and on most occasions get some treats delivered to my room to say thanks for returning. Takes some of the pain out of being away from home for Work. Thank you Morrison and all the great staff.",5,2017,01,31
237," An American's weekend in Dublin ","I made a spontaneous decision to visit Dublin and Belfast from Atlanta. I had stayed at the Morrison 10 years ago so was familiar with its location. It's perfectly situated near many of the popular and lesser-known attractions, tantalizing restaurant options and public transport. Best of all was the staff. Everyone, from front desk, to concierge, to bar/grill, was super attentive. Will keep it in my for my next jaunt to my ancestral motherland. ",4,2017,01,28
237,Comfortable and friendly,This was the perfect place to stay for a visit to Dublin. Close to the centre but without the price tag that often goes with that proximity. Rooms were a decent size with all that you need including wifi. Staff helpful and friendly.,5,2017,01,28
237,Excellent stay,"Me and the wife stayed here for the weekend of my birthday.  Lovely hotel, staff helpful and friendly and breakfast was good.  They even left a  plate with small cakes on saying happy birthday.in our room.  Ideal central location on the river.  Recommend for a weekend",5,2017,01,27
237,Best Place for Company party,"We held our Xmas party here on 2nd week of January for 150 people.  We had presentations, dinner and dancing.  We had use of Print works room which was decorated and set up beautifully.  The hotel organised everything for us and were on hand all night to ensure everyone had a super night.  The food was superb.   In particular Marion O'Connor and Jane Bridge were absolutely outstanding... true customer service",5,2017,01,25
237,Very good - does what it says on the tin!,"This is a great location - quiet but busy (hectic) if you want very close by, across the river to Temple Bar. Staff are very professional without being really genuine. I would definitely stay here again as the rooms were superbly clean and fresh. ",4,2017,01,24
237,Great two day break in dublin,"Myself and my husband visited Dublin for his birthday weekend. The hotel is in a great location. A very short walk to halfpenny bridge and straight over to temple bar. We didn't have to get a taxi all weekend, very central. But also not noisy, we were in a room to the side. The staff were very welcoming, we were given a nice warm cookie on arrival. The reception staff asked if we were visiting for an occasion so we mentioned my husbands birthday. We then nipped out to explore and on our return to get changed, a plate with little pieces of cake was in our room with Happy Birthday on it in chocolate. Was a very nice touch, especially as it was a passing comment only made at check in. The breakfast staff were great and they had a good selection. I ate from the menu, included in our booking. The omelette and eggs Benedict were lovely. The only one slight criticism from my husband is that there wasn't beans on the buffet. We definitely stay here again. Thank you for s lovely stay ",5,2017,01,23
237,Great location,"Great location, central but just enough distance from the main area to still be peaceful at night. Room was small but clean and warm. Bed linen lovely. Desk staff friendly. Two minutes walk from the airport bus stop.",4,2017,01,21
237,Nice hotel & superb venue for parties,"We had our Christmas party at The Morrison Hotel.
Venue is situated near O'Connell Bridge and very convenient for shopping & Temple Bar.
Food served on the night was good plus service cannot be faulted.
Overall a very pleasant evening",4,2017,01,21
237,Highly recommended,"Great hotel, great location. The staff was very professional and personable. The prices are expensive in general in Dublin but theirs was reasonable and definitely worth the value. Breakfast was delightful. They  put the news on a huge projector screen so you can actually see the scrolling letters at the bottom. ",5,2017,01,20
237,Delightful Stay,"Stayed at Morrison because of convenience and location to train, restaurants, and airport. Staff was great and hotel and accommodations were very pleasant. Leveraged one of the conference rooms for meetings and it was roomy and met our needs.",5,2017,01,19
237,"Super Location, Very Friendly Staff","The Morrison is the perfect location for a business trip to Dublin. Close to so many amenities, right in the centre of Dublin. The staff are so friendly and make you feel at home. Good parking rate for the overnight stay for a central local using the nearby carpark.",4,2017,01,18
237,Very nice,"Very nice hotel in great location. Staff were all friendly and welcoming. Great service at reception, bar and restaurant. Bedroom was comfortable and warm (but not much wardrobe / hanging space. Good breakfast.",5,2017,01,17
237,Very nice hotel in the ideal location to see downtown Dublin,"Spent 5 nights in this hotel and it was very nice.  It's in the absolute perfect location to explore downtown.  Close to pubs, shopping, public transportation and even grocery stores.

The hotel itself is very modern, seemingly nearly brand new inside.  The room i was in was also very modern or contemporary inside.  Had all the basic hotel room amenities.  Worth noting for USA travelers, all of the plug ins are 220v so you will need an adapter/transformer to use US electronics.  I believe the front desk has some available, but I brought my own and it worked fine.

I did like that the shower had good pressure, and also that the window could open to provide some fresh air.  I did not like that no matter where I set the thermostat in the room, it would not get cool enough for my liking unless I opened the window for a while.  Also the tub is rather awkward.  The bottom of the tub was about 6"" higher than the rest of the bathroom floor.  I about slipped a couple times getting out.  Also the tub drain can be pushed closed just by stepping on it. So most times I wound up standing in ankle deep water unless I noticed it and bent down to open it back up.  Very minor things in the grand scheme of things.  Also worth noting that parking is in a garage about a block away.  I didn't drive but others in my group did.  The hotel will give you a discount on parking.  It takes quite a while to drive around the blocks from the garage back to the front of the hotel due to traffic and small one way streets.

The one thing that stopped me from giving 5 stars was the bed.  It was two twin mattresses pushed together and it was incredibly hard.  Other folks I traveled with also complained of very hard beds as well.

The front desk staff was always incredibly polite, and went out of their way to help whenever possible.  The breakfast staff was also very polite and helpful.  I ate at the restaurant once and it was decent but not amazing.  Lunch doesn't start til noon in the restaurant.  And I think breakfast doesn't open until 7am.  So later than we're accustomed to in the USA.  Also worth noting that breakfast is not included in the price of the room.  But they have a great selection, much like a continental breakfast you'd expect at a nicer hotel in the states.

Given the chance, I would definitely stay here again if I came back to Dublin.  Overall a great hotel, made even better by the great location.",4,2017,01,17
237,Christmas party,Went here for our work Christmas party on Saturday. The place is immaculate. Not one thing out of place. The staff are very professional. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was the portion sizes. Way too small. I don't like finishing a three course meal in a restaurant and still feeling hungry. I'm a 75kg man. It doesn't take a lot to fill but unfortunately the Morrison didn't. ,4,2017,01,17
237,Amazing!,"The staff were all so helpful, the rooms were lovely and couldn't have asked for a better location, it's within walking distance of everything, also the breakfast was to die for! They made it so special for my boyfriends 21st! Would definitely stay again and recommend to everyone! ",5,2017,01,15
237,"Clean Hotel, Pleasant Staff, Great Amenities, Perfect Location","Spent the week of Christmas here. While most places in Dublin are closed Christmas Eve and Day, this hotel hosted a number of events to keep us entertained and well fed. When the Temple Bar area reopened again, we were minutes away from its best bars and restaurants....yet far enough away to retreat to our quiet room once we were ready to turn in. 

The Morrison is a boutique hotel - stylish decor with an ambient soundtrack on loop inthe lobby. The restaurant and breakfast buffet is more expensive then surrounding eateries..but you get what you pay for. The Morrison puts more effort into the style, taste and service for every meal they offer. The breakfast buffet boasts freshly made smoothies and ready to serve omelettes or eggs benedict. The rooms are average sized in my opinion and perfect for couples. They also have a state of the art gym on the -1 floor that always has free water bottles on hand, and a good variety of weights, machines and medicine balls. When I realized I forgot to pack a power converter, I asked the front desk where to buy one but instead of directions they gave an adapter to use for our stay!

Great value all around. We've already planned to stay here again our next trip back to Dublin.",5,2017,01,13
237,Perfect Hotel with exceptional Service,"Stayed here for a wedding recently, the hotel was perfect. Very clean and the staff couldn't do enough for you. 
The food was superb.
Breakfast price for 2 with room service was €44. But to be fair it was a lovely breakfast.",5,2017,01,10
237,Fantastic!,"We stayed here Friday to Sunday and loved it. Great location, across the bridge from temple bar and to the other side of the hotel doors is Jervis shopping centre and the dart. Breakfast here was amazing. Great selection of food. Staff were wonderful and very helpful. Room was great - great size and of great comfort. I'll definitely be back here.",5,2017,01,10
237,Lovely Hotel,"We spent 2 nights here over the new year and the morrison by double made it that bit more awesom. The hotel is spacious and modern with really ambient lighting and arty wallart throughout. Rooms are great with a nice comfy bed and modern bathroom! On arrival they did give us a twin room even tho we booked a double but i rang down to reception to let them no and they upgraded us to a higher priced room which was a double so no complaints from us.

The location is AWESOM!! Right in the heart of things, across the river from Temple bar and about a 20 minutes walk right alongside the river from the Guinness factory/storehouse.

We found the morrison by doubletree a perfect base for our weekend trip away and we would recommend it to anybody.

Thanks 

Dan & Amie",5,2017,01,09
237,Excellent family hotel,"We stayed recently at the Hilton Morrison. We were made instantly at home by Darren on reception. He was friendly and very informative . A cot was already in the room for our baby. Anna gave us a late check out, she has a great smile and personality. Vic was very fast and polite with room service.
Thank you to all the staff for a memorable stay with you. We will be back soon. D&J DJ 🌈",5,2017,01,08
237,"Clean, great location, good service","The location is very good and just minutes away (by foot) from all of Dublin's main attractions. The staff was friendly and helpful, and they provide assistance with transportation.

The room was clean and well kept. Just something to note, that with this particular hotel, you need to use your hotel card to access the lights. I didn't realize that and wasn't told that so it took me a few to figure out why the lights wouldn't turn on. I would recommend this hotel and likely stay here again.",4,2017,01,08
237,Great hotel great location,"Went to Dublin for the weekend for my boyfriends birthday and stayed at the Morrison! It's a lovely hotel very modern, clean staff are over helpful rooms are fab and location is great bars and restaurants all around as well as good shopping! Had the best weekend thanks for a great stay ",5,2017,01,06
237,Holiday vacation,Great location..across the street from the temple bar area ..clean rooms .. great food and staff ...near city tour bus tours .. great restaurant & lounge area ..lack of draw space but used the closet .. enjoyed ,5,2017,01,06
237,Very nice,"The Morrison was a great place to stay convenient to Temple Bar and O'Connell St. 
Facilities were excellent and food in the restaurant very good.  It was a great value on TripAdvisor though more modern than our taste normally. ",4,2017,01,05
237,Great venue for a wedding. ,This hotel is located in the city centre of dublin . It's a perfect location to explore dublin right in the city centre.  We attended my son's wedding and we were blown away. The hotel is ultra modern but classy. The food was excellent as was the service. The bar prices were a bit stiff but it was a small price to pay for excellence.  I will certainly return. ,5,2017,01,04
237,Beautiful hotel in city centre,This was our second trip back to the Morrison. It is luxurious and very centrally located. The breakfast was really good and the rooms have all amenities required. Checkout of 12pm is great. We will definitely return again,5,2017,01,03
237,Wonderful Little Hotel❤️,"Can't say enough good things about this wonderful little hotel...super friendly staff, great food, perfect location (near everything but quiet and cozy) and creature comforts galore! Will book for my next stay in Dublin.  This place is a real value compared to comparable hotels in the vicinity🍀",5,2017,01,03
237,Wonderful Stay,"Staff were so friendly! Had the absolute best time in Dublin! Hotel was stunning! Couldn't fault a single thing! 

Food was amazing, and the waitress could not have been more helpful! 

Definitely recommend going into temple bar, amazing atmosphere and live music! 

Loved every minute of our visit to Dublin!!",5,2017,01,03
237,New Year celebration weekend getaway,We stayed at the Morrison for 2 nights over the New Year. First of all the location is great. It's across Temple Bar area on the other side of River Liffey - so it was close enough to the action but was in a much more quieter and calmer area. The rooms were clean and the size okay. The pillows were fluffy and you got two each ( I suppose you can get some more if you need more than 2 per person ). Although a did find the bed a little hard - I still had a good night sleep. Our room did not have a view but that was quite alright for us. There is a restaurant and bar in the hotel. We had a few drinks at the bar but no food. Drinks were good but pricey and the bartenders were really nice. Everyone was really nice in the hotel. ,4,2017,01,02
237,First trip to Ireland,"First off, I must mention how the staff at The Morrison was over the top outstanding in their service and friendliness.  My plane landed at 5:00 a.m., yet they were able to provide me a much needed room when I arrived around 6:00!  They were full of useful information, made great recommendations, and went out of there way to make  our Dublin adventure a success.",5,2017,01,01
237,A return visit...,"I used to stay at this hotel a fair bit when travelling to Dublin through work. This is the first time I have returned since it has been taken over by the Hilton Group.

Breakfast was not as good as I remember it. Everything was a little over cooked / dry. It was ok but not excellent.

The ambience is lovely. The bar / grill is excellent and the bar staff particularly are second to none.

The location is great. Far enough from the madness not to be disturbed but near enough to walk to (although I did take a couple of taxis when going out in heels and these were reasonably priced).

I would class this hotel as a good 4 star and would recommend it.",4,2017,01,01
237,Amazing place to stay!,"We were visiting on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, 2 nights, 3 rooms. We were upgraded to the Penthouse!  OH MY!  Very awesome!  It was great to share this room with my daughter, her husband and 3 little ones, and my daughter and her 3 older children, myself and husband. They each had their own room but we had a private area in the Penthouse to just visit and be together!  There were 11 of us all told. The view was beyond lovely!  The staff was very efficient and friendly. We all enjoyed the balcony with lots to see, the walls were mostly windows and a Christmas tree also! I cannot imagine being in this room with only me and hubby....this is a room to share, with family and friends!  We were very blessed!",5,2017,01,01
237,Central Hotel,"Spending four days in Dublin with the family and the boys' girlfriends. We booked three rooms. Quality of hotel is great but position is exceptional. Reception staff are very polite and helpful. Unfortunately we are at the back and the noise early this  morning was intrusive to say the least. Getting a room higher up might help. Opted not to have breakfast and try the restaurants around the hotel, so cannot comment about the breakfast quality. However, we did go by the breakfast room and it seemed to be a quality spread. Good hotel in excellent location",4,2016,12,31
237,Comfortable City Centre Hotel ,"Comfortable city centre hotel just across the river from Temple bar. Hotel has been recently refurbished and rooms were well appointed. Friendly staff. 
Only downside was a little street noise at night as we were on the first floor. ",4,2016,12,30
237,Great stay,"The location is great, close to Temple Bar, the IFSC and the shopping streets. As a Gold member, the recognition is at the top : upgrade to a nice Suite, excellent breakfast, staff particularly helpful. The bar / restaurant is really nice as well. I would definitely recommend this hotel for any leisure or business stay in Dublin.",5,2016,12,30
237,Christmas in Dublin,"First the entire staff was extremely nice. In all my years of travel, I've never experienced such a nice and welcoming staff. We felt like we were among friends. My only complaint is that we didn't stay longer. We will be back and will stay here again.  Highlights -Centrally located on the north side of the river. Rooms were comfortable with American amenities. Breakfast staff extremely nice and the barista is top notch. Overall best hotel experience ever. ",5,2016,12,29
237,Would recommend to anyone! ,"Stayed in this hotel with my partner ( both age 25 ), could not fault this hotel, the staff are fantastic and couldn't do enough for you! 
We flew from Newcastle and there was a mix up with our luggage which left us without any of our things from the afternoon we got there until the following afternoon, the hotel staff sorted it all out for us by ringing the airport and finding the luggage, it would have cost us a fortune in phone calls if we were ringing ourselves, we then got a knock at the door from Adam who works at reception with our case! They were excellent, we couldn't thank them enough.
The rooms are lovely we were in room 316, cleaned every day and tea and coffee to have every morning and 2 bottles of water, room was very modern and spacious and beds comfy. Bathroom was fine, shower worked fine. 
Hotel is right in the centre of Dublin just across the bridge so was easy enough to walk to the pubs, restaurants and shops. 
Honestly could not fault this hotel if we were to come back we would without a doubt stay here again! ",5,2016,12,29
237,What a fabulous hotel right in the heart of Dublin,"I stayed here in a corner room, facing the back streets, what a great room and hotel. The staff just went above any beyond at every interaction. I spent a lot of time in the room as I was unwell, it was very comfortable. 

What was fab? 
* Great layout of room
* Great lunch room service meal of Beef & Barely soup
* Very spacious including a large bathroom
* Corner room with windows going along both side with electric curtains 
* Uniquely stocked mini bar

What was drab and needs attention? 
* After hours room service pizza, for the price was very scarce on toppings and not so tasty

What can't be easily changed? 
* Nothing to note 

Would I stay here again?
* Yes definitely",5,2016,12,29
237,Great hotel but disappointing food,Very unusual hotel in great location. Felt like it wasn't great value for money. Cookie on arrival was a nice touch but food in restaurant was overpriced. Would skip the breakfast the next time and get something in the numerous coffee shops around. Good location for shopping and you can walk everywhere ,3,2016,12,29
237,Top Quality Hotel and Great Service,"Great hotel on the river Liffey. High standards of service and very friendly staff. Check-in included a fresh warm cookie - nice touch. Rooms are very comfortable and well equipped including air conditioning and mini bar. Breakfast and bar service is very good and again friendly staff.

Good for business and leisure (but not cheap) - you get what you pay for!",5,2016,12,28
237,Excellent hotel and service,"Perfect location, beautiful rooms and superb staff who consistently went out of their way. We were travelling with a baby and lots of bags and couldn't be more comfortable and at ease as the staff were always a step ahead of us whether with bags or high chairs. Even the cot provided by the hotel was excellent, so much so that we didn't bother using our own travel cot.",5,2016,12,25
237,Morose-ison,"I'm a Hilton Diamond and have stayed around the world. The Morrison is truly ridiculous. See through bathrooms and no locks on bathroom doors for privacy. Rooms are sparse aside from the glare of the neon lights. This is a Hilton in need of a makeover. 

No Diamond recognition upon arrival.

237,Where customers Matter.,"Incredible location, Jaw-dropping rooms and the friendliest and most available staff I have ever had the pleasure to meet in my life so far. Perfect formula for a successful hotel and business.

The hotel is very easy to access, as it conveniently sits in the city centre, facing the River Liffey and it is within a five-minutes walk from the Airlink bus stop which connects the Airport and the city centre.  

As soon as I arrived at the hotel I was greeted with a warm and welcoming smile. As I realised I made a mistake with my online booking, the reception staff immediately offered an efficient solution which I was more than happy to accept! Going the extra mile for the customer always strikes a chord with me. 

The room I was assigned was incredible. Amazingly decorated, from the warm lighting choice to the combination of colour. Cherry on top: inspired song lyrics painted on the wall in front of my bed. A bed which was incredibly comfortable.

I have had the chance to try the breakfast served in the hotel. Varied and inviting, it allows you to go for a smaller sweet one with a selection of croissant and muffins or opt for a more savoury one, including all the ingredients of a traditional English Breakfast.

I will always have fond memories of this hotel in my life. It's a must.",5,2016,12,22
237,Made to wait...and wait..and wait..,"Arrived at 1.55pm to be told suite wouldn't be ready for 40 minutes by the delightful Brazilian lady at reception. She processed payment (hold on credit card for room rate plus €100 extra) and bags were left in the storage cupboard, then headed for lunch close by.

Came back at 3pm (the advertised hotel check-in time) to be told room not ready yet. No apologies, just a statement of fact.

The charming Brazilian lady had gone off shift to be replaced by the irritating cast of some Irish sitcom!! 

""Would you like a drink while you wait""..no, I'd just like the room your colleague said would be ready at 2.40pm.

How long will it be I ask...""erm, not long they're just cleaning it""..

How long is not long I ask..""I don't know, housekeeping aren't answering the radio""..

At this point a lady, who I presume was the Duty Manager comes from the back room and states ""the previous guest checked out late"" to which I reply ""it's your responsibility to ensure the previous guest has checked out in a timely fashion and the room is cleaned and ready for the guest who's just paid €458 to stand around Reception (fair enough right readers) I was now on the cusp of asking for my money back and going somewhere else for my one night in Dublin.

""Two minutes Sir"" I'm then told by the gentleman behind the desk. 

Great I say, ""give me the key and by the time I get to the room it'll be ready, right""?...

""Ah no, actually Sir it needs inspecting first""...so not two minutes then I say!..

I hasten to add at this point I'd been up since 6am travelling from Norway and it was now 3.30pm!!

I then make to go outside for a smoke to calm my ire when the young bell hop asks if I'd like my bags taken out of the storage cupboard and taken to the room when it's ready.

No, I reply, I'll take them myself thank you (I have valuables in my bags and given the shambles I'd experienced already I had visions of my bags ending up in someone else's room, or sailing down the Liffey).

I come back in from a long lingering smoke to be told the room is ready, here is your key..and wait for it...your bags are in the room!!! ARGHHHH

So, to summarise, the whole team failed big time, consistently gave incorrect information, failed to have the room ready on time, and also failed to listen to their guest.

I will never, never in a thousand years return to this hotel.

In saying that, sleep quality was good (once you work out how to turn off the myriad of lights - trust me on this, they need labelling) and breakfast wasn't bad, just a bit dry.

I rarely lose my cool, but well done Morrison's top check-in front desk team, you managed it big time. I'll never forget any of your confused faces..

The hotel's internal communications and workflows need serious revision..

p.s After venting on the Hilton app while waiting for my flight I received an email from Hilton Worldwide within 7 minutes to be offered an apology for the hotel's failings and stating that ""mistakes happen"". And to make it up to you here's 5,000 Hilton HHonours points. Gee, thanks, that makes me feel so much better about my experience (note the sarcasm).",2,2016,12,20
237,"Friendly, Helpful, and Flawless!","It was my first trip to Dublin and while excited about visiting the city i did not give a second though to the hotel. I have stayed in other DoubleTree by Hilton before and know the basic standard is good, and this particular one was a fantastic location.

Since my return my main comments and stories about Dublin have all been about your fantastic hotel! 
As an event manager I travel a lot for work, and quite honestly I have never been in any other Hilton like it! 
Not only is it well located, beautifully dressed, and clean, but your staff and service was better than some of the 4/5 star hotels I have stayed in!

I MUST make a special mention to Darren (sorry didn't catch the second name) and Jason Bullman who not only made me and my mum feel welcome front the moment we stepped through the door, but they couldn't do enough for us! 
They actually spent time talking to us, and helping us make the most of our trip with all of the best recommendations. Jason even remembered our reservation as we walked back through the door, and immediately handed us a room key.... as we had arrived earlier that day.
All of the staff where friendly and helpful, but these two gentlemen really stood out and are a great credit to you hotel. I hope the hotel recognises this and rewards them in some way.

We will be back! I've already started looking for flights next month, and we certainly won't be considering any other hotels.

Many Thanks for a memorable stay!

237,Wedding,We stayed here for my friends wedding. Great location and she walked to her wedding in the fab city hall. Staff at reception were really friends . Great food and drink . Lovely wedding room with smoking room near so you didn't lose crowd. Room clean and quiet . Lovely restaurants close by and well appointed if coming to Dublin city. ,4,2016,12,19
237,"Nice, but I would expect even more outstanding quality from Hilton","In general hotel is nice. It is well located and very cozy. I don't know whether all double rooms were booked, or they just don't have any.. Beds in twin rooms are quite tiny. I had to move both beds together, but mattresses kept separating, hence I wouldn't say I had the best sleep. Also mattress quality was not on top ( I somehow keep comparing with Hilton Double Tree Tower Hill in London). And the last - air conditioning is extremely loud, so I kept my window open during the night. However, I had to close it soon since Irish is hard-partying people and when they are drunk they enjoy singing:)))",4,2016,12,18
237,Great hotel,Stayed here for one night. The only thing warmer than the hotel was the welcome we received.  The customer service was super. Really nice hotel in a great location.  Very nice food also. No hesitation in recommending this hotel to anybody.,5,2016,12,17
237,Best upgrade ever to Penthouse Suite!,"Incredible stay here this week - when I was checking in, the lady very casually told me I'd been upgraded, walked to my room on the Hilton Honours Floor and walked in to the most amazing penthouse suite I've ever set foot in.

All staff were very friendly, only shame was I wasn't there longer!

Thanks for everything :)",5,2016,12,16
237,Great 2 night stay,Clean and modern city centre hotel. Staff was friendly and professional. Close to all areas you want to be in Dublin. Modern and stylish lobby and room. TThe tram is located 2 blocks away for longer journeys in the city. The bed was too firm otherwise no complaints!,5,2016,12,15
237,2 brilliant nights in my fave city !,"Stayed in various hotels in Dublin over the years but this one has got to be the best . Fantastic location and a beautiful modern and relaxed feeling hotel . Staff were brilliant especially when we turned up early before check in time .
  The bar area is lovely and i have to say serves the best coffee . Will return and totally recommend here for a city break .",5,2016,12,13
237,Excellent location and would definitely recommend,"My husband and I stayed at The Morrison for two nights in early December of 2016.  We were very pleased with our choice.   I would stay there again and definitely recommend the hotel.  My favorite aspect of the hotel was the breakfast.   The staff were helpful and even brought our beverages to us at our table since our hands were full from holding our food.  They had a drinking chocolate machine and the hot chocoloate was such a unique and tasty treat for breakfast.   I also was very happy with the warm items at breakfast and my husband and I both agreed the muffin we split was the best tasting muffin we had ever eaten at a hotel.  
We walked everyone once arriving at the hotel because the location was so excellent.   It is a rather short walk to the Temple Bar area.   We even wandered around the city and stopped at churches, historic places, and restaurants/bakeries that peaked our interest.   We even walked to Guinness, which was a much more impressive tour than I had imagined.
We stayed in Dublin after visiting Galway.   Therefore, we had a rental car.   The hotel has parking at a garage not even half a block away.   The parking situation was coveniently located just a minute walk from the hotel entrance, it was only 12 Euro for each 24 hour period, and we were very happy with it.   ",5,2016,12,12
237,Amazing hotel,"I cannot recomnend this hotel enough, the team here played such a big part of the best weekend of my life from organising restaurants to assisting my partner in surprising me with a proposal to decorating our room and everything else they did, - a truly amazing hotel and team!!!!",5,2016,12,11
237,The Morrison Hotel - The Whole Package,"First you need the property (location and building), then you need the vibe, then you need the people. The Morrison has the whole package. Great accommodations, welcoming rooms, great breakfast room, inviting bar and perfect location. Super vibe...in the heart of everything while being away from everything, all at the same time. A great mix! And now the most important factor, the people. The front desk...excellent. The housekeeping...super. Same for the bar. However, Maria and Darin (from the front desk) MADE The Morrison! I want them to take care of me EVERYTIME! I felt 100% the most important person in their care 100% of the time. We will be back to The Morrison as well as everyone we tell because of Maria and Darin!",5,2016,12,11
237,Great Hotel/Close to Attractions,"This hidden gem was perfect for us! Traveling to Dublin for the first time, not knowing the City, we were pleasantly surprised at the proximity to Temple Bar and O'Connell Street. We walked everywhere from the hotel. It's truly centrally located! Don't let the river fool you, it's very small and there are short bridges that bring you to the other side. It's just a few feet! ",4,2016,12,09
237,Great comfortable hotel and nice staff,"The rooms are nice and contemporary, comfortable and functional. Free Internet is of good speed. Beds are big and comfortable. Staff are all great, very profesional and attentive. I stay frequently and will do so again soon.  ",5,2016,12,09
237,Very nice business stay in Dublin,"I really enjoyed my stay at the Morrisson during my business meeting in Dublin. Very modern and comfortable rooms and very friendly staff. Price is rather high but the location is ideal, next to the Temple Bar area and very close to Dublin city centre and commercial district.",5,2016,12,08
237,Wedding Anniversary,"Beautiful hotel, friendly staff and excellent location - would definitely recommend this to family and friends if they wanted a trip to Dublin with that extra bit of luxury - looking forward to returning in the near future ",5,2016,12,07
237,A few nights in Dublin,Hotel staff were very helpful in finding restaurants and pubs etc.  The room was very cool and had all the latest amenities.  Bed could have been softer.  (There is not box spring)  Linens and pillows were very nice. Had a tub and shower which I like.  Hotel has lots of restaurants and bar options although we always went out.,4,2016,12,07
237,"Modern, detailed.","This hotel is such a great location. I love the modern touches to this hotel, there's such wonderful detail I want to copy this style in my own home. The breakfast is brilliant, choices from the menu, and more from the buffet too, and more pastries than you can shake a stick at. The bed is comfortable, the TV large, the shower and bathroom clean, modern. Linen is as expected. Oh my, and the bar downstairs... yes, love it, also the restaurant - I ate way too much there.
It DOES get noisy on weekend nights - because it turns into some sort of 'club'. They do warn residents if there's something extra noisy happening - and this was useful... either go out and come back later, or just put some music on the TV.
I loved it. Thanks!",5,2016,12,06
237,Very nice hotel in a great location with very nice staff,"The hotel itself is located just north of the Temple Bar area and location wise is great if you are not interested in the nightlife but prefer a more quiet and peaceful time. The room itself was really nice although it was odd to see a huge bathroom with only one hook for a towel and no power outlet to use a hairdryer.

The bar and in room dining provide very good value and are impeccable.

The only remark was that during our stay, on saturday upon returning we found a note stating an event would take place on the same evening and this would last up to 1.30 AM. The event had very loud music and the floor vibrated on the third floor because of it. I did not notify staff as it was announced and I do not wish to spoil other peoples event however management should perhaps in the future consider not to allow this type event to last until 1.30. Midnight would be much more acceptable for the other guests in the hotel.

Lastly I would like to say that head concierge Darren has really provided us with excellent service and went the extra mile to help us out in planning our trip and providing us guidance around. A big thanks for that !",4,2016,12,05
237,Avoid the first floor. ,"Super attentive staff throughout our stay, a comfortable and huge bed and the fabulous location made this stay a good one, despite some problems. There was a lot of noise from the disco, from the corridor and from the street -  I don't know quite what can be done to improve the soundproofing but until it is I would definitely recommend as high a floor as possible. The manager was extremely sympathetic, reduced my bill considerably (although I was presented initially with the original one at checkout,  oops) and moved us to the blissfully quiet 3rd floor. Result! 
Just some observations that are purely a matter of taste - the reception has a large number of weird cushions that you can only perch on -  impossible to sit down properly. The  bathroom had a big space where a wet room would have been ideal, not to mention towel storage -  they were all taking up space next to the basin! There was only one bathrobe -  not an oversight but policy, apparently. 
Thanks to the staff for being so helpful and professional. ",4,2016,12,04
237,Fabulous hotel,"Just spent one night with my husband and we were both very impressed with the hotel. It's a cool hotel with a great atmosphere. The grill restaurant was buzzing when we were there. It was one of the best meals we had had in a long time. I had the fillet steak and my husband had the venison. Both were so tender and delicious. 
Our room (junior suite) was spacious and very well decorated and also very quiet considering its busy location. The hotel is within a few mins of great shopping and restaurants. 
Finally the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. 
Great hotel! ",5,2016,12,03
237,I'm happy to say --->,"Doubletree Dublin has
Wonderful staff -very attentive  -forward thinking special touches!
Great bath sheets- and that's one of my cardinal Requirements
Decor  is modern  and soothing
Elevators are bright and inventive.
There is a tea pot and associated items to warm 
We had an issue in our first room- none of the electric sockets worked so we called down and they moved us to a different  room one floor above quite promptly
Also they  invited us to have a drink  in good spirit! And included breakfast gratis.
This is good business thinking and won points from me.
The location could not have been better if I had requested a perfect location !
Everything including the salon quality hair blower and numerous places to access electricity  was anticipated to the highest level.
The one sad point I must make is
The bed, a mattress upon a platform 
Was uncomfortable -extremely hard and unforgiving.
I brought this to the attention of the staff upon check out and they had wished I had said something sooner so they might provide  a topper to soften the bed experience
So
Even though the bed was not comfortable, this will not deter me from returning because I know they will make it better!
All said and done I truly enjoyed the full extent of this hotel experience, and highly recommend  it. We had a river view room and recommend a high floor
Enjoy!",4,2016,12,03
237,"Lovely hotel, great location ","This hotel was really lovely, the rooms are modern and clean with all mod cons. The location is also fantastic, easily can walk to all the main attractions and shopping area. We were greeted with warm cookies at reception on check in!

We didn't eat here but the cocktails at the bar are lovely and the bar staff are very helpful. 

I had a little bit of trouble checking in, and I felt a bit looked down on by staff which is the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5. That said, most of the other staff experiences were lovely but I didn't get a great vibe from reception. Maybe it was because we were a young couple. I would stay here again though because it was a lovely clean hotel.",4,2016,12,03
237,"Great Location, Fun Hotel","This hotel is in a prime location for visiting all that Dublin has to offer.  The check in experience was great, and staff even took the time to help plan some sightseeing and helped me book tours.  We were able to check in early and could hit the town right away.  Drinks in the bar were a great way to end an evening on the town.  Rooms are fun and modern, and the hotel was sparkling clean.  The Morrison is a hotel not to be missed on your trip to Dublin.",5,2016,12,03
237,Business meeting/training day,"Found the hotel much improved since staying there 6 years ago.  On arrival the reception was busy, knowing I couldn't check in so early I went to the concierge desk and as I looked at him his preference was to answer the phone!!!
Lunch was great and staff in restaurant were really good. 
Meeting rooms were ok didn't much like the open plan of one. The room was so comfortable it was heaven! Room service for breakfast was great. 
Checking out was easy enough and looking at the cost of the parking next door I was pleasantly surprised that for 24 hrs parking it was only €12. 
In my opinion a great location and well worth a visit!!!! 👍👌🏻🌸",4,2016,12,02
237,Great staff,"We enjoyed the revamp Morrison. The room was spacious and the bathroom well equiped. Super lovely staff. The breakfast menu extensive and the buffet perfect. We enjoyed that they had an actual barista making our morning coffee also.

237,Excellent,"I usually never leave reviews, but this experience was too good not to.  This is one of the best, if not the best hotel I have ever stayed at.  Rooms are large and immaculate, staff are extremely friendly and helpful, going above and beyond with service.  Whenever I revisit  someplace, I like to stay in a different hotel to get a different experience.  Never in Dublin, when I go to Dublin, I will only stay at the Morrison.",5,2016,11,29

237,"Great location, helpful staff","We traveled as a family of 4 and were able to get connector rooms from a king (yes, you read correctly) into a room with 2 singles. Just make sure to book directly with the hotel even if you have high tier Hilton status. Breakfast was good and had made to order option at no additional charge. Plus the mall with a large Tesco grocery store is a block away as is the ubiquitous Spar (e.g. 7-11) everywhere. Only downside of hotel is that if you rent a car there really is no dropoff zone (yes there is technically one but you may get there to find a bus there) - the carpark is only 100 meters up the road so if you're in reasonable condition and didn't pack the kitchen sink, just lug your stuff from the ramp to the hotel. Skip doing laundry and make the <10 min walk to the Allamerican Launderette where it is 10.50 euro per load for them to do it for you. Dropoff at 830am when they open and your stuff is done by 330pm same day. Worked great for us and you don't have to pack as much stuff or pay hotel rates for laundry if you're not traveling on biz.",5,2016,11,27

237,Superb Staff,"We have just returned from a lovely weekend in Dublin, mainly owing to our staff at The Morrison.
Checking in was great, very friendly, very helpful staff and this was a theme that continued over the weekend.
The location is superb and there are some great places to visit within walking distance.
The only downside was our very noisy neighbours on our floor who decided to continue the party they'd been attending, in their room with no regard to fellow guests.  We telephoned reception about the noise at 4.30 a.m and again at 5.00 a.m and someone very kindly came up and asked them to keep the noise down, which unfortunately they chose to ignore.  Having had little sleep we mentioned this at reception a few hours later and asked to change rooms if they were staying another night.   To our delight the front office manager Piotr Marek was more than sympathetic and accommodating and we cannot thank him enough for his care and consideration.  The rest of our weekend was fantastic and we truly love this city and will definately return to The Morrison.  The breakfast buffet was also one of the best hotel breakfasts I've had and again the staff could not do enough for you, this truly is a special hotel.",5,2016,11,22
237,Wonderful,I would definitely recommend this hotel - Perfect modern hotel with lovely attributes and perks and location is quiet enough but close to shopping and pubs.  Staff is incredibly helpful and friendly.  Food is very good - everything that Dublin has to offer is just steps away.,5,2016,11,22
237,Perfect Location,"My wife and I stayed here for two nights during a long weekend trip to Ireland, and truly enjoyed our time at The Morrison.

First off, the location is perfect for just about anything you might want to do in the city of Dublin.  Dublin is a very walkable city, and this hotel places you just minutes from the majority of attractions.

The breakfast buffet is fantastic, offering a variety of traditional Irish breakfast options, as well as classic American/English/French choices, and a made to order coffee/espresso bar.  It was included in our stay since I have gold status with Hilton, but would be well worth the price if we had to pay for it.

Live music is offered in the evenings, and is tempting as a comfortable place to sit down and have a few drinks. That said, our time was brief, and I wanted more of an Irish pub experience.

Staff was courteous and helpful.  One night during our stay, an event was being hosted on the main floor, and I found a letter in my room apologizing for any disturbance, alongside some complimentary chocolate and crisps.  I'm not sure what the event was, but I certainly couldn't appreciate any additional noise from my room on the third floor.  However, the consideration was greatly appreciated.

I highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Dublin, and will plan on staying here again myself when we next visit.",5,2016,11,21
237,Great Hotel,"Stayed for two days over the weekend found this hotel to be in a great location, and to offer a wide range of facilities. On arrival the checking process was painless and as you enter reception there is a smell of cookies to which we received two large cookies at checking. Rooms well decorated and spacious. Although the room that we were in didn't have a very good view but this didn't overly concerned me as we weren't planning to stay in the room for long periods of time.

Over the weekend breakfast is served till 12pm and has this great selection of buffet style or ordering off the menu.

I found the checkout time of 12 PM great which meant that we didn't have to rush on the day of departure. Staff were very friendly and helpful and has a great atmosphere especially at night times in the bar. I will definitely stay at this hotel again when I return back to Dublin.

My only negative comment is that the beds seemed very hard which gave me a bad back but that may be down to my sensitive back.",4,2016,11,21
237,Oh Wow!,"Smack in the centre of Dublin, this gorgeous, funky, cool hotel will NOT disappoint!  The staff are just gorgeous, friendly, and not afraid to engage with their guests, So refreshing!  The bar is fabulous and comfortable...the night we were there, we had the most entertaining Co. Antrim man behind the bar...he kept us entertained without even trying.  Dinner was fabulous, as was breakfast...we cannot fault The Morrison and can't wait for our return visit.",5,2016,11,20
237,Fantastic Stay,"My husband is a Hilton Diamond member and we stayed here with points for five nights in early September.  The hotel was sold-out so a room upgrade was not available, which the staff was extremely apologetic about.

The staff was very friendly and professional.  The hotel location was excellent - a very convenient location but tucked away from the noise.  The room itself was comfortable and spacious.  The bed was incredibly comfortable and the shower pressure was great.  Our biggest gripe was that the wireless was very spotty in the room, but overall that was just a minor inconvenience.  I also found the closet setup to be a bit awkward as it had cascading hooks instead of a traditional bar, but again, very minor.

Breakfast was awesome and there were plenty of gluten-free and dairy-free options for my medical dietary restrictions.  The gluten-free bread and dedicated toaster were an especially nice touch.  As Diamond members, we were also able to order off of the menu.  The staff in the restaurant was very attentive and always had a smiling face.

The gym was nice and spacious with a decent amount of options.  I do wish they had free weight options that were less than 5 kg.  My spouse and I were still able to get a solid workout in every morning though.

Overall, The Morrison is a conveniently located luxury hotel that is appropriately priced.  We would absolutely stay here again!

In terms of getting back and forth from the airport, we took the two-story green Airlink 747 bus and used the O'Connell Street stop each way.  It was about a 30-45 minute trip with the stops.  The bus was clean, comfortable and had free wifi.  Buy a return (round-trip) ticket to save a few euros.  

If you are flying from Dublin back to the United States, the customs process did not take three hours for us like we were warned it would.  From the time we stepped off of the bus at the airport, to the time we were in the secure pre-clearance gate area, it was not even an hour.  For reference, we had a morning flight the day after Labor Day.  Lastly, there was only one lounge option and limited restaurant options in the pre-clearance section of the airport, so use that to plan your trip through the airport.  We just followed the signs and before we knew it we were at our gate two hours early with extremely limited food options.

We loved Dublin and we loved The Morrison!  Enjoy your stay!",5,2016,11,20
237,Fantastic hotel,"A wonderful hotel in a great location just minutes walk from all of Dublin's main attractions.

I love the makeover they have given the hotel and it now has a modern yet luxurious feel. The rooms are lovely, bright and spacious with very comfortable beds.

Overall our favorite Dublin hotel. ",5,2016,11,20
237,Nice hotel ,"Extended a business trip through the weekend and stayed at The Morrison. Nice hotel, very centrally located (at the River Liffey)...within walking distance to everything. Restaurant and bar, free wifi. Street noise can be loud so if that bothers you at least don't choose a second floor room on the side street. Smaller room but nothing out of the ordinary for Europe. Not sure how comfortable the beds are but it wasn't terrible so you can decide for yourself. Clean and modern. I'd stay here again. ",4,2016,11,19
237,"Nice hotel, noisy guests","The Morrison is a lovely hotel located within easy walking distance to Temple Bar. The staff is welcoming, the warm cookies are tasty and the rooms are very comfortable. 

The one challenge is that either there isn't much sound proofing or the guests were particularly noisy. Probably a bit of both!  

I was traveling on business and it was clear that others were enjoying Dublin's lively pub scene.  ",4,2016,11,19

237,A great hotel in a great city,"On a business trip for a few days. This hotel is very well situated near major attractions and the city centre and is a home away from home. It was clean, the staff were great and the room was fantastic. Breakfast was excellent (try the french toast) and I just really enjoyed the stay. Thanks,",5,2016,11,15
237,Wonderful Hotel,"We have just returned from another great stay at the Morrison in Dublin.  Located centrally next to the Liffey, the Morrison provides a really professional and welcoming service.  
The city is always busy and was particularly so last weekend however, as as soon as you step inside the hotel, you find yourself in a different world.  The friendly staff always provide a great service without being old fashioned or stuffy.  You can spend time in the relaxing bar and grill which offers great drinks and cocktails alongside an all day menu.
We stayed in a King size guest room on the second floor with a really comfortable bed, T.V, mini bar, dressing gown, slippers, lovely toiletries in the bathroom and not forgetting the  free Wi-Fi.  There was even an umbrella (very useful in Dublin). The breakfast is excellent with a wide choice of delicious hot and cold foods which were  delicious.
Reception honored our request of an early check- in which was really appreciated since we had arrived on a very early flight. from Stansted. We would have liked to have stayed longer and look forward to staying at the Morrison again in the future.",5,2016,11,15
237,Great stay,"Lovely location and great service was made to feel very welcome, outstanding example of great service. 

Food quality at dinner was exemplary but breakfast hot offering on the buffet could up its game a little. ",5,2016,11,13
237,An amazing experience ,"Brilliant hotel , brilliant staff , brilliant location right next to the river Liffey , visited for 4 days 6th to the 10th of November rooms got upgraded as we are prt of Hilton HHonors , I've got a say and remark a member of staff that was superb ! Mark McCormack from the bar was so friendly and helpful always good to have a laugh.. will definitely be back here soon you've got to love it !! 

",5,2016,11,10
237,Great hotel!,"Stayed at this hotel with my Mum as a treat for Mother's Day. The hotel is right on the River Liffey - and just across the river from Temple Bar so it's a perfect location.

Our room was large and really clean and modern - we loved it! The staff were very helpful and attentive.

We used this more as a base for exploring the city, so didn't get chance to have any meals here, but the bar/restaurant looked really lovely!

Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for somewhere to stay in Dublin.",5,2016,11,08
237,Best Location - Modern Chic Hotel,GREAT location!  Just on the Liffey River across from Temple Bar and 2 blocks from the shopping on Henry Street.  Very nice and modern design of hotel.  The staff were very helpful and accommodating for my 1 year old daughter (calls to room service for milk and crib). I would definitely stay in this hotel again.,5,2016,11,07
237,What a wonderful hotel!,"We soent 6 nights here. Modern. Comfortable. The staff was very friendly. Our room was clean and beautiful, if one can say that about a hotel room. The onsite restaurant, Morrison Cafe, was fantastic (see separate review). The breakfast facility was also nice with a very good selection ofrom a full breakfast, to fruits, cereals and yogurt. To top everything off , tne location for exploring Dublin could not have been better. You will not be sorry choosing tbe facility.",5,2016,11,07
237,Bad experience,I had walked into the Morrison Hotel to use the restroom and a woman told me if I was to use the restroom I had to buy a drink etc so I bought myself a drink and asked where the restroom was as I was walking towards the restroom a man rudely walked Infront of me and waved his arms demanding why I was in there I explained to him I was a paying customer and explained I was walking to the restroom he yelled at me to leave immediately and he waving me out of The door and told me to go to a bar down the road and go there i found that very unprofessional and I felt very embarrassed they way he has spoken to me . I would never go back in there again after being treated so badly,1,2016,11,05
237,Great location - great experience,"Perfect location for our Dublin vacation.
Hotel is in walking distance to everything.
Room was ample size, clean, modern, was overlooking the Liffey River, only on the first floor but we did not hear any street noise.
The service from reception was first class from the minute we arrived.
The concierge desk was 100% spot on with its recommendations.
James who was on duty in the afternoon and evenings, hopefully I got his name right, was exceptional. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin. 
The breakfast was also everything that you could want while the cup of tea from the restaurant late in the afternoon was perfect.
Again I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,11,05
237,"Excellent location,friendly staff","Staff at checkin and checkout went out of their way and were very helpful, providing useful local advice. Everything worth seeing, drinking or buying is within walking distance. Would not look for another one next time",4,2016,11,05
237,Very Good but.......,"Nearly perfect location near Temple Bar, all hop on hop stops and within walking distance of many sites. The front desk staff was wonderful. We arrived early in the morning, checked our bags, went sight seeing and returned to check in and found bags already in room. Breakfast was varied and well done. Service in the bar was happy and efficient. The room is small and a little quirky. We had to call the desk to find out how to turn off the pink background lights. The really bad news was our room was on a side street on which happy drunks paraded until early in the morning. Closing the window and the drapes didn't help",4,2016,11,04
237,"Friendly welcoming staff, great location, comfortable room!",All of the staff is friendly and professional! The hotel is just north of Temple bar area. Tons of great restaurants and pubs close by. The rooms are always kept clean and well take care of. Makes for a very enjoyable stay!,5,2016,11,03
237,Great stay in Dublin,"You couldn't find better hotel checkin staff.  They were very helpful and exhibited a great amount of professionalism. The bed was very comfortable and the location was excellent, especially for the Temple Bar area.",5,2016,11,02
237,Excellent hotel,Great location with modern rooms. Excellent food and friendly hotel staff. Gary in the bar and Darren at the front desk will make your stay and visit to Dublin complete. The food is great in the restaurant. ,5,2016,11,02
237,Excellent hotel,This hotel is top notch. It's in city centre and the rooms are amazing. Staff is super helpful and friendly. The rates have gone up a lot though lately but if you can get a room for a reasonable price you won't regret booking here.,5,2016,11,02
237,Great location and loyalty upgrade!!,"Loved the location of this hotel, close walk to anything we wanted to see. Very much appreciated the penthouse upgrade for our one quick night in Dublin! Jason and Adam hooked us up with suggestions on things to do and see and I think we hit them all! Absolutely fantastic staff--special thank you to Jason whose exceptional customer service exceeded any I've ever seen. Absolutely fantastic experience in a beautiful city! Can't wait to come back!",5,2016,11,01
237,"Gorgeous hotel, great location, INCREDIBLE Staff!!",If you want to be close to everything in downtown Dublin and be treated like royalty... this is the place for you!  The staff was awesome.  Especially Maria who was there to assist from the moment we arrived.  Thank you!!,5,2016,11,01
237,I would give this 10 stars if I could!!!!!,"I was running the marathon on Sunday and proposing to my girlfriend straight after. I contacted the hotel 3 weeks prior to my stay and wanted to arrange for roses to be in my room for when we returned. Darren looked after everything with such efficiency. From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty and not just for this reason, they treated all visitors like this. Words can't describe how good the customer service is at this hotel. I came back from the run and we were given a lovely congratulation dessert which was presented fantastically. Then we went back to the room and saw the beautiful roses which was organised. A big thank you to Jane who was just so welcoming and attentive. The customer service in this hotel was flawless. With a 2 minute walk to temple bar and 2 mins to O'Connell Street, this hotel was close to everything. We travel to dublin 3 times a year and this is by far the best hotel I have stayed in. We definitely stay here again. Thank you to all stay that made our stay exceptional",5,2016,11,01
237,Class Hotel,The hotel is ideally located in the middle of Dublin. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful and done everything to assist us. The rooms and food where second to none. We really enjoyed our stay. ,5,2016,11,01
237,Great Stay,"Great location in Dublin, just across from Temple Bar area.  Very ""modern"" stylings, but still felt warm and inviting.  Very friendly front desk who went out of their way to welcome us and help out -- they contacted housekeeping to speed the cleaning of our room when we arrived early, and called a taxi for our pickup on checkout (plus called the cab again, on their own initiative, when it seemed he was taking his time).",5,2016,11,01
237,Weekend break,"We spent weekend with two other couples and the location, the quality and service of all staff was second to none. The front of house team, the bar staff and the breakfast staff all could not have been more helpful. Overall I would not hesitate to come back here as everyone was so helpful and friendly",5,2016,10,31
237,"Great Place, Great Location.",Very good location with very friendly staff. Bath Room was nice clean great shower. Checked in soon as I got there which was nice. Comfortable Bed and Pillows. Did not have dinner but Breakfast was very good. Very healthy choices to choose from. ,5,2016,10,31
237,Dublin 1 nighter - wish we could have stayed a bit longer,"The hotel room was spotless and the public areas are well maintained. The breakfast choice was really good with cooked offerings and continental. We found the room to be rather hot at night, but must admit we did not report it or try and correct the temperature. There was quite a lot of external noise that leaked into the room at night - which disturbed our sleep - but I don't know what the hotel could have done about that - other than ensuring better window insulation/sound proofing.",5,2016,10,31
237,Great location and value in Dublin,"Just across the pedestrian bridge from Temple Bar and within a 10-20 min walk from most major attractions, this is a great place to stay for exploring Dublin. Staff was incredibly helpful, full of good recommendations, and rooms themselves are stylish and comfortable. ",5,2016,10,31
237,Hotel nice a bit hard to find when driving,"We were only here for one night. The room was very nice, well appointed. Right on the river, near lots of bars in the area. But our room was still quiet as it faced a court yard.

We drove here from the country, and had trouble finding it. The entrance is actually on Swifts Row, which is a different address than what is given on the website (around the corner).  The parking lot is down the street on Jervis.  We knew none of this before arriving, so it made finding the hotel entrance and parking lot a bit interesting, especially on a Saturday evening when the narrow streets were very busy with pedestrians.  We suggest that the hotel post more information on its website regarding the hotel entrance, and location of parking.

Another issue was that the Dublin Marathon was the Sunday morning we left, but the parking lot did not open until 9 in the morning.  We drove to the airport, avoiding the marathon route so it ended up being ok.",4,2016,10,30
237,City Life Atmosphere!,Great location to the Dublin city centre and great customer experience too. Staff were very polite and great with guests. They are always eager to help especially when they know a customer is in need for something.,5,2016,10,28
237,The Morrison is great to stay at when in Dublin,"The Morrison is great to stay at when in Dublin, its right across the river from the Temple bar. The hotel staff is excellent and are more then helpful when any question or concerns arise. The hotel is close to both the rail and bus excursions. Both are walk able but for it being so early in the morning we took a cab 6 euros to the bus and 9 to the rail stations. You could walk to the Bus in 5 mins maybe 20-25 to the rails. There are two rail stations so just check where your trip leaves from. The hotel has food and a 24 hour pizza room service which is great for after drinking nights. The rooms have fridges which is nice but beware the 6 dollar euro charge for a bottle of water, everything else was priced about what you would expect. Stores are close and center Dublin is a 10 min walk. The bar was nice and had good cocktails, I do wish the entertainment was a bit better but there are plenty of places nearby that have real good Irish music and cover bands. I would definitely stay at this hotel again .",4,2016,10,27
237,"Highly recommend this modern, well located 4 star hotel","The Morrison may very well be the best DoubleTree experience I have had. It is a well located, modern-feeling hotel with super comfy rooms in central Dublin. Used a combination of points and $$, making it an especially great value (but in general the hotel is a good value anyway). I would stay here again and recommend it!
 
The room was extremely comfortable and well designed to maximize space. The bedding was luxurious with down pillows, duvet, etc. Bathroom was ok, spacious but not luxurious and probably the biggest ""tell"" this was a DoubleTree property.

The front desk staff was bend-over-backwards levels of helpful on the one or two conversations we had. Although there was not a lounge for Diamond members, I was easily able to find common areas that allowed me to power through work at all hours without keeping my partner awake by camping out in our room. Breakfast area was vast, with all sorts of delicious options, as well as a menu to order 4 or 5 special items. The service was wonderful there, as was the food. 

Downsides were minimal. The late night room service menu (after 10:30pm) was pizza. Just pizza. Sub-optimal pizza that I ate half of one slice of. I called at 10:32pm and there was no ability to accommodate even the items on the dinner menu like soup that were surely still easy bring up. Service from all other dimensions was outstanding, so I just presumed it was hard to help on a busy weekend evening. Aesthetically I could nitpick and share that our room had a gigantic quote that was laughably bad, purple pantone-esque squares on the carpet and purple glowing cubes that felt right out of the 1980s. Ditto in the lobby. Seems like maybe the hotel is trying a bit too hard to have an edgy boutique feel. 

Lastly, a thank you! It was the hotel that tipped me off to the nightmare that is departing from Dublin Airport to travel to the US via preclearance required customs. Time consuming and I would not have otherwise planned to arrive so early. 

Overall it was a lovely stay in a well located, modern, luxury hotel with good service and I would come back.",4,2016,10,27
237,Exceptional Service!,"We recently stayed just one night at the Morrison en route to Barcelona.  We arrived in Dublin before dawn and made our way to the Hotel knowing it was much too early to check in (5 AM) but hoping to just store our luggage and go looking for breakfast.  The wonderful man behind the counter must have taken one look at us and realized we needed sleep.  He said our room was available if we would like to go up.  YAY!  A few hours sleep is just what we needed to gear up for our 30 hours in Dublin.  The room was very clean, quiet, modern, and super comfy.  We found the staff to be super friendly and very knowledgeable.  They were able to recommend great places to eat, drink, and shop.  We had a wonderful stay at the Morrison and would definitely stay again.",5,2016,10,27
237,Excellent location & service,"Highly recommend staying here, can't beat the location. Staff is very friendly & helpful. Breakfast buffet is not to be missed. We took hop on hop off bus, stop is a couple of blocks away from the hotel. Given the hotel is right across the Temple Bar, it was easy to come back to hotel, unwind for a bit before heading out for dinner & drinks in the most bustling & lively neighborhood ",4,2016,10,27
237,Perfect location on the Liffy,A 15 minute walk along the river takes you to the International Finance Centre with some interesting restaurants close by. The hotel is modern and very clean with curtious staff - loved the warm cookie upon arrival.,5,2016,10,24
237,Decent Boutique style hotel across the river but still near to everything.,"I stayed here 5 nights on business. The decor is stylish and the room I had  (on the road side) was spacious and well thought out, plugs next to mirrors, lots of lighting options.  The staff were very helpful and the food at the Grill (separately reviewed) was good given it was a hotel.  I only had one night of slowish service and the burger I had on this night was too dense and salty.",4,2016,10,23
237,Quality in the heart of Dublin,"the Morrison hotel offers great location together with modern, clean and spacious rooms. Add the very friendly and always helpful staff and this hotel is a perfect choice for a short weekend visit or long business trip.",5,2016,10,23
237,Classy central hotel,"Have just returned from a 2 day stay at this classy hotel in a central location. 
We paid extra for a river view and although the room was excellent, it is probably only worth upgrading if you get a high floor, as we saw the busy road rather than the river itself. Although the hotel is on an extremely busy road, the soundproofing is excellent as we didn't hear a thing. Fabulous room with a huge bed and enormous bathroom. There was also everything you could possibly need; have never before stayed in a hotel which puts an umbrella in the room. 
The bar is well worth a visit but we didn't bother with the €16 breakfast.
A super hotel if you want a touch of luxury for a special occasion.",4,2016,10,22
237,Great location,"Great location in the heart of Dublin. Easy to walk to many different sites, restaurants, pubs and cafes. Staff was super nice and helpful. Hotel room was also clean and comfortable although we spent most of our time out and about. It was always nice coming back at night to fresh baked cookies and an apple (to counterbalance the cookie, of course).",4,2016,10,21
237,Wonderful location and staff,"We selected this hotel for the location and it was perfect!  Walking distance to many places of interest, such as Dublin Castle and Trinity College.  Lots of nearby places to eat.  The rooms were spacious and very clean.  The staff couldn't have been nicer!  Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,10,21
237,Epic,"I stay at a lot of hotels on business trips and was not expecting something of this class and quality.

Staff were impeccable, polite and professional, the public areas clean and tody and the rooms superb.

Comfy bed, great bath amd shower and superbly quick internet access free of charge.

The only problem was that they let me leave.",5,2016,10,21
237,Great place to stay in Dublin!,A friend recommended the hotel when she heard we were headed to Ireland. The location is great and the service is even better.  We were all over Ireland and they by far had the best Full Irish Breakfast. Loved the coffee bar and the fresh pastries and bread. Toasted to perfection. ,5,2016,10,20
237,Notafourstar,"Was at a wedding here recently. While the staff were excellent,particularly Jane Bridge ,the place itself was a bit disjointed. The ceiling of the function room was low making it feel like a niteclub. The food was average (main ok but starter and dessert poor). There was an outdoor patio area which was overlooked by Georgian buildings on two sides and also, unfortunately, rats. Not too nice to be sharing with evening with rats running around unoccupied buildings surrounding the seated area outside. Didn't think the overall feel of the p[lace justified a four star rating.",3,2016,10,19
237,just coffee & a beer...,"Great location on Dublins North Quays, always lots of good staff, coffee nice, beer is excellent and staff are always very helpful.

Place is always Spotless and it's very luxurious if you want to Lounge for an hour or two.",5,2016,10,18
237,Dublin break,The hotel is on the river and very convenient for all the main sites. It has been very tastefully modernised. The staff are very helpful-the service was excellent and the breakfast menu gave a good choice.,5,2016,10,18
237,Sophisticated hotel with superb location!,"This hotel is in the best location. On the Liffey and steps away from Temple Bar. The staff is warm, welcoming and helpful. The morning breakfast buffet had a great selection and as a Diamond member I had access to an additional menu offering omelettes, salmon and waffles. There are quotes from famous Irish people whispering on the walls of the corridors and the rooms. Shops, cafes and restaurants all within 1 block. Bus stops and hop on hop off stop 2 blocks away. ",5,2016,10,17
237,"Amazing venue, incredible staff and service","Visiting Dublin for a concert, didn't manage to stay at this hotel but stopped of for cocktails and dinner. The food was incredible, the staff amazing - we were even fortunate enough to have a young group perform on the evening we stopped for dinner.",5,2016,10,17
237,Its certainly about the location because....,"Ok we arrived at our hotel at an very early time and of course could not check in.  To be honest there is very little I liked about this hotel.  We did discuss our issues with the manager and he did offer compensation in Hilton points and an apology.
Likes:  location
Dislikes:  the beds are like Ikea beds with a hard mattress and no box spring
The noise from the street on the two nights there kept us awake until 3 a.m. or so
The seating in the lobby is very uncomfortable and actually not that clean
We are would travellers and I have reviewed many hotels over the years and mostly have given the benefit of the doubt on all occasions but this hotel I just had to give my thumbs down.",3,2016,10,17
237,Best hotel in Dublin!,"I always stay at the Morrison when I come to Dublin (which is often). The staff are exceptional. From the warm cookie at check in to the cleaning staff, food and beverage staff to the overall feeling in the hotel... I love this place!",5,2016,10,17
237,Nice hotel but very uncomfortable beds,"I like the location of the hotel and we have a suite-check out tomorrow but this is close to one of the most uncomfortable beds I've slept in-could hardly sleep.  The mattress slides to an angle and it's just a squeaky uncomfortable bed.  I plan to go see the manager about this today as well.  Staff is very friendly, good service, breakfast was good and dinner was very good.  I would not stay here again unless the bed was changed though!",3,2016,10,17
237,Excellent.,"We have travelled from Canada to the Dublin Theatre Festival at least 7 times.  This year for the first time we stayed for 10 days at the Morrison, a Double Tree by Hilton.

To sum up our experience - it was superb in every way.  

Over the time there we we were impressed by the staff's dedication, their friendliness and enthusiasm and determination to always go the extra mile to look after visitors, despite the hotel being busy.

We met and noticed some of their dedicated staff at work - there are of course many others.  At reception were Maite, Jason and Dean - all of them always helpful.  Darren - the concierge was 100% service orientated.  Sarah Reilly at the Halo where we had breakfast, was always welcoming and very attentive. The food and beverage manager, Jane Bridge, made us very welcome, constantly enquiring if there was anything further we needed.  Ria, from housekeeping attended to room service and manifested pride in the detailed way she attended to our room. 

I asked a staff member, ""How come every one here is so friendly, helpful and service orientated?""  I received the immediate answer, ""It's because of the General Manager, Patrick Joyce - he is very supportive, encouraging and always brings the best out in the staff.""    We met him later and  appreciated his enthusiasm for his City, Dublin, his hotel and his staff. 

The decor is modern and refreshing with some interesting pieces of original art.  The breakfasts were very good, and, also important for us, was the reliability of the wifi.

We found the the location ideal - close to theaters, great restaurants, bars, near Temple Bar on the opposite bank of the Liffey and without the noise of party goers!

My wife and I look forward to another visit next year.",5,2016,10,16
237,Great location,The beds are very firm.  My daughter liked it but I thought it was uncomfortable .  The location is excellent.  Across the river from temple bar area.  Walking distance to many restaurants.  Parking is in a garage two blocks away. You get a preferred rate since staying in hotel.,5,2016,10,16
237,Quality hotel,"Great location, friendly staff, clean comfortable rooms. Staff very helpful with suggestions. Responsive to all needs while there. In the heart of Dublin , all areas within reach by walking. No need to fight for taxis to get to places.",5,2016,10,16
237,No recognition for Diamond Member,"Per title, no extra perks like room upgrades, lounge etc.. Only perks received are a bag of chips and a chocolate bar delivered to room after check in. And seriously, I do not feel anything special treatment being a Diamond member in this hotel at all as compared to the ones I usually travel to.",3,2016,10,16
237,Would definitely recommend ...,"We recently stayed at the Morrison Hotel for a few days and would definitely recommend it.  The location is perfect to walk to many of the galleries, museums and shops in Dublin, along with easy access to buses and trams.

We were welcomed with a warm cookie which was truly scrumptious!  Our room was a good size and was clean, warm and welcoming with reasonable storage. The room had bathrobes and slippers along with tea and coffee making facilities which are a must.  Two small bottles of water were provided each day which was a nice touch.  The room had a large flat screen TV with a good selection of channels and free wi-fi which worked well for the duration of our stay.  

The breakfast was a buffet which was well stocked and offered a wide range of hot and cold food, cereals, some truly wonderful breads, muffins, yoghurts and lots more besides.  There is also a menu with additional hot food such as pancakes (yummy), and French toast (even more yummy).

The staff were mostly friendly, apart from one or two bar staff, and there was one guy (concierge?) at reception who was everything you ever imagined an Irishman to be - red hair, fair skin, a lovely warm personality with a real gift of the gab.  He had a passion for Dublin and was incredibly generous with his knowledge of places to visit.

A couple of minor flaws - we arrived around 2 hours early for check-in and our room wasn't available.  We were told it would be prioritised and to come back in 30 minutes or so.  We ended up gaining access just before the normal check-in time.  Also, the bar only offered one rose wine which was quite sweet.  It would have been nice to have one or two more choices.  

We would have no hesitation in going back to the Morrison.",4,2016,10,16
237,Great stay,"Due to flight cancellations, we had to travel to Dublin and stay one more day on our vacation.  This was a great place to stay and experience the city.  Even though the hotel is right in the heart of Dublin, the room was quiet.  Staff was very friendly and welcoming.",5,2016,10,16
237,"Great location, great staff","We picked this hotel for the location, but discovered the staff and hotel were fantastic as well.  Right on the shores of the Liffy, but across from the noisy Temple Bar area, we were so happy with the location. The rooms were comfortable and modern, the staff so helpful in planning our week.  The included breakfast had american and irish options.  

This is the best hotel for the price!  And included fast internet too!",5,2016,10,16
237,Great location just across the river from Temple Bar,"The Morrison was everything I expected and more. It's in a great location, across the river from the Temple Bar district, but on the quiet side of the river. The hotel staff was very helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly. My room was clean, spacious, and modern. I paid more than I'd hoped, but in the end, it was worth it to have a nice place to stay and a good night's sleep while in Dublin.",4,2016,10,15
237,Wonderful Stay in Dublin,"We had a great suite overlooking the river.  The concierge was great help choosing restaurants.  Go to l'Ecrivier if you are in Dublin.  The staff is very helpful, and the location could not be more perfect for enjoying this great city.",4,2016,10,15
237,Great experience!,"Great Experience!
Welcomed with warm cookie, extremely cheerful and helpful staff. Relaxing, clean room. Great breakfast. Staff were so helpful in assisting us to make sure our tour was coming as scheduled. ",5,2016,10,15
237,Good Experience,"We were welcome with cookies and coffee upon arrival. This would have been rated 5 stars if the front desk did not commit a mistake and messing up the arrangement of the room which resulted for my friends to wait for 2hrs only to find out that it was the front desk's fault. Other than that, rooms are very comfortable, breakfast was good and location's great!",4,2016,10,15
237,Great hotel to explore Dublin from,"Great location, just over the bridge to all the action. Well appointed rooms, comfortable bed and good service.

237,Applegreen charity Ball,"Superb hotel and room, fantastic bash and great food welldone to the hotel for dealing with big numbers, staff were fantastic .

Loved the room, spacious, well lit dressing table with a plug socket in easy reach for a hair dryer  is something so simple but overlooked elsewhere.

The breakfast was fresh, hot and well presented and all items available I stayed here many years ago,  it's been too long but I will be back. Actually booked. Next month already .

Hygiene standards were impeccable and to be applauded.

237,Loved it,"Grand Accomodation really excellent food scallops, crab cake, chocolate desert to die for... and well looked after. The finishing touch was the saw doctors lyrics..sing a powerful song....35 lunch guests loved it also!",5,2016,10,14
237,Overpriced and a terrible welcome...,"I stayed in The Morrison for one night in October for a friend's wedding.  

Upon arrival, I was left waiting for 15 minutes at reception while two members of the front desk staff attended to the same group's request for advice on what to do and where to eat in Dublin. Surely to God one person can handle this.  I made eye contact with the person that should have been checking me in, and was told to wait.  I might add that there was a queue building behind me.  This is wholly unacceptable in my opinion as the front desk staff are the hotel's ambassadors and the guest's first point of contact with the business.  I mentioned this when I was finally seen to and received a snarky response.  Very unprofessional.

The entire hotel is decorated to a modern standard throughout.  The main reception and bar area are tastefully done but sadly, that's where it ends.  I found the room to be tacky and unwelcoming.  There are plastic bedside lockers with gaudy pink / purple lights inside them, giving the room an overall seedy feel.  Think ""red light Amsterdam"" and you're in the ballpark.

The bar staff in the hotel were friendly enough but the service was slow and not to the standard I'd expect from a €335 a night hotel.  If I'm having more than one drink at a hotel bar I expect the bar staff to keep an eye on what I'm drinking and offer me another at an appropriate time.  Instead I had to work to catch the barman's attention and remind him what I was drinking.  The bar was not busy at the time.

The breakfast was of good quality and served piping hot.

It's the little things that make a hotel a nice and welcoming place to stay and I feel they are missing here.  The staff were cold and distant and the room decorated distastefully.

There are far better hotels in Dublin to stay in at that price point and I recommend you look for them as you won't be disappointed. 

I would not stay in The Morrisson, Dublin again.",2,2016,10,14
237,One of The Best Vacations We've Ever Had,"Our early morning check-in was seamless, The staff could not have been nicer or more helpful. Their assistance with so many local ideas were great ! Darren was the greatest concierge we've ever had the pleasure of knowing. He's like part of the family now. We look forward to going back. The location in Dublin was great, centrally located to everything. Anytime you check in there ask for Darren.",5,2016,10,13
237,"Great hotel, very good location, and service impeccable","Arrived for two nights (i wished more..) we were received with cookies and with care.
Staff were willing to help on any request we had. We received 100% attention, rooms were exactly as requested, clean, all in great condition. just a perfect vacation. Steps away of the Temple Bar area, on the river, and with the help of the staff, all was reachable and smooth.
I would recommend it for 100% and for sure next time i'm in Dublin, i will be with no question staying at the Morrison.",5,2016,10,13
237,A total winner,"The hotel is fantastic. The rooms are very modern, with hardwood floors, expansive bathrooms, large windows for good light, and very clean. It's just across the river from Temple Bar, but if you find that part of Dublin too touristy, there are *many* restaurants and pubs on the north shore of the river within a 5 to 10 minute walk from the hotel.

Also within easy walking distance from the hotel is the famous distillery, two cathedrals, the Dublin Castle (castle not included), St Stephen's Green, Trinity College and its famous library, and the Leprechaun Museum. 

The hotel rooms are extremely quiet. It's hard not to get a good night's sleep—jet lag permitting—on their extremely comfortable beds. The lobby bar is very nice, albeit with a limited selection of beers on draught. Of course, one of those is Guinness, so much is forgiven. 

Tip 1: Bus service on Airlink Express (route 747) is €10 roundtrip from the Dublin airport (6 miles, 10 km from the city center). The Airlink folks don't seem to have heard of The Morrison, so make sure you get off at the O'Connell Street stop. Turn right off the bus (south) until you get to the river, then right for 10 minutes until you get to the hotel.

Tip 2: Dublin has light rail (tram) — the red line — that runs east/west parallel to the river. There is a stop (Jervis) about 2 blocks north of the hotel. For those, like me, who need to get to the Convention Center (CCD), it's a quick trip. The CCD is about 30 minutes by foot along the river, but if you want to get there quicker the tram is a good option. Tram tickets are available at every stop. ",5,2016,10,12
237,Three Nights in Dublin,"We arrived in Dublin early in the morning and after a long flight it was a great surprise to find that our room was ready and we could check in early.

The room was an interior facing king room with a window that opened into the dining area of hotel. We were a little concerned as there was a notice that there was a wedding reception and our room might be noisy. Those fears were unfounded.  The room was very quite disputed it's proximity to the action. It was modern and clean. The Morrison itself was very conveniently located on the River Liffey and a quick walk to the Temple Bar area and close to shopping and some nice restaurants.

The staff here were all extremely nice and helpful at every turn. This is for sure a 4.5 hotel. The only reason I did not give it a 5 is it is just missing some of the finer detail of a five star hotel. I would definitely stay here again.",4,2016,10,12
237,"Great hotel, service & location ","I love this hotel and stay here often. Staff are very helpful and will often go out to their way to do things. 

Rooms are good size, clean and very well kept. Food is great too. There is a wide choice available for breakfast and you will not be disappointed.

The location is perfect too...talking distance to Temple bar if you there for leisure. 

I will certainly be staying here again when next in Dublin!",5,2016,10,11
237,Beautiful hotel in great location.,"The Doubletree Morrison is a beautiful hotel in a perfect location!  Request a room with. View of The River Liffy.  You are steps from hundreds of pubs, restaurants, and shopping.  What was impressive is the quietness of the rooms.  The hotel was very full, and lots of people outside.  However room was very quiet.  A comment from others staying t nearbye locations was lack of sleep due to noise from the pubs, and music, etc.  I am very sensitive to noise no has no complaints. ( and that was on a Saturday  Night too!)",5,2016,10,10
237,Highly recommended hotel in Dublin,"The Morrison, a Double Tree by Hilton Hotel in Dublin, is perfectly located, lovely rooms, good breakfast, very good service, highly recommended. We had a short and wonderful stay at this hotel.  The staff is polite, provide excellent service, and able and willing to arrange any request.",5,2016,10,09
237,Perfect Location in Downtown Dublin,"I booked this based on comments and was absolutely satisfied.  As one or two others mentions the beds are subpar for such a nice hotel!  Hotel is modern, staff is professional and helpful.  The location keeps you just outside the noisy, busy temple bar area.  Literally you walk across the street and a small foot bridge and you are in the heart of Temple Bar. We walked to Trinity College within 10 mins, Guinness within 25 mins, Teeling in 20 mins.  Grafton Street shopping is also 10 mins walk.  Seriously...take a hard look at this location....it may be a few Euros more but well worth the money,  Also...don't even try and park downtown if you've rented a car.  If flying to Dublin for a vacation, rent a car and leave Dublin finishing your driving by returning the renal to the airport and cab it to downtown. Or wait until after Dublin to rent a car.",4,2016,10,09
237,Modern and cool,"Spent a Friday night in this hotel in Dublin. Great from the time I arrived to the time I left. It's a modern, cool and funky spot which I enjoyed. If you are looking for a high end chilled hotel in Dublin look no further then here.",5,2016,10,09
237,Beautiful design hotel with great service,"I stayed in the hotel for 1 night for a business trip and was truly impressed with it. It's situated in an old building but the inside is truly modern and it certainly feels luxurious and quite hip. The service is high as you would expect from a Hilton hotel and that starts with the check in, you get a smile and a (warm) cooky and it's that simple to make people feel welcome! The rooms are beautifully designed as well, spacious and the beds and, more importantly, the pillows are very comfortable. The only downside, which is a plus at he same time, is that it can be quite noisy as the hotel is situated right in the city centre. My room was at the 1st floor so if you want a more quiet room go for high and back of the hotel I guess! The bar downstairs is spacious and cool and a nice change from the regular pubs in Dublin although I like these as well of course! Breakfast is simply great with a complimentary newspaper and again, great staff that will take care of you. I travel regularlyto Dublin and this is certainly one of the best hotels I've stayed in. So the only reason to not give it 5 stars is the slight noise in the room but I'm particularly sensitive to that so don't let that scare you off! I would definitely come back here.",4,2016,10,07
237,A luxury hotel in a great location,"My girlfriend and I went to Dublin last weekend and after researching hotels decided on the Morrison Hilton. We were keen to be near the centre and able to walk to and from the Temple Bar area. We were delighted by many aspects of the hotel, not least the location. Close to the river and within 5 minutes of the Temple Bar area. 
On arrival we were warmly greeted and the efficient check process was completed quickly and without fuss.
We had booked a junior suite and were pleased with the size, quality of furnishings and bathroom. We didn't eat in the hotel but it looked like a comprehensive breakfast selection. The best thing was the staff. They were all incredibly helpful and always smiling. It's not cheap but then Dublin is an expensive city and we were happy with what we got for our money",5,2016,10,06
237,Excellent,"The hotel was immaculate overlooking the Liffey River. Across from the Temple Bar area. About 30 steps from the Temple. Great breakfast Buffet which I strongly recommend . Within walking distance from everything. Helped me with all the great restaurant in the area that I wouldn't have thought about.
The hospitality was great! Breakfast, lunch, dinner, everything was perfect. Clean environment.
General Manager : Patrick Joyce was very great!

237,First Time at The Morrison,"We stayed at The Morrison this past weekend - a first time for us.  If you are looking for a very modern hotel, situated in a busy part of central Dublin and quite expensive - this is the hotel for you.   (Dublin hotels are amongst the most expensive in Europe apparently.)   We were able to use the Luas tram (free to us as Seniors) from Connolly Station and a short walk from the stop, plus I used it to attend a seminar some 6 stops away on Saturday afternoon.  Very handy.     There are plenty of good restaurants around but we had an excellent well priced meal  the first evening in the Grill Bar with friendly staff.   The breakfasts were good as well and the beds extremely comfortable and of good quality.  The room was quiet and on the second floor.  Would recommend this hotel and would stay there again.",4,2016,10,06
237,Hotel stay,Great location excellent staff. The bed was sub par but the rest of the room was nicely done.  The front desk was excellent in providing information on where to go and helping in making reservation when needed ,5,2016,10,06
237,Super hotel in a great location,"Stayed here on a business trip as it's located near to the office. Given the amount of tourists in Dublin and a huge variance in the quality of hotels, the Morrison stands out. Great service with warm and friendly staff.

The room was fairly spacious with all the amenities you'd expect from this level of hotel. The bathroom was a good size with a large shower. Housekeeping did a great job of refreshing the room each day.

I didn't get the chance to dine in the hotel although service in the bar was efficient, even during the busy Christmas party season.

The location is perfect for getting around the centre of Dublin with everything within walking distance.",4,2016,10,05
237,"Beautiful hotel, great location!","We stayed here for three nights at the end of September.  I used the online check-in facility, which was efficient, and we were able to take our room early on the day of arrival, which was a welcome surprise.  The staff members here are very pleasant and helpful.  The rooms (deluxe king, room 105) are spacious and modern and the bathroom is amazing.  The gym was also well equipped and modern.  The bar too is lovely, and the barman who served us was wonderful.  It's a great location; near enough to all of the major attractions, but far enough away (across the river) from Temple Bar that it is quiet enough for a good night's sleep.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,10,05
237,The Staff and Location are Wonderful,"Stayed nights of September 24-25, 2016

We had a junior suite that overlooked the ""courtyard"". Quiet, spacious and comfortable. Perfect for us. 

However, what sets this hotel apart is that the staff.  Every single one of them had a friendly attitude, always attempted to do more than was necessary and all had a focus on making sure they always exceeded expectations. This includes the front desk, breakfast room and dining room.  I wish I remembered everyone’s name because each deserves recognition. They are INCREDIBLE! If management wants to know specifics I can describe when and where but not the names.  

The location is perfect and an easy walk to many of the sites around Dublin.  This hotel will be, for us, the only place we will stay in Dublin.",5,2016,10,04
237,Wonderful Hotel,Stayed 5 nights here for my first visit to Dublin and was blown away by all this hotel had to offer. The location was absolutely perfect. Within walking distance to lot of attractions and easy access to public transportation. The staff was very friendly and always very helpful. The breakfast at the hotel was superb. Made to order coffee was a luxury I miss now that I'm back home. I will definitely be staying here again if given the choice.,5,2016,10,04
237,Friendly and Helpful Staff,"This hotel located across the river from Temple Bar. Easy walking distance to many locations.  Front desk staff is available for help with dinner ideas, arranging for cabs and general questions about what to see and how to best see it.  Wonderful hotel!",5,2016,10,03
237,Modern and Fun Location in the Center of Dublin,"My family and I all stayed at The Morrison for our last trip to Ireland. Everyone was extremely helpful and considerate. Darrin, in particular, really went out of his way to help accommodate us, both within the hotel and for our daily explorations. 

The hotel is fresh and modern. I especially enjoyed the art in the hotel lobby. The hotel rooms were clean, modern, and cozy. My parents booked a suite as a meeting-up space for all of us. It provided a nice-sized living room and dining area that comfortably fit all 8 of us, with more room to spare. 

My only complaint is that you can clearly hear anyone in the hallways. This isn't a unique problem to The Morrison, but just something you should consider when staying at a hotel. 

I was pleased that the rooms were nice and cool and provided a variety of lighting options. A few of my family members felt that the bathroom was a little too dark - especially for putting on make-up and getting ready in the morning. 

Overall, I would recommend The Morrison for your stay in Dublin if it fits within your travel budget.",4,2016,10,03
237,Perfect place to stay in Dublin,Fantastic modern hotel with a history.  The most friendly of staff and the breakfast was just incredible.    Location wise is perfect.  Close enough to the action but far enough away as well.  Stayed here twice now and would stay again. ,5,2016,10,03
237,Excellent stay at gluten free Morrison Hotel in Dublin,"Picked this hotel as it offered gluten free options on its website.  We were not disappointed, gluten free options available at breakfast (separate so no chance of contamination) dinner service was very good with a good choice of gf items.  Hotel itself very stylish, clean and rooms excellent and very comfortable.  Staff were very helpful and went the extra mile for our requirements with no problem. Definitely stay there again",5,2016,10,03
237,Uncooperative & Rude Staff member ,"I recently stayed at this hotel for my second time! There was a misunderstanding with the number of rooms we had booked & prepaid! The lady staff member was so rude & spoke down to us, her attitude was awful towards us & she made our arrival feel very unwelcome! This particular staff member told us we had to pay for an extra room that we did not book. Eventually, the hotel realised This mistake was not made by us and it was made by booking.com according to the hotel staff. There was no apology from the staff for the way she had dealt with the situation & for her rude customer service. It is a shame as the hotel itself is lovely; I will not be staying in this hotel again simply because of how this staff member treated us! It was very inhospitable of her. ",2,2016,10,03
237,Great Location & Friendly Staff,"You can't beat he location right across the quay from the temple bar area. Staff is outstanding, prepared to help in anyway they can. Only concern is that the pricing is creeping up to the point that I will probably look at alternatives, especially since it is starting to get a little tired and in need of a bit of spousing up, in particular the bathrooms.",4,2016,09,30

237,Beautifully maintained with outstanding staff,"I've stayed at The Morrison twice this year (total of 8 nights) and simply love this hotel.

237,Honeymoon in Dublin,My wife and I arrived in Dublin for the second part of our honeymoon and were immediately greeted with a fresh cookie (so delicious) and after hearing that it was our honeymoon we were upgraded to a deluxe room and received complimentary Processo which made us feel so special. The Morrison was recommended to us by a previous guest and we couldn't have been more delighted to stay there. It was a perfect location and the night we didn't explore the live music and bar was a great experience (Friday night). We had an amazing experience and would certainly not only stay there again but would recommend it to potential travelers.,5,2016,09,26
237,Amazing Modern Hotel!,"We were extremely happy with the Morrison .  Beautiful Hotel.  Very modern , clean lines, beautiful artwork and spotless. The service was amazing. Anna, at the front desk checked us in with warm cookies, cold water and a wonderful personality . We were Upgraded us to a beautiful suite. Gave us very helpful information on Dublin. As did Violet on another day. We always felt taken care of.  The beds were firm, which we both liked. The windows kept all the city noise out and the curtains and blinds made sure of a dark room. They thought of everything. Thank you Hilton for making our vacation perfect!",5,2016,09,25

237,Fantastic hotel,"We recently stayed at the Morrison for 2 nights during our 10-day Irish adventure. The hotel staff were so accommodating. We arrived in Dublin at 5:30 am and by the time we got to the hotel, they had a room available and were able to check in early!

Darren, the Concierge, was terrific!!! He gave us so many suggestions and recommendations we wished we had more time in Dublin!  He suggested great places to hear music where locals go to play and jam with fellow musicians.  He told us about a local pub, Lotts, where we met the nicest people and it wasn't too touristy.  He mapped everything out for us.  

Darren also gave us great tips for getting our tickets to see Kilmainham Gaol early to make sure we got in!  We would not have been able to see it, if not for his recommendations. 

I would recommend staying at this very centrally located hotel!!!! Wonderful experience AND the famous Doubletree cookie!!!! 

Thanks again for a great stay!! ",5,2016,09,25
237,Very Nice accommodation in the heart of Dublin,"Hard to find a fault with The Morrison. Great location right across the river from Temple Bar and walking distance to most of Dublin's attractions. Friendly staff who accommodated our early arrival and got us in our room after a red eye flight the night before. Rooms are generously sized by European standards, more like an American  hotel. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because the a/c wasn't working (I assume because it was late Sep) and the room was uncomfortably hot. We were able to open the window and that solved the issue. ",4,2016,09,25
237,Perfect,"Well over all very good rooms are modern with kettle tea coffee, iron and board, fridge. Perfect central location 2 mins walk Temple bar, Very comfortable only one down side the breakfast staff on both our days breakfast good, but the staff gave me a pot of tea waited 10 mins for cups, gave me a menu if wanted to order but never came back to ask four staff spent most of the time chatting amongst them selves. Hilton can check the days and staff if they need a quite word 22-09 and 23-09
But in all a good hotel.",4,2016,09,23
237,Convenient Location,The Morrison is conveniently located just north of the River Liffey. It was a great base for our Dublin sightseeing. Was easily able to walk to all the top tourist spots. The staff was friendly and helpful. ,5,2016,09,22
237,Great staff,Our first stop in Ireland we spent two nights here.  The staff was fabulous and helped us make the most of the beginning of our vacation.  Located within walking distance of temple bar district and so much more.  ,5,2016,09,22
237,Great!,"Really the level of luxury stay.  The room was perfect. They combined the single beds to a King size. Riverside hotel with tons of bars just across the small bridge. Room 405 had no view.  Bed to short for 2m guy, toilet height is for kids:-) 

In all, great standard, great service! ",5,2016,09,22
237,Amazing hotel in the heart of Dublin,"We had the pleasure of staying at the Morrison while visiting Dublin and I will never stay anywhere else! The facility is fabulous and the entire staff was wonderful. Special thanks to Adam at the concierge desk, he gave us some fantastic tips for dining and sightseeing.  The Halo restaurant was great for breakfast. The property sits just across the river from the Temple Bar section of Dublin and is conveniently located to many of the cities best sights.  You will not regret a stay at this awesome Doubletree property.",5,2016,09,21
237,"Exceptional, Modern Hotel in Great Location Across from Temple Bar","Experience at this hotel from beginning to end was phenomenal.  Hotel staff was friendly, helpful and professional in all they did.  Our group arrived early and with an additional traveler than originally planned.  The staff was able to not only accommodate this change but held onto our luggage and brought it up to our room while we went about our visit to Dublin.  Would definitely recommend a visit here.",5,2016,09,20
237,Super Mod; Comfortable beds; Great Breakfast (included); Misinformed Concierge,"Got a Jr. Suite after a week in a cramped hotel room in Dundalk.  Great view of the canal.  Super mod room.  Great range of tv channels (uncommon in europe), deep bathtub for 2, terrific water pressure in the shower and a super comfortable bed.

Breakfast was a highlight- it was included, and they have a great buffet was well as a plethora of a-la carte items- which like on a cruise ship - you can order as much as you want.  Indulge!!

Plus they give you a warm cookie when you check in - awesome!

Only watchouts-
1.  the concierge is misinformed and inconsistent.  Speak to 3 people and get 3 answers, so double check the info they provide
2. and this is only becuase I travel a lot- but ordered a cab to the airport at 6:30.  Was at the deck at 6:30 and they gave my cab away to someone else because an earlier cab failed to show.   WRONG!!  My ability to plan ahead is not an invitation for you to mess me up because you don't know how to handle the situation.  The desk person tried doing this for other cabs/customers and created a huge situation.  Not the least of which was that the cabs are on a schedule and so they refused and so smiled at him, then drove around the block and picked up the 'right' passengers.  Left a sour taste in my mouth and will make me think twice about staying here again with so many other options for a good service experience.  Ill informed concierges and a bad front desk staff member should be an easy solve.  Solve it.",4,2016,09,20
237,"Comfort, Convenience, Class","We had a delightful stay at The Morrison.  The hotel itself has a contemporary, fresh feel while at the same time offering the warmth and hospitality one would hope to enjoy in a top notch Dublin hotel.  As Hilton Honors members, we had complementary breakfast both mornings.  One time we enjoyed the extensive and delicious breakfast buffet - which included a made-to-order item and would have been well worth the menu price. The following morning I took advantage of the Grab-and-Go option, as I had an early flight.  The front desk staff was friendly, helpful, and efficient both at check in and at our early morning departure.  Our overall experience in the bar, the restaurant, and from the front desk staff and management was extremely positive.

Beyond the exceptionally skilled, attentive, and friendly staff, our room was very clean and comfortable - with plenty of fluffy pillows, not always our experience even in highly rated hotels in Europe.  I had a great night's sleep throughout our stay - in striking contrast to our experience in July in a well-known hotel not far from The Morrison where I lay awake to the sound of cawing seagulls all night as the room lacked AC and was stuffy, requiring the windows to be opened.  The windows at The Morrison do open - which I always appreciate - but I am happy to report the the heating and cooling (as well as the WiFi) functioned perfectly!  Another detail I appreciated: although we didn't consume anything from the mini-bar, I did take advantage of the small (free) containers of REAL milk available in the fridge when making tea and coffee in the room.  

The hotel itself is wonderfully located.  A quick walk across the Millennium Bridge puts you in the heart of Temple Bar - a vibrant area both day and night (but an area I wouldn't necessarily want to stay in the middle of).  You are in walking distance of Christchurch Cathedral, Dublin Castle, Trinity College, Grafton Street, St. Stephen's Green - plus all the delightful small shops and restaurants in the area between those major destinations - as well as sights on the north side of the Liffey. There are loads of dining and shopping options within easy walking distance on both sides of the river, making this a fantastic location for anyone wanting to take advantage of what city center Dublin has to offer.  And, after a long day out and about, it was a pleasure to sit in the lounge, enjoy a signature cocktail served by friendly staff, and look forward to a comfortable night's sleep.",5,2016,09,19
237,Wonderful hotel booking!,"Our Travel agent booked our three days/nights in Dublin at this wonderful Dublin hotel!  Glad he suggested The Morrison as we were very impressed with this lovely hotel & wonderful staff!!  All the employees were so very nice and helpful to us throughout our stay!  Received suggestions for excellent places to eat that were all within an easy walk and had superb food -The Lotts Bar/Cafe, The Church Pub/Restaurant and also a wonderful dinner/show, ""Celtic Nights"".  We were assisted with tickets to a nearby hop on hop off bus. Helped with directions for driving to Dublin area golf clubs. Loaned an adaptor when ours that we had brought was not compatible with our cell phones.  We also received a suggestion of a close by store where we could reasonably purchase an adaptor since we would be traveling to a more rural hotel next on our Ireland trip. We did have hair dryer problems but the staff was prompt to correct.  Would note that Dean, Adam and Darrin were especially helpful during our stay.  The hotel validates parking at Jervis St. Car Park which is close by and reasonably priced.  
Would definitely recommend this wonderful hotel!!",5,2016,09,19
237,Great hotel,"We stayed at the hotel for about 5 days in March 2015.  The best part about the hotel is its location.  It is a short walk across the bridge to the Temple Bar area.  The hotel itself is located near many restaurants.  

The hotel has a modern feel to it and the rooms are very comfortable.  I would highly recommend the hotel.",4,2016,09,18
237,cool and comfortable,"We ended our trip here and it was a great way to wrap things up.  The hotel is just far enough away from the chaos but close enough to walk everywhere.  Don't let its position on the other side of the river make you question it - everything is a short walk away.  We arrived before the room was ready, so our luggage was stored, we got our delicious Doubletree cookies and went sightseeing.  As promised, the hotel called about 2 hours later that the room was ready for us. When we returned, we were given our keys and our luggage was already there in the room - quite a nice touch.  The room itself was huge with a fabulous king-sized bed, super cool mood lighting and strong air conditioning.  The bathroom was incredible with the best shower I've ever had in a hotel.  We were on the back side of the hotel on the 3rd floor I believe and we did hear some noise from the road.  I'd imagine the rooms facing the front along the quay are far noisier, as the roadway is jammed with traffic at all hours of the day.  Had cocktails in the bar each night and they were fantastic.  Breakfast was free as HHonors gold and the buffet and menu items were out of this world.  We ate so much we never needed to have lunch.",5,2016,09,18

Tip: get corner room on top floor, is a very nice room. ",5,2016,09,18
237,Beautiful Hotel in Great Location,"The Morrison is a very classy hotel with beautiful, modern decor.  The rooms were also extremely nice as well as comfortable and clean.  It is just a short 5 minute walk across the river to the Temple Bar area that has an active nightlife.  We felt very safe walking home late at night after enjoying a few pints and some music.  We stayed here when we were in Dublin 4 years ago and will stay here again when in Dublin. ",5,2016,09,17
237,"Excellent hotel, excellent location",Been here a few times and as always very good service and experience. great location! Highly recommended. Bar experience really good and breakfast also good. Been in suites and rooms and always very clean and maid service is great.,5,2016,09,17
237,Great hotel,"Stayed at the Morrison for 5 nights and thought it was well located and with great rooms and service. Recommended for staying in Dublin.
Lots of great restaurants to go to near by and only 5 minutes to Temple Bar if you want to experience that part of town. Also only a 10 minute walk to a great self service laundry called the All American Laundry. ",5,2016,09,17
237,Excellent accomodations and an Excellent Staff!,"We were treated extremely well by all of the staff during our stay.  This was a family vacation, and we relied on the expertise of the staff to help us find amenities in Dublin.  They were all eager to help and provided excellent tips on enjoying the city.  Room accommodations were quite nice.  Clean, modern and well appointed.  I hope we get a chance to visit Dublin again soon, and stay at this great hotel.",5,2016,09,16
237,Simply stunning!,"Room - Penthouse Suite – Overlooked the Liffey …..Simply stunning

Great location, excellent service, first-class luxurious accommodation in a city centre location. Hugely impressed by all staff in hotel who were exceptional in every way. Spacious comfortable room which far surpassed expectations.

From the minute we arrived the staff were really attentive and friendly nothing seemed to be a problem. The décor is welcoming and inviting, and the lobby offers a warm and cosy atmosphere. We were greeted on arrival by the lovely Darren Odoirbhin who really surpassed himself, and took care of our every need making our stay both memorable and enjoyable, a real credit to the hotel. 

There are no words to describe how amazing our room was when we got there! We walked into the open plan dining/sitting area and we were blown away at the panoramic views of the whole city, absolutely incredible. The Penthouse is huge and has super-fast Wi-Fi, 2 Flat Screen TV’s, an iPod docking station with Bose sound system, 2 bathrooms, large dining area, living area with all around balcony, large bedroom, huge on suite with large bath and a walk in rainforest shower which was wonderful. We loved the styling and the comfy bed with the mood lighting above it which changed colour. The room was immaculately clean and had everything we could possibly we need from various varieties of tea, Espresso coffee machine, and a fridge stocked with champagne, wine beer and nibbles!

We spent the evening in the beautifully decorated bar where we were served by mark McCormak who really went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable and provided the service that made this a 5 star review. The staff here really do exude a perfect balance of friendly demeanour and professionalism. We had planned to venture out of the hotel for the night after a few drinks at the bar, but decided against it as the singers in the bar were amazing and really created a great atmosphere.

Breakfast, which was served in the Grill was very good, both warm and fresh, with an extensive selection of dishes, totally fulfilling! This hotel will be the only place for us to stay on any future visits to Dublin, we can’t wait to return!",5,2016,09,15
237,Great location - would stay here again!,"My family and I stayed in this hotel on our first night in Dublin. It is very well situated right across the river from Temple Bar area and many other attractions (all within a 15 minute walk). It was also only one block from the Jervis Luas station (tram). Since we had arrived at 7am, our rooms were not ready so they offered to store our luggage while we walked around the city. When we came back around 1pm the room was still not ready so we grabbed a few beers from the bar. Bar area was very open and service was friendly. They gave us joining rooms without us even asking which worked out well for us. Rooms were nice and clean with plenty of space (one room had a king bed and other room had 2 twin beds). Decor was simple and more on the contemporary side. Bathrooms were clean and spacious with a tub and shower combination. Rooms also had air conditioning that worked well. Reception staff was friendly as well as the bellman that helped store our luggage. No issues with complimentary wifi while we were there. Price was on the higher side, but would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again.",4,2016,09,15
237,Do not stay here - overpriced and not good,"Let me start by saying the staff were excellent! Very very helpful.

Now let's talk about the hotel.

My hotel room smelt of TCP as I walked in.

The in room wifi didn't work.

The hotel's general wifi was very slow and phased in and out.

My TV just shut down at one point.

Then downstairs from my room they decided to vacuum the dining room at midnight.

And the bill, EUR 290 for one night - SERIOUSLY!!!!

",2,2016,09,14
237,worse night in Dublin,"Rooms were average, nothing special. However our room was over a bar that was blasting music till 1am. Followed by the what sound like a garbage truck emptying several different dumpsters. Did I mention the party down the hall???",2,2016,09,13
237,Second stay and not the last,"This was our second stay at the Morrison Hotel, we first stayed between Christmas and New Year 2015 and was very impressed. My wife enjoyed everything about the hotel, so for an anniversary surprise i booked again. Everything just as good, the staff are very attentive and nothing is too much hassle. The bar staff know how to have a good conversation and a laugh they are also very informative about the local area and places to stay away from ""the tourist trap"" 

The room, we stayed in a king guest room with river views. This was on the second floor, i have read some reviews saying these rooms are noisy due to traffic outside. It is a centrally located hotel in a very congested city. If the window is open yes you can hear noise, close the window and very quite. The air con in the room is very good and easy controlled. The rooms are very clean and comfortable with a modern look to them.

Location perfect.... Nothing more to add to that one.

Food & Drink, had breakfast and lunch before we left. Both very good, and what is not to like about the bar, very comfortable relaxed feel and well stocked.

All in all a great stay and thank you. We will definitely be staying again.",5,2016,09,13
237,The Morrison Doubletree in Dublin,"We had a wonderful stay at the Morrison Doubletree in Dublin. The staff was extremely helpful with dinner reservations, directions and information on tours.  The rooms are very nice but a little short on storage space.  Other than that everything was perfect",5,2016,09,12
237,Great stay in Dublin!,"Accommodations and staff are wonderful...some of the best experienced in our extensive overseas travel. The breakfast is great, a wide variety of choices, all tasted were well prepared.  Location is equally good. ",5,2016,09,12
237,Hard beds ,"We are Hilton diamond members so we always stay at Hiltons. This is VERY nice for a doubletree. The breakfast was included with diamond status and top notch. What I didn't like was the parking situation(tough to find a spot), the bellman who didn't assist us with luggage, and the hard bed. The light switches in the room were also tough to navigate. The mini bar prices were much lower then in the states and the room service was AMAZING!!!!!! Best steak that we have had here in Europe. Their seafood chowder wasn't worth trying a second time though. Overall, very satisfied.",4,2016,09,12
237,Nice but dim,"We had a river view room on the 2nd floor, the traffic noise was intrusive, and the curtain did not quite cut out all the light from the street light which was at the same height. The room offered little more than a Premier Inn. It was clean and comfortable if not enormous. Good range of toiletries. Reception area lifeless but staff very helpful. Same for the bar where staff kept smiling at any time of the night.  background music not always in the background.",3,2016,09,12
237,Excellent Hotel Once Again,"We returned for a 4 night stay in a King Guest Room in this hotel in early Aug '16 as we thoroughly enjoyed our previous stay in Sept '14. Its central location and close proximity to the Temple Bar area just across the Liffey with its many pubs, restaurants and shops, made it the ideal place for us. The hotel once again lived up to all our high expectations - large tastefully decorated modern room with comfortable king bed and spacious bathroom. We requested, and were given, a room at the rear of the hotel as we had experienced some noise issues from late night revellers on our previous stay when our room overlooked the adjacent side street - very quiet this stay. The buffet breakfast had an extensive selection of dishes and was again amazing and totally fulfilling. On 2 occasions we had prepacked 'Breakfasts-To-Go' as we needed to leave the hotel very early for a Tour, and also on our last day to go to the airport. The staff at this hotel are always cheerful and most helpful. This is the only place for us to stay on any future visits to Dublin.",5,2016,09,12
237,Amazing location!,When booking this hotel I was looking for a place for my husband and I that was close enough to the pubs downtown but far enough away that the noise wouldn't keep us awake.  This place was perfect!! We drove around Ireland and this was our last stay.  The staff was very helpful and accommodating. The parking garage we parked in offered to clean and vacuum our car before we returned it and we accepted (we pretty much lived in our car for 10 days).  They did an excellent job! The food we ordered from room service was good at 1am and hit the spot!,5,2016,09,11
237,Centrally located,"We hired a car and drop from Dublin airport to this hotel, noted that the Morrison steak house is facing the main street and it was hard to see. Has to ask a cab driver for direction and finds out that the main entrance of the hotel is on the side street. Staff is nice and welcoming. Wifi is included, hotel is trendy, room has been renewed. It is located in the heart of downtown and it was very nice that you are able to walk to most attractions. Parking is with the garage next block, very closed by. It cost $12 to park there overnight. Overall nice hotel.",5,2016,09,10
237,4 star hotel,"We stayed as a family for two nights with two connecting rooms.  The rooms were as expected from a size and amenities standpoint.  The lighting was a bit quirky as you had to turn off about 5 lights to get the room dark.  Bathrooms were large.  The audio and television options were exceptional with many channels and features for music, news, internet, etc.  We spent quite a bit of time at the bar which provided excellent service including from the restaurant.  Breakfast was better than anticipated with excellent service as well.  Many options both from the menu and the buffet.  The one downside was how the hotel dealt with parking.  While they don't have parking facilities, they contract for parking around the corner.  Unfortunately, there is not a great location to temporarily park and unload your bags or doormen to assist in the process.  It was manageable but somewhat frantic on a busy Saturday afternoon.",4,2016,09,09
237,One of the nicest hotels I've stayed at,"We booked to stay at The Morrison Hotel for one night on our return journey from Las Vegas. When we got to the hotel it was so nicely decorated inside and had a really warm and friendly but luxurious feel to it. When we checked in we mentioned we had had a long journey and the lady offered us cookies (which were yum!) but our room wasn't ready as we were quite early. So we sat in the bar and had a couple of drinks while we waited and the lady at reception said she would make our room a priority and look after our bags.
The lady behind the bar was friendly and helpful and chatted to us about different places to go in Dublin and recommended a gin bar to us.
When our room was ready we went up and the room was fabulous! I had booked a king one bed suite as a surprise for my husband for his birthday and we absolutely loved it! The rooms looked out across the river at the front of the hotel and we had windows all around the front and side of the room. There was a bedroom area and a living space with tv, sofa, dining table and desk. There was also a nespresso coffee machine. The bathroom has a lovely big shower and a large bath and double sinks with all the toiletries you would need.
The reception desk sent our bags up to the room shortly after we had gone up, they weighed a tonne aswel the poor man who had to carry them!
We ate in the restaurant downstairs that night and the food and service were impeccable! We both had starters and then had the sharing steak from the grill section. It was beautiful and they brought us extra sides  and sauces too.
We then went to the bar for a drink to take up to our room and spent a while chatting to the bar and restaurant manager who was absolutely lovely and seemed to really care about his hotel. I wanted to give a particular mention to Mark McCormack who served us in the restaurant and at the bar, he was so friendly and his service was fabulous. He was really knowledgeable about the hotel and area aswel and always had time to chat to us.
We went up to our room early as were pretty tired from travelling and had an early check out. We really didn't want to leave the room the following morning as it was so nice! 
The staff who checked us out were lovely and efficient and ordered us a taxi to the airport.
The location of this hotel is fab, right on the river front and just across the river from the Temple Bar area.
This really is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at and I would give it more than 5 stars if I could! I don't think I would consider anywhere else for my next trip to Dublin!",5,2016,09,08
237,Nice Hotel in the Center of Dublin,"We had stayed here as a part of our 5 week trip through Europe.  We chose this hotel due to it's location right across from the Temple Bar area but not directly in it.  The location could not have been better as it was only 2-3 minutes to excellent restaurants and cafes. We had a deluxe king room, and was happy with the size and renovated bathroom.  The staff were nice enough but seemed very busy due to the US football game that weekend.  We would highly recommend this hotel if you want a contemporary and clean property.",5,2016,09,07
237,Delightful Stay!,"We stayed at The Morrison for four nights and could not have been happier - fabulous staff with the most passionate concierge I have ever worked with.  I'd read some reviews about the noise due to the location (which is perfect), but we were given a courtyard room - not an attractive view but so quiet and since we were busy all day that didn't matter to us at all.  The breakfast buffet with option to order from the menu is expensive, but really a nice way to start the day - a step up from even a European breakfast buffet.  It was a busy time at the hotel and they were sold out, but staff were always accommodating and available to assist.",5,2016,09,07
237,Staff went above and beyond!,"Amazing amazing staff!!! Violeta greeted us when we arrived(with warm cookies, water bottles and a city map of Dublin). She helped us map out different places we wanted to see and gave us great recommendations.  She even personal delivered our bags to our room to make sure we were happy with the room!!! She was  professional, kind, helpful and genuinely a great person.  The hotel's breakfast was AMAZING!!! They have their own barista and he was FANTASTIC! He made me my favorite drink - an earl grey vanilla lattte every morning and had a cup ready for me to take to-go. I wish I wrote down his name....he was amazing and so kind. There were so many other awesome staff at the Morrison hotel. Very impressed! Great location!",5,2016,09,06
237,Excellent Location with Top-Notch Irish Hospitality,"First off, a trip that could have started off sour was made delightful by the staff of this hotel. I specifically want to mention Papa, the night manager, who really took care of us and made sure our first day started off well. My fiancé and I were in town for the college football game at Aviva Stadium. We arrived EARLY AM on Thursday after an overnight flight from Washington, DC. We knew we most likely would not be able to check in to our room at that time, so we were dreading spending the day walking around feeling dirty and groggy from a long flight with no sleep. When we arrived at the hotel, Papa arranged to take our bags and led us to a nice private bathroom downstairs that had a full shower with ample amounts of bath products. This literally SAVED our day. While still going on no sleep, we were able to refresh ourselves and perk up for our Guinness Storehouse tour scheduled at noon later that morning. Once we got back to the hotel later that day, our bags were waiting in our room for us, which was a nice touch.

The room was very sleek and comfortable. It had a lot of nice modern touches and a very comfortable king bed. We really enjoyed staying in the room, and we were both impressed at how well it blocked out the city noise. We were never disturbed once by any amount of noise.

We also would like to commend Darren, the head concierge. He painstakingly went over every detail of the city we cared to ask about, and seemed to know how to direct us everywhere we wanted to go. We also took a side trip to Glendalough (amazing!), and he took the time to print out directions for us on the computer in the lobby. We really enjoyed talking to him as he was very animated and passionate about all things Dublin.

Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Morrison Hotel, and it definitely added to our experience in Dublin. The location literally COULD NOT be better, and the staff really added to the experience. They also have an excellent breakfast buffet which we enjoyed every morning before embarking on our daily journeys.",5,2016,09,06
237,great location and staff make up for  some room issues,"perfect location for business or vacation, very helpful staff, good breakfast buffet. room quirky re receptacles, lighting and HVAC. fitness center pretty small but acceptable if your needs aren't too ambitious.",4,2016,09,06
237,Location location,"Perfect location to get to tourist bus stops, to temple bar area restaurants/shops, Dublin city center shops/restaurants and walking distance to many of the Dublin sights-Dublin castle, Jameson visitor center, Jervis shopping center... Price was high because of weekend events but worth it to save on taxis",4,2016,09,03
237,very modern but very noisy- we left after 1 of our 5 nights,"I am a Diamond HHonors VIP and I booked this stay on points for 5 nights. I had requested the e-standby upgrade (to pay $$) to upgrade to a junior suite instead of the usual complimentary upgrade, but we were given the king room type that I had booked and told no upgrades were available.  We left our bags as the room was not ready and came back several hours later to check in.  When we finally got into the room we noted several things: there was no electric outlet in the bathroom to plug in the hairdryer (I am fine with that as the bathroom is generally not vented well and hotter), however there was an outlet near the desk but there was no mirror there.  So, I ended up sitting on the floor in front of the mirrored closet doors to dry my hair.   The toilet also took a very long time to refill and would not flush again until it was completely full.  It was now around 3:30-4pm and we heard bass from music quite clearly in the room.  We were heading back out and did not think much of it.  However that night we were first awoken around 1am by loud voices in the hallway, then again at 3 with the same bass. At 3:30 my husband called down and the desk clerk said the wedding party downstairs was over but the noise was on our floor and he would take care of it.  It did finally stop not long after that.  By then we had decided to change hotels (my husband is Platinum on Marriott so we moved to the Shelbourne).  We had breakfast and packed up and just around 11, the bass started up again.  We went out in the hallway and it was in room 430. We were in 427 and it was quite loud in our room. 
When I explained why we were checking out, Piotr at the front desk did restore the additional points I had used back into my account, and offered to move/upgrade us to stay, but it was too late by then.  He was very gracious and apologetic and stated that he had been informed about the noise from 430 and they do not condone that sort of thing.  He also gave me bonus points and took care of the cab to the Shelbourne after apoligizing again.  So, on the plus side, they did try to make it right, but it was too late at that point. 
The taxi driver stated that the Morrison, being near Temple Bar, probably had a band staying there that was making the noise we heard. 
We did not get upgraded at the Shelbourne either, however even though the property is very old we did not hear any noise from the hallways or other rooms.",2,2016,09,01
237,Top Location,"Really good hotel in a really good location, walking distance to everything you can want - shops,bars, coffee shops, restaurants! Decent value for money.

Rooms are a good size, very modern and very clean.

Staff were nice and helpful",4,2016,09,01
237,Modern and comfortable ,"The room was lovely. Really spacious with a very large comfortable bed! Tea / coffee / hot chocolate / bottled water provided and mini bar is reasonably priced. 

Great location near the temple bar area and good restaurant on site with plenty of options. 

Also have a great cocktail bar as part of the hotel. ",5,2016,08,31
237,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel staff very friendly perfect location in city centre Dublin.  Food is also of very good standard and full of flavour. Hotel bar is nice with a good atmosphere, hotel room was nice very clean.  Over all I'm pleased with my stay here and would stay again.  ",4,2016,08,30
237,"Modern hotel, great location","My husband and I stayed at the Morrison fore 2 nights this past weekend as we celebrated our wedding anniversary in Dublin. It was a bit of a splurge  -I know it's a 4 star hotel and in a great location, but it was more than we normally would for a hotel break. Our resulting experience was 4/5 overall.

The location of the hotel is perfect - very central, just a few steps away from the Luas, Temple Bar, great shopping etc - all the major sites within walking distance. Parking is in a garage next to the hotel, it is discounted but not free (€12 for 24 hours). 

The room had modern furnishings and was extremely clean. They had left a ""happy anniversary"" plate of mini desserts for us, which was lovely touch! Some nice features such as the light in the wardrobe, and the temperature/fan adjustment was great. Minor complaints were:
- We asked for a quiet room, so we were placed on the 3rd floor but the room was overlooking a smoking area 4 floors below. There was a wedding on both the Fri and Sat nights and it was quite noisy until around 2am both nights. They did leave us a note to advise about the weddings, but there was little we could do as we were already on the 3rd floor (there's only 4 floors, and I think the 4th floor is the penthouse?? I could be wrong) Also the window had no view, just of another side of the building.
- The bathroom was clean and modern but had a few faults. The heavy door to the bathroom is incredibly loud as it clicks into place to close it - there was no going quietly to the bathroom at night without waking the other person! There was only a shower only in the bathroom (no bathtub) and the shower head was quite small and not adjustable - water pressure was OK, not the best. The lighting in the bathroom was only a few recessed lights - not good for doing makeup or hair.
- the bed was large but VERY very firm. if you like a firm mattress you might appreciate this, but there was literally no give in it. 

But the two main aspects that made the hotel exceptional were the food and the staff!

We had breakfast both days, and it was great. The hot food was perfectly cooked and really tasty, and I had one of the nicest cappucinos I ever had prepared by a barista onsite. The selection of cold foods was varied and high quality as well. I can't comment on lunch or dinner as we didn't have either, but if the breakfast is anything to go by I'd love to try them the next time. Also, breakfast was served until 12pm and you weren't rushed out. Amazing!

The staff were just SO lovely, particularly those working behind the front desk and in the breakfast room. Friendly, helpful, cheerful - really excellent service and so pleasant! Thanks so much.

I believe the hotel has a fitness centre but I didn't see it. It would be great if the hotel had a spa onsite - or even just a therapy room for massages. 

Overall a very nice stay in a modern hotel in a great location",4,2016,08,30
237,great centrally located hotel,"Clean, modern hotel in a super location and close to all attractions.  Staff were efficient, friendly and helpful.  Nothing was too much trouble.  ambience is bright and cheerful.  Late check out time also helped.",5,2016,08,30
237,Overnight stay and family wedding,"My wife and I attended our daughter's wedding and stayed overnight at The Morrison on 26th-27th August 2016. It was excellent in all of the ways that mattered and we'd heartily recommend it to anyone considering having their wedding there or just staying at the hotel.

The catering arrangements, food and general facilities were top class. There were 140 guests and the professionalism and quality left nothing to be desired. First class meal, all hot and clearly not left lying around in the kitchen before being served. 

The unobtrusive but constant personal service throughout the evening was natural, unforced, effective and friendly. All minor requests were dealt with promptly. Well managed, well run, high service levels and no hiccups. A special commendation to Jane who embodied all of the above, not just through the evening and into the small hours but, incredibly, early during the morning after the night before as well. 

Beautiful room, fresh contemporary decor and spotlessly maintained. Very good breakfast and - nice touch - clear understanding that people who were up half the night might not appear for breakfast until well into mid-morning.

Only word of caution - if you were not attending an event like ours it would be advisable to check beforehand with the hotel that you could get a room away from the revelry. Compliments again to the hotel management - a polite letter in the room as we checked in altered guests to the need to ask for a quiet room if required.

All in all, an object lesson in how to provide service. Excellent staff in each area we encountered, from reception to bars to catering to cleaning staff. Very good facilities for the function, all round high standard and service delivery without any fuss.",5,2016,08,29
237,Amazing friendly Staff,"From the moment you arrive each and every one of the staff bar none went above and beyond to look after us. They were genuinely warm and welcoming and ensured we needed for nothing. 
The bedroom was bright, spacious and well appointed. Plenty of bottled water, robes in the room and spotlessly clean. 
We attended a wedding and it was WOW!  Sumptuous food, superb service and great spot in the courtyard for drinks. A particular mention to Jane who could not do enough for us. Thanks also to Paul who made sure we were so well looked after.
Breakfast was close to the best hotel breakfast i have had. Recommend the French toast which was yummy!
Overall a wonderful stay. Other hotels should look at how the team at the Morrison are trained, they have set the bar high!
We will be back.",5,2016,08,29
237,Modern and city center,"We have visited all of Ireland. This hotel is the most modern one that we stayed at. It's renovated and clean.

The location can't be beat. Just within a few minutes walk of shopping and everything in the city center.

There is a parking garage next door but it's not free. It was approx $13 USD a day.

The only complaint I had was the breakfast room was too warm temperature wise and it made breakfast miserable.",4,2016,08,29
237,Central location,"On the upspide: central location (next to Temple Bar zone), large and clean rooms, comfortable beds and friendly staff. 

On the downside: internet is not stable and the breakfast items are somewhat limited.",4,2016,08,28
237,World class hotel for a reasonable price,"A gem in the heart of Dublin. I am definitely coming back to the Morrison for my next visit.  The staff could not have done more to make me feel welcome. The rooms are modern, clean, and very spacious. Location is excellent, as the hotel is located within walking distance to Temple Bar.",5,2016,08,28
237,Excellent location and every hotle should have a Darren,"We booked this at short notice and arrived late in the evening. Easy to find in Central Dublin on the bank of the river a short walk from Temple Bar. The room was comfortable and overlooking the river. In retrospect, possibly not the best idea as the traffic noise was audible until the early hours.  Breakfast were amazing. Cooked beautifully to order. I enjoyed Eggs Florentine and my wife fresh waffles. On going out for the day, we were told to speak to the concierge. Every hotel should have a Darren, like The Morrison. Very knowledgeable about what was on, where to go in the time available, where to listen to the best music and to get good food. Witty and very likeable, we took his advice and benefitted from it. On our return, we shall definitely stay at the Morrison again.",5,2016,08,28
237,Got Us Off To A Great Start!,"We picked the Morrison as a base for seeing Dublin. The location is perfect, right across the Liffey River from Temple Bar. From there, it was an easy walk to the sights we wanted to see: Dublin Castle, St. Patrick's and Christ Church Cathedrals, and Trinity College Library. And I can't go without mentioning Darren. He could not have been more helpful! I went to the desk with three requests and he fixed them immediately! He even offered to give me names not just to places I might want to go to but to names of the people there so I'd get the best service. Super friendly...I hope they keep him here!",5,2016,08,27
237,It's more than a Doubletree!,"We stayed here for two nights in Dublin! What a great location, just over the river from the Temple Bar Area and Trinity College. The rooms are very modern and have everything you need! The free wi fi worked very fast, coffee bar in the room and a huge tub with great water pressure! We had a room facing the river and a busy street but the windows are well insulated and the room was very quiet! But the best part about the Morrison is the STAFF! Wow, unbelievable dedication to their Guests! In particular was a gentleman named Darren! He went out of his way to make this memorable trip!",5,2016,08,24
237,Met expectations,"We enjoyed the staff's attention to the details.  They were very helpful in recommending us for places to eat, and gave good directions.  The restaurant was excellent!  The location of the hotel was convenient.",5,2016,08,23
237,City Trip,"Great little hotel ideally located in Dublin for both business and leisure. Will definitely use this hotel again. Adam was a tremendous help with check-in and tourist advice. Cautionary note if arriving by private vehicle: the hotel has two entrances, With luggage, I advise using the entyrance off the main street, not the one on the Quay. Parking is a short distance (50m) away.",5,2016,08,22
237,Great location in Dublin,"Friendly staff, great location, would stay here again. The lighting in the rooms may not be for everyone - ours were pink - but has a great modern feel in a historic city. Across the street from temple bar and easy to get to via car, bus and taxi",5,2016,08,21
237,Great stay!,After arriving from a long flight we were welcomed with an early room availability. The staff was friendly and helpful. The location was perfect for walking to just  about everywhere but not too close to the crowds.,5,2016,08,21
237,Modern Upbeat Hotel!,"We enjoyed our 3 day stay at the Morrison in Dublin.  The hotel is in a good location right across the river from Temple Bar.  The staff are very accommodating.  The restaurant in the hotel, The Morrison Grill was good for a quick dinner before the theater.  We had two rooms on the fourth floor.  The decor is very modern, comfortable and chic.  My only criticism was that we payed exactly the same price for each room but one room was significantly smaller than the other.... a slight disappointment but overall, we would still recommend this hotel.",4,2016,08,20
237,Best I could expect,"Best location- close to everything , easy to locate and quiet
Spacious  modern rooms 
Good breakfast  and FANTASTIC service!!!!
It's a Hilton hotel so you have the benefits if you are a member
Nevertheless it feels like a boutique hotel so best in both worlds
Highly recommend

237,Hum!,"The Windows are to small for a view,room. It's really not,a view if you have to stand next to the window to see out. The bathroom layout is horrible, the toilet is in front of the sink and the shower head is so close to the wall you have to stand with your body pressed up,to the tile to get wet. Not a relaxing experience. Also the lighting,is extremely bad, way too dark. We had reservations to stay when we came back the next week, but cancelled and looked for,something else. The one thing I will say is they did an extremely good job of hiring really good people, every employee we had contact with was excellent!

237,Stayed weekend 13th Aug 2016,"Perfect couldn't fault the hotel at all. Cookies on arrival were the best ive probably ever had. Rooms clean and modern. 

Parking in the car park was a bit of a issue due to it being full later that eve we did get in. Just Be sure to tell them when paying that your staying in the hotel as they will charge you full price tried to charge an american couple in front of us full price.",4,2016,08,18
237,Superb service.,"Thoroughly surprised by the level of service in this hotel. Spacious, modern rooms with a great TV system. Big bathroom, great amenities. Superb gym facilities. Enticing menu although the did not manage to try it. Very friendly and helpful staff. They gave great advice re train timings and also offered us maps of Dublin. We arrived early but our room was not ready. However, the staff checked us in, stored our luggage,  and when we returned after a day of sightseeing, we were given our cards and our bags were placed in our room. So thoughtful! ",5,2016,08,18
237,Our favorite hotel in Dublin,"We are frequent guests at various Hilton hotels and were absolutely impressed with the Morrison.   The hotel has been remodeled and is very modern and very clean.    The staff was friendly and accomodating, too.   We enjoyed having a drink in the bar listening to some of the best live music of our entire 2 weeks in Ireland.   The musical duo is known as the Luna Boys. Amazing!   Check this spot out and you won't be disappointed.    Mini bar.   Ironing board.   Free wifi.",5,2016,08,17
237,"Great hotel, great staff",The location of the Morrison is excellent as a base to explore Dublin. We were made to feel very welcome by the reception staff as well as the maitre d in the restaurant/bar area. Loved the live music in the bar when we came back at night. Our room had a bit of a funny layout but the bed was superb - always welcome when you've been walking around town all day. Would definitely stay here again.,5,2016,08,17
237,A great hotel in a delightful city,"The Morrison is a marvelous hotel in the middle of Dublin - right on the river Liffey. It is very convenient to many restaurants and places of interest.  Hop-on, Hop-off busses are available just a block or two away. Our room was spacious and had a great view of the river.  What made the hotel truly outstanding was the staff at the front desk.  they were all very friendly and helpful.  One lady who stood out was Violeta,  She went out of her way to help us, providing us with maps of the city which she marked up, showing us points of interest, including restaurants, one of which was truly outstanding - The Winding Stair (separate review).  The hotel itself has a very nice restaurant.  Thanks to her information, we had a truly spectacular visit.  The hotel was certainly one of the best we have stayed in (and we have traveled all over the world). Violeta was instrumental in making it so !",5,2016,08,17
237,"Helpful Staff, Great Hotel","We stayed at the Morrison on our first night in Dublin and found the staff to be helpful and the rooms to be clean and roomy. The Hotel is centrally located and within walking distance of the Temple Bar area. A special thank you to Maria and Maite for their help in securing a van for our trip back to the airport. The main roads were closed for a bike race and many people were trying to find transportation, but they went out of their way to help us.",5,2016,08,16
237,Excellent service - wedding guest at the Morrison,"My family and I were guests at a wedding on August 12th 2016 in the Morrison Hotel in Dublin

As a guest my observation was that the wedding party and all the guests seemed really happy with the hotel service, the absence and food, all really good.

For me the care and attention shown to my daughter by Mark the bar manager and Jans the events manager was second to none.  My daughter is pregnant and was unwell on the day and Mark and Jane both went out of their way to look after her but confined for the rest of the evening to check on her which I was not aware of until the next day.

Well done guys and thank so much",5,2016,08,15
237,This is probably the best hotel I have ever stayed in!,"Location: It was located in the heart of Dublin. Just a few blocks from Temple Bar. We could easily take the bus and public transportation. Even though it was in this great location, once we were inside of the hotel, we could no longer hear the hustle and bustle of the city.

Rooms: We stayed in the penthouse suite and it was luxurious. We had a beautiful view of Dublin, while we had breakfast each morning. It had window seats along all of the walls with plush, velvety pillows (comfortable enough to sleep on). It was very modern with motorized curtains and blinds. The bathroom was amazing with a huge walk-in rain shower and separate soaking bath tub. We had 2 adjoining room next door with the riverside views and it was just gorgeous and modern. They were also a good size. 

Service: Our flight arrived in Dublin a bit earlier than the check in (i.e. we got there are 9am and check in was at 3pm). They were able to accommodate 3 adjoining rooms within an hour of our arrival. I called the front desk a few times for requests for extra towels, pillows and blankets, and the service was almost immediate!

Overall: I could not have imagined a better room, service or location for this vacation with my family!",5,2016,08,15
237,Enjoyable experience,"The room was very nice, and the location was fantastic. We had been on a road trip around the coast of Ireland and were ending our holiday at the Morrison, and hence we were looking for some comfort. The hotel met our needs. The WiFI was excellent. The location is just right as you can walk over to the South side of Dublin, and nothing feels far away. The shuttle bus to the airport is within a 10 minute walk, and thats a bonus.",4,2016,08,15
237,Good location but that´s all,I made two separate bookings for two days because I decided to come a day earlier to the city. I hade to activate the card between and the other booking was to better room but I got the cheaper room for both days and  had to pay for better room. The staff didn´t bother to tell about the breakfast and first day I missed it. The other day I found the breakfast room but it was disapointment. Couldn´t get even coffee by myself and there was nothing fresh. One of the worst breakfast I ever had. In the room was coffeemaker but between the days nobody checked that there was coffee to make ... Great location but that´s it. This hotel isn´t worth the price.,3,2016,08,15
237,Pleasant Stay,No complaints.  The hotel property and staff were pleasant.  There seemed to be some confusion during breakfast due to staff changes.  But the dining room itself and food were fine.  Close to everything and nicely maintained.  It would be a good choice for any travelers to Dunlin.,4,2016,08,14
237,Best Location,Perfect simple hotel in the heart of the city ----  just across the river from Temple Bar active area.   Modern hotel w good size rooms - but no 2 queen beds?  Vehicle traffic can be tough in this area ---- walking works best.,4,2016,08,14
237,Very convenient and very comfortable,"Great location, close to most things to do in Dublin. The rooms are very clean and beds are comfortable. The staff is very considerate and went out of their way to ask questions and offer suggestions for dining and places to visit. ",5,2016,08,12
237,Couples vacation,"Great location and the staff was awesome. We went to Ireland for 3 days and we would absolutely go back to the Morrison. The quality of everything, especially the staff made us so glad we chose to stay there. Bravo to the hotel for hiring such upbeat professional personnel. Stay here if you can!!",5,2016,08,11
237,Excellent choice in Dublin,"I researched (and stressed over) which hotel to book for our anniversary trip.  Five minutes into our experience at the Morrison, I knew I'd made the right choice.  Every staff member we encountered throughout our stay was extremely nice and helpful.  We received a letter on the second night stating there would be a large, potentially loud, event that night and they would move us if needed.  Because we were running the half marathon in the morning, and needed sleep, we asked to move rooms.  They took care of it very quickly.  Both rooms we stayed in were very clean and modern.  We had no issues at all during our stay.  The wifi was accessible throughout the hotel and reliable.  If you are just staying in Dublin, there is no need to rent a car.  This hotel is centrally located and you can walk or get on a bus to just about anywhere within the city.  The hop-on-hop-off tour bus stops pretty close to the hotel (within 2 blocks - easy stroll).",5,2016,08,11
237,Perfect Location,"The Morrison is located directly across the bridge from the Temple Bar area of Dublin.  This is the perfect spot because it is just close enough to experience everything Temple Bar has to offer but just far enough away to provide a quiet restful place to recharge to see all of Dublin.  The staff was always at the ready to provide help and suggestions on what to see in this beautiful city.  Do not miss the morning breakfast with a wide selection of buffet items but also fresh cooked to order items right off the menu.  The location is what got my attention, the staff is what put it over the top.",5,2016,08,11
237,"Location, location, location","Great place to stay!

The hotel is centrally located in Dublin just across the bridge from Temple Bar and a short walk to most of the tourist spots. The hotel is clean, modern and the staff is very friendly. 

My only advice for people coming to stay at this hotel is ask for The Morrison and Not the Hilton. Although this is a Hilton property, it does not have a big sign on the outside of the building to identify it a Hilton (I walked by the hotel twice because I was looking for the Hilton sign). My brother came to this hotel from the airport and the taxi driver took him to the wrong Hilton by accident.",5,2016,08,11
237,Modern Clean Convenient Hotel With Helpful Staff In The Heart of Dublin,"I am a Hilton Honors member. I found this property to be among their best.  

The staff is gracious and helpful.

The rooms were spotless.  Excellent large walk in shower.

Free Wifi worked at high speed throughout the property.

Don't miss the Proper Irish Breakfast.",5,2016,08,09
237,"Good hotel, after switching rooms","When I am paying over $260 Euro for a night, I expect my room to be nice especially from a Hilton property. My wife and I check-in and are given a handicapped room where the bathroom looked like something out of the 1980's.  The bedroom area was remodeled, but the bathroom was not touched.  It was dirty and very unappealing. You had a small table about knee high to put your bathroom supplies, and literally had to bend down to grab what you needed.  I went to the front desk and was given another room, but the hassle of waiting for them to get it ready and move all of our stuff after 8+ hours of travel was not what I wanted on vacation.  The next room was a totally different experience.  It was spacious, updated throughout, immaculate bathroom and very clean.  I would expect that a Hilton property has all of their rooms remodeled, because if you get one that isn't, your experience will be quite different than your neighbor.

Staff was friendly and the location is unbeatable.  Bar areas were fun, and the bartenders were nice.  Hopefully, all of their rooms are up to Hilton standards soon.",3,2016,08,09
237,"excellent hotel, even better location!","We stayed for a single night on our way back home on  a weekend.
the hotel is ideally located within a 5 min. walk to the temple bar district and the shopping center(s).
The hotel is in very good condition, the room was clean and well designed. good TV selection, decent speed (free) WiFi and good breakfast.
Heard good things about the hotel restaurant but didnt have the time to check it out.
i will return to the hotel next time in Dublin",5,2016,08,08
237,Not Your Typical Doubletree!,"My husband, son, and I stayed at The Morrison for 6 nights. Originally I booked a room too small for the three of us and when I tried to correct my error online, the website said the hotel was sold out.  I called and spoke to Renata in Reservations, and she arranged for a Jr. Suite...she was incredibly helpful... I mentioned our flight was arriving at 7AM and while we didn't expect our room to be ready, we did want to be able to freshen up and she said there would be no problem!

Arrived 7AM and the entire front desk staff was welcoming, helpful and friendly (especially the manager and Alicia).  We freshened up, left our luggage at the front desk, and went out to explore Dublin.  They called  to let us know the room was ready and when we finally returned to the hotel, exhausted, we were incredibly happy with our room, which was huge had a lovely view of the River Liffey!

The location of the Morrison is perfect...a short walk to everything...across the bridge to all the Temple Bar action or to the Dublin City Gallery in the other direction.  Breakfast was great and my husband especially appreciated the many gluten free options!

We would definitely stay at the Morrison Doubletree again if we make a return trip to Dublin!",5,2016,08,07
237,Great location and friendly staff,"Visited Dublin on a family vacation and spent two nights at the Morrison. We had two rooms - received an upgrade on one due to Hilton Honors. The regular room was small but comfortable. The junior suite was considerably more spacious, and made a nice gathering spot for our group. No views from the rooms, but then Dublin is right there so we didn't spend much time in the room. 

Location is perfect for seeing Dublin - we walked to Guinness, Trinity College, St. Stephens Green and much more. Easy to pop over the bridge to the Temple Bar area, but nice to cross back for a quiet night's sleep. (Quiet except for the gulls!) 

Had breakfast and both food and staff were outstanding. I especially loved the waffles! Darren at the front desk saved us money with a suggestion to take the Luas instead of a cab to the Enterprise office on Kylemore Road for our rental car pick-up when we left. ",5,2016,08,07
237,"Location perfection, room hell","We spent 2 nights and we're glad to go. The location is truly as perfect as everyone else says, just across from the noise but far enough away to get rest. The hotel is clean, the rooms are small, white and gray, the beds are hard and the a/c is extremely inconsistent. If you do not pay for an upgrade, your view is an inner courtyard that is empty, you see a brick wall. The toilets are so difficult to flush that after a long overseas flight with jetlag I had to cram a bottle of shampoo in there to get it to flush. The minimilist decor continues in the bathroom, no towel bars. Really!?!? The precious little counter space and you use it to stack up towels on it?!?! We ended up feeling like the decor was better suited for a prison than a hotel, we definitely won't go back to the Morrison, Dublin - for sure!",3,2016,08,05
237,"Great Location, Friendly Staff","We stayed three night in this hotel which is right across a walking bridge from the Temple Bar area, great for pubs, night life and shopping.  The rooms were well appointed, but the best part was the staff who worked in multiple rolls and did everything possible to make our stay perfect.  The Irish breakfast buffet was top rate.  I would recommend this hotel, close also to Trinity College to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2016,08,04
237,"Great Job, Reception Staff!","I showed up a day earlier than my original reservation, but the staff were accommodating and empathetic.  Luckily, there was a room available and they welcomed me to stay.  I had a mix up with the cancellation procedures with a 3rd party agency, but Peter was nice enough to handle on my behalf.  Special mention to the attentive staff: asian girl expecting a baby, and the up-beat Concierge (Irish local).   

I would also recommend to try the Gentleman's Tea - great value for the price!  Also, the breakfast was nice in a modern, bright, and tranquil space.  The rooms are comfortable, spacious (by European standards), and loved the live music in the bar.",4,2016,08,04
237,Best hotel I've ever stayed in! ,"We stayed at The Morrison for 2 nights over the weekend to celebrate my birthday. 

Smooth check in. This might be standard practice for Doubletree (having not stayed in one before I didn't know this) but they charge you a €100 charge upon check in. This caused a bit of a panic as I'd brought cash to pay for the room and didn't have a card on me but I managed to resolve this but it would be good to have been told (booked through booking.com) 

Warm cookies given to us on check in which were most welcome after a late flight and there was also a note welcoming us to the hotel along with a little box of chocolates in our room which was a very nice touch. 

Rooms very spacious and immaculate. Beds were even comfier than mine at home! The pillows are amazing. Tea making facilities are provided along with an iron, hairdryer, complimentary bottles of water, mini bar, dressing gown, slippers and a few lotions and potions in the bathroom. Felt really spoilt! 

The hotel is in a fab location. Just down the road from the main shopping centre and a short walk across the bridge to temple bar (brilliant for a quick dash back to the room half way through our night for some flat shoes!) 

Staff are very friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble. 

Made our stay in Dublin very much enjoyable and that little bit special due to the luxury. Will be back for sure and will recommend your hotel to anyone travelling to Dublin. 

Thank you! ",5,2016,08,03
237,Location... Location... Location...,"The Doubletree Morrison is not the world's greatest hotel. The rooms are pretty small, as with most European hotels, and the all-you-can-eat breakfast, while filling, did not have the greatest choices, but was still adequate. What this hotel does have going for it, besides excellent service from the front desk that is willing to do almost anything you ask of them, is location. It sits right on the river Liffey, across the Millennium Bridge from the Temple Bar district, and all the nightlife and restaurants and attractions that this bustling area of the city offers. It's also only one block from the tram station that goes to the Jamison Distillery and a couple of other locations. If your Hilton Honors member and you can stay here on points your best to do so. ",4,2016,08,03
237,Quick but pleasant stay,"A little more pricey than many Dublin options but worth it. We had a very spacious room, good check in and out and a great concierge (Darrien?) who put us on to several great local attractions. Our room had no view but was quiet, which we find to be a good trade off. Very nice service in the bar for a nightcap and reception arranged early morning transport to the airport. You're a quick walk from Temple Bar without being in the middle of it and close to everything else.",4,2016,08,02
237,Great location,Booked last minute and with parking close by it was a good choice. The staff were friendly and being a Hilton Honours member I got the customary warm cookies on arrival which went nicely with the cuppa in the room. The room was lovely and modern with a decent ensuite the only downside was the lowest setting of the air con sounded like a train so we turned it off and opened the window but the noise of seagulls outside was nearly as bad....the joys of being beside the river I suppose. ,4,2016,08,01
237,Great for Business,"I stayed here for one night in July 2016. Of course I was welcomed with a warm cookie. The room was spacious and very well appointed. I couldn't fault the room or the service I received, The location was ideal for Dublin City Centre. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,07,31
237,Nice Experience,"Our family stayed in this hotel during a recent visit to Ireland.  It is in a great location of Dublin, easy access to tour bus stop and walking distance to major attractions.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  Nice Experience!",5,2016,07,31
237,Nice boutique hotel with great location!,"Stayed at the Morrison for five days in mid-July. Great staff service and the location of the hotel is ideal -- short walk to museums, pubs and restaurants. In particular, Darren Derwin was awesome giving helpful hits, as well as very friendly and willing to go the extra mile. Concierge Jane Bridge, Sarah Reilly and Karen Cardona also provided excellent service and should be commended for making gusts feel very welcome. Rooms were good size and comfortable. Overall a good place to stay.",4,2016,07,31
237,A well located lovely hotel!,"Stayed in this hotel for two nights for my daughters 16th birthday. The location was perfect as the trip was mainly for shopping. There is a shopping centre just across the road. The room was really lovely and comfortable. It was warm but had air conditioning which was nice. The bathroom was spacious and the shower was very good! We had breakfast both mornings which was fantastic. Great buffet selection and lovely menu with pancakes, french toast etc. have to recommend both of these! Staff were very helpful and friendly. It was expensive, definitely a lot more than I would usually pay for a hotel, but it was a birthday treat!",5,2016,07,31
237,Fabulous hotel. ,"We stayed here with friends on 29th July. The hotel is very modern and stylish.  The room we had was spacious and luxurious.  The bathroom was big and had a separate shower. the bed was very comfortable and extra pillow was provided in the room.

The girls on reception at check-in were very friendly and professional. The bar was very comfortable and the barmen were excellent especially the guy from Antrim... (i forgot to ask his name).They have a very extensive range of cocktails and I would highly recommend the Blue Crush.  They have a great range of whiskey too if that's your thing. 

We didn't partake in the afternoon tea but I saw some other guests having it and it looked scrumptious and was excellently presented.

We had breakfast sent up to our room on Saturday and it was devine.  Everything was perfectly cooked. I couldn't fault this hotel and will definitely be back again. 
",5,2016,07,31
237,We were disappointed. Why isn't it less expensive?,"The hotel is nice but it's not up there with the best. The street noise was bad and the bed was as hard as a rock. I looked to see if there was a mattress because it felt like I was sitting on a box spring (not joking). It's in a really busy part of town with lots to see and do but I would not stay there again, especially considering the price.",3,2016,07,31
237,Dublin,"Extended a tour.  Great location .  Extremely helpful staff.  My room's location was located near a loud, evening noise.  If the breakfast area was open an hour earlier, I would have enjoyed two of your fabulous breakfasts. As it was, I only enjoyed one breakfast.  Totally loved your French toast!",3,2016,07,31
237,Fantastic Stay!,"My husband and I just stayed here for 2 weeks while vacationing in Ireland.  We were upgraded to a nicer room upon arrival and it was like staying in a little flat while we were there!  It was clean and comfortable.  The location couldn't be better. We walked everywhere while we were there. The staff was very friend and helpful, as well! We will definitely stay here again on our next trip. If you are a light sleeper and stay on the river side, pack some ear plugs as you can hear street noise. ",5,2016,07,30
237,Quick Overnight Stay,"Needed a place to sleep for the night before flying home the following day.  Great hotel, friendly stay.  Location is perfect to walk across the river and into the Temple Bar district which has lots of pubs and shopping to choose from.",5,2016,07,30
237,Beautiful Location,"We came to Dublin under a real cloud with the loss of someone very precious to us. We found the Morrison Doubletree Hilton a beautiful and relaxing place to stay and the staff where very accommodating and they could have done no more to help us. The food was excellent and the breakfast times with Ruso where excellent.
Will be going again for sure AAA+++",5,2016,07,27
237,Very nice hotel ,"The hotel was very nice with great rooms and service. It had free WiFi and breakfast, which was very good. It is located near most of the sites in Dublin, and almost everything to do is within walking distance. Restaurants are also close by.",5,2016,07,26
237,3 Nights in Dublin,"Upon our arrival we were told that our upgraded room would not be available for awhile.  But, the staff at The Morrison went into action.  One of the concierge sat us down with a map and showed us the places to go to see the ""real Dublin"".  Then, while we were talking, the Manager of the front desk came by to ask if we would ""mind"" staying in the Penthouse for the night until our room the next day was ready.  Duh.  What a treat for weary travelers.  Thank you.  I cannot say enough about the friendliness of the staff at The Morrison.  Plus, the location is directly on the River Liffey  directly across the walk bridge from Temple Bar.  It is a superb location, very close to pubs, restaurants, shopping, etc.",4,2016,07,26
237,Perfect location,"Excellent hotel, rooms were clean, tidy and very comfy. Excellent river view. Hotel staff very helpful. Hotel bar and resturant was really nice, food amazing. Location is perfect and the best part about this hotel. In middle of everything. 2 min walk to temple bar area and shopping center. Can easily walk to the likes of trinity college, castle, cathedral and a 15 min walk away from guinness factory. ",5,2016,07,26
237,Hotel to the stars ,The staff couldn't do enough for us and it was a stone's throw away from the venue we went to see and the main attractions. Food was glorious and the service was excellent. Very cheerful staff exactly what we imagined a typical irish welcome would be. ,5,2016,07,25
237,It's the best in Dublin,"This was our second stay at the Morrison.(reviewed previously on TripAdvisor) From the moment we checked in until our check out, our experience was great. Our room request, quiet room away from elevator, was honored. Even though check in is at 3, we were able to have our room early, which was good because we had flown in early from the UK. All the staff at the Morrison is friendly and helpful from the front desk staff to restaurant/bar staff. Our room had a comfortable king bed and all necessary amenities. Did not have a meal this time, but did enjoy some small plates (snacks ) in the evening at the bar. The bartenders have great personalities and are very accommodating. Made ice tea for me, which most places in the UK and Ireland won't do. All in all, you can rest and relax while at the Morrison. Should we get back to Dublin in the future, the is no doubt that we would stay at the Morrison again!",5,2016,07,25
237,Very impressed,"This was my first ever visit to Ireland and what a brilliant choice of hotel this was. 30 minutes from the airport, €30 by taxi or €6 each by bus. The hotel is very well situated along side the river and only a few minutes walk from all the bars/restaurants/shops. First impressions of the hotel as we walked to the check in desk was very good, it looked very clean and welcoming. The reception staff were all smiling and made us feel welcome and gave us a very yummy cookie. My only moan is that we were given room 11 and as we went to our room we could not find it, after a short search I had to back to reception to ask how to get to the room. It was on the mezzanine level really should have been explained as we checked in. When we got to the room it was very well set out very spacious and very clean, and the bathroom was gorgeous. 
We went to the bar for a drink and as we were deciding what to have the barman came over and started talking, he was very friendly and talked us into having a couple of cocktails, he recommended two cocktails based on drinks we like and they were lovely, so a big thumbs up for the bar staff.
We ate out both nights so didn't have any meals other than the breakfast which is a buffet style breakfast and it was all very nice, especially the scrambled eggs. You can order alternative breakfasts from a menu if you don't want the buffet one. As we checked out we were heading straight to the airport and the reception staff gave us a bottle of water each which I thought was a lovely gesture.
Thank you The Morrison,  we will return. And I will be recommending this hotel to anyone I talk to that's going to Dublin.",5,2016,07,24
237,Superb Location for Dublin Centre,"The Morrison is a well modernised establishment. It was excellent to be just across the River Liffey from the Temple Bar district and within walking distance of many tourist attractions.

The room was well laid out, a comfortable bed and spacious bathroom (shower though not bath). The desk was ample with several power points. WiFi was included in our rate. The power is controlled at a switch into which a room card key (or similar shape) is inserted. The front desk was friendly and helpful and other staff courteous. The room and the corridors are in excellent condition.

There is a shopping district less than 5 minutes walk away.  Airport bus services are about 10 minutes away.",4,2016,07,24
237,Weekend getaway,"Location excellent, right in the heart of this bustling city...had a twin room, beds very comfortable, clean, decor tastefully thought out, extra bedding supplied if needed...room could have done with a stool in front of large mirror for the purpose of getting ready and another mirror above dressing table. Exceptional customer service, smiley and very helpful. Would definitely recommend for a comfortable stop off 😀",5,2016,07,24
237,A weekend in Dublin ,"This hotel is in a great location to walk to most of the city's attractions + sights. The rooms are spacious, luxurious, well appointed and spotless. The staff are friendly and very helpful. The bar is a bit expensive but worth the money for the comfy seats, great cocktails + really talented musicians. The band playing on 23 July were really talented! 
",4,2016,07,24
237,Excellent location,"Great position, right on the River Liffey and close to the Temple bar area, though I prefer the Oval bar if you are looking for and excellent pint of the black stuff.Very clean and comfortable room overlooking the river, great attentive staff. Parking is also very close by and secure at the cost of about 12 euros a day.",5,2016,07,24
237,"Great location, hip hotel","We just stayed at the Morrison and it was a great choice for us.  Very centrally located on the River Liffey across from Templebar.  The hotel is very modern, and comfortable.  We had a nice big bedroom, with really soft sheets, overlooking the courtyard and rooftops of Dublin (we asked to be put on the quieter side.)  The service was really good, especially for the amazing breakfasts.  The food was delicious.  A great choice in Dublin.  ",5,2016,07,24
237,Outstanding Accommodations and Service,"I highly recommend this hotel.  Quality service and accommodations.  The room was clean and spacious and the staff were friendly, courteous and professional. The location was perfect for our Dublin day trips and the staff most helpful in any of our needs.",5,2016,07,24
237,Really Nice Hotel,This Hotel is close to everything and just a short walk to the famous Temple Bar. The rooms are modern and well appointed with everything you may need. The staff is second to none and make every wish come true.,5,2016,07,24
237,excellent hotel....right downtown....great staff,"Spent a few days at this hotel recently. Great staff. Extraordinarily helpful. The location can't beat. Right on the river near almost everything you want to see and do in downtown Dublin. Rooms were spacious. We had a room facing the inside courtyard which ensured a very quiet experience. Since the hotel is on a busy street, don't know how noisy the rooms facing the street are. Wifi was impressively fast and no limit on the number of devices (the hotels that restrict the number of devices are really beginning to annoy me).",5,2016,07,23
237,Things to be improved ,"Some previous reviews are great and it is  fully deserved to receive the feedback like this from those who love Morrison. The hotel is in the prime location, away from the crowd, easy access to anything you want in central Dublin. 

I am a regular customer here and I like Morrison for all the above & their rates are competitive. Morrison would have been perfect if they had a chance to look at the service as a whole though. Possibly change their attitude as the management, or maybe train their staff to be a bit better connected with each other on one thing - IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE. 

A few examples to support this. I might be having just a bad experience. However, I found it consistent in this particular place. 

During my first stay I was put in a spacious en-suite with a living room, which I haven't booked or asked for. I liked it, however the bathroom was full of smoke odour! It was awful as the bathroom had no windows. The wi fi didn't work and the guy who did the room service kindly provided, what he said was 'his' code. It looked like I had to tip him for it. He was a very strange guy. I had a late night after my business meetings, so I complained later when I left. 

My second stay with 20 other people in the group was alright. The room was perfect. The only thing we had to wait 30 min for omelettes & egg benedict, and the staff wasn't considerate of our time. We were asking & asking.... My omelette was burnt in the end, it wasn't good at all. The gentleman refused the egg benedict as he was running so late, he had a scrambled egg instead from the buffet.

The restaurant arrangements in the mornings are just awfully inefficient. The coffee, the menu, the upstairs. Who sits where is unclear to the staff. Why would they need to serve the coffee from the machine which is already there?!! One person can sit at 6 people table & that's OK as long as other people are not waiting.... It's quite messy in the mornings. There are business meetings there too for which the breakfast area is far too small. You can offer to use the grill area for the business meetings which is empty! 

My third stay just recently made my eyes roll. It was a late check in at about 8pm. I was told my room wasn't ready (!!!) as there is some work still ongoing. They've offered a standard room at a cheaper rate which was perfect. They said the breakfast was included. 

I realised as I walked in, the bathroom in that room #117 to be precise, was very strange. The toilet is adjusted to the sink. Then there is a huge space with no use. When you actually try & use the shower - it is in the bath - and you almost have to SIT on the BATH TAP to take the shower. That's how BADLY it's engineered. I've never seen anything more ridiculous than this! I've mentioned this to the ladies @ the reception. Hopefully someone actually checks it & makes the changes. 

In the morning in the restaurant I was told I had to pay for the breakfast (!!!) which obviously I refused referring to my previous conversation that the breakfast was included. The restaurant staff didn't make a fuss about it. I had already checked out by then which saved me time.

It's a very good hotel, and they do a fab job in refurbishing etc. It's just doesn't connect with the service. And illustration is attached where you cannot even complete a survey on your mobile. And the TripAdvisor brand is a part of this technological failure as it appears. What is it Hilton DoubleTree!!!??? You can do so much better than this.

BTW, they give you a nice chocolate chip cookie as you arrive - great stuff - take a green apple instead! They have them too.",2,2016,07,23
237,Great Hotel and location,"We had a great stay at the Morrison Double Tree in Dublin, Ireland.  The hotel has a great location, close to the Temple Bar area.  The Hotel itself was very clean, breakfast was great, and the hotel staff were very friendly.  We will definitely be staying there again.",5,2016,07,23
237,Awesome Hotel and location,"We had a fabulous experience at the Morrison Double Tree in Dublin, Ireland.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The location is great and two blocks from the Temple Bar area.  Will definitely stay there again!",5,2016,07,23
237,"Great, modern hotel in a prime location.","We just spent several nights in Dublin and the Morrison was an absolutely perfect choice for our stay.  The rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable and the modern décor carried over from the rest of the hotel into the design of the rooms.  In addition, every staff member that we interacted with - at the front desk, in housekeeping and at the bar - was courteous, professional and were always asking if there was anything that they could do to make our stay more pleasant.

On top of simply being a wonderful property, the location was perfect for exploring the city; we were able to walk to and from most places that we wanted to visit during our stay, and the few times that we did take a taxi, the drive was never more than 10 minutes.  The Temple Bar district is just a quick walk across the bridge, but because the hotel is on the other side of the river, it was much quieter at night than a hotel in Temple Bar would have been, as that area seemed to be consistently packed until the wee hours of the morning.

In short, this hotel is a perfect choice for anyone wanting to stay in a modern, upscale property that is centrally located in Dublin.

A couple of travel tips:  There are several great cafes within 1-2 blocks of the hotel that are perfect for a light breakfast or coffee, as well as a few extremely good Italian restaurants one block over on Millennium Row.  There are also several pubs on the hotel's side of the Liffey River that are quieter (and packed with a lot fewer tourists) than the ones across the river in the Temple Bar district.",5,2016,07,22
237,Enjoyed our stay,"Overall we enjoyed our 4-night stay at the DoubleTree Morrison. The location was perfect for us, right across the bridge from the Temple Bar area, easy walk to most sites including Trinity College & Grafton Street, and a two minute walk to the LUAS red line Jervis stop, which we easily took back and forth from the train station to do some side trips from Dublin.

We liked our modern king guest room with view of the river. The bed was comfortable and it was roomy enough for the two of us. We enjoyed having coffee in the room and the mini bar so we could keep our complimentary water cold. The bathroom was a letdown and a stark contrast to the modern room. It was very dated, the toilet and sink were shoved together on one side with a big empty space on the other. There was no drying rack and it was very dark … it didn’t look like it should be part of the same hotel room.

The free Wi-Fi worked well and there was no need to sign in.

The staff was friendly and helpful throughout our stay, including in the bar area where it was nice to relax with a glass of wine after a day of seeing the sights.

Would stay here again.",4,2016,07,22
237,"Modern, spacious and central","You get what you pay for at the Morrison.  The rooms are modern, spacious and equipped with everything you need.  At first, the decor is a bit shocking with everything done in purple and white, but it was a pleasant surprise to find the ""Ikea"" look when everything around you is historic.  The staff was pleasant, noise was minimal and the location is a stone's throw from a dozen must see tourist attractions.  It is expensive but worth every penny.",5,2016,07,22
237,2016,"LOVE this hotel. The staff is extremely helpful. My flight was delayed several hours and I worried my room would be cancelled, but when I called the hotel, the staff assured me I needn't worry that they would be waiting for me to arrive, no matter how late. ALSO, I was starving when I arrived. I noticed fries were not offered on the overnight menu, but when I called to the reception, they said they would make the fries. It's those small gestures that put this hotel above the rest. Would definitely book again!",5,2016,07,21
237,Perfect hotel in prime location,"We visited Dublin for a long weekend with family and this hotel is a great location the far side of the river from bustling Temple Bar. Staff were really friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean and comfortable, good quality bedding, plush towels and ironing board and hair dryer in room. Complimentary bottles of water each time the room was made up was a nice touch.",5,2016,07,21
237,Centrally located,This is a very nice hotel that is centrally located in Dublin. From here you can walk almost anywhere. The rooms are nice and the bathroom is spacious. The towels are nice and fluffy. I would recommend this for a vacation to Dublin. And they give you a nice warm cookie when you arrive. The breakfast is delicious. ,4,2016,07,20
237,Wonderful hotel,Great location. Staff all are interested in guests having an enjoyable stay.  Food was excellent and the design of the hotel is attractive.  We enjoyed an afternoon tea with my wife having the traditional and I had a gentlemanly tea which I liked much better.,5,2016,07,20
237,Location and service,"Hotel is right off Liffey River, across from the activity of Temple Bar in the new city. Convenient to all. Unusually decorated room with white plastic-like room side tables,purple lights, etc. We were in a junior suite.  It was a different kind of luxury (if plush sofas, rich reds, golds, and Old world charm is your thing, this might be off putting). Room and hotel extremely clean. Service was excellent. Loved the hotel afternoon tea and had dinner there once and it was quite good. Copious breakfast.",5,2016,07,20
237,"Lovely hotel, great location, friendly staff","Stayed sadly for just one night. Wish we could have stayed longer as it was lovely. The hotel was modern, stylish and very comfortable. The staff made it stand out, they were very friendly with excellent advice on what to do in our very short time.  The steakhouse restaurant was ok, not outstanding but adequate.bThe breakfast however is fab! ",5,2016,07,20
237,Great Place to Stay in Dublin,"Loved this hotel, it has awesome amenities and housekeeping is wonderful here. Rooms are clean and comfortable. The bar has the best bartenders ever, we were there one night and the bartender put on this awesome show with the bottles while making our drinks, and the cocktails are delicious. Really enjoyed our stay here for 2 nights. It's also really close to Temple Bar and anywhere else you want to walk to in Dublin, we walked everywhere from here. ",5,2016,07,20
237,Ireland 2016,"Hotel was well, positioned, just a short walk to the Temple Bar, and other main attractions for the city, Staff was very pleasant, attentive and friendly, the bar was open, and lively, try the Brioche Bread Pudding, not a big dessert fan but this was worth it.

Room was spacious, contemporary, and clean.

Would certainly go back.",4,2016,07,19
237,Morrison hotel dublin,Great location and really stellar service and attention to the guests.  Really good concierge who listened to what we wanted and needed and never failed to direct us appropriately. Rooms were modern and well maintained - would recommend this to anyone interested in visiting Dublin,5,2016,07,18
237,Hard to Find! ,"After making 3 large circles to find this hotel we finally went through some alleys and found it. The front of the hotel does not face the main street given as its address . The restaurant attached to it does. Once you find it, it is in a great location just across the Liffey from Temple Bar and other fun places. The room was great with no view but we weren't there for the view. Very helpful informative staff. ",4,2016,07,17
237,Perfect Location,"Just a 5 minute stroll across the Ha'penny Bridge to the popular Temple Bar area yet a million miles away from the noise. Perfect location, beautiful modern rooms and a staff always willing to help you.",5,2016,07,16
237,Best breakfast EVER! ,"Awesome location, super comfy bed, great shower, squeaky clean room, but a little on the small side. However, the amazingly friendly and helpful staff make this a great hotel, especially Russo and Caryn who delivered possibly the best breakfast I have ever had! ",5,2016,07,16
237,Terrific gues experience,Everyone at the Morrison was incredibly kind and helpful. A special shout out to Darren for all his great advice! Room was comfortable and quiet. Easy walking distance to Trinity College and Temple Bar. My only complaint was that I couldn't figure out how to turn off the light below the tea kettle.,4,2016,07,16
237,"Central location, great staff, quiet and comfortable - loved it","We were here for 8 nights and would definitely stay here again. 

Regarding the staff, we were very impressed with their genuine friendliness and willingness to help. There was no ice machine and being Americans-who-love-cold-drinks, we called about getting ice. They brought it to us in our room and said, ""call for ice anytime, 24 hours a day"". The front desk staff was first rate. If it was raining, they would offer you an umbrella. Violeta in particular at the front desk helped us to book some activities like bus tours and went out of her way to make sure that we were pleased. Mark in the restaurant was exceptionally great at his job - a real plus to the hotel. Make sure you keep him!

The room was very quiet and clean, and the beds were very comfortable. We were on the 4th floor facing the interior courtyard/rooftop area. We couldn't hear anyone in the rooms adjacent to us. My husband and I had 2 twin beds, but we were able to push them together so it was like a king (except we had separate covers). Everything was in excellent condition, clean and well maintained throughout. A very nice hotel. 

The location was excellent - right in the middle of Dublin. We could walk most anywhere: Temple Bar, Trinity College, museums, parks, restaurants, movie theatre, Guinness Storehouse (the last was a bit of a long walk, but do-able). The few times that we needed a car, either the hotel arranged a taxi for us or we used Hailo and Uber. 

We had dinner in the hotel restaurant a couple of times and really enjoyed the food there. Being also Americans-who-love-steaks, we were impressed with the Irish beef and how the restaurant prepared it. The bartenders were very friendly, especially Gary, and we spent some pleasurable time hanging out at the hotel bar watching soccer and sipping drinks. There is a separate restaurant/area for breakfast, which doubles as a sports bar in the afternoons when a big game or match was on. My husband was not a big fan of the breakfast food, but I think it was just personal taste and not being accustomed to European sausage and bacon. I thought the breakfasts were good. There is a breakfast buffet or you can order from a menu. With my Hilton HHonors status, breakfast was free for my husband and I. There is also a great coffee shop with hot breakfasts right next door to the hotel (Mochaland Cafe).",5,2016,07,16
237,great hotel,This hotel was wonderful.  The staff was very friendly and helpful!  The location was great and we could walk everywhere.  The rooms are a good size.  we were there for a wedding and they were so attentive to the bride and groom.  We would stay again!,5,2016,07,16
237,Excellent hotel with great staff,"This is an excellent hotel.  The staff are very friendly and helpful, probably the best hotel I have ever stayed in in that respect.  The rooms are well equipped and very clean.  Excellent location near the city centre and Temple Bar.  Thoroughly recommended and I would definitely go back.  I suggest you will have to do a lot of searching to find a better hotel in Dublin.",5,2016,07,15
237,Beautiful property in an excellent location!,Walking distance to Temple Bar and the DART. We also walked to Guinness in about 25 minutes. Staff was excellent and super helpful. Great bar on-site to have a couple of drinks in. Check in and check out were very quick and efficient. Staff ordered a taxi for us the night before our departure and he was waiting for us when we came down the next morning. In the early morning it was about a 25 minute ride to the airport. ,5,2016,07,15
237,Darrien is Amazing!,"This hotel is in a great location, we could walk to all the attractions and restaurants.  Darrien, the conceriege will take care of you.  His recommendations are spot on.  Had a fabulous stay because of this hotel!  ",5,2016,07,15
237,"Great Location, Modern Hotel","We changed our itinerary a bit while in Ireland, and we wanted to stay a couple of nights in the center city region. The location is great to walk pretty much walk anywhere  you'd want to go. In fact it was so convenient, we returned our rental car early and caught the bus back to the hotel from the airport (only 6 Euros - can get 10 R/T if you want - we took taxi to airport for just 27 Euros for 4 of us). The decor is modern and sleek, which isn't a preference (like more traditional), but again, it is nicely done. The service from the concierges and desk attendants was terrific. The price is not what I'd consider a ""good deal,"" but again the location is really convenient and staff is accommodating.",4,2016,07,14
237,4 days in Dublin,here for 4 nights.  First of all the service is outstanding.  Everyone that worked there was extremely pleasant and helpful.  The room was very large. Bath had a large glass door that didn't shut completely so not good if you need privacy.  There was alot of outside noise- room needs to be a little quieter.  The food is very good- and the hamburger on their menu is one of the best I have had.  The location is very convenient for sightseeing.  Nice cafe on corner as well,4,2016,07,14
237,Great Location,"This hotel is in a great location for most of Dublin's tourist attractions, hop on hop off bus stop just down the street. Multi story car park just down the street with a Hotel discount.
The lunch / dinner offers good views of the river, extensive menu at reasonable prices.
Breakfast is very good, large range of Buffet style food as well as the ability to order off the menu.
we will stay here again",5,2016,07,14
237,LOVED IT!,"I was so sad that we were only in Dublin one night.  When we got to the Morrison, the front desk staff was SO welcoming and friendly.  The hotel is cool and funky with purple lighting throughout and very modern.  The location was superb with it being right near Ha'Penny Bridge. It is walking distance to Temple Bar, Dublin Castle, Jameson Whiskey and Guiness Factory.  The room was comfy, clean and had a nice coffee/tea service.  There was a small fridge in the room filled with beverages for purchase as well as a few snacks for purchase.The freshly baked cookies one gets at check in are far better than the ones in the states.  Not sure why!
Only drawback for us, was the address of Ormond Quay, is NOT where the front door to the hotel is and we walked past it a few times before we had to ask people if they knew where the hotel was. Again, so sorry we were only there less than 24hrs before our flight back to the US, but I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2016,07,13
237,"Amazing Staff, Great location, but noisy rooms. Should be 3 but Staff make it 4","The staff here are wonderful. Very friendly and they really make the place work. The greeting was great, and very welcoming.All the staff are wonderful, but a special mention to Papa the night manager, who is a class act. Nothing is too much trouble. If only every hotel had a Papa !!.
The bar and restaurant is big, and at night can be rocking.
Rooms were spacious, and well equipped. On the day i affixed there was a wedding downstairs. Although on the second floor, it seemed like they were in my room. and at night is was very loud until 2am. The hotel did write to us all to be fair to explain, but double glazing would be an improvement.
The staff really do make this place, and also a shout out to Aileen, who was super helpful with our booking.",4,2016,07,12
237,Very good hotel,"Very good hotel, extremely welcoming staff, very well situated in the city center; right across temple bar :)  If you get the a la carte breakfast feels much better and their eggs benedict are amazing :)",5,2016,07,11
237,A fantastic place to stay.,Spent a week here recently with some friends who were very very impressed. It's a beautiful hotel with a nice atmosphere and very friendly staff. Definitely going back soon. The rooms were beautiful and the food was fantastic. Full marks to the Morrison.,5,2016,07,11
237,Location Location Location.,"That is it. Best location in town. Great hotel, great service. It is in the center of Dublin, everything is at walking distance. You will not find anything better.  It is not cheap but it is totally worth it.",4,2016,07,10
237,close to the  action,"a delightful hotel close to the center of Dublin. It left us with short walks to many of the sights we had to see while there. The GPO where the Easter Uprising occurred 100 years ago is around the corner, the Grafton Street  and Steven's Green are 1/2 mile away, as is Trinity College and the Book of Kells. The Temple Bar district is just across the Liffey. The Guinness Brewery is a brisk 15 minute walk and worth it.",5,2016,07,09
237,Doubletree Hilton Dublin ( By Temple Bar),"This hotel has been our home Monday to Friday for the past 3 years as we are working in Dublin and we commute from UK. The hotel is exceptional in its facilities, the staff and its location.  The rooms are big, clean and quiet. The Bar area has a nice feel to it and the bar menu is extensive not to be repetitive.  Its location is excellent for the travellers who are tourists and for business travellers the location near to the LUAS stops is also a bonus.  The hotel staff are friendly to all the residents if they are one night residents or long term residents. I would highly recommend that what ever your purpose for visiting Dublin make the Doubletree Hilton in Ormand Quay your hotel of choice",5,2016,07,08
237,One nighter on the Liffey,"The Morrison, in a series of old buildings along the Liffey River, close to major tourist attractions, is very modern inside, all neutral colors and shiny surfaces.  There's a good bar/restaurant, the Grill, on the ground floor facing the street where we had an enjoyable dinner of grilled lamb.

Our room, while not large by American hotel standards, was comfortable and well-appointed.  My only complaint is that the lighting in the bathroom, 4 small spotlights, was completely inadequate for applying make-up.  The could have provided a lighted magnifying mirror, at least.  The bedroom's lighting was only a little better but the bed was very comfortable and the room was spotless.

The staff was cordial and helpful.  As it was Gay Pride weekend, there was a lot of  street noise which filtered up to our room on the 4th floor, even tho we were facing a side street.  Perhaps that isn't normal.",4,2016,07,08
237,"Location, location, location!","A great hotel in a perfect location, on the river Liffey! We told them we were celebrating our anniversary and they brought a couple of glasses of champagne to our room with strawberries! So very thoughtful and welcoming. We also got a room with a view of the river Liffey, so extra special! Our adult kids were on the same floor and their room was exactly as ours just not as neat a view. The rooms were nice size, very comfortable beds and very clean. The hotel location is centrally located. We walked to the Temple Bar area.  We had bought tickets for the green hop on hop off sightseeing bus for two days which was great. We saw a lot this way, such as Trinity College, Dublin Castle, and the Guinness Storehouse. We rode the bus the entire route listening to a commentator point out all the great points of interest. We saw where the president of Ireland lives along with many other interesting spots. We had the front desk get us a taxi for our return to the airport because we had to leave very early. Our flight was at 9:00 am and it is recommended that you allow 3 hours to go through security. The cost was 40.00 Euros which was reasonable since there was 4 of us traveling together. We had planned to take the 747 air link bus since we had already purchased return tickets when we arrived in Dublin but changed our minds and decided to take a taxi since it would have been a bit of a hike from the hotel with luggage in toe to get to the closest airlink bus stop so early in the morning. I strongly recommended the 3 hours they say you need to get checked into the airport if you have to go through customs. It takes almost that long even going that early in the morning. There are many decent places to eat within walking distance of this hotel as well. I do think prices are a bit steep but there is no getting around that when you stay in a central location in the heart of Dublin.  All in all a great stay and I would not hesitate staying at the Morrison Hilton again.",5,2016,07,07
237,Good location,"We enjoyed two nights with a river view. Room was average size for the city with modern furnishings. 

The location is great with everything within walking distance. Quiet for a city hotel.  The bar is great with a good view. 

Would recommend for business or pleasure.

237,Bzuerch,"Great location,excellent service,modern and immaculate. Thanks for a wonderful place to rest after a grand tour of Ireland. Breakfast was included with our stay and it was one of the best we had. Check-in and check-out were quick and easy. 
",5,2016,07,07
237,Brilliant,From arrival to departure the hotel staff were brilliant! Darren in particular was extremely helpful as nothing was too much for him. The room and food was very good and the location is superb. I will be returning to the Morrison in the near future! I thoroughly enjoyed my stay!,5,2016,07,06
237,Staff were amazing,"My husband was traveling for business and I tagged along with our then 6 month old daughter. Honestly, I thought it would be a snobby hotel because it looks very stylish from the outside, also it's not cheap. It turned out to be an awesome stay and it is far from snobby!  The room was great, spacious and very central location right on the Liffey. Huge, soft beds. You can ask for a crib (cot)  if traveling with a young one. The breakfasts buffet was good: meats, cheeses, cereal, sausage, egg, toast, pretty much everything you could ask for. The staff were lovely, very helpful, friendly and definitely went the extra mile for us. I can't say enough about them.  No complaints.",5,2016,07,05
237,"Friendly staff, nice stay","Okay, the sign to this hotel (expecting a big DoubleTree sign, right?) is about one foot square on a side street, but we finally found it. We booked here due to using Hilton Points, and the location is SPECTACULAR!!! The staff were initially a bit offish as we arrived in the morning prior to our check-in and needed to store our luggage for the day; we arrived in Dublin at 6AM, so this worked out okay and they held our luggage with no problem. After we checked in, we had nothing but excellent service and friendly helpful staff; they gave suggestions for things to do and small towns to visit around Dublin which turned out to be great. Our room was clean and super spacious for a city. The only real hassle is (yes, I know, an American thing) getting ice. We like to have beverages in our room, and when getting ice, the bartender treated us like we were asking for something ridiculous. However, then the breakfast staff were OUTSTANDING - friendly, go out of their way to satisfy, truly a lovely experience for a buffet.",5,2016,07,05
237,Family Wedding - Brilliant Service,"We had a family wedding at the hotel and we couldn't recommend the hotel more, the staff and facilities were top class and made our day and night very enjoyable. From the minute we arrived to the time of departure the staff were extremely courteous and helpful and there was nothing we could fault.",5,2016,07,05
237,"Great location, very modern and upbeat","This is now a Doubletree hotel.  It is bright and modern with a good layout for a longer stay.  We were here for two days, longer would be fine!  It is a fabulous location.  No onsite parking but a public car park about 200 meters away where you receive a discount.  Staff are helpful.  Breakfast is 'fine'.  You might choose from any number of cafes nearby if you don't need an early start!",4,2016,07,05
237,"Great hotel, perfect location! ",Arrived Sunday 3rd July early evening for a 3 night stay. Reception staff were very friendly and helpful. We had booked a King junior suite overlooking the river.  The Morrison has a very cool modern style and the room reflected that - very funky and we loved it.  We had an issue with the plumbing and Adriana the hotel manager looked after us incredibly well - thank you! 😊 I had read lots of reviews about traffic noise but can honestly say we weren't disturbed at all.  The hotel is perfectly located - just a short walk over the river and you're in the heart if Dublin. Would definitely recommend this hotel...and I'm really rather fussy about hotels! ,5,2016,07,05
237,Family wedding,"Stayed at the Morrison for a family wedding last weekend. I have never been to a hotel with such helpful and friendly staff. when checking in, we were given cookies still warm from the oven. the staff enquired as to they could help in any way and even offered to check other family members rooms for my teenagers to find their cousins. Darren in particular was very helpful and nothing was any bother to him. Rooms were great as was food. Jane in charge of the function was also very efficient and helpful. we will stay here again.",5,2016,07,04
237,"""I don't think we're cool enough for this hotel""","I booked this hotel for 2 reasons: 1. I could use Hilton Honors points and 2. the location. You can't beat the location, right across the river from temple bar area and within easy walking distance of many sights. However, they're really trying to be very ""hip"" with the decore and overall feel, I just never felt comfortable. Additionally, the room was on the small side and the bed was also a little hard for our liking. Again, the location is the selling point and I can't fault them as it was clean and staff we encountered were friendly, this hotel simply wasn't for us.",3,2016,07,04
237,great location,Arrived and were helped immediately by the manager. Then told where to park. Trouble with our room air conditioning. Service came immediately and we were moved to a different room. Ate breakfast there the first morning but the service was poor and the croissants were terrible. Next morning went down street 1/2 block. for great croissants. Eate at the restaurant had a very nice chicken sandwich,4,2016,07,04
237,Great hotel and staff,stayed here for our honeymoon and the staff was great and very accommodating.  loved the modern feel with a great breakfast each day.  location is perfect.  what more do you need?  would definitely stay here again for our return to dublin.,5,2016,07,04
237,Anniversary treat,"The Morrisson was not the cheapest hotel we have stayed in in Dublin but as it was our first anniversary we decided to treat ourselves. We were not disappointed.

We booked a river view room and on arriving in the stylish and modern room we were sent up bubbly and a sweet plate compliments of the hotel. Lovely touch and much appreciated!

Hotel was in a very central location but very quiet at night time. Perfect combination.

All the staff were fabulous and we commented afterwards that it was possibly the happiest hotel staffing we had ever come across. We actually called the manager at one stage of our stay to let him know what a pleasure it was dealing with the staff.

Breakfast in the morning was delicious and there was a good variety. We were also glad to see that they are very celiac friendly as we have a close relation who often finds it hard to eat out due to this. If you wanted something that was not celiac friendly you ordered it from your waiter. 

I would definitely stay here again and would highly highly recommend it to friends and family.",5,2016,07,04
237,"Great location, but...","Our visit to the Morrisson started badly... and was an overall frustration for us. To begin, there is nothing on their directions that tells you where to enter the hotel. The ""front"" of the hotel (the hotel's address) is on Ormond Quay Lower, but that is a very busy one-way boulevard going east (the opposite direction being across the river), but the actual entrance is on Jervis Street (turn left of of Ormand Quay as you pass the hotel). And... there is no loading area to speak of (what was there was occupied by other cars). After that ordeal, I was given poor directions to the offsite parking garage and ended up in the wrong one (that was a wasted 15 euro). Then I learned that the parking garage would not be open the next morning early enough for us to leave (they open later on Sunday mornings). I ended up parking on the street behind the hotel and down a block (sketchy neighborhood, but it was a rental... I wouldn't park my own car there overnight). The staff (all from eastern Europe) were all very cheerful and helpful (or at least tried). Our rooms were very spacious and very nice, but perhaps a bit too ""hip"" for our tastes. But then... we learned that there was a wedding in the hotel and reception with loud music and partying... immediately below our rooms, and the hotel was fully booked so there was no where to move away from the loud party. Plus, the room overlooked the back street, which seemed to be the place all the drunks in town liked to go to shout at one another late at night. Not a great night. The breakfast buffet was very good, so no complaints there. The one big positive is the location. The Morrisson is just across the river from central Dublin and was a perfect spot as a headquarters for sightseeing the city.",3,2016,07,03
237,Great Location and experience,"Lovely Hotel close to Temple Bar and other sights in Dublin. The staff was always helpful with transportation and recommendations of local places to eat or just to see the sights. The room was quiet, spotless and comfortable. The staff whether it be the front desk staff or housekeeping were lovely, courteous and helpful. I would stay here again.",5,2016,07,03
237,"Not a good start, but hotel is nice.","We had a very strange start at this hotel.  We showed up around noon, checked in and dropped off our luggage since our room wouldn't be ready till around 3PM.  When we came back, we picked up our keys and made our way to the elevator.  As soon as the elevator doors closed, we heard a loud bang, a jerk and then it stopped moving.  Someone immediately answered the intercom and we informed them.  It took about 15 minutes and we were released.  The manager offered us a couple drinks at the bar for the trouble.  When we got to the room, my wife was desperate for a nap since we had been traveling and already seen some sights, but there was construction going on.  I went downstairs to ask how long it was going to be, and I decided to take the stairs instead of the elevator.  There was a staircase next to my room, but it took me into a small corridor with 2 electric doors.  1 of the doors had a button that said push for release, so I did and left.  It took me into an empty venue space that I assume was part of the hotel.  The door I just came through was locked with a keypad, and the front door said it was a fire door with alarm.  I went to the back and found the construction crew, and someone let me back into the main hotel.  I find it really weird that there were no signs this whole time and can only imagine if I took that path after the construction crew had left, would I be stuck in there?
The room itself was awesome.  It was big, had a nice desk and phenomenal bathroom.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  We were able to have breakfast one morning and it was really good.  The location is central, on the river and close to many attractions, but it is in Dublin city center and felt dangerous at night.  I don't think it is any more dangerous than anywhere is in the city center though, but we did have drunk people mess with us walking home one evening.  There was construction both days we were there which was a big inconvenience since my wife couldn't take a nap.  They were literally using jackhammers about 50 feet away from our room for the majority of the day till about 5:30PM.  I will say that some of this is just bad luck, and hopefully things go better if we stay here again.",3,2016,07,02
237,Great location,Location was very good. No parking at hotel but discounted down the street. Might have been helpful to have information of where to park before arrival. Room was very nice and breakfast was a good selection of items. ,5,2016,07,02
237,Great hotel & a lovely city . Family trip to Dublin,"Hotel staff very friendly & very obliging . We had young children with us & their needs were met from breakfast to room service for something as simple as warm milk . Food was amazing . There was unlimited choice for breakfast , afternoon tea was delicious , cocktails were amazing in the bar .......would book this hotel again & recommend it to friends & family . Very central position in the city . ",5,2016,07,01
237,"Nice, Upscale Hotel","The room was very nice.  There was not a good place for my girlfriend to straighten her hair in the morning though as there was not a plug near a mirror.  The location was nice, not far from a lot of attractions.",4,2016,06,30
237,Fantastic hotel,"Stayed here just before Christmas. The hotel had gone to town on decorating and it looked lovely. The hotel is really modern. Upon arrival, we were upgraded to a deluxe room free of charge, we also received a cookie which was gorgeous. The staff were so helpful, any queries we had, nothing was too much trouble. When we got to our room, it was very clean and spacious. There was a kettle with tea and coffee. Also in the fridge there was a variety of drinks, crisps and pots of sweets. The bed was really comfortable too. Had a great few nights here and would definitely recommend. ",5,2016,06,30
237,Best breakfast and great stay in Dublin,"Chose this hotel for its location -- right on the Liffey, and steps from central Dublin sites. Couldn't have been better. Even though I needed to be farther away, buses were easy to use and right in front of the door -- nice treat in Dublin: wifi on the buses ;)

Hotel is nearly invisible from the road. We heard they can't hang signs out from the building, and if you may miss it if you are driving (we arrived by taxi, but another guest who was driving said he had trouble finding the hotel).

Fabulous rooms -- huge, modern, high ceilings, very comfortable.
Breakfast -- give yourself a few hours to enjoy. I just did not have enough time to make a good run at the choices!",5,2016,06,30
237,Perfect location,The check in experience was impressive.  Very quick and yet informative.  The concierge was helpful and friendly and enthusiastic.  Great welcome.  Room was very nice with a lovely view of the river.  Breakfast was fantastic!  Great selections and excellent.  ,4,2016,06,30
237,Great Experience,"From the moment we arrived until we departed, we received excellent service.  The concierge people could not have been more helpful especially with upgrading seats on our flight home and helping contact our airline when our flight was canceled the same morning of departure.  The hotel is in a great location right next to the river Liffey and in walking distance to many shops and restaurants.",5,2016,06,29
237,Weekend in Dublin,"Finished our holiday in Ireland with this delightful weekend in Dublin. Hotel very good, staff extremely friendly and helpful and restaurant food very good. A real find in the centre of Dublin with multi storey parking nearby at reduced rate.",5,2016,06,29
237,Brilliant staff but some concerns,"My business requires my being in hotels about 100 days a year as such I've got a good feel for staff and other things.

Let me start by saying the staff in everyway, shape and form were outstanding. Not good but rather outstanding.

The hotel itself was very nicely kept, clean and modern but I do have 2 concerns if you will. 

Being in the city center area is great for the access to be entertained and enjoy great food. That access also provides for a wee bit of noise from those who've indulged a bit too much then congregate along the river bank and boardwalk. The other area of concern is value for what they call a suite. Yes it was a suite but IMHO grossly overpriced given what the suite entailed. Yes the suite did overlook the river but I stay in numerous cities to include Hong Kong quite a bit at a very nice hotel on the water with great views of Victoria Harbor, have executive floor access, free breakfast and evening refreshments as well as food for about 40% less. Keep in mind Hong Kong is one of the most expensive places in the world for real estate.

If for no other reason than the staff I would go back because they were so good, so friendly and truly sought to accommodate your needs, I'd just cringe at check out",4,2016,06,28
237,Dublin Stay,Great hotel. Clean. No issues. Great Staff. Location is across from pedestrian bridge to Temple bar district. 100 yards. Parking garage next door. Walking distance to everything in Dublin. Price beats everything else too.,5,2016,06,28
237,Modern hotel in a great location,"We felt welcome as soon as we walked in. I would recommend this hotel due to the location and nice, clean, very comfortable rooms. The breakfast was outstanding and complete, especially the highly addictive caramel donuts!",5,2016,06,28
237,Comfortable and convenient stay,"Just across the river from the Temple Bar area and not too far of a walk to Trinity College or the Castle and Cathedral.  In the opposite direction is a shopping area with reasonably priced stores.  Modern, clean, convenient and pretty quiet, especially since it is right on the main boulevard.  Dublin must have considerate night guests.  The hotel was comfortable and had a handy bar with food and late night entertainment.  ",4,2016,06,27
237,Lovely hotel,"We stayed in the hotel for four nights ! The breakfast is wonderful. The rooms are very modern and very clean.

Perfekt location near to all the  shopping and all the pubs. We had a wonderful stay and Will come back for sure

Thea have a lot of nice drinks in the bar, and you can also have a very nice meal in the restaurant ",5,2016,06,27
237,Great stay at the Morrisson in Dublin,"Lewis was amazing.  He was very helpful and made us feel extremely welcomed, since this was our first trip to Ireland.  Everyday he came up to see if he could help with anything.  We had great conversations and he made great recommendations",4,2016,06,27
237,Great visit,"Great food, great service. Gary at the bar was wonderful. Service staff nice but a little slow sometimes with coffee. Breakfast buffet adequately stocked with the staples
You'd expect. Dinner meals outstanding
 All things considered it was just perfect.
Ideal location near Temple Bar. ",5,2016,06,26
237,This hotel should teach customer service around the world,"This hotel is in a perfect location. The staff were possibly the best in all the Hiltons I have visited. All in all, giving this place a 5 star rating feels like I am undervaluing it. I have traveled to many different areas around the world and this one stands out as one of the best experiences I have had. ",5,2016,06,26
237,Tremendous Staff,"This Hotel was Perfect. Great staff, nice room, super Location.
we were walking distance to the major attractions, shops and restaurants, museums, everything.  I would definitely stay here again when I return to dublin.",5,2016,06,25
237,Very Nice!,This Hilton Hotel was very well appointed. We enjoyed our visit tremendously. The restaurant had a well-versed menu with excellent food. The staff is superb. Nice location and very safe. Within 15 min walking distance of anywhere you would want to go down by the river.,5,2016,06,23
237,"Clean, modern hotel in great location","Modern, slightly funky hotel right on the river, near Temple Bar. Staff friendly and room was clean and comfortable. No natural light though (despite paying over 300 Euro the night. Breakfast was fine. Car parking down the street in public car park, 12Euro overnight.",4,2016,06,23
237,"Fantastic location, hip hotel.","Spent 6 nights for a group business trip - was a bit overpriced due to limited availability in Dublin but the service was exceptional and the location is amazing, directly across the Liffey from Temple Bar. Excellent breakfast and the bar/food is good too. Can get a little loud if your room is on the street side.",5,2016,06,22
237,Nice stay in a good location ,"I booked this Hotel for its location between City Center and Temple Bar. All is reachable in walking distance even the Aircoach stop in the City Centre. 
I was welcomed by Adam, a very engaged young gentleman at the front desk. He provided me all the necessary information like city map and he gave me good recommendations for my excursions. 
For my room rate, the breakfast was included what I like. The breakfast buffet had all what I needed. I didn't made use of the a la carte options. The room was very clean, thanks to Adiana the house keeping woman. All the staff was super friendly as all of the people in Dublin. 
",5,2016,06,22
237,Cannot be any better,"If you are looking for a hotel in Dublin look no further! Excellent location, quiet, outstanding facilities, clean and comfortable room, fantastic staff. I have been to many hotels around the world  (I am a frequent traveler) but the Morrison is one (if not) the best hotel I have stayed in. Thank you for a great stay!",5,2016,06,21
237,"Perfect location, Friendly staff, Quiet night in super comfy Bed","This location is within short walking distance of so many tourist sites, like Christ Cathedral and St Patrick's.  The staff was super friendly and accommodating.  A wonderful breakfast buffet was included.  The bed may have been the most comfortable I have ever experienced in a hotel. I would highly recommend.  Note that there are 2 Doubletree Hotels in Dublin. Our airport transport first delivered us to the wrong one.",5,2016,06,20
237,Lovely hotel,"This hotel is a boutique hotel that was really lovely.  Great decor, good guest services.  We really didn't eat at the restaurant but did have some pre drinks before dinner.  Nice central location, close to bars and restaurants.",5,2016,06,20
237,"Perfect location, stylish rooms and helpful staff","This is hotel is only just across the river from Temple Bar and within easy walking distance of Grafton Street, Stephen's Green and Trinity College.
The hotel is modern with good facilities and the rooms are large, comfortable and well furnished. The staff were very helpful throughout our stay.",5,2016,06,20
237,Sign of a Good Hotel is How They a Deal With Problems," The location of this hotel is excellent but it also means you can hear a fair bit of noise on lower floors. When I checked in I found out I was on the first floor in a small room with twin beds, not my requested upper floor King bed. The fault rested with my travel agent who did not include my HHonors account # and upper floor request. The hotel was fully booked so they said they would fix it the next day. Not only did they get me my requested room but they also moved all of the luggage for me and gave me a bottle of wine and sweets for our troubles. Very impressed with the service.",5,2016,06,20
237,"Good location, average stay","A Doubletree is sort of the same anywhere you go in the world - it had all the standard amenities like warm cookies upon check-in, concierge, fitness center, etc.  The only problem is finding the hotel in the first place - there is literally no signage to help you. We had to stop on the street to ask someone who worked at another hotel, and that was the only hope we had of ever finding the place.  The room was pretty tiny, but I guess real estate it as at premium in the big city. The location was really good to be able to walk to Trinity College, Temple Bar, etc.",3,2016,06,19
237,Sons graduation.,"From checking in on Tuesday 7 June to the present, we are enjoying our stay in this lovely hotel.
Reception staff are warm and friendly, and make check in a good experience.
Our room-suite-111, is spacious, bed so comfortable, 
bathroom big, lovely toiletries, clean towels daily. Room cleaned to very high standard.
Breakfast is a pleasure, great choice, lovely staff again, excellent customer care.
Bar is clean, fresh, great cocktails.
Location is superb, near Luas, Jervis, all shops 5 mins away.
Cross the bridge and you're in Temple Bar.
Love, love this hotel. This is my 3rd visit, I highly recommend The Morrison.
I don't want to leave.....😀",5,2016,06,19
237,Convenient Dublin Hub,"We began and ended our trip to Ireland in Dublin and we stayed in The Morrison for both parts.  Upon our arrival, we met with the concierge, Adam, as we arrived too early to check in.  He took the time to map out for us recommendations for shopping, eating, and attractions.  We assumed he would forget us, as the hotel was full, but he greeted us by name the next morning.  Just a short walk from Millennium Bridge, it's very easy to get to Temple Bar and still be away from all of the crowds.  My favorite was we were a block or two from two different Costa locations, which is a must have.  The staff is friendly, the location is wonderful, and the rooms are very clean.  We took the time to stay in the room for an hour or two to rest after walking around Dublin.",4,2016,06,19
237,"Great location, Nice rooms and a good staff",Stayed for two nights with the family.  The location can't be beat.  The rooms are nicely appointed.  We had too get two rooms and the staff was great about getting them on the same floor.  The workout room was a little weak.  But the free breakfast was fantastic. Overall a very pleasant stay,4,2016,06,18
237,The Morrison Dublin,The main problem was locating the hotel in the first place. There is no prominent sign on the main street and merely window etchings showing Morrison's Restaurant on the front. This is difficult to see as there is a bus lane between the hotel and the car lane. The room was very clean and ample size. The only criticism being the bed did creek badly when turning over. The dinner was excellent. This property is right in the centre of Dublin making walking around very easy.,4,2016,06,18
237,Wonderful hotel with perfect location,"We stayed at The Morrison for three nights at the end of March/beginning of April. We were very satisfied with our stay.

Our room was modern and quite large and the hotel staff was very welcoming and helpful. Within walking distance to the sights of Dublin, such as The Guinness Storehouse, the Temple Bar area and Trinity College, the location of the hotel couldn't have been better. Not to forget, the breakfast buffé was fantastic and had a small menu for the warm dishes. Our wonderful breakfast waitress Lucy gave us good advice on what to order.

All in all, The Morrison is highly recommended for a weekend getaway and definitely worth it's price, even though it's quite expensive.",5,2016,06,18
237,Exceptional Experience,"From the moment you enter this hotel, the entire staff is very gracious and helpful. The hotel itself is beautiful with a fun bar and nice restaurant. Room was beautifully designed with a well appointed bathroom. The location is perfect, a short walk to everything in Central Dublin, especially the nightlife. I loved the entire experience here and highly recommend this hotel. Overall, the best Doubletree experience I have ever had. Kudos to the hotel management and staff at this hotel....and thank you!",5,2016,06,17
237,Great,"Great place to stay, a little pricey but my wife and I found the experience to be almost worth the price. The location is perfect for Dublin must sees, walking distance to Guinness, Jameson, St Michans and the Temple Bar!",5,2016,06,17
237,"Clean, modern hotel with super-helpful staff","My best friend and I stayed in a twin room in this hotel on a recent mom-cation in Dublin.  The room was clean and the beds were comfortable.  It was also very quiet, considering the hotel's busy but convenient location.  We didn't get a chance to eat here, but the restaurant had an interesting Gentleman's Tea that I'd love to try next time - problem was, I didn't have a gentleman with me.  :)  I was very impressed with the training and efficiency of hotel staff, particularly with a young man named Lennox on the front desk.  He was incredibly helpful with providing advice on interesting things to do in the city.  I thought the rates were a bit pricey, but it is a nice hotel and we felt very welcome. I'd stay here again.",5,2016,06,15
237,Beautiful hotel,"We stayed here just one night but it was wonderful.  Beautiful hotel, wonderful staff.  Warm cookies on arrival and great service.  Rooms were big and beds were comfortable. Had a great time at the Temple Bar, which was close to the hotel. Also, walked to the Guinness Storehouse for a tour and tasting.  Loved Dublin more than we thought.  Would definitely stay here again.",4,2016,06,15
237,Ideal location,"Walking distance to pretty much everything. Excellent customer service in all regarding the room and the stay.Great cocktails and a decent kitchen; have Gary make you something special. The only negatives were not so great service in the restaurant at dinner time (but the food was pretty good); breakfast service was good. Evening in the lounge and restaurant meant enduring an absolutely awful, and very loud, karaoke quality two-person music act performing bad pop music covers.",4,2016,06,14
237,mid week business related stay,"excellent staff, professional, welcoming and always friendly  great location, short walk to bars and restaurants breakfast is first class  my favorite place to stay in Dublin when on business  parking is easy and accessible",5,2016,06,14
237,You've changed,"It's not me. It's you. Remember when you were John Roche designed. Now you look like you've been tarted up by a housewife with a penchant for purple. In fact, most of Dublin's accommodation seems to be engaged in some sort of Prince tribute. There's a pun in there about purple rain but that would be cheap. 
Looking for accommodation in Dublin was disappointing and depressing",3,2016,06,12
237,"One issue, quickly resolved.","We stayed here for four nights.  The room was very comfortable.  The air conditioning struggled a bit to keep the room cool but keeping the drapes closed during the middle of the day helped.  At the bar one evening we felt a bit ignored.  To be fair they were busy while we were attempting to order our 2nd drink (which we never did as we needed to leave for our dinner reservation). Upon our return later that evening we opted for a night cap and the staff, realizing out earlier displeasure, went out of their way to apologize and proceeded to buy us 2 rounds on the house.",5,2016,06,12
237,Confortable as you are staying at home,Junior suites large and very confortable. The big shower is relaxing and very clean. Breakfast with a very good cappuccino and everything you want. Fitness center and very charming hall. The only little downside is the room key: you need it to go everywhere in the hotel. ,5,2016,06,12
237,Shelleyde,"Stayed at The Morrison for 2 weeks. The hotel was perfectly located to everything we wanted to visit. We actually were able to walk to most attractions/restaurants, but transportation was around the corner if needed. The staff was the friendliest we ever encountered at a hotel, from the front desk to housekeeping!! The rooms were roomy enough and very clean. The food was delicious! Room Service was very prompt and the food was hot and plentiful. We ate at The Morrison Grill twice and enjoyed our meals. Will stay at The Morrison on our next visit for sure :-)",5,2016,06,12
237,Comfortable Hotel in a Fantastic Location!,"My husband and I spent three nights here at the end if our trip of Ireland. I was feeling weary of travel when we arrived, but The Morrison and Dublin, one of my favorite cities, revived me. The hotel is very modern and trendy, but still very comfortable. The room was spotless and well-equipped (hair dryer, iron, plenty of soap, wash cloths, etc). We had a little bit of noise the first night, but otherwise our stay was quiet. I did select a higher floor when I did I one check-in because of noise complainants in other reviews. My husband has HHonors Diamond status so breakfast was included. We could even order off the menu instead of eating the buffet! That was a nice treat after days and days of breakfast buffets! The hotel is easy walking distance from most of the major attractions as well as shopping and restaurants. The nightly rate is quite high, but if you're looking to use HHonors point for a hotel stay in Dublin, I highly recommend The Morrison.",5,2016,06,12
237,Comfortable stay,"Overall a good experience, however the street noise was a bit bothersome (could be the late partying because of the long June days).  Very good room service and a nice breakfast buffet.  I did find the rooms a bit sterile in design.",4,2016,06,11
237,Would stay again,"This well-located hotel is upscale, clean, roomy and has excellent food service. Within walking distance to everything, near the trains and far enough from the tourist areas to be quiet.  Excellent breakfasts!

Our room overlooked the Liffey River. The hotel staff were extremely helpful, and the walk to the trains was just two minutes. There are many restaurants, museums, parks and libraries to explore nearby. ",5,2016,06,11
237,Exceeded all expectations,"As an American traveling to Europe for the first time, I was somewhat concerned about the hotel situation.  The Morrison quickly assured me that I had no reason to fear.  This is a fantastic hotel, great staff (at hotel as well as bar/restaurant).  As a Hilton Honors member I was fortunate enough to be upgraded to a suite with a river view.  Very spacious, clean and well equipped.  On top of all of this, I couldn't have asked for a better location. Right across the river from Temple Bar, short walk to Trinity College and St Stephen's Green.",5,2016,06,10
237,Dublin Vacation,"Loved this hotel, the location was excellent - along the river, very close to Temple bar area. The room was very nicely decorated. Loved the huge bathtub. We enjoyed the bar and the food. The front desk staff was efficient, friendly and helpful. We would stay again.",5,2016,06,10
237,Pretending to be something it NEVER could be!,"This hotel was not inexpensive.  It had no sign out front indicating it was a hotel.  It was almost as if the Doubletree brand wanted nothing to do with it.  The unprofessional reception staff was consistent...all they could ever manage was a shrug of their shoulders.  The design was supposed to minimal, but it was simply cheap.  I asked about why they provided only one bathrobe in the room with two guests, and the receptionist said ""that is our standard policy""...and then shrugged the famous ""Morrison shrug"".  The room was clean, but was so minimal it left almost nothing to clean.  The bathroom sink did not drain.  YUK!
They even recommended a restaurant that was so bad, we later asked our on/off bus guide, Ian about it...and he said that the place they sent us was known to be disgusting.
The best person we dealt with was a young lad who was the concierge.
The location was within walkable distance to everything, but the shouting and screaming, car alarms going off, and deliveries through the night on the streets outside made sleeping a challenge.  Parking was expensive, but they do validate to reduce the rate.",1,2016,06,10
237,Very nice hotel,"This is the first time I had stayed at the Morrison hotel. I visit Dublin regularly and will certainly look to stay here is the future. 

The hotel is very well located for local bars and restaurants and the Luas line is very close.

The room I stayed in was very big, clean, bright and well kept. I felt very comfortable in the hotel and the staff were very helpful and friendly.

I would recommend this hotel for business or leisure and will certainly stay there again in the future.",4,2016,06,08
237,stay at the morrisson,"stayed for a family wedding, lovely hotel however the provision of alcohol beverages was poor for example coors light and other beers.  Room was very nice and bed was decent quality.  Location was very central - obviously the views from the hotel were poor as it is in the city.  The service was good and the staff were efficient and friendly.  Would stay again if the price was right",4,2016,06,07
237,Wonderful Dublin Hotel,"My husband & I stayed in the Double Tree Hilton in Dublin for a family wedding.  We were most impressed by the service, friendliness & helpfulness of all the staff. It is a lovely hotel, bedrooms excellent & fitted out with everything we needed.",5,2016,06,06
237,Trendy hotel in a great location,"Stayed at this hotel on a short weekend break.

We arrived early and the staff did all they could to get us a serviced room. They also recognised that the room we had been allocated would be noisy because of an event being run that evening

They found us another room - which turned out to be spacious and modern

Breakfast was good - with a good selection of local dishes

All,in all a great stay!",5,2016,06,04
237,Very average,"I'm not sure why this hotel rates so well. The biggest positive is that the staff is very nice. The bed wasn't very comfortable. The hotel feels dated and overcompensates with purple lighting everywhere, which made it feel hokey vs. cool. Location is good and right across the river from the Temple Bar district. The bathroom setup is really strange, especially for the location of the toilet. Shower was really mediocre. I would look at other options on my next stay to Dublin. ",3,2016,06,04
237,Great location in Dublin,The Morrison is located in the heart of Dublin. The hotel is exquisite and offers anything you could ask for. Service at this hotel is equivalent to any 5 star hotel you could ever stay in. Breakfast has an awesome selection for travelers from any part of the world. We will define til stay here on our next trip to Dublin. ,5,2016,06,03
237,Happiest staff ever,"Incredible breakfast last week,met the nicest staff ever,such a nice morning,all thanks to them.Ill definately be back .They could not do enough for us.They made my Auntss 80th birthday breakfast super special.Have never met such staff that could be so attentive.Highly reccomend it",5,2016,06,03
237,Great Place,The staff was amazing especially Adam.  Very helpful.  Room is clean and very pretty.  Never experienced better service anywhere.  We really had such a wonderful time here.  Also the location is excellent.  Near everything.,5,2016,06,03
237,Great cookies.  Great Location.,"Greeted upon a check-in with a mouth watering freshly baked cookie at this superbly located hotel.  Ideal for exploring the city during our short but comfortable stay.

Reception staff were very friendly, helpful and personable which couldn't be said for the breakfast staff.  Maybe they were demotivated as the tables in the morning were lacking the evening tableware of illuminated pink phallic lanterns.  The buffet style breakfast was plentiful and offered many variants.  Tasty.

Rooms decent sized with ludicrously sleep easy pillows however my mezzanine rooms air con didn't appear to fully function.

Overall a decent hotel and would return even if only for the arrival cookie.",4,2016,06,03
237,"Modern, quiet hotel","Hotel staff nice and friendly and when checking in we got a warm homemade cookie just perfect after the trip out from the airport. Very modern and clean hotel and a great super king bed to boot.  Hotel overlooks the Liffey although we didn't have a river view.  Nice and quiet location although it does sit on a one way street which can get very busy.  All mod cons provided along with toiletries as you would expect from a quality hotel chain.  Room also has a safe meaning you could leave valuables/passport etc.  Hotel bar is nice and not too pricey, didn't try the grill restaurant, but it was quite busy over the weekend.  Did have breakfast one morning at 16.50 euro, little steep but you do have lots of choice.  Would certainly consider staying here again.",4,2016,06,03
237,Good location  Great staff,"We stayed for two nights and were very satisfied.  The hotel has a great central location in Dublin.  The price is not out of line with center city hotels.  There are several nearby places for breakfast if you don't want to pay the somewhat high price for breakfast at the hotel.  The decor was contemporary which usually I'd not my thing, but this was done quite well and we enjoyed it.  The biggest asset is the fantastic staff.  We were warmly greeted, and the staff was quite helpful with local places.  They gave us information for a place to get laundry done, which was a help.  The room was spotless and the cleaning efficient and well done.  Great place to stay.",5,2016,06,02
237,"Great Stay, Well Located.","The Morrison Hotel is a very nice hotel with nice amenities. They have a delicious breakfast buffet and they have a super friendly, helpful staff. Highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in Dublin. Short walk to most areas and attractions.",5,2016,06,02
237,Great location for a weekend away!,"Was really impressed with The Morrison Hotel. Located ideally in the centre of Dublin's tourist attractions we were able to walk to a number of attractions. The Hotel was very secure, staff seemed vigilant and had a number of security measures to prevent un-authorised access to guest rooms. Our bedroom had a balcony which was great and gave a bit of extra space. Impressive breakfast with a buffet and a la carte breakfast menu!",5,2016,06,02
237,Very nice hotek,"The hotel is situated along the canal and for the price is a very good value kn Dublin! I have been to quite a few and always disappointed but NOT this time :) 
Very spacious and clean rooms, beautiful entrance, very helpful staff. 
If you book in advance, make sure to ask for a room with river view as they go very quickly! ",5,2016,06,02
237,Great location just a bridge away from Temple Bar,The hotel is very modern with cozy rooms; the staff is nice. The location could not be better; in the center of the city and just a minute away from busy Temple Bar. The only problem we experienced was the air conditioning system which did not work too well.,4,2016,06,01
237,I've always wanted to stay at the Morrison,"Comfortable tastefully decorated room. It even had a pleasant view, which is unusual for a inner city hotel. The warm cookie on arrival was delicious & staff were pleasant and helpful. The Morrison is ideally situated in a great location with easy access to the Jervis Shopping Centre, Henry St shops and restaurants and South of the Liffey. We really enjoyed our stay at the Morrison",5,2016,05,31
237,Great stay,Pretty faultless experience. Got to choose room with digital check in. Clean and odourless room. Good quality sheets and amenities. Lunch at the Grill was great. In room breakfast a treat. Smooth checkout. ,5,2016,05,30
237,Would highly recommend,Stayed here last night and couldnt of asked for better...checked in and was given free cookies which wer delicious...room was lovely and breakfast was amazing. A great choice of foods ans great service throughtout!!,5,2016,05,30
237,"Location, Location, Location","The location could not have been better, and the staff could not have been more helpful and friendly.  We arrived very early in the morning and could not check in, but when we returned from exploring later that afternoon, the front desk already knew who were were, handed us the keys, and our bags were already waiting for us in our room.  I would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay there again if we go back to Dublin.",5,2016,05,30
237,Fabulous! ,"Recently stayed for the Bruce Springsteen concert and have felt completely pampered by the Morison from start to finish! Warm cookies upon arrival, Amazing breakfast and Gary the bartender! What more could you want? Big shout out to gary again! He was an absolute star. 

Jess & Eugene ",5,2016,05,30
237,Great wedding venue,"Attended my brothers wedding here and was really impressed. The service provided by the team at the hotel was excellent throughout the day. The food, especially given it was a wedding, was excellent too.
Rooms are a bit small but that is to be expected in any city centre hotel, particularly one located in the heart of the city like this one.",4,2016,05,29
237,Excellent hotel,"Great location, very comfortable, excellent food and service.  Great breakfast buffet and service. Coffee was fresh and many food items to chose. Quiet and large rooms with nice amenities.  Clean and nice decor. ",5,2016,05,29
237,Fabulous hotel,Second visit to The Morrison.  Fantastic hotel.  Staff are friendly and very helpful.  Had a lovely selection of cakes delivered to the room for our anniversary and a round of drinks.  Lovely touch. You simply must stay here if you visit Dublin.  Perfect! We will be back 😀,5,2016,05,28
237,"Nice, functional but noisy","One night  in this hotel located closed to the city center. Huge and nice restaurant made for young people (lot odd screens, large bar, table we can share....), good food including a. Ice and spicy Nasir goring, good service, efficient. However in such place I was expecting restaurant to serve food after 10Pm. Standard room with. O charm but the basic facilities. Front desk with poor welcome behaviors (in fact terrible). Noisy room due to the neighbor door making a lot of noise when leaving or entering the room. Expensive hotel but overall ok. Little thing could improve dramatically the overall assessment.",4,2016,05,27
237,Location,This hotel is very nice and the location can't be better.  You only Ned to cross the bridge in front of the hotel to be in the Temple Bar area with all restaurants and bars.   I had dinner at The Schack and it was excellent.  Ireland is a country with happy people amid their problems.,4,2016,05,27
237,Sales meeting ,Good location in downtown Dublin. It was very nice to be able to walk around town and see most of the important sites and be close to nice restaurants. The hotel rooms were nice and I really enjoyed the inclusive breakfast. Have a nice small restaurant for lunch is in the bar is great to catch a drink or two. The Internet like too many hotels is really pretty poor connection,4,2016,05,26
237,Over rated and over priced!,What a crap hotel!  Definitely not a 4 star.  The rooms are small and so are the bathrooms.  I was in room 407 and felt boxed in.  The window is small and overlooks nothing but back of neighbouring building walls and garbage! Hated it!  The curtains were small for the window and did not shut the light out. The wifi is a joke - it has zero upload speed and works worse than a dial up.  I was there for 4 nights and just could not work!  In the end I just tethered with my iPhone network which was a thousand times faster!  Honestly who in this day and age and especially an Hilton have crap wifi like this??  Ordered room service and got overcharged and also got charged for a phone call that I never made - infact it was to room service!!!  So not impressed - wasted a €1100 - feel gutted.  I will just stick to Marriotts - a much better and reliable brand.  It Tilly ruined my trip to Dublin.,1,2016,05,26
237,The Morrison Hotel - Excellent Place,"This was our first trip to Ireland and our stay at The Morrison was great. I was only a little disappointed with the recent renovations. I don't know what it looked like before, but I was hoping for a quaint hotel atmosphere. This is very modernistic. The staff was friendly and helpful whenever we asked them about anything. The concierge helped us with day trips, too. I was most impressed by their breakfast buffet, though. I've NEVER seen a bkfst buffet with so many choices, and they even had fresh green juices and smoothies. They also make their own yogurt on site. Wonderful place, right across from Liffy Bridge, the heart of Dublin, so many sights within walking distance.  Awesome time and we hope to return someday.",5,2016,05,26
237,Our Stay in Dublin ,"Excellent hotel in a wonderful downtown location! The staff were friendly and always helpful. The rooms were large enough, impeccably clean and comfortable. We also enjoyed the cocktail lounge and the breakfast arrangement. Stayed five nights and would definitely come back whenever we return to Dublin.     Ross S.",5,2016,05,25
237,Doubletree quality with a central location,"We had hassle-free check-in, a clean room decorated fabulously with modern accoutrements, and all the quality and touches you expect from a Doubletree or Hilton property.  Though the hotel is technically on the ""north"" side of the river Liffney, that's not a problem because (a) it's right next to two pedestrian bridges, putting all the fun stuff in the South just a few steps away, and (b) the north has plenty of interesting things to see and do as well.

One tiny quirk:  Some rooms require you to take four or five steps upward, which can be a pain when you are lugging a heavy suitcase.",5,2016,05,24
237,What a beautiful hotel.,"Hi everyone. This was my first time at this hotel recommended by a friend. Well it's a true old saying ""you pay for what you get"". Fabulous boutique hotel in the centre of Dublin. So close to all amenities, tourist attractions , Ate in the hotel which was a beautiful experience not to missed. Highly compliment our waiter Mark who went above all to help and welcome. 
His Customer service is extraordinarily. Well done. Most certainly will be returning to this hotel. ",5,2016,05,24
237,Outstanding. ,"The hotel was first class. The venue is perfect. Just across from the Temple Bar area. Plenty of places to go and see and allot of them are in walkable distance from the hotel. The hotel is just great. Absolutely spotless. The room is spacious, well presented and modern. Nice bathroom area with bath and separate shower. Will be stopping here again next time I'm over the water. Well done guys. ",5,2016,05,24
237,Perfect central,"As other write, - warm welcom. Nice room with all caind of service including wather in a small bottel. The and coffe facilities and Safe box included. A peace of fruit would have been welcom. Noise from the street and aircondition a minor problem.",4,2016,05,24
237,Dublin May 2016,"The Morrison was a very trendy and sophisticated hotel, centrally located in Dublin. Very nice place to stay, clean and cool. The only thing is with the jet lag I could have used more coffee in my room! Otherwise, the hotel was great and the staff needs to be cloned and sent around the world to train others. They were amazingly nice and caring.",4,2016,05,23
237,"Morrison Double Tree, Dublin","Excellent hotel, great location, near Temple Bar but far enough away not to hear the noise, great view of river, very friendly and helpful staff.  Many eating places in area.  I am Hilton diamond and got free breakfast.  Buffet and/or order off of the menu.",5,2016,05,23
237,Nice place in a great location,"This is a very modern hotel right along the river and very close to Temple Bar and the Ha'Penny Bridge, so a great location.  Rooms were nice, although no view.  Pricey considering no breakfast included.",4,2016,05,21
237,A great start to our Irish Vacation!!,"The Morrison was a great way to kick off our 10 day trip around Southern Ireland. The staff made it worry free, and the breakfast and rooms are top notch. I highly recommend the Mortison if staying in downtown Dublin!!! I will be back !!",5,2016,05,21
237,Way too expensive,Location is excellent; nice staff; quality of breakfast is very good. Bar area is very nice. Menu in bar is good and good bar service. But price would disencourage me. I would suggest a review of price. ,5,2016,05,21
237,Well located hotel,"I've stayed here several times on business. The hotel is nice, rooms are a good size, and the wifi is reliable and a decent speed.

Staff are always friendly and I've never had to queue to check in or check out.

One minor grumble is breakfast can be very busy so sometimes the staff are overrun and it takes a while to get served.",5,2016,05,20
237,"A wonderful artistc hotel, located on the Liffey River!","Such a welcoming hotel in the heart of Dublin on the banks of the Liffet, close to all attractions! Very friendly and efficient staff, in an historic building with interesting artistic details! We would definitely like to return to the Morrison!",5,2016,05,19
237,Faultless Hotel.,"From the moment we arrived, nothing was to much trouble, booked a twin by mistake and they changed it straight away. Staff were very helpful and made us feel welcome. Room was very clean and comfortable. Would return in a heart beat. ",5,2016,05,19
237,Walkable to everything in Dublin City Centre,"As an ex-resident of Dublin, I choose location carefully whenever I'm back visiting the city. The Morrison provides excellent walkable access to the shopping district around Henry Street / Jervis Street as well as being a short stroll across the river from Temple Bar, Grafton Street and St. Stephens's Green. It's a good alternative to staying in Temple Bar with all the overpriced bars, restaurants and overcrowding that entails. 

Extremely comfortable room, with full climate control - not always guaranteed in Dublin. Very large and well appointed with modern decor.  Internet connectivity was solid, and very usable desk provided for work.

They have a parking deal with the garage next door. Very handy, but check tarrifs carefully - for a short overnight stay the garage rates may be better than the hotel's deal. 

Definitely a solid option for Dublin City.",5,2016,05,17
237,Love this hotel - easy access to all of Dublin,"We booked 10 rooms for a group of us travelling from Vancouver...check-in was quick, with a lovely warm cookie on arrival.  Adam and Darren were so helpful directions, restaurant recommendations and transportation options.  Rooms were spacious (especially compared to the London hotel we had stayed in), well appointed and the bed was very comfortable. There was a wedding in the hotel on my last night and the hotel delivered letters to each room to warn about possible noise.  It was not unbearable from my room.  I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to others.",5,2016,05,17
237,Great staff," Great location on the river across from Temple Bar. Took airport bus to O'Connell Street and walked 5 minutes to hotel.  Had a spacious room with all the amenities. Excellent breakfast buffet.  Most notable was the gracious and professional staff.",5,2016,05,17
237,Location Location Lux,"Right on the river, a short stroll to the Temple Bar area with all the drink, food and music to stun a leprichan with short arms and deep pockets. Hotel was very welcoming complete with a warm cookie at checkin",4,2016,05,17
237,Would definitely return,Very comfortable. Stayed in suite 335. Very comfortable and quiet. Great location. Darren was great and very accommodating. Within walking distance to everything. Food was good. Definitely would go back ,5,2016,05,16
237,Great hotel with friendly and efficient staff,"Stayed two nights in this hotel while starting a tour of Ireland. From the minute we checked in the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. Especially Adam and Darren at the front desk and Lewis in the restaurant. 
Parking is a block away but that is nothing in Dublin. Parking to unload is hit and miss but double parking is almost the norm!  Hotel is just across the river from Temple Bar and there is a foot bridge within a few yards. 
This is a very modern hotel so don't expect quaint Irish surroundings. Rooms are high tech which may take some help in understanding. But the staff are more than happy to explain things.
Bar is well stocked and restaurant has a great menu. Excellent prep and presentation. I would certainly recommend to anyone spending time in the city.   ",5,2016,05,14
237,Just average,"Booked a deluxe room on hotels.com. 
Hallway to the room was hot and musty really needed ventilation.
The Deluxe room should be bigger than a standard room. Room was small and stuffy. Cooling did not work, opened the window into the noisy laneway to cool the room and put up with the street noise until it died off in the small hours. 
The firm King bed is ok for 1 night but no where near good enough for a AU$440/per night with breakfast room.
The shower was good, but toilet is kind of weird small low commode like something from a kindergarten. Room has basic jug & sachet tea & coffee facilities.
Breakfast is a reasonably good standard with great barista coffee and offers of an a la carte service or buffet. 
Overnight Self parking is a 2 minute walk 8 euro if parking after 6pm and leaving before 10am.
The location. Is excellent, Temple bar district straight across the rivers Millennium bridge 2mins walk from the hotel.
Would I recommend staying? No. (You might consider it at around 180-200euro but not 267)
This hotel is Overpriced for the room size and bed comfort.
Next time we're in Dublin the choice will be to walk a bit further and get more comfort for our hard-earned $. For me 6/10.",3,2016,05,14
237,Break in Dublin,"An excellent hotel, very comfortable, centrally located and within walking distance of most places of interests and bus stop from airport. The staff are extremely helpful, friendly and knowledgeable with suggestions of places to visit, restaurants etc to suit our particular interests. Highly recommended!",5,2016,05,14
237,Oasis in Dublin,"The hotel was a welcome respite after a long day of flying. The atmosphere was spa-like, and the location very convenient. The staff was especially gracious, helping us find our lost luggage on the flight over.",5,2016,05,12
237,Second Time Stay,"Our second stay at The Morrison was just as perfect as the first time we stayed!  The front desk staff are warm, friendly, and knowledgable, and our favorite concierge, Adam, was there to accommodate all of our requests and inquiries without hesitation and flawless execution!  The buffet breakfast had a wide variety of selections to choose from and all were delicious!  Our room was spacious and very clean and comfortable.  The hotel's central location makes all of Dublin's many attractions all the more accessible.  I would highly recommend The Morrison as a first choice, and I look forward to one day returning for another great stay!",5,2016,05,11
237,Good location,"Booked based on consistent positive trip advisor reviews. 
Pros:  Good location, just walk across bridge to center of town.  Staff friendly & nice. 
Cons:  Room too hot, a/c not working well and Need towel/clothes hooks in bathroom. ",3,2016,05,11
237,Excellent hotel with fantastic staff,"Stayed at the Morrison for wedding anniversary and couldn't have cannot fault the hotel or its staff. 

From the moment we checked in we were made to feel welcome and special. The receptionist chatted to us about our stay whilst we enjoyed a complimentary warm cookie, gave us a map of the city then sent up Prosecco to our room. 

The room was well equipped, clean and in a great position in the hotel for us - didn't hear a thing from other rooms or the street!

We ate in the Morrison grill which was brilliant with live music as an added bonus. During the meal the waiter brought over several more glasses of prosecco which was most welcome and then a plate with happy anniversary written in chocolate sauce (see photo). 

Every member of staff is a credit to the hotel. 

Would highly recommend to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2016,05,11
237,Great Location/Great Service,"On a business trip to Dublin for 24 days, and stayed at the Morrison. Staff was always very friendly and helpful.  Room was always clean.  Food was good.  Occasionally on a Saturday or Sunday night, you could hear loud people leaving the Temple Bar area around 2am.  But this only occurred twice in my entire stay.",4,2016,05,10
237,A pleasant stay!,"Stayed at the Morrison Hotel on the front end of our trip to Ireland (2 nights) in a junior suite facing the Liffey river and in room #419 (king bed on the top floor) on the back end for another 2 nights. Both rooms were very nice, bright and spacious enough. The suite was obviously nicer with hard wood floors and more spacious but #419 had big windows, decent city view and all around a better value. The staff were all very friendly and accommodating. Special thanks to Darren for all his insights and the managers Maria and Alicja who was especially helpful in arranging a flawless and worryfree car rental agreement with Hertz and with the car delivered at the hotel. 

The location of the hotel is great within a walking distance from all the key points of interest, bars and restaurants i.e Trinity college, the Temple area, shopping areas, St. Patrick's Cathedral etc. The breakfast was good and in order for the value for money equation to be right, it should be included in the price. All in all, a great stay and would come back. The staff with their positive attitude make all the difference!",4,2016,05,09
237,Terrific location for your Dublin vacation,"I just returned from a 4-day stay at the Morrison in Dublin.  It's a perfect location, only a couple of blocks from O'Connell Street and right on the Liffey.  (Note: The entrance to the hotel is actually on the side street Swifts Row.)  The staff were very friendly and accommodating, and the hotel is modern and comfortable with free wifi.  I actually changed rooms after the first night, because my initial room didn't have sufficient lighting, an accessible outlet, or a towel rack; the staff were quick to acknowledge the issues and moved me to another, suitable room.  I used the Morrison as a base for my extensive sightseeing (mostly walking) all around the city and a couple of day trips (by bus).  The Morrison's breakfast was excellent, including a buffet and made-to-order items.  I also used the gym daily; it's open 24 hours, with treadmills, a bike, elliptical, and step machine, as well as free weights.  I would highly recommend the Morrison for your Dublin stay!",4,2016,05,08
237,Great stay,"Friendly professional staff, great location and amenities. Would highly recommend for anyone traveling to Dublin, close to all local hangouts and restaurants and pubs, lots of pubs. Will travel back again soon.",5,2016,05,08
237,Great overall experience,"We had a great 5 nights stay here.

My request for a room with view was taken note, and lucky us was assigned with one upon arrival. Unfortunately the offer to prioritise our room for early check-in was not materialised. Would have been awesome if we get to freshen up after travelling for over 15hours. However, they did remember that we were celebrating a birthday & had brought up 2 glasses of Prosecco shortly after we have access to the room.

Reception kept our luggages, offered us the standard cookie.  Would have been nice if reception would offer water and maps during the check-in, knowing that we can't access the guest room for another 3hours or so.

Room is large and well furnished. No photos taken because it looks just like the photos on the official website. Toilet is big as well. Bed is a little hard to our liking (we prefer plushy tops) but it's fine. Room with a view of Liffey is lovely, but noise from the traffic & party goers can be rather disturbing even with the window closed & curtains drawn. Suggest light sleepers to forgo the view, cos I myself is a heavy sleeper and was awakened by the shoutings of party goers (at 2am) twice.

Breakfast at the Halo Restaurant was awesome. Special mention for The Berry Bomb & the cooked to order Eggs Benedict - best we ever had, cooked to perfection. The Guinness Bread was lovely too. The kitchen was very accomodating to let me order eggs cooked to my liking that were off the menu. 

Location is excellent be it for shopping, pubs, restaurants or attractions. Oh, do note that the luggage friendly entrance is located along Swift Row, not the one facing River Liffey (you have a couple of stairs to maneuver if enter from here). 

Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin city!",5,2016,05,06
237,Perfect Location in Dublin,We stayed here for nine nights. We were using hotel points so our stay was free! The best part of this stay was our free Hilton Honors status which gave us free breakfasts each morning. The hotel is lovely although very modern. The location is perfect as it over looks the river and everything is so close. On both sides of the river are the main attractions. We spent our days wandering the city and didn't need mass transit for the places we wanted to see. We did take tours out of the city and the tour bus pickups were about a 15 minute walk. I highly recommend this place! The food was great and very friendly and helpful staff. ,4,2016,05,06
237,Gorgeous Hotel,The Morrison Hotel is fantastic! I highly recommend it! The rooms are fantastic; contemporary with the latest modern features/conveniences and extremely clean. The breakfast is a must- they make great cappuccino's!,5,2016,05,06
237,Anniversary,"We had a wonderful time at this hotel. Great staff, great location, great food, beautiful decor. Couldn't recommend it more highly... Had our wedding here and it was a memorable day. Will hopefully make it back next year.",5,2016,05,04
237,Best Hotel in Dublin City Centre,"I took my girlfriend for her 18th birthday and upon entry to our room there was a plate with happy birthday in chocolate writing and cake assortments on it shortly after a man with champagne knocked and said happy birthday to her overall the arrival service was brilliant and we were made to feel welcome... The hotel is just a stones throw away from temple bar, the local shopping outlet, restaurants and the tour bus locations so there's no real need to waste money on taxis the beds were comfortable the lighting in rooms were great, the restroom facilities were good the tv had all the channels you needed the view was lovely I honestly don't know how this hotel is not a 5* hotel just overall a brilliant experience and will definetely be back",5,2016,05,04
237,Perfect Location and Amazing Staff,"This hotel is amazing! There is nothing bad I can say! Right when we got in, we were treated like royalty. Our luggage was lost with the airline and the hotel staff told us to remind them when we came back to check in so they can call to make sure our luggage would arrive as we were leaving the next day. They offered us water and warm cookies to start our adventure to the city. They gave us a map and told us the hot spots and the quickest way to the Guinness storehouse. Our room was AMAZING! We ended up with the suite on the 4th floor. The bed was comfortable and the sitting area was just as nice. The bathroom was huge and had the biggest soaker bathtub where my husband and I both fit in comfortably! The brought the luggage to our room and we actually forgot about reminding them! They went above and beyond our expectations! We will be staying with them again!",5,2016,05,03
237,Chic / Clean / Comfotable,"Just a quick weekend in Dublin and cannot fault anything in the hotel really.

- Spacious and stylish lobby
- Trendy bar and when we sat down within 5 mins 3 bartenders came over to take our order - that must be a record!  Usually hotel bars are not this well staffed.
- Large room with great storage and nice modern deco
- Staff all very friendly and fast no matter what you ask for
- Great location moments from Temple bar but not to close to hear the noise

We would not return to Dublin but would visit another member of this hotel chain.",4,2016,05,03
237,Perfect Location & Service,"Situated on the Liffey, this hotel could not be in a better location. It gives easy access to anywhere you could want to go (and also several bus stops are nearby if you want to go farther). The staff is friendly, courteous, and will do anything for you without blinking or making you feel like you are imposing. Our room was on the first floor but you never had any noise from outside, and it was without a doubt the cleanest, most comfortable room I've ever stayed in. The shower had excellent water pressure for a hotel. The beds were comfortable. The wifi was great. I look forward to staying here again sometime in the future.",5,2016,05,02
237,Amazing as always,Love this hotel! Would not stay anywhere else in Dublin! From moment you walk in the door the staff couldn't be nicer and the rooms are fabulous with everything thought of. Wonderful hotel recommend to everyone!!! ,5,2016,05,02
237,A relaxing and comfortable hotel,"My wife and I spent 4 nights in The Morrison and we have rarely encountered such a friendly and helpful staff. Our room was spacious with an interesting and innovative decor.  It was well-appointed and the bed was particularly comfortable. The view across the Liffy helped to make you feel you were in the heart of the city. Its  location was ideal for exploring the city and the various forms of transport were close at hand. A bonus was the excellent choice at the buffet for breakfast. We would recommend the Morrison to anyone looking for a first-class hotel in the centre of Dublin. 

 ",5,2016,05,01
237,Hilton efficiency plus Irish friendliness in a great location!,"Wonderful stay--great staff, new property, awesome location right on the Liffey across from Temple Bar but perfectly quiet for sleeping. Breakfast was great and the gym is perfectly useful. Will definitely be back.",5,2016,05,01
237,Extremely pleasantly surprised!,"We stayed at the Morrison for 2 nights when we arrived to Dublin, and also the last night before we departed home to the states. I admit I chose it based on the fact that it was Hilton affiliated (we are HGVC owners as well as HHonors members). This was my first time in Europe, so I was admittedly taken aback when we pulled up to a quaint appearing small hotel that was not very clearly marked. We drove around the block and then parked in the Jervis street parking garage...and that was where my frustration ended. 

We were immediately greeted by friendly staff, check in was a breeze, and given their signature warm welcome cookie. We had taken the red eye in from NY and being 10am, our room wasn't yet ready. The bellman happily held our luggage for us while we began to explore Dublin. When we came back to get into our room, we were pleasantly surprised to find ourselves upgraded to a one-bedroom suite overlooking the River Liffey - beautiful view! 

The location can't be beat. Right on the River Liffey, situation in front of a bridge to cross over and walk right into the Temple Bar area. We walked almost everywhere in Dublin from here, including the Guinness Storehouse, museums, open air shopping, and restaurants. You really don't need to rent a car if you aren't planning to travel out of Dublin. Despite the hotel being located in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the city, our room was perfectly quiet.

The decor of the hotel is ultra-modern, yet comfortable. The staff is TOP NOTCH. Everyone we encountered was friendly and made it their priority to make our stay perfect. The menu at the Morrison Grill was tempting, but we chose to dine out of the hotel.

This hotel is newly renovated, IMMACULATE (super important to me), and has 5 star service in my opinion. When I find myself in Dublin again, I will definitely be back.",5,2016,04,28
237,Above and beyond service ,"We called the front desk for milk for our coffee. They brought a fresh serving of milk instead of creamer. 

Breakfast was great. Tomatoes and mushroom were my favorites. The salmon was nice as well. It was good to be able to take breakfast back to my room also. 

We asked them to pop popcorn for us and it had burned. They offered French Fries for the inconvenience. 

They have warm gourmet cookies at the front desk that they happily gave us when we requested. 

The gym is spacious enough with water bottles and towels stocked. Entering with the keycard and not being bothered by attendants was a plus. Two TVs with remote controls also. 

Perfect location, just a bridge crossing away from temple bar, and 10-15 minute walk to the train station. ",5,2016,04,27
237,The Right Double Tree,"This hotel was a perfect trip for 3 nights in Dublin. Super modern, huge bedroom and excellent mod cons, we really enjoyed our stay. 
We arrived via the Air shuttle bus, however please note that there are 2 Double Trees in Dublin and the bus drop off is outside the other one which is the other side of town! Apparently reception tell us this happens alot so make sure you travel to the one overlooking the River Liffey, otherwise an extra taxi trip will be needed. 
The hotel is in an ideal spot for exploring Dublin and is over the river from Temple Bar but opposite enough to avoid the brawl of all the bars.
Breakfasts were divine and all staff were really accommodating and friendly. 
This is a really trendy hotel and perfect place for celebrating my husbands birthday.",5,2016,04,26
237,Very Nice Hotel in a great location,"Found this hotel online and it was perfect for our weekend stays in Dublin.  Easy access to the center of town and Temple Bar area is just across a small footbridge.  No need for a car, most sites are within walking distance, cab or bus.",5,2016,04,26
237,"Perfect Location, Perfect Staff","This hotel was just perfect for me my husband and 2 year old daughter. It was right by the river across from Temple Bar. walking distance to everything. the staff was absolutely accommodating and so friendly. from the second we walked in, they helped us park our car (even though they have no valet) found us a table at breakfast the next day, just smiles and genuine offers to help out all the time. the hotel itself is modern and clean. the windows open (we have a King w river view) bathroom clean, and the food at the adjoining restaurant and where breakfast is served is delicious. Highly recommend and would absolutely return.",5,2016,04,25
237,Wedding Anniversary,"Myself and my husband got married in The Morrison in April 2015 - such an amazing day from start to finish (I posted separate review from that experience). We came back to The Morrison to mark our 1st anniversary. We were kindly given an upgrade to a gorgeous Suite and the management had a lovely amenity waiting for us on arrival. We didn't dine in The Morrison on this occasion however when we returned for drinks following our meal the service was very efficient. There was a band playing in the bar on that night, they were very good, however one comment I would make is that they were a little bit loud, friends had come in to meet us and it wasn't the type of atmosphere that allowed us to have a conversation. On other occasions I have been in the bar and there is one singer and a guitar and this creates a lovely atmosphere. This is only one small point, overall the experience in the bar was excellent. We availed of breakfast in our room the following morning and it was delivered on time and was fresh with lots of choice. It was great to go back to the hotel were we hold so many happy memories. Thank you once again to all the staff.",5,2016,04,25
237,Great Place to Stay in Dublin,"The location of this hotel is perfect. It is a 2 block walk from the Temple Bar district. Hotel rooms are comfortable and cozy. The bed was a little firm but the pillows and comforters were amazingly soft. My husband and I both slept like babies. The bathrooms were spacious and clean. The fitness center was clean and had everything anyone but an Olympic weight lifter would need. The hotel bar was great! Lots of locals came in for drinks and the staff was incredibly friendly. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. However, it is incredibly expensive so if you are on a budget this is not the place for you.",5,2016,04,25
237,Very modern - Great location,"Hard to find anything negative to say about this hotel.  Except for one thing.  WOW it's expensive.  But the staff is fantastic, the decor is very modern.  It's within a short walk of several days worth of sights and attractions.",5,2016,04,25
237,decent place to stay,"Hotel staff super friendly, knew the city well giving directions how to get to different places. Would get a taxi for you if needed. Room was nice, only complaint would be the bathtub was a little high to get into.",5,2016,04,24
237,Nice hotel,"Nice hotel in a great location, We was Saint Patrick's Day ( whole week ) and very enjoyed our staying . Breakfast was awesome very like the personal menu also welcome cookie was great nice and tasty start. Tram station very close but the location is quite 5 minutes to The Temple bar. 
we had an Internet Wi-Fi issue and solved by the stuff. 
Will look forward for reserve the Doubletree hotel network around the globe and recommend my friends to stay at this hotel. 
Thanks",5,2016,04,24
237,Great location ,The hotel is in a great location in the heart of the city centre.  The hotel was clean and the front desk was helpful.  The rooms are very modern which I didn't mind.  The reason I give it a four was because I feel the bed's are pretty hard.  I have had much better sleep in other Hilton locations.  The mattress is on a platform with no box spring.  That may have been why the bed was uncomfortable.  You will find great places to shop and eat within a block of the hotel!,4,2016,04,23
237,"Great hotel, great location","The Morrison is steps away from Ha'Penny bridge which takes you across the river into the heart of Temple Bar area. But not so close that you have to deal with the noise or tourist crush. The rooms are a good size with everything you need. Breakfast comes with all the usual choices, and dinner has a couple of good options. If you want to get out, there are restaurants and bars all around. It is also 2 blocks away from Henry Street which is one of two main shopping streets in Dublin city center. I will definitely return. ",5,2016,04,23
237,Great location and hotel,"Stayed at the Doubletree Morrison for 3 nights. Great location, right in middle of city center with restaurants, bars and shopping. Friendly and helpful staff, good breakfast, good sized rooms, trendy hotel. Right across the street from the famous Temple Bar district. No need to rent a car. Use taxi, uber or public transport. Most places within walking distance unless you want to venture out of the area.",5,2016,04,22
237,Great hotel ,"We spent 2 nights here after a long flight from the US. We enjoyed comfortable, clean rooms,  extremely friendly and helpful staff, and an excellent location for exploring Dublin. We would definitely stay here again. ",5,2016,04,20
237,"My favorite hotel in Dublin, perfect location","This hotel has perfect location in the center of Dublin. It has really nice atmosphere, newly equiped rooms, friendly staff. Perfect services. Breakfast contains continental and full English breakfast option, conference rooms are spacious and catering provided is tasty.",5,2016,04,20
237,"Good location, Great people","Greeted with cookies and water even at 10:30 am when we arrived after an overnight flight from the US.  Great location within walking distance to the Temple Bar entertainment district.  Nice up-to-date rooms about the size of a standard US room.  Darren the concierge is as considerate to guests as anyone I've ever met, and is a terrific ambassador for Ireland and the Irish people! Can't comment about rates since this was a ""points"" stay, but we'd certainly come back!",5,2016,04,19
237,"Great hotel, wonderful location!","I was here on business and this was a fantastic hotel to stay at.  Very close to the heart of the Dublin - easy to get to Temple Bar area, Grafton street, etc.  The rooms were nice and spacious.  The one downside was I was on the 2nd floor and there was a party going on and it was quite loud and you can hear the DJ.  It is a smaller hotel so it's to be expected that you would probably hear music -- so if you are a light sleeper, I suggest asking for rooms in the higher floors.  Bed was great and nice clean modern style. I didn't see many kids at all -- it seemed to be catered more towards the business travelers.  Overall, loved the stay and would recommend again.",4,2016,04,18
237,"Perfect location, amazing decor, super friendly staff","Smack bang in the middle of the part of Dublin you 'want' to be in - it doesn't get better than the Morrison! We loved our stay - with warm cookies on arrival at reception! We were a bit early for check in, but were shown to our suite straight away - with breathtaking views over the Liffey - and a little side balcony. We were in heaven! The bathtub we divine and I loved the little extra touches like the bathrobe being tied up with a silver ribbon. The Morrison Grill downstairs is a bar/restaurant with some of the best cocktails we had - again with a great view of bustling Dublin. The meal we had in the restaurant was out of this world - and the service - and super friendly and happy. The Morrison gets the idea that you don't have to be 'snobby' when you have an amazing hotel! We stayed on for the live music and even danced a bit - and loved every minute of it! Bed was super comfy in our quiet room, and breakfast the next morning was WOW. Custom made barista coffee as standard with breakfast - and one to take away as we journeyed out to explore Dublin. We love the Morrison and can't wait to come back. Worth every penny and MORE! xx",5,2016,04,18
237,Great Central Hotel,"Fantastic location, central for everything. Good quality rooms, especially the views over the river. Very helpful staff, breakfast good in relaxed surroundings. Never felt rushed. Definitely stay again.",5,2016,04,18
237,Good quality hotel,"Nice hotel located reasonably downtown Dublin nicely, overlooking the river.
Rooms are clean and modern with good quality TV set and comfortable king size bed.
The staff is very kind and collaborative; likewise the other DoubleTree by Hilton Hotels  you get a warm chocolate cookie at time of the check-in",4,2016,04,16
237,THE MORRISON HOTEL DOUBLE TREE,"I recently went to Dublin.  I chose the Morrison Hotel.  If you want to be in downtown
in a walking distance to everything this is the place to stay.  The staff go above and beyond to be helpful to you.  Darren and Adam couldn't anymore helpful weather it was giving directions, helping to pick a tour.  The night before we left they weighed our
suitcases to make sure we weren't over 50 pounds.  We ate in the bar there and it was very good.  I would choose this hotel again and I wound recommend it to anyone going to Dublin.  It is close to Hueston station where we picked up two of our tours and a walking  distance to O'Connell Street where we picked up another tour.  It is also walking distance to the Temple Bar.",5,2016,04,16
237,You must stay here !!,"Fantastic service, very clean hotel definitely a 5* experience, food and drinks great, as a family we enjoyed every minute of being there from the pre-booking experience to the moment we left the hotel. The location is great for everything too! Highly recommended - we have been previously and it is just as good now it is a Hilton hotel as it was previously!",5,2016,04,16
237,Fantastic City Break,"We had a lovely stay here during our visit to Dublin. The staff were extremely welcoming, friendly and helpful. The room was bright and clean. Most importantly the location was perfect for us, minutes away from the temple bar area, the hop on hop off bus stop, shops and other attractions.",5,2016,04,14
237,"Excellent location, great staff","Great hotel opposite temple bar - handy for pubs etc but also getting to the arena and port areas. Modern clean room, bar looked great (didn't try it though), staff exceptionally helpful. Overall expensive, a good weekend treat but will book somewhere cheaper next time.",4,2016,04,13
237,Excellent Vacation!,"The staff and accommodations were fabulous. We loved the friendliness of the staff. Each staff member we interacted with went beyond expected to assist us with our questions, and provided excellent suggestions for our sightseeing, and travel.",5,2016,04,12
237,Top notch!,"Stayed here for two nights for my daughter's wedding - a fabulous day very well managed by Ross. Being more used to 'budget ' hotels, I was blown away by the attention to detail by the staff and the quality of the rooms (most of us were on the mezzanine level). The food from the bar was delicious (I could suggest more vegan/vegetarian options) and service from Mark, Adam, Gavin and Marcio deserve particular mention. And the wedding - and subsequent reception - was nothing short of perfect! An unfortunate mix up with the final bill for bride and groom was rather dampening but thank you for everything else!",5,2016,04,12
237,Great treatment and very convenient,"Hotel stands up to its class. Good personal treatment and can do attitude. Extremely capable staff that supports guests in a proactive way. Rooms were really nice and free internet connection was ok, although not the best I've experienced. Comfortable and close to city center.",4,2016,04,12
237,wedding bliss,"Stayed for my wedding. Not only us but all my guests were treated like royalty. Cannot recommend the hotel and staff highly enough, the little touches made us feel so special. Location is also spot on.",5,2016,04,12
237,Hilton The Morrison - Dublin (IRL),"Excellent service at the Morressy, staff going to ends to make your stay a customer experience. Rooms, neat, clean. Location near the city centre with only having to cross a bridge makes this an ideal place for a long weekend stay.",4,2016,04,11
237,Visit to Dublin,"Stayed 5/6 April. Fantastic hotel! Great location. Very clean & modern rooms. The man on reception couldn't have been more friendly and helpful, made us feel very welcome and that he would have done anything he could to help make our stay perfect, can't thank him enough. Would highly recommend this hotel and hope to return in the future.  ",5,2016,04,10
237,Never fails to delight,"Our third stay at The Morrison and it just gets better and better. Clean, central and relaxed, the food and accommodation are excellent but what makes this hotel particularly good is the level of customer care. Staff endeavour at all times to make sure guests are happy and individual needs are met. In manner staff are welcoming, pleasant, caring and efficient without being intrusive. Our first time visiting since my husband was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease, we found staff particularly understanding of and sensitive to his mobility needs without embarrassing him. So many superb staff in all areas of the hotel who deserve a personal mention. Whoever coordinates staff training and ethos should be delighted with the way staff dealt with us. We will be back! Oh.....don't forget to book in for the Gentleman's Afternoon Tea....a delicious twist on  a tasty treat.",5,2016,04,10
237,Concierge service let us down,"We spend two nights in the Morrison and it was the Easter-weekend of the 1916 celebrations. While the stay was average and ok the Hotel didn't manage to organize a taxi to the airport. Yes, it was an exceptional weekend but we were willing to walk several blocks (and did so in two different directions while finally being in a hurry) but they send us to the wrong place twice and after six phone-calls with the reception and their taxi-company we had to manage to find a cab ourselves (and despite some roads being blocked cabs could well reach all the locations we had been to ...).",2,2016,04,10
237,Great Location and Friendly Staff,"The Hotel is located just across the river opposite the Temple Bar area in Dublin, so you have easy access but away from the noise and the crowd. All the other areas like Grafton, Trinity College are all walking distance from the hotel. The staffs are very friendly and accommodating. The breakfast is excellent with a lot of choices including healthy options. I would definitely stay in this hotel again.",5,2016,04,10
237,The Morrison Doubletree,"The staff at The Morrison were very friendly, welcoming, and helpful. Whenever they saw us, they would ask if all was OK, and if there was anything they could do to help or to make our stay better. They genuinely cared.  If the opportunity arises, we will definitely stay at The Morrison again.",5,2016,04,09
237,"Great staff, service and location","I recently stayed here and I couldn't fault a thing even if I tried hard.   Helpful, friendly but professional staff, the location of the hotel and service levels collectively make this hotel a great choice. I will be back and I love the warm welcome cookie!",5,2016,04,08
237,Brilliant!!!,"My family and I stayed at the Morrison for three nights at the end of March and couldn't recommend it any more highly. All the staff, with a special shout out to Adam, we're so helpful, personable and obliging and the room and room service was perfect. The location was very central and the overall experience faultless. ",5,2016,04,05
237,Will be returning for sure! Best hotel Breakfast.,"I visited the Morrison for the weekend with a Hen party, it was also St Patricks weekend and the six nations (great weekend to go!)

The staff were so lovely, we were greeted with hot cookies and waters, which was 100% needed after our flight. the hotel was beautiful as well. 

Very clean, lovely modern rooms. So close to Temple bar. 

The food and drink was spot on - the cocktail 'Red velvet' IS AMAZING - I had about 10. 

The highlight was the breakfast! - Buffet breakfast, I would come back just for that!",5,2016,04,04
237,"Generally good, some minor issues.","The Morrison is located right in the heart of Dublin on the quays overlooking the Liffey.
Check-in was quick and efficient with friendly and polite staff, you get a chocolate chip cookie which my wife assured me was delicious.
The room was of average size and clean, the bathroom was larger than in most hotels, there was a large and comfortable bed and a decent size tv. There’s an in-room mini-bar and fridge containing the usual over-priced items.
Despite our room being opposite the lift, we heard very little noise from the corridor and adjoining rooms during our stay, so there is obviously good sound insulation. Our view was quite disappointing, overlooking Jervis street. I had hoped to overlook the Liffey but had forgotten to mention this at check-in.

The main reason I’m docking a star is due to the bar area. There’s a comprehensive cocktail list provided in the room and the Morrison’s website describe their bar as “Quay 14 is a cool, contemporary destination bar that offers an extensive drinks menu, specializing in cocktails, whiskeys and local craft beers”.
It sounded nice and we’d thought we head there for a post-concert cocktail as we were seeing Gregory Porter that evening. Unfortunately when we walked in we were greeted by a large gentleman with an acoustic guitar bellowing some god-awful chart hit into a microphone. It certainly wasn’t contemporary and was, I thought,  more suited to a Temple Bar drinking emporium. The juxtaposition between the concert we’d just attended and the bar ‘music’ was incredibly jarring. We left to find a quieter spot in the Italian quarter.

Breakfast the next morning was nice. Individual items can be ordered off the menu and there is a buffet containing the usual breakfast suspects. I had Eggs Florentine which were very nicely done, coffee was also freshly ground, but at €16.50 a head it’s not cheap.

In general, The Morrison was a positive experience, the bar was certainly a let-down and at the prices charged I feel there are a better value options available, but the staff, food and cleanliness of rooms were all exemplary.",4,2016,04,04
237,Great Location,"Check in staff were friendly.  We had to wait about 30 mins for our room and sat on the lounges in the foyer, which was comfortable, and we were given drinks while we waited.  
The location is very central and close to restaurants.  We ate in the hotel restaurant.  The food was good and the restaurant staff were friendly, but it was quite expensive.",4,2016,04,03
237,Excellent service.,"The staff at the Morrisson were helpful, friendly and efficient. To provide an example - during breakfast I had a slight tickle in my throat. The waitress without prompting came to my table, to give me a glass of water- this is just one of many examples.

The rooms were fresh and clean, breakfast was beautiful and location fantastic. Would definately recommend. ",5,2016,04,01
237,"Perfect location, walk to everything","The Morrison is ideally located along the Liffey just a couple of blocks from O'Connell Street and a short walk across the bridge to Temple Bar.  Is staying in Dublin, almost anything worth seeing is within walking distance.

We arrived early and the staff were able to get us a room without much of a delay despite being fully booked for the Easter 2016 celebrations.  

The rooms were spacious enough although a little cozy.

There is a restaurant and bar where we were able to get drinks by showing our room ky even on Good Friday.  The breakfast buffet is plentiful and the staff are happy to cook eggs to order instead of being stuck with the scrambled on the buffet. A nice touch is that they make the coffee fresh by the cup for each guest vs. simply placing a carafe on the table.

The Luas sop is a block away for venturing further out and it is easy to catch the airport bus a few blocks away on O'Connell Street.

The GPO, Glasnevin, Kilmainham, Temple Bar, St Stephens Green, Trinity college, etc. can all be easily walked to from here which makes the location well worth a few extra Euros for the close in location.",5,2016,04,01
237,"A great stay, wonderful staff.","The Morrison is a wonderful hotel in the center right on the river.  It was the week of St. Patrick's Day and our Airbnb fell through.  Being hilton honors members, we made our way to the hotel to see if they could help us out.  Not only did they find us three rooms, they made sure they booked at the lowest rate and even upgraded us.  
The three women at the front desk were professional but also extremely polite, welcoming us wonderfully and continuing to be warm throughout our stay.  The manager, Jane, was especially delightful.  She gave us tips on everywhere in town to go and even gave us the stories and folk lore of the establishments.  She went well beyond the call of duty.  The entire stand was always pleasant and accommodating.  
The rooms were also very nicely appointed and best of all, quiet.  The breakfast in the hotel was very good, thought the buffet much better then the dishes ordered.  
Overall a wonderful stay and could not have asked for more.",5,2016,04,01
237,"Comfortable, terrible wifi","Very comfortable, clean hotel with speedy and friendly room service.  Great bathroom with good lighting and nice products.  The wifi was so slow it was virtually unusable.  Really frustrating for a business trip.",3,2016,03,30
237,Strong selection for Dublin,"This hotel is in a great location. It is recently renovated so rooms are in great condition. Staff goes above and beyond, I could not be more pleased. 

Upon arrival we were given all of our Diamond benefits. Nothing was missed. They did charge €50 for a rollaway bed. Most hotels comp this but paying for the extra bed wasn't a big deal, especially given the upgrade to the river front suite. 

Cab fares from the airport weren't too expensive. €35 into town and €25 on the way out. 

I highly recommend the hotel restaurant. Maybe a bit on the expensive side for Dublin but the food was very good and service was superb. 

We would certainly stay here again. ",4,2016,03,30
237,Excellent hotel great location,"This is a great hotel in a wonderful location. Friendly staff who couldn't do enough to to help our stay. We go every year to Dublin and this will be our first hotel choice next year. 
Wonderful hotel, wonderful location, great staff. Great breakfast. 
The hotel bar is a great bar to start your evening and finish.",5,2016,03,30
237,Superb hotel stay,"It was our first trip to Dublin & we chose the Morrison hotel firstly by recommendation from our travel agent & secondly looking on trip advisor. It is situated in a perfect position overlooking the river Liffey you walk over the bridge & you are in the temple bar area. The welcome we received as soon as we got there was fantastic Darren is a fantastic asset to the hotel he makes you feel so welcome & knows the are so well he is hilarious with his tales he tells about local bars & people, thanks to him we had a fab time! The rooms are gorgeous & decorated very modern also they are kept really clean, we ate in the restaurant on Friday & special thanks to Lewis the manager who talked us through the menu & advised about the steak dishes of which my husband had the Rib eye on the bone & I had the fillet, both were cooked to perfection, we both agreed it was mouth-wateringly tasty. Our whole experience of the Easter weekend was something we will always treasure as we were fortunate enough to see the parade for the 1916 Easter Rising & felt incredibly privileged to be sharing this special time with all the thousands of people. The temple bar pubs are so much fun I wish we could bottle the atmosphere & bring it home with us, we had so much fun. Our thanks to all the staff at the Morrison Hotel & we hope to come back soon!!!",5,2016,03,30
237,Spoilt dog left at home again,"We enjoyed our stay although spoilt dog had to stay at home back in UK. Great location, close to many of the attractions in Dublin and all very easy to get to on foot. Helpful and cheerful staff, clean rooms (all white and very modern).  Bar was very busy on Easter Sunday and staff run off their feet but service remained courteous.",4,2016,03,30
237,"Great hotel, location and welcoming staff",The Morrison is a great hotel situated in central location. A warm cookie from reception on arrival made for a great start and the rest of the stay did not disappoint. Friendly staff and a nice hotel bar.,5,2016,03,30
237,Would definately recommend and stay here again!!,"We stayed here for 2 nights over Easter and we were not disappointed.  On arrival we were told we could not check in as the people before us had requested a late check out, (we had booked a junior suite) but were then upgraded to a suite, and OMG it was gorgeous!! So spacious, and would def recommend a suite/junior suite if relaxing is your thing-nice to chill out and have a drink/coffee etc.  Bathroom/shower was excellent (important to us) and bed was super comfy.  Location is perfect also, super close to O'Connell street and Temple bar area.  Overall an excellent hotel with friendly staff who are extremely helpful. ",5,2016,03,30
237,Lively and stylish Dublin stay,"Had a fantastic time in The Morrison in November and about to return for another weekend stay. The bar and grill restaurant are really welcoming and lively. There was live music on Saturday night which drew a big crowd to the bar. I liked the fact that it wasn't only guests there but also a 'destination' for other locals and tourists, many of whom probably wish they were staying there!
The rooms are simple and stylish with good lighting - innovative lighting is a theme throughout the hotel. Good bedding, shower room was spacious with nice toiletries.
I highly recommend the grill restaurant - we ate many things from the menu and all delicious. You know you're in Dublin because the staff in all areas are super friendly and made the whole experience of staying there special. They cannot do enough for you and, although I can't remember his name now, the older waiter in the grill/bar stood out as a true professional. He deals with every request easily and confidently and is a real asset to the hotel.
Nice touch to get complimentary freshly baked cookies at bedtime and checkout. 
Location is perfect - lots of shopping 2 mins walk away, restaurants, galleries, theatres and Temple Bar all within 5 mins walk. St Stephens Green and Grafton St about 10 mins walk . 
Glad to be returning this weekend for a shopping break with my Mum.",5,2016,03,30
237,COULDN'T BE BETTER!,"Excellent hotel in excellent location. Just a short walk over the bridge to Temple Bar.

237,Great Location,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and found it's locations to be ideal. It is directly across the river from the Temple Bar area with numerous bridhes to get over the river readily accesible. The hotel was clean, the room was fair size and the staff was exceptional. It is quite a long haul from the Airlink bus stop (hauling luggage) but we only had to make that trek twice. Otherwise, we walked everywhere and enjoyed our stay here.",4,2016,03,29
237,Extreme care in all areas,"We visited Dublin for two nights and stayed here. The staff was incredible (we love Adam!), the room was cozy and clean, and the breakfast was amazing. Located in the heart of the city, we found that helpful because we could walk everywhere and stop in to take a short nap or get freshened up for dinner. ",5,2016,03,28
237,You won't want to leave Dublin after staying here!,"I recently had the pleasure of spending three nights at the Morrison Hotel in Dublin and I enjoyed every minute of my visit.  Upon arriving I was greeted by an impressive staff who checked me in quickly, took my bags to my room, and provided maps and directions to local attractions.  I couldn’t imagine a better welcome than I received at the Morrison! Throughout my entire stay I was always warmly greeted, coming and going, and the staff worked exceedingly hard at making sure everything was perfect during my visit.

The hotel itself is very modern and stylish.  The lobby was spacious and had many inviting comfortable chairs and couches to relax in while waiting for the rest of my colleagues.  The rooms were clean and spacious, and I particularly loved their modern design and feel.  My room had an incredible view overlooking the River Liffey!  With its central location directly on the river, it was an easy 5 minute walk across the bridge to Temple Bar and many other sites of interest, and only a 2 minute walk to the nearest Tram stop.  Ideally located, it was easy to get anywhere around downtown Dublin from here.

I enjoyed two meals at the Morrison Grill and both times the food was excellent.  I also enjoyed a few pints at the Quay 14 Bar where the service was always quick and friendly.  A special treat for me each day was the wonderful breakfast bar at the Morrison.  Besides a wide-ranging selection of traditional breakfast items, they had an amazing selection of breads, juices, and coffees and teas as well.  I particularly enjoyed their fresh fruit smoothies (two flavors to choose from!) each morning.

As a former NASA astronaut and a veteran of four Space Shuttle missions, I have traveled around the world (both above it and down on the surface!) many, many times, and my experience at the Morrison Hotel ranks as one of the best in all my travels.  I’m looking forward to returning here once again so I can enjoy more of this beautiful city. 

Thanks again to the excellent staff for making my visit so special and memorable!",5,2016,03,28
237,Highly recommended,"This is my fourth time staying at the Morrison and it is always a great experience. Hotel is conveniently located, rooms & staff are terrific. It is close enough to Temple Bar without noise bleeding in and it is surrounded by great restaurants in the neighborhood ",5,2016,03,28
237,Quiet spot but close enough to noise!!,"Ideally located on the banks of the Liffey across from Temple Bar,.  Everything you could want close at hand.  Staff delightful, breakfast excellent with properly made coffee, espresso or whatever you liked.  Everything done with a smile.\Only blemish is that website illustration of bed rooms show espresso machine.  Not to be found, but breakfast service compensates and then some.",5,2016,03,28
237,Excellent property!,The front desk staff is amazing.  We has an early check in.  They were so accommodating with our bags and information of the area.  This property is extremely well maintained and clean.  The restaurant has excellent food.,5,2016,03,28
237,Stayed here twice,"Darrel was so helpful when we arrived from our overnight flight.  He was good to us and we appreciated it so much.  He's a cool Irish guy!  Jane was a manager who also was wonderful to us.  The rooms are nice, modern and well kept.  We came back again & stayed for we were so happy here.",5,2016,03,27
237,Awesome Staff & location,"The staff was out of this world and helped with everything they could, location is great and I highly recommend this hotel......breakfast, restaurant and bar great.  Rooms big and clean and bed very comfortable.",5,2016,03,27
237,Best city hotel,"This is the best city hotel I have been to. It is modern, quirky but still keep the hotel charm. I love hotels and this hotel did not disappoint. The breakfast is great with a large variety to choose from. The grill gas amazing steak.",5,2016,03,27
237,The perfect hotel experience,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in this hotel. The rooms are so stylish and contemporary that you cant help but fall in love with the clean lines, the minimal feel and the romantic music quotes on the walls. The breakfast is served in a room with a huge and stunning bronze sculpture of a hare. It sounds strange I know but it has the total wow factor. The breakfast had everything you can imagine from hot chocolate with marshmallows to freshly made smoothies and juices and gluten free options too. Location wise this hotel is really central especially if you are planning a days shopping in Arnotts and the surrounding stores. Parking is provided in a car park just around the corner from the hotel with a special rate for guests which was so handy. I would definitely stay here again and I certainly hope to do so !.",5,2016,03,25
237,Lovely visit ,"Great location right on the Liffey river. Started there twice in a matter of a week.  Stayed March 13 and then March 16-19. 
Staff at the front desk are great. Adam at the front desk is great.. Did more than expected. 
Room for my first stay was a little small. The view was on the river. 
Second room was a view on the river but was a big room than the first room. A lot of room. Temp in the room was not controllable. 
Security friends had problems with people trying to get in the room.

Bar was great. Mark the waiter was great. Took care of of group.  
",4,2016,03,24
237,"Location good, quality so so","Stayed here for 2 nights with my son. Location is great if you are use to city noises and want a central location for touring. Since I  live in the suburbs (gasp) the noise was distracting at first. The room was comfortable for two people.  But reason I gave this hotel three stars is the cleanliness of the bathroom.  Our counters looked terrible. There were smudges, glass rings on it. I was able to scrub it clean with a bit of effort. As such, I wondered how well the rest of the room was cleaned. Nothing ruins your comfort level like the thought of a dirty room. ",3,2016,03,24
237,Mix up with rooms,"Security at this hotel is not up to standard..whilst entering our room we came across luggage at entrance only then to find a naked couple on the bed, we exited the room a quickly as possible, went back to reception a little shaken and embarrassed and explained what had just happened...
We were given another room, an apology and a lot of sniggering from staff for the duration of our stay.",2,2016,03,23
237,Rugby weekend visit,"First ever trip to this hotel and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Reception was friendly and check in was very efficient. 
Room was of reasonable size and was well equipped. We also had a view over the river.
Breakfast was buffet style and had a good range of hot and cold choices.
We ate in the restaurant a couple of times and the food was well presented and not that expensive. 
The bar area was quite quiet but also fairly comfortable. There was a live band playing a couple of nights, just a pity that, due to where they were set up, you couldn't see them. 
The staff were really helpful. They suggested good places to visit and best ways of getting to them. Great service by everyone and much appreciated by me.
Well worth a return visit.",5,2016,03,23
237,Treated like a Queen,"Arriving at this hotel I was treated like the queen of England. The front desk staff helped me with parking, gave me yummy cookies and seemed to really care about my comfort. Our room was amazing and very comfortable and was in the perfect location to walk to almost everything. We were here on Halloween night and the streets were very crowded and noisy, but you could hear nothing once in your room. I will be staying here the next time I am in Dublin. ",5,2016,03,22
237,Lovely hotel with excellent location!!,"I booked our stay at the Morrison a year ago to make sure my friend and I would get the absolutely best location for the St. Patrick's Day shenanigans - and boy, oh boy we did!! 

The hotel was modern, stylish and the service level was impeccable. Greeted by smiles, cookies and easy check-in we got our room with adequate space, biiig bathroom and all the amenities needed. The hotel has both a grill restaurant, a fine dining option and a bar, but during our stay, we only visited the latter. Again, great service complimented by a fine selection of drinks. 

The location is probably the best in the city. Right on the riverside, close to excellent dining options such as The Winding Stairs, Bach16 and the 'underground' pub Sin É. Across the river is the infamous Temple Bar District and both Guiness Storehouse and Jameson Destillery are within walking distance.

I can not imagine staying anywhere else if I ever get the chance of returning to Dublin.",5,2016,03,22
237,Excellent,"Having stayed in many hotels in Dublin over the years, this was without doubt, the best. Superb service, excellent breakfast with quality food and quality staff. A great location giving easy access to shopping, restaurants, bars etc on both sides of the river makes for easy walking of the area.
Sleep disturbed by the usual temple bar revellers, but overall would return in a heartbeat.",5,2016,03,22
237,"Nicely located, modern hotel","The hotel is very well appointed, with sleek and modern rooms.  We were upgraded to a junior suite due to celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary.  It was so lovely to receive macarons and champagne from the manager to celebrate. As a Gold member of Hilton Honors, breakfast was included, and it was excellent.  The afternoon tea was delightful, and it was even better knowing that it could be delivered to the room.",5,2016,03,21
237,Perfect centrally located Hotel with a wonderful staff included!,"We booked this hotel as it was centrally located to pretty much everything we wanted to do in Dublin, as this was my husband and my first trip to Ireland.  We arrived on St Patty's Day so I'm sure you know that we were in the midst of some heavy partying and heavy crowds, but it was an event I will never forget.  The hotel is right across the Liffey River from Temple Bar and steps away from tons of shopping.  We walked to Guinness Factory and Jameson Whiskey Distillery as well as Dublin Castle.  To name a few.  The staff at the hotel were very friendly, including the front desk receptionists, and maids.  We also ate dinner at the Morrison Grill, located on the main floor and had breakfast on the main floor in the mornings, the food was great in both places and all the staff were kind and friendly also.",5,2016,03,21
237,"Outstanding hotel, friendly service, and great location!",We started our Ireland trip off with a two night stay at the Morrison. The front desk staff were excellent - from finding a room ready for early check-in to touring suggestions to storing our luggage.  The room was contemporary and spotless.  We would absolutely stay here again!,5,2016,03,20
237,If you're visiting Dublin- stay here!,"We recently stayed at The Morrison for two nights as we were there to see a concert at the 3 arena. This was an early birthday present for my Husband- I emailed ahead and requested if possible for a nice room. Upon arrival we were greeted with warm cookies and had a short 20 minute wait before our room was ready. We went to the bar for a quick drink during this time where we met Gary who is truly a credit to this establishment- friendly, knowledgeable with a great sense of humour!
We then went up to our room which to our surprise had been upgraded to a suite overlooking the river Liffey- absolutely beautiful! (Room 133 for reference).

That night we decided to eat at the hotels restaurant and had one of the best meals we've had in a long time (so good we ate there the day we left!) The restaurant Manager Mark who we had met earlier when waiting for our room went above and beyond and the service was truly exceptional.

We stayed for a further night after this and again, I can't credit the facilities and the staff enough. My husband and I travel the world frequently and this is up there with one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in, so much so we are now looking to make this an annual trip.

So again, a big thank you to the whole team, you made a birthday weekend truly memorable and we can't wait to return!

237,Dublin,We arrived in Dublin at 5 am on a Saturday. The hotel staff was very helpful. The room we booked was not ready but we were offered another room instead or their shower room to freshen up.  We booked a room overlooking the river so we used their shower room and headed out for a early walk around the city. Breakfast in the hotel wonderful and worth the money if not included in your room. Bar service outstanding. Hotel staff ALL go out of their way.,5,2016,03,19
237,"Great hotel, excellent location","For work trip colleagues booked for me this hotel.  I really enjoyed my stay in this hotel. Very helpful staff at the reception, in the restaurant and housekeeping. Right at the river, just cross it and you are at the Temple area.",5,2016,03,17
237,Great Location,"This hotel is great, the location is right on the river in central Dublin City, close to temple bar and the shopping areas. It is pretty modern with some really funky colors in the rooms. The Wifi in the rooms was great and in general my stay was good. Only critic I had on the hotel was that I arrived early and they made ZERO effort to assist me with a room, their answer was simply the room is not ready. The time rolled past the check in time and it was still not ready. Food is good, selection a bit small but all in all a good stay.",4,2016,03,15
237,Great Hotel and location,"This is a great hotel. Very modern and chic. Located right in the heart of everything. Cross the penny bridge and you are right in the heart of party central. Temple bar is straight ahead. Staff is nice, rooms are clean and nothing better than warm cookies well your checking in...nice touch. Also cupcakes in the room and the TV has a screen welcoming you buy name. Would stay again if visiting.",5,2016,03,14
237,Fab hotel on the Liffey ,"The hotel is modern chic. The service is amazing and the location is great!

The rooms are large and clean! Although there aren't any drawers, there are plenty of cubbies to hide your luggage away. The room has complimentary wifi, coffee, tea and hot chocolate. They have a water kettle and some complimentary water bottles for you to use. Iron and ironing board in closet, as well as a safe big enough to hold a laptop.

Just across the River Liffey, you'll find Temple Bar. Great location! So much to see within walking distance. Mall just down the street where you can find a market and lots of places to eat just steps from the door. Really a great location. 

If you are looking for a quieter room, ask for lodging on higher floors. I was on the 2nd floor and could hear all the goings-on.  Still a great stay.",5,2016,03,14
237,Perfect Dublin Hotel,"This hotel is in a great location, you can walk anywhere you'd want to go in Dublin.  The staff is lovely, helpful and so nice.  The rooms are clean, nice and perfect for any length of time.  I was here for business and really enjoyed my stay.  The brunch is convenient and delicious, the restaurant has great food and also really convenient.",5,2016,03,13
237,Fantastic staff at The Morrison,"Lovely, quirky hotel in a great city location. Right on the river and within easy walking distance of Temple Bar,  Trinity College and Christ Church Cathedral. The great staff made our stay here even better. They were all friendly and helpful. Special mention must go to Darren on the front desk. He couldn't do enough to help, suggesting places to visit,  finding maps, guide books etc. Superb customer service.",5,2016,03,12
237,Great location.,"We stayed at The Morrison recently. It is a typical 4 star hotel. The rooms are spacious and comfortable.

The staff are friendly and helpful.

The biggest advantage this hotel has is its location. It is situated on the river bank within walking distance to Temple Bar and excellent restaurants around Dame St and Georges St. Grafton St is also within a 10 minute walk.
The hotel is on the doorstep of the shopping on Henry St which includes The Jervis Centre and Ilac Centre.

I have one comment to make to the hotel. The ""background music"" in the bar on Sat night was so loud that people had to shout to each other to be heard. The pub was not full so surely the volume could have been turned down",4,2016,03,11
237,"Friendly helpful staff, great location",We stayed 2 nights for vacation and the location was perfect.  Close to all of the sights and tours for Dublin.  The staff was very helpful and friendly.  Eager to assist with lining up tours and giving directions to local sights. There are plenty of restaurants and pubs nearby.,4,2016,03,09
237,Great hotel,We received a warm welcome on arrival at the reception & the checking in process was very quick & easy. Every staff member we encountered during our stay was very friendly & keen to help. The rooms were well laid out and spotlessly clean. Considering the busy road that the hotel is on we didn't hear noise from the road & slept soundly. The location of the hotel is also a bonus. Close to so many of the sights & places of interest in Dublin but a calm oasis when you want to have some peace.,5,2016,03,09
237,Our experience couldn't have been better,"Had a great stay here. Staff were friendly, Liffey View room was bright modern and clean with comfortable bed(!), location was super convenient - couldn't believe how quiet it was, yet so close to Temple Bar.
Thanks especially to Reception for recommending the Winding Stair for dinner, that was excellent.
Proximity to Brother Hubbard (breakfast and coffee) also a plus for me. Recommended.",4,2016,03,08
237,Excellent location,"Excellent location, really friendly attentive staff. We found the dining room for breakfast rather cold and draughty. The  staff were really attentive. And the service was excellent.  Pretty standard breakfast  but no vegetarian sausage and bacon alternative available for breakfast  which is unusual these days, especially for a hotel of this standard.  If you were a vegan your choice would be very limited. Nice modern spacious bedroom, we had a view of the Liffey which was great, but if you like to sleep with window open I'd recommend NOT booking a room over looking river, as the street is very busy with road traffic. Just a short walk over one of the nearby bridges and you are in Temple Bar area,",4,2016,03,08
237,Nice And Tidy,"Stayed here for 2 nights with friends. Hotel is clean and hospitable, all staff very friendly and attentive.
There was a lot of noise on 1 night of our stay due to a wedding function which the hotel were more than happy to resolve for us.
Location is great, close enough to everything yet not too close so you can hear the revellers in the temple bar area.
I'd definitely recommend to friends and would stay again! ",5,2016,03,08
237,Great Location!,"Situated in a bustling area with lots of restaurants and attractions. Rooms were clean with a modern feel; staff was welcoming; accommodations were as expected. You do have to pay for parking in a garage behind the hotel, but you get a discounted rate as a guest of the Morrison (€12/day). Overall, we were happy with our stay in Dublin. ",4,2016,03,07
237,good experience,"Overall, the experience is good.  I liked the breakfast.  The dinner is a bit expensive, but I took it anyways since the time and efficiency is more important to me.  The warm cookie is welcome and made me feel happy.",4,2016,03,07
237,"Great property, perfect location!","Traveling back from business in Cork, Ireland my husband and I needed somewhere to stay in Dublin before heading back to the US.  This property came up while searching Hilton properties in Dublin.  The hotel is a quick 5 minute drive from the Dublin Hueston train station and is located directly across from the Temple Bar area.  Just a 2-3 minute walk across the Liffey River and you have plenty of food/drink and shopping options.  Hotel service was excellent; great amenities.  Would definitely recommend this hotel for business or leisure.",5,2016,03,03
237,Wonderful Anniversary Gem - The Morrison Hotel,"My wife and I decided to hold our 52nd Wedding back in the place we had our honeymoon - Dublin. We were married on the 29th February 1964 (Leap day leap year)
On arriving at Morrison Hotel the greeting we received was fantastic. The Hotel reception staff were brilliant, they upgraded us to a suite (room 330). The room was very thing you would want large lounge with a 40inch TV - large bedroom with 40inch TV - large bathroom with bath and shower facilities. The first person we met was Darren who made sure that the impossible was possible, nothing was too much trouble. Anything we asked about ie: Restaurants, special places, local food and entertainment area's he knew them all. The location of the Hotel was ideal for anything you would want to do. Across the bridge is the Temple Bar area great for a good night out. The staff made our wedding anniversary special with drinks and cakes delivered to our room along with a beautiful card. We would like to thank Darren, Maite, Maria and the Morrison Hotel staff  for going that extra mile. When we arrive we were customers but when we left we had made special friends and on first name greetings with reception staff. I hope Morrison management appreciate them all. We will be returning again and we recommend this wonderful hotel to those who will read this review.",5,2016,03,03
237,"Excellent hotel, amazing service.","We had our wedding ceremony and reception here last week and from the moment we arrived the service was incredible. Every single member of staff was amazing and nothing was to much to ask of them. 
They made our wedding so perfect and were there, on hand, to support, the entire weekend. Sally, Ross & the entire events team were great and helped make our day so enjoyable and run so smoothly.
We had an amazing room with a river view and the food was excellent. 
I cannot recommend this hotel enough, one of the best I've ever stayed in for service and comfort!",5,2016,03,03
237,A stay in the Morrison Hotel Dublin,"The Morrison is situated in the centre of Dublin yet there wasn't a sound at night. We thought this a well run hotel, very clean and comfortable. The staff were the friendliest. most helpful and pleasant people I have ever dealt with. The food excellent.",5,2016,02,29
237,Impressive 2 night birthday stay in Dublin at Hilton Morrison. ,"Well where do we start... Since being for a special occasion we were delighted to be informed we had received a complimentary upgrade. The reception staff were extremely accommodating when checking in and made sure our arrival was as smooth as possible. The room and bathroom were very impressive and spacious with everything you could ask for down to the toiletries to the view of the river Liffey. 

We decided to book breakfast for both mornings which was not with any regret. The selection was outstanding with a delicious buffet and a wonderful menu you could select further options from (would recommend the eggs florentine). The breakfast also had its own personal barista who made coffees to order, he was very friendly and made some amazing coffees! If you could forward our compliments that would be much appreciated :)

The breakfast and hotel facilities were so impressive so we decided to dine In the hotel on our final night. Very reasonably priced and delicious we had a lovely meal and the atmosphere of the bar / restaurant had a great ambience. As I like to keep active whilst away I used the hotel gym which was free of charge and perfectly suitable for a quick workout on both evenings. In addition free wifi was available throughout the hotel which was helpful. 

Overall we were extremely impressed by the hotel and very much looking forward to return in the near future when we next arrive in Dublin.
",5,2016,02,28
237,"Lovely room, great staff, can be little noisy","We stayed in a junior suite which was beautiful, with a river view.  The room was amazing and always spotless.  The staff are excellent and can't do enough for you.  

Wi-fi is free and relatively painless.  The river view is arguably over-rated (sorry Dublin, the Liffey just isn't that pretty a river!), especially since it can be noisy until late into the night (and that's ""Ireland late"" not normal late - think 4am on week nights).  But that's not the hotel's fault and overall a really great stay.",5,2016,02,28
237,Staff are the stars here,"First class staff both welcoming and efficient.  Modern décor and furnishings towels replaced daily and everything spotless. Very odd room lighting in the form of pink bedside light cubes. Not enough light to read with without one of the main lights on thus disturbing my companion. Our room appeared to be over the loading bay (117) so we were disturbed by early morning deliveries. Although internal soundproofing is very good as no noise from other rooms or corridor. Breakfast tasty and plentiful and staffed by extremely friendly personnel, however not good value. There is a café on the corner which is very reasonably priced. Surprisingly the bar seemed well priced.",4,2016,02,24
237,Amazing staff ,"This was our second visit to the excellent Morrison hotel, the purpose this time was to celebrate our first year wedding anniversary after celebrating our wedding here. As expected it didn't disappoint, the location can't really be bet, so close to all the action but yet not in the middle of all the chaos. The location and general standard of rooms/food etc is only bettered by the staff this hotel has, a lot of familiar faces which says a great deal about staff retention. In particular thanks to Martin and Mark this time around, cannot recommend enough for weekend away or modern city centre wedding location. ",5,2016,02,22
237,"Lovely hotel right in the heart of Dublin, excellent staff ","I stayed in the Morrison for one night on a business trip. My initial impressions were very good - nice decor, very friendly staff and the added bonus of a free warm cookie on arrival. Upon leaving, once again the staff were excellent - could not have been more helpful and friendly. 

The room was very spacious and the temperature was perfect. Bathroom was good with nice toiletries and good water pressure. The minibar was probably the most reasonably priced I've ever seen!

I can't comment on the breakfast because I didn't go down for it and I understand there is a mini gym but I didn't use it.

However, the bathrobe that I took out of the closet had horrible brown stains on it. I called down and a new one was delivered very quickly but it seems strange that the bathrobes are not inspected to make sure they are clean.  an unfortunate reason to have to lose a star in this review.",4,2016,02,22
237,Exceptional Hotel,The Morrison Dublin DoubleTree by Hilton is a quality hotel in the heart of Dublin. The restaurant offers a variety of food all at reasonable prices. The staff service and quality of rooms made for an exceptional stay.,5,2016,02,22
237,Lovely staff,So just want to say there was a woman on the front desk who was quite little and blonde and she was just lovely and a credit to the hotel! The bar staff were also wonderful and very friendly. Rooms are nice sized with modern decor but there are a couple of things that would of made the rooms a bit better. The only mirror in the room is the mirrored wardrobe and the mirror in the bathroom. If you're like me you like to sit at a desk to do your makeup but that's not really possible and I ended up having to sit on the floor in front of the wardrobe to do my makeup. Also there's a vent above the bathroom that's only noticeable when you turn the light on. It's just bad luck that you can see the vent in the mirrored wardrobe and the vent was pretty dirty. They were only tiny things and apart from that our stay was perfect! ,5,2016,02,22
237,Best hotel in Dublin,"I stayed for a weekend for work purposes. This is the best hotel I have ever stayed in in Dublin. 
The staff are so friendly and helpful.
The breakfast is out of this world served with some amazing coffee.
The rooms are cozy and modern. 
Couldn't fault it",5,2016,02,22
237,Best Hotel in Dublin,"this is our second visit to the Hotel and my wife and I could not fault it. The hotel is wonderful very welcoming and relaxing, the staff are so friendly and have always a smiling and happy and make you feel welcome and at ease. We had a few meals in the grill and the food was superb and great value for money. 
The hotel has a fantastic location, very central and easy access for shopping and the bar and restaurants in Dublin. We highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,02,21
237,Nothing was too much trouble ,"Having just arrived home from a weekend spent at this gorgeous hotel, I cannot recommend enough. From the moment we arrived and was greeted with warm gooey fresh cookies to the moment we checked out as was given a selection of pastries and coffee to go (due to our very early flight). There wasn't an area of this hotel that lacked the finer detail. The room was modern and the colour scheme flowed throughout. The bathroom just as up-to-date as the rest, just like the rest of the hotel the detail was just outstanding.  As well as the hotel being such high standard the restaurant only mirrors the same. Always a busy vibrant atmosphere with the afternoon tea proving very popular, although we opted for the Gentlemen's tea, and was not disappointed. 
Location wise we couldn't of asked for better right across the river from temple bar and within walking distance from most tourist attractions although if not up to walking the nearest tram stop is literally steps away from the front door. 
Again I cannot recommend enough. Staff were very attentive and welcoming. Overall this is by far one of the best hotels I've stayed at to date. ",5,2016,02,21
237,Brilliant!!,"Brilliant hotel ! We stayed here for my friend's hen party weekend.  The hotel itself was beautiful and the rooms were really nice.  The bed was so comfy!  The location was perfectly placed directly across the river from Temple Bar area so it was a quieter but within walking distance to a lot of attractions, the Tourist Information Centre and the Hop On Hop Off sightseeing buses.  The staff were very helpful and really nice and gave us lots of warm fresh cookies at reception. They beautifully decorated my friend's room (on request) and had champagne and strawberrries waiting for us in the room which was amazing! I would definitely stay there again if I go back to Dublin!  ",5,2016,02,21
237,Enoyable,"Great hotel, loved the stay and breakfast is great. Parking is a one minute walk down the road and is about 12 euros per night. Very central and impressed. We hd a room facing the river which was a great view. You can literally walk over the river and be in the heart of the the city of Dublin. Like many big cities the choices of experiences and never ending. We only stayed for a couple of days but will be back as you truly need much more time to appreciate Dublin and the surrounding towns and cities which create this magical experience. Well worth a visit and very friendly and welcoming people and hotel staff.",5,2016,02,21
237,Wonderful ,"Love this hotel,  had a lovely model rooms, modern bar etc, had bathrub and slippers and hair dryer,  everything you need. Nice qoute on the wall... Rested very well,  one small problem was the ac...on the coolest it's still not cold enough. So if you like to sleep on cold don't count on that. ",5,2016,02,20
237,Good hotel. Best location for night life,"Been to the Morrison for work. Very friendly staff and awesome breakfast. Rooms are small but that's common there. When I needed help the staff was very willing to help and went out of their way to describe running path, dining and convenient stores around. One interesting moment was with an unknown charge found on my bill when checked out, but it was sorted out.

237,Ideal,"Perfect location for both shopping and relaxing, we had a king suite which was beautiful and very comfortable, however, bed was noisy. Breakfast was good staff very friendly. All round very good experience would definitely stay again, would probably give the grill a try also",4,2016,02,19
237,Fantastic stay - Would definitely stay again when in Dublin,"Great staff, well designed hotel and Espresso martinis to die for!  The size and quality of the room was great value for money. I would recommend to anyone staying in Dublin either for business or pleasure as you are right in the heart of the City.",5,2016,02,18
237,Amazing Hotel!,"Upon arriving I could not believe how modern, clean and friendly this hotel was. My husband booked our trip to Ireland as a wedding present. I'm so glad he booked here. We arrived early. As we had a river view room booked it was not ready, but the lady in reception happily took our luggage and had it sent to our room as soon as it was ready. In fact, as we were walking to the reception, a male member of staff took our suitcase to the reception for us. We were always greeted with a smile and friendly staff. When checking in we were given warm chocolate cookies which put a smile on our faces! 
The room was a great size, with everything you could need from dressing gowns and slippers, two sinks, a huge bath, a huge walk in shower, a sofa, tv, wifi, kettle with plenty of tea/coffee/hot chocolate, as well as a well stocked mini bar!
There was only two downsides. One being how hard the bed was- we did wake up a few times in the night. Second being how easily the noise from outside crept in including the wind howling and feeling the air coming through. However this did not dampen our stay but maybe an idea for an improvement? 
Room service was easy to order and arrived within ten minutes. Food was lovely except for one muffin which tasted slightly stale.
We had a king size deluxe river view room. Central to everything in Dublin and importantly, across the river from the Temple Bar!
Thank you to all the staff in the Morrison for making our stay in Dublin enjoyable and relaxing.",5,2016,02,17
237,Exceptional service at possibly the best Doubletree hotel,"We have stayed at six Hilton Doubletree hotels (Cambridge, London Bridge, Bristol, Chester, Sheffield and the Morrison Doubletree in Dublin) and this was the best. The staff are fantastic and extremely helpful. The bedrooms and public areas are spotless and attractively designed with quality furnishings. The hotel is well located in the city centre close to excellent bars and restaurants as well as the main shopping areas and the buzzy Temple Bar area. Good sound insulation between rooms and comfortable beds allow a good nights sleep. Very good buffet breakfast.",5,2016,02,16

The only downside is the room service food. Was a bit over cooked. However, the level of service outdid the letting down of the food. Would not select any other hotel if was to come to Dublin again",4,2016,02,15
237,Never a disappointment,"I regularly stay at the Morrison in Dublin - and I can safely say I have never had an issue with them. The service is great, the rooms are clean, the food great, and the cookies also! 

I last stayed there from 7th Feb - 11th Feb 2016 - I had an issue with the heating when I first arrived - however, once I informed the desk - the situation was dealt with within half an hour. 

I would always recommend this place. Put down the extra 20 euro a night and stay in a fantastic place.",4,2016,02,14
237,Fantastic hotel.   Perfect location.  Just note the parking garage hours!,"I stayed at the Morrisson for two days at the back end of a week-long stay for work in Limerick.  Driving up to Dublin from Limerick was a 2-plus hour drive, but for this American, that was no problem.  Quicker than the drive between Seattle and Portland, which I’ve driven at least a hundred times.  The hotel was easy to get to, and there’s a parking garage one block from the hotel.

The staff were very friendly and accommodating.  There was a wedding reception going on and they put me on the 4th floor so I would not be disturbed by all the noise.  They also lent me a European adapter for my iPhone. That was appreciated and very thoughtful.  Rooms was very stylish and contemporary, which I like.  Really, they were just great.

The location was perfect.  On the other side of the river from Temple Bar, minutes from a bevy of restaurants and pubs.  

One warning about parking in the parking garage.  They’re closed from midnight to 9AM.  My plan was to leave early, very early (4AM) after my 2nd night so I could make the drive back to Shannon in time for my morning flight out.  So, I was kind of screwed when I couldn’t get to my car.  The staff tried their best to help me out.  They called the owner and said they could have someone over in a bit, but it would have been too late for me to catch my plane.  They could tell I was pretty rugged from a long night out (I had only strolled in for the evening 45 minutes earlier  -- kudos to the bartender staff for serving up four of us at 3:30 in the morning … ), so they extended my checkout time until 2:00P, threw in a courtesy breakfast and a few water bottles on the way out.",5,2016,02,13
237,If only the bed had been as good as the Internet,"Very Good: Internet, Location, Service, Room Appearance, Cleanliness Very Bad: Comfort - if you like a really hard bed and unyielding pillows then you'll be fine, if however you like a more comfortable bed with a softer mattress/or mattress toppers then this may not be the hotel for you. I stayed in a King Deluxe",3,2016,02,12
237,Brilliant Hotel,"Once of the best Hotel in Dublin - nice location - friendly staffs.    Beautifully designed rooms. Close to Temple Bar area. Close to shopping area as well.   Good Breakfast , good gym, restaurant. So far no issue for me neither heard of anything from other people stayed here,",5,2016,02,11
237,Excelent Hotel,"The whole experience went over all expectations. Breakfast was extremely good - both buffet and a-la-cart. Located in the heart of the city. Spacious rooms (at least on HHonors floor where we stayed). Clean, modern. Top notch basically.",5,2016,02,10
237,Lovely Hotel,"Great hotel, with excellent service. Rooms are of a very good standard and at a good location for access to restaurants and bars. Would definatley return to this hotel if i returned to Dublin. We were staying in a group and we were welcomed warmly and our every wim was catered for.",5,2016,02,10
237,Central location hotel,This hotel is near both the north and south side of Dublin. East to walk to all sites but not in among the crowd or noise. Friendly and helpful staff. We plan to come back both to the city and to this hotel.,4,2016,02,09
237,Fantastic stay in Dublin,One of the best hotels we have stayed in. Staff were so friendly and helpful. Loved the lighting and decor in the room. Food was exceptional. Buffet breakfast was delicious and you could choose anything from the a la carte menu at no extra cost. Enjoyed a couple of evening meals in restaurant and spent some time in the bar. Hotel bar had live music for 2 nights. All in all a super place to stay and great location. We loved Dublin as well. ,5,2016,02,09
237,Perfect place,This is a very central hotel for those enjoying Dublin. Rooms spacious. Bar reasonably priced. Staff genuinely warm and nice. Breakfast very good. Recommend and I would certainly stay here again. Very relaxing,4,2016,02,08
237,Fantastic hotel,"What an amazing hotel, staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. The junior suite was fab with plenty of space and everything you need. Excellent bar for drinks and eats!! Elegant and modern decor throughout. Would always stay here when in Dublin. 5*'s",5,2016,02,07
237,"Lovely hotel, lovely staff!!","The location couldn't get any better in Dublin, I travelled with people who aren't used to walking and we got around just fine. It's close to pretty much everything; shopping areas, Temple Bar, Trinity College. The room is decent sized and clean.

I'm especially most impressed by how friendly and helpful the hotel staffs were, it feels as if they handpicked the friendliest people around to work there.

I wished we had stayed longer, honestly, will definitely come back to stay there again next time I go back to Dublin again.",5,2016,02,05
237,Excellent Break,Our family of five stayed here for a family celebration and we highly rate the quality of our stay and the friendliness of all the staff. The hotel was exceptionally good value for overall quality and it's central location. The special  24 hour car parking rate and closeness to the Gervis Luas stop was valued by family members.,5,2016,02,04
237,Excellent location,"Have stayed here a few times before and we're always struck by how convenient it is.  Very handy for shopping during the day and across the Ha'penny bridge from some very good restaurants and nightlife.

Rooms are still fresh looking, despite being a few years since it was refurbished.  The bar was quiet for a Saturday night but they do have some great value food and drink offers on.  

Breakfast was also very good.  Great selection from the buffet or a la carte.  Great place!",4,2016,02,03
237,Nice place,"This hotel is the best hotel in Dublin located close to everything in Dublin 
not in the heart of temple bar but very close just to pass the bridge 
Near to all shopping centers 
very clean and modern Hotel with Delicious breakfast 
if you are looking for a hotel to inspire you and makes you feel good then this hotel can be your decision",5,2016,02,02
237,Back again,"I haven't been here for a few months as I had struggled to get in, and stayed further out in the Burlington instead, but this time I managed to get a room. Being so much more central this is a better option for wandering around the centre of town, but worse for taxi traffic, especially first thing in the morning. Check in was speedy and the room was clean and modern as ever. Free wifi too. I struggled with the room temperature a bit, ending up opening the window, which introduces more noise into the room. ",4,2016,01,29
237,Best Birthday Present,I cannot say enough about my experience in this hotel. From the moment we arrived and we're handed those warm chocolate cookies (that prompted an immediate cuppa to be made in our room). To the surprise plate of mini deserts delivered to me in our room as a birthday gift. Staff were excellent and room was fab. We didn't dine in the hotel but I can imagine they have the same high standards in their food as they do everywhere else. Thanks for making my 1st night away from my 2 little ones so memorable ,5,2016,01,27
237,Amazing location ,"We (my partner and I) spent the weekend here for an anniversary. It's a beautiful hotel right on the river Liffey. On arrival we were warmly greeted by the friendly hotel staff. I loved the fact that as when we got into our room there was a personalised message on the tv screen.

The hotel is within walking distance to all the major attractions Dublin has to offer, which was great as it meant we could always pop back when we were met with the Irish weather. 

The breakfast they had to offer was truly fantastic. So much you could choose from with additions on the main menu, and staff always ready to pour another coffee if it had run out.

When I return to Dublin I will definitely stay here again. ",4,2016,01,27
237,"Stylish, well placed hotel","Great hotel, well placed for most things whether this be business or pleasure, literally overlooking the river.

Staff were incredibly helpful and friendly and couldn't do enough to help.  The room was stylish, clean and we maintained, had everything that you could possible need and so quite.

Will defo look to stay here again but for fun this time rather than business.",5,2016,01,27
237,Ladies weekend away,"Lovely hotel, in an ideal location for all activities. Lovely rooms, food, drinks, and friendly staff who make you feel welcome. The breakfast catered for everyone's needs. The bread was fresh and the tea was good quality. The only fault was the toaster was slow, but this is the case in the majority of hotels. Put your toast in first while deciding what to eat, spoilt for choice.
Drinks and afternoon snacks where lovely, The bar staff very entertaining and helpful.
Staff went out of there way to be helpful.",5,2016,01,25
237,Kickoff your trip at The Morrison,Accommodations were great. Customer service was something to truly write home about. Great food recommendations. Thanks to Jane for putting together an amazing breakfast package. So thoughtful and quite memorable. What a way to kickoff our trip in Ireland.,5,2016,01,24
237,Would reccomend and return,"Check in staff very friendly, had a chat with us about our plans for the night and when he found out we were celebrating a birthday he had two glasses of prosecco sent up to the room. Really nice along with the warm chocolate chip cookie you get at check in! Room was large and clean, especially the bathroom. We were on the first floor so of course there was street noise but once the window was closed it was fine. Room was very warm but air conditioning worked well. Comfy bed, tons of storage for anyone who is staying a little longer. Have had drinks in the bar on a previous occasion and its quite nice, live music as well as a DJ but the lobby area and hotel itself were nice and quiet while we were there. Location is perfect, across the river from Temple Bar. Would love to return again. :)",5,2016,01,24
237,Christmas Eve and Christmas Day in the Morrison!!,"My daughter and I booked in on Christmas Eve, we were greeted by the very helpful and friendly Jonathan. Checking in was quick and the chocolate chip warm cookies were a lovely touch to the check in experience.  The bedroom and the decor surpassed my expectations and my name on the tv was a lovely personal touch.  Gifts that were left in by friends were displayed nicely and the room and the bathroom were spotless.  Initially we were worried that being away from home for Christmas we would not get the Christmassy feeling!!! But rest assured a walk down grafton st on Christmas Eve put all our worries to rest.  

The bedrooms were modern and had bathrobes, slippers and cosy comfy beds. The room was a nice size and had a well stocked mini bar. 

Breakfast was amazing, such a wide and varied selection with plenty to choose from. At this point I would like to highly recommend the Guinness bread....

I couldn't possibly find a fault with this hotel, the staff were warm and friendly and I must say Jonathan was an absolute angel and he couldn't do enough for us. The atmosphere in the hotel was perfect. And we absolutely adored the pink umbrellas!! We will definitely stay here again, and mostly certainly will be booking our stay again for Christmas. ",5,2016,01,22
237,Perfect hotel!,"This hotel is in the most perfect location in Dublin. Being right on the river it s a stroll accross the bridge to Temple Bar and a short stroll in the other direction to some good shopping. We didnt have to catch public transport or cabs anywhere, everything was a short walk including the Jamison Distillery.
The rooms were modern, fresh and clean. My room was quiet and the staff amazing.
The bar has a good range of wines and was a nice place to come back to for a wine at the end of the day.",5,2016,01,20
237,Fantastic Staff,"Spotless rooms, friendly staff and great food what more could you need. easy to get to and from, parking close by with discount for staying at the hotel. complimentary bathrobes and slippers. Next time we will stay longer.",5,2016,01,19
237,Great Location,"I checked in at 4pm, I saw two baggages inside the room so I rang the reception and waited for 15 minutes, no one come to my room. I have to return to the reception and queue in line just to query why there are bags inside my room?! 

After all, they sent someone to remove the bags. 

The hotel is nice and decent, staffs were friendly but due to too busy, lack of efficiency.",4,2016,01,18
237,Nice boutique hotel,"I stayed at the Morrison whilst I was over in Dublin on business.  It is a boutique hotel that was recently taken over by Hilton, so is rather different than from your average Hilton.  My room was a good size with a comfortable King side bed.  The breakfast buffeywas fine, although the dining room was rather cold.",4,2016,01,17
237,Great experience,"The Morrison Hotel, Double Tree, was a great and conveniently located hotel to stay at while visiting Dublin.  The staff was friendly and accommodating.  The food at the bar/restaurant and breakfast was also very good.",4,2016,01,17
237,Great stay and location.,"The location of the hotel was part of the reason I picked it for our stay. Right on the canal and close to lots of things. The price was even pretty decent compared to others around. The rooms are nice with a very  modern feel and pretty well appointed. Parking is done at a garage a block away which was also pretty convenient. We are able to walk to everything we wanted to in down and to catch the tourist buses that go around town. Very friendly staff that helped make the stay great. And of course, being a Doubletree, there is an excellent cookie involved.",5,2016,01,15
237,Brief 1 nights Stay at the Morrison,Hotel staff were wonderful and very helpful.  Accommodations were clean and well kept.  Location near downtown Dublin areas of interest was great. Would recommend to business travelers and adults wanting to be in the heart of Dublin.,5,2016,01,14
237,Corner suite luxury,"We've picked the Morrisson for our annual Xmas break away and again this year had a great stay. We had a corner suite with separate living area. 

The detail, finish & space was fabulous with great views of the Liffey. Breakfast was as always amazing, trying to be healthy is so easy with fabulous healthy choice but that said with amazing freshly baked bread, muffins & pastries. 
 ",5,2016,01,11
237,Coeliac Friendly !,We have stayed here before and have always been royally treated. This time my wife was amazed to finally have found a hotel that serves a gluten free cereal at breakfast as standard. AND has a dedicated toaster for the gluten free bread. It made a huge impression on us. This place thinks of everything !,5,2016,01,11
237,Amazing!,"We had such a lovely stay in this hotel. The facilities were second to none. The staff were very welcoming and we wanted for nothing! Fantastic location, across from Temple Bar. Definitely worth the money. We will be staying again! ",5,2016,01,11
237,Very enjoyable,"Room was perfect, facilities perfect, staff very polite and professional, fantastic location. I will definitely stay here on another occasion. Afternoon tea was really nice and the ambiance was also great. All in all a very satisfied customer :)",5,2016,01,11
237,New Year @ Morrison Hotel,"Return visit to the Morrison for a Dublin New Year break..fairly high rack rate which was expected due to the time of the year but that bought me a junior suite. Also managed one night on Hilton loyalty points plus cash which made it a very good all round deal.
Warm welcome on check in - a slight delay in getting into the room as we early but no problem as we headed to the nearby shopping centre...the tram is also on the doorstep so the hotel is handily located overlooking the Liffey and Temple Bar on the opposite bank.
The suite room was a good size but was inward facing (235) so new view for three nights...bathroom was also good and well lit. However we had problems with room temp control and needed an engineer after a pretty cold night...unable to resolve the issue and the duty manager kindly moved us next door to a larger suite room which had views over the Liffey...resulting excellent rating as a result.
Breakfast is also a plus with a very good buffet laid on in the morning...dined in the bar as well, again excellent and reviewed separately.
Overall a very good stay, excellent management team and friendly helpful staff...only other negative to speak of is that the marble clad bathrooms are fairly cold as there is no seperate heating system...sleep quality in the King bed is excellent and hardly any noise intrusion from the road outside...well recomended and look forward to a return..",5,2016,01,08
237,TRUE IRISH HOSPITALITY,In a perfect location we were welcomed like royalty and given exceptional service.  We could not have asked for anything more and will hope to visit many more times in the future.  We particularly enjoyed our New Year's Eve dinner in the Grill and the exceptional decorating throughout the hotel.,5,2016,01,07
237,"Trendy, Vibrant and a great place to stay","We have stayed at the Morrison several times before and indeed i have previously written a review but after my stay on 31st Dec for 2 nights i felt compelled to review it again.  The whole experience this time was by far the best and we have stayed here
several times since my last review. The reception/check in went so smoothly i forgot
we were in a busy city hotel. The bar staff especially Mark (a big thank you to him) made us feel at home on a very wet and windy irish day. My biggest surprise on this
visit was the breakfast staff in particular a young lady by the name of Niamh who in my opinion is a credit to the Morrison. Her mannerism and obvious love of her job and actually portraying that to the customers in this day and age is a rare find. She deserves a massive thank you from the Gordon family for making our staff complete.",5,2016,01,05
237,Small Rooms but nice stay,This was a nice hotel on the north side of Dublin. The south side is the more active area but it's literally just a 5 min walk over a bridge to the south side so it was actually kind of nice being in the quieter area and only having a small walk to all the pubs and attractions. the rooms were pretty small so make sure your comfortable with your roommate but i would stay here again despite the room size.,4,2016,01,04
237,Amazing stay,"We had a lovely stay in Dublin. The hotel was located over the bridge from the Temple Bar area. The Guinness Storehouse, Jameson experience and Grafton Street shopping are all close by. The hotel itself was very clean, bright and modern. I would definitely stay here again. ",5,2016,01,04
237,Excellent location but $$$,I have stayed at the Morrison on two occasions and love it.   The location is awesome (right across the street from Temple Bar area) and the Liffy Bridge.  The rooms are nicely appointed and the staff is very welcoming.  I was waiting for a package to be delivered and they made sure to bring it to my room as soon as it arrived.  It's not cheap but well worth it,4,2016,01,04
237,Perfect location but $$$,"I have stayed at the Morrison on two separate occasions while visiting family in Ireland.  Both times I have had very pleasant stays.  The rooms are nice and nicely equipped, the location is perfect right across the street from Temple Bar area and the staff is very welcoming and accommodating.  It's not cheap, but it is well worth the expense.  I will stay here every time I travel to Ireland.",4,2016,01,04
237,NO smoke &mirrors.,"On arrival check in was very smooth, luggage portered to our room 4th floor 432,room was extremely stylish with modern cubist fittings in fashionable muted colours,oh, and it overlooked the river Liffey also.

Dining was very enjoyable,the service was discreet and efficient, the food was of high quality and beautifully presented. A nice touch was that wine was obtainable in a half bottle and so we had both a red and a white.

Overall, our 5-night stay was extremely pleasant, the staff and the surroundings,the whole experience left us with a ""feelgood"" feeling and we would not hesitate to book this hotel again.

We would like to say a huge thankyou to the staff who were working over Xmas and who made our stay so complete.",5,2016,01,03
237,Nice Hotel in Great Location,"Guest Relations Staff were awesome.  Most staff were very helpful and accommodating. Unfortunately, the lobby smells like a giant cigarette because people smoke just outside the door all day and a LOT of second hand smoke makes its way into the lobby.  The rooms are clean and smoke free and the staff are great.  We had an issue with the heating in the room.  No matter what setting we had it on, it was HOT.  We did not report that which is our fault because we did not give them a chance to remedy the problem.",4,2016,01,03
237,New Year's Eve,"Where to start......one word amazing. We stayed here as our friends had there wedding reception here. Reception staff were very professional, friendly. Check In was very quick and got fresh warm cookie on arrival which were yum. Our Room Which was Room 240 was lovely big spacious room, very clean. The staff overall were amazing from start to finish on our stay there. I cant wait to go back and stay again.",5,2016,01,02
237,Great choice for a long weekend break,"Lovely hotel - we were greeted at check-in with a warm, freshly baked cookie! Nice touch! The room was a good size and modern and the pink/purple theme ran through both the rooms and the public area. We didn't have much of a view as we were round the back but we weren't there to gaze out of the window and it was lovely and quiet at night

The bar was lovely but super busy so you couldn't always find a seat for a nightcap but to be fair, we were there a few days before Christmas so lots of people were out celebrating.

The location is great as it's a 5 minute walk to O'Connell Street, less to Temple Bar and maybe 10 minutes to the Grafton Street area so very well positioned

Can't comment on the restaurant as we didn't use it - it looked very nice but there's just too many lovely restaurants in Dublin so we ate out the whole time

All the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful and seemed to be enjoying their jobs 

Definitely recommended",5,2016,01,01
237,A perfect Dublin location,"This hotel ticks all the boxes: great location for a tourist, nice rooms at a decent size for its downtown location, friendly staff and proper security.

It's a short walk across the river to the Temple Bar pubs and an easy walk to Grafton St & St Stephen's green.  Walked to Jameson, but took a taxi to Guinness.

I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2015,12,31
237,Great weekend break,"This hotel was exactly what we wanted for our weekend break. It was modern, immaculate and a pleasure to stay in. It's was around a 15-20 minute walk away from the City centre or a 5 minute tram ride, this was ideal for me and my wife. The hotel bar was a little pricey (however no more than to be expected).
The staff were friendly and extremely helpful. If we were to go back to Dublin we would stay again. ",4,2015,12,31
237,"Great Location, Great Hotel, Cool Atmosphere at the Hotel Bar","We stayed here as a family of 4 in two rooms.  The location is excellent.  The rooms were pretty standard sized for a major city.  The rooms were definitely modern and comfortable.  We enjoyed hanging out in the hotel bar having snacks and drinks several times.

We attended a concert in Croke Park.  It is a bit of a walk to Croke Park and pleasant as long as the weather is good.

This is a good option.  Not over the top, but a solid, trendy and modern hotel.",5,2015,12,30
237,I stayed at christmas,"Very nice rooms, clean well located good choice of breakfast nice christmas dinner room well presented any requests that I made were responded to very fast.  fairly good choice of teas and coffee in the rooms minibar had the usual items not a great choice of alcoholic drinks but plenty of soft drinks. nice big television",5,2015,12,30
237,A great hotel for a city break,"Recently returned from Dublin, and had 3 nights in this hotel, I chose it for its location, and probably one of the best locations in Dublin! Everything is literally a five or ten minute walk away!! And it's pretty quiet, apparently all hotels in Dublin get a bit noisy with revellers returning from the temple bar area late at night, but this hotel is just away enough from the area, we did hear a few people in the early hours outside, but nothing more. The breakfast is perfect, all buffet and an a la carte menu which allows you to choose various dishes such as eggs benedict etc, our suite was perfect, my only observation was the bath, which was huge, but owing to the low water pressure it took 30 minutes to fill!!!! But that's my only negative, and the staff are all totally brilliant, helpful, polite, smart and really great people! Thank you, we had a great stay! The bar is also a great spot for a drink before dinner!",5,2015,12,30
237,So Good We Returned,"While touring in Europe we had the chance to return to Dublin and chose the Morrison as it had been so comfortable and ideally situated for exploring the city on our first visit. A major shopping area is two blocks from the hotel as is one of the two tram lines. It is walking distance to The Old Jameson Distillery, the Temple Bar area, Trinity College and  Grafton Street. Staff were friendly and helpful and attended to our wants in a  professional way. Breakfast is great with lots of options on the buffet and dinner in the hotel on a very rainy evening was delicious.",5,2015,12,29
237,Good value for your money,Located on a quay near the very centre of the city. Cosy and quiet rooms. Friendly and helpful staff and very good and complete breakfast. Also a nice bar to drink a couple of Irish whiskies or beers. ,5,2015,12,24
237,Family holiday in Ireland,The location is excellent.  The hotel staff were extremely helpful with any requests we had.  They hotel is well kept and maintained.  The warm choc chip cookies at the reception desk are delicious.  I highly recommend this hotel.  ,5,2015,12,23
237,Excellent Location,Redeemed HHonours points to stay here - so definitely value for money for us.  An excellent location which is close to all local attractions - would definitely recommend. There is a fabulous little café across the road which does a great breakfast!,5,2015,12,22
237,Another Home Run From The Morrison,"Another trip to Dublin, another fantastic experience with the Morrison. The room, food & beverage, and ambience were all fantastic.   As reviewed previously, the staff, once again, were EXCEPTIONAL. Manager Jane Bridge and the staff went out of the way to make our visit special.   Customer service and personal touch continue to set the Morrison apart from the competition.  Looking forward to the next visit!",5,2015,12,22
237,Great but location issues,"The Morrison in Dublin is a design hotel with a lot of surprising modern accents (lights, sculptures) which make a stay very special. Friendly and extremely dedicated staff working in an inspiring atmosphere. The cleaning issues that we initially had were instantly solved. Spacey rooms with state-of-the-art lights and all necessary comfort (including WiFi, complimentary coffee, tea, water). Unfortunately this is another hotel where you have to jump into the bath and close a curtain to get a shower. We believe that at the time of the refurbishment of a few years ago this should have been addressed as well. If you have a problem with your knees (like my wife has) it is a real struggle to take a shower. Although the beds are extraordinary comfortable we did not get much sleep. Unfortunately our room was located near a small street (Swift Row) where young people scream and shout each night on their way to/from Temple Bar as from midnight to 5.30am. We had to make a choice: extremely noisy airco or an open window with a lot of street noise. We chose for the latter. A point for improvement could be the reception desk which is absolutely too small so that people have to queue up. The breakfast restaurant is one big experience with modern art, a giant screen with projections and (most important for a breakfast restaurant) a variety of lovely food to start the day. Everything that you can wish. Overall we had a very pleasant stay.",3,2015,12,21
237,A nice hotel with very good food,This is a very nice hotel fronting on the river Liffey in Dublin. The hotel is a good four star hotel and in a nice central location. What makes it stand out is the restaurant food which is  excellent. The stakes are fabulous. I would come back again if only for the food.,4,2015,12,21
237,Very Good Stay,"Excellent hotel with well decorated contemporary design. Didn't eat at the hotel other than breakfast, which was really good. Toilet didn't flush properly but once had told the reception was fixed within 10 minutes. A major plus was the warm cookies on arrival! It is in a great location just walking across the bridge and then you are in Temple Bar, but not to close so it is noisy in the evenings.",5,2015,12,21
237,Great with one big exception,"The Morrison is ideally situated in the heart of the city by the river. Rooms are bright and cheery and well cleaned. The breakfast buffet is superb with lots of choice plus a cooked to order menu as well. The staff here are some of the best we've come across, helpful and always smiling. They are clearly well led and motivated.
So why 3 stars? Bottom line is sleep, you come to a hotel to get a good nights rest. Due to a wedding on the Saturday they didn't want to let rooms over the courtyard to non wedding goers to avoid noise complaints which is understandable. The problem was our room was like a sauna even with the heating control turned to minimum, even the fridge (326) was hot to touch. The only option was to open the window, sadly central Dublin is to say the least lively until 3.30-4am each morning. Shouting, screaming, singing, broken glass and sirens. Three nights of very poor sleep is the reason for the rating and we live in a main road in town so are used to some background noise. ",3,2015,12,21
237,Not bad at all,Large enough and clean rooms. Free WiFi and good beds.  Lovely and smiley staff although continuing to mispronounce my surname by referring to me as a famous Dutch alcoholic beverage (it is not dissimilar to be fair) was entertaining.  Great bar service and education into Irish Whiskey...  Excellent location although avoid a room overlooking the rives as it does get noisy!,3,2015,12,21
237,Good Hotel,"Good Hotel, modern style, near city center, not luxury but OK.

 Standard rooms are too small but deluxe rooms are better. 

Try to get hotel's front side rooms as it have very good view covering the horizon.

237,Dublin ,Had a great time at this hotel service was very good staff couldn't do enough for us. Food was plentiful and well presented hope to stay there again when next in Dublin.  Very clean.  Situated ideally for the temple bar area. Everything was within walking distance. The Guinness storehouse was well worth a visit. Plus well worth doing the hop on hop off bus tour which stopped quite close to the hotel. ,4,2015,12,18
237,Great Upscale Hotel,"The rooms are very sleek and modern. My favorite feature was the very long deep bathtub! Heavenly! Bed was very comfortable, high tea in the hotel restaurant was a wonderful treat. They thought of everything I could need, including an umbrella in the closet. Situated right along the riverside this is a great base to see the city by foot or the hop on hop off bus.",5,2015,12,16
237,Delicious Breakfast,"Really enjoyed my stay. All staff members were very friendly, rooms clean and the breakfast was fab especially the warm mini doughnuts with caramel centres and freshly made smoothies. Excellent location right beside the Jervis Shopping Centre and it's a short walk across the bridge to Templebar. €12 to park in the multistorey carpark for 24 hours but be careful not to go over the 24 hours-  it'll cost you.",5,2015,12,15
237,Always amazing,"Love Love Love this hotel! Wonderful experience from the minute you walk in the foyer.  Staff couldn't be nicer, rooms gorgeous and location amazing!!  Have already booked another stay for next year.  Genuinely wouldn't stay anywhere else in Dublin now, as I go every December for a girls weekend",5,2015,12,15
237,Great Location & Service in Dublin,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the DoubleTree. It is close walking distance to the main attractions and overlooks the River Lifey. Very friendly and attentive staff. Two blocks from major shopping, the tram and Temple Bar area. Some night time noise from the street.",5,2015,12,13
237,"End of a long business trip, nice place to stay in the middle of it all!","Great location, great service, great food. Buzzing bar, nicely decorated. 

On the river, across from Temple Bar, and most of what you might want to see in Dublin. Walked around easily. Took taxi to areas a bit further out (Rathmine, etc). 

Room was comfortable. I was able to get early check in. The beds were split, I had asked for a bigger bed---they quickly reconfigured to King size at a time that was convenient for me.  Front desk staff was very friendly. 

Morrison Grill has good food, Irish beef was good (not the best, and a tad overcooked for my liking, but overall tasty and convenient if you don't want to leave the hotel for every meal).

The only minor inconvenience was parking. There is a garage very close by, but on weekends the garage opens at 9 AM so if you have an early flight the next day, you have to park on the street or park in a garage that is a bit further away (and still doesn't open before 8 AM weekends) and isn't validated. Still, the night I used the garage was only 24 euro with hotel validation, and street parking is free after 6 PM. When I went to move my car for the night, the bell hop told me where I might find a spot right behind the hotel, and I found one in less than 5 minutes, on a Saturday before Xmas next to a major shopping center...so not bad at all. 

I give 4 out of 5 just for the parking situation and the food being just on par and not out of this world. I would stay here again. ",4,2015,12,12
237,Charming hotel at the heart of Dublin,"This is a charming riverside hotel is at heart of everything: shopping, food,music. While it's at downtown, but at different side of river than Temple Bar, so it's quiet. The decor of the hotel is modern and romantic. The room is small but everything is modern so I don't mind. The staff is very friendly and nice. The breakfast is good, but the restaurant can improve in term of cooking. The downside is the parking. Although it gives a discount for hotel's guest, it opens late during the weekend. We had an early flight so we need to drive the car out before the parking closes the night before and find a street parking.",4,2015,12,12
237,Templebar Stay in Dublin,"Lovely stay at Hilton Doubletree Morrison Hotel Templebar.. Great location, great room, excellent service. I would recommend a stay at this hotel to any visitor.  We found our room and location to be perfect for our stay in Dublin.",5,2015,12,10
237,Wonderful hotel,"Visited for 1 night last week , have to say the whole experience was wonderful. The hotel is ideally situated over the bridge from temple bar . We arrived at 9 am and were able to check in straight away, into a lovely room overlooking the river . The staff were very friendly and very helpful , particularly the local Irish guy . He went out of his way to help was was very polite . I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel and if I were to stay in Dublin it would be my first choice , superb",5,2015,12,08
237,Mostly Good,The check in guy on reception was really friendly - probably the nicest check in I have had (sorry I didn't catch his name) - and the warm cookie is a nice touch. I was given a nice room although the silver pleather chairs were not to my taste... Unfortunately when I returned late that night - there had been some sort of leak under the carpet between the bed and bathroom wall and over an inch of water sitting with no obvious signs of where it came from. Which meant having to pack up all my things and move to another room in a slightly noisier part of the hotel. However the staff were very apologetic - it was just an inconvenience that unfortunately happens.  Had the breakfast the next day - and the choice of food was excellent. The fresh smoothies and french toast were delicious. There was plenty of choice - with lots of healthy options.,4,2015,12,08
237,Morrison Hotel & staff wonderful,"On business, perfect room with all the modern facilities and cleanliness you need. Wonderful, friendly welcome and efficient departure.  Great location, fab breakfast selection. All very pleasing and highly recommended. Certainly felt like a person and not another guest statistic.   10/10",5,2015,12,06
237,Fantastic ,"This was our third stay at the Morrison and it never lets you down.
From our first interaction at check in getting lovely warm cookies as a welcome to the extra touches like bottled water as you check out for your journey home.

The hotels deco is amazing, beautiful designs and the rooms are spacious and impeccably clean and location is ideal.

We were particularly impressed with two members of staff and unfortunately we can't remember their names but we were checked in by a very professional local young man who was very helpful and friendly. He was on the concierge desk on 28th Nov around 11am. He made us feel very welcome and is a credit to the hotel. We were also checked out by a lovely lady with blonde hair, on the 29th. There was a bit of a queue for check out and she was doing everything she could go get people through quickly.

Great selection for breakfast. The only one comment we had was that there were no napkins down beside the hot plates which meant going back up to our table before we could lift a plate... But this was only a very minor point.

Overall we would highly recommended this hotel and can't wait to be back'",5,2015,12,05
237,Really nice hotel and location,"Thanks for a very nice and cozy stay at the Morrison last night. Rooms are very nice, clean and it is really quiet and peaceful.
Great breakfast, nicely presented and tasty.
You can be proud of your customer service. The gentleman who handled my check-out this morning was really very pro and has real customer service skills! Great job! ",5,2015,12,04
237,"Great Stay, Great Location","I spent four nights here and thought that the hotel was excellent.  The location of the hotel is superb, right across the river from Temple Bar and a close walk to nearly everything inside of town.  The only downside I experienced was that the breakfast in the hotel restaurant does not open until 7am, which can be a drawback if you have a day trip planned, as I did.  Nonetheless, the hotel was very clean and my room was quiet.  I also appreciated the ease with which I was able to connect to the hotel wifi.",5,2015,12,02
237,wonderful hotel,"I was very pleased with my stay, the hotel itself is clean and welcoming, the staff are friendly and helpful, and my room was comfortable, I loved the large bathroom and lighting in the room. I stayed in a room with a view of the Liffey and it was lovely to look out the window and see that view with temple bar across the way, out of earshot so I could sleep even with the revelers outside. I would recommend the Morrison to anyone wanting to stay in walking distance to all the sights in Dublin and wanting a comfortable quiet place to sleep.",5,2015,12,01
237,Amazing Staff,"My group Public Enemy performed with The Prodigy Tour on the 30 th of November and was rushing to get in our rooms and head out to sound check in a timely fashion. The staff in particular the Manager ( Jane) was enormously helpful and attentive to all of our ( 16 people) needs. Along with the warm delicious cookies we were greeted with upon the doors opening into the spacious hotel, we were also greeted with bright warm smiles from Maria, Jason, Rhea and Marc.
The rooms are very spacious with a huge bathroom and heavenly comfortable bed.  I would recommend this hotel and absolutely return whenever I come to Dublin. You should visit this wonderful hotel and its Staff members.",5,2015,12,01
237,Hip Hotel,"This is a clean and modern hotel.  From the decor, you would think you were in Sweden or Denmark.  For the most part the staff were very friendly and helpful.  Service at breakfast in particular was very much hit or miss.  The concierge staff is amazing.  The room was large, clean and comfortable.  The bathroom was unusually large and the walk in shower was fabulous.  My room faced the river which was nice during the day but to be honest was a nuisance at night due to the traffic noise.  If I were to stay at this hotel again, I would ask for a room that does not face the river.  Aside from breakfast, dining in the hotel was positive both in terms of atmosphere and quality.  The hotel got very crowded over the weekend but the staff seemed well able to adapt.  Location of the hotel was very good.  Lots of things to see and do within a 10 minute walk from the hotel.",4,2015,11,30
237,"I really can not say enough good things about this hotel, especially the staff.","We arrived early in the morning from our transatlantic flight and while there were no rooms available yet, the staff did go out of their way to make us comfortable with offers of complimentary coffee, tea, and soft drinks.  The location is perfect for first time visitors to Dublin. The rooms were comfortable and clean.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2015,11,30
237,Another great stay!,"Stayed at this hotel two years ago and returned again for another weekend break and it is still as good for a great stay (service, decor, location, food)....wouldn't go anywhere else when visiting Dublin!",5,2015,11,30
237,"Nice hotel, great location","Nice big room. Food is ok. Good central location, but no car park. Special parking rate of 8 euros for overnight parking in the car park further up the street. A bit noisy with functions taking place on the Friday and Saturday that we were there.",3,2015,11,27
237,Stunning rooms and great location but a little noisy,"Now this is a rather lovely hotel, although a rather smelly one on our stay due to some drain work outside the hotel...not the hotels fault but they apologised anyway!

Perfect reception greeting and check-in and my room as an hhonours member was on a high floor which had limited road noise. Some colleagues lower down did get disturbed my this noise.

The rooms are modern, classy and spacious.

A late lunch was had in the grill. It was around 'shift-change' and the service was a little let down, the chowder however was not in taste but for €9 it was in portion size.

Evening dinner and service fabulous. Nicest vegetarian pasta dish.

A good nights sleep was expected but with all the coming and going and closing of other guest doors. It was hard to get to sleep. Why are hotel doors so noisy?

Outstanding breakfast, I was asked if there was something missing I wanted. I mentioned irish brown soda bread and swear the waiter nearly cried as he broke the news the delivery hadn't come in yet. 

So apart from the late lunch service and noisy hotel doors, an absolute lovely hotel to stay in a prime location.",4,2015,11,26
237,Great location,"My husband and I stayed at the Morrison with friends on our way back from Germany to the USA. We only had three nights in Ireland and were so glad that we chose this hotel because of the location. Everything we wanted to see was within walking distance. We could have fun in Temple Bar but then travel back across the pedestrian bridge to the quiet area. We were also in close proximity to the train and were able to venture out of town for the day. (The coastal walk from Bray to Greystones is AMAZING!!)
The hotel staff was extremely friendly and very helpful. They were busy with a wedding that weekend but never made us wait...the bar staff always made sure we had a full drink and the desk staff took time to answer any sightseeing questions we had.
Will definitely stay here again!",5,2015,11,23
237,Super location,"A modern hotel on the Liffey near the Millenium bridge and the Ha' Penny bridge.  Room was large, with two beds with a lot of white (furniture, walls, bedding).  Bathroom was large, clean.  Front desk staff member Adam was marvelous and helpful.  The elevator requires the room card to go up.  The breakfast was adequate.  I would definitely consider this perfectly located hotel for a stay in Dublin.",4,2015,11,23
237,Great location,"The Hotel is Very well located, only few minutes walk to Temple Bar.
The Wifi is very poor for the kind of Hotel.
Breakfast really good.
Staff very kind always very helpfull when needed.
The rooms are very well decorated, clean. Sometimes turn off all lights can be a challenge.
",4,2015,11,23
237,Just great,"Right on the Liffey and a 5 minute walk to Temple Bar The Morrison is ideal. Add the that friendly staff, great food and an excellent room on the Honors floor (4)
Great tour bus stop les than 5 minutes away and the tram to the Arena was a bonus
Great for whatever you want from Dublin ",5,2015,11,22

237,Birthday getaway,"Stayed here for two nights, the hotel is in the perfect location, a short walk away from all the pubs and sights. The hotel itself was first class too, warm cookies on arrival were a winner, rooms really modern and clean. Bed was comfy and had two good nights sleeps! Would come again!",5,2015,11,18
237,"Great value, clean and in a great location.","Went with the wife for our anniversary and we were looking everywhere for a hotel that was modern, a great location and in our price range.  This was perfect. The service was good and the hotel was directly across from the main Temple Bar area of Dublin. 
If you're planning to visit Dublin, this is a sure bet place to stay.",5,2015,11,15
237,"Excellent service.. the staff were, without exception, friendly and helpful","The location was ideal for our short break. right across the river from the Temple Bar area with loads of bars, restaurants etc.  The hotel was beautifully presented, staff genuinely helpful and friendly. The room was spotless and nothing was too much trouble.. I was a bit cold and because I hate air conditioned heating, the reception team provided blankets to make sure I was comfortable.",5,2015,11,15

Very central locatie, you can walk to al the site signs from the morrison hotel.

237,Our wedding reception,"We had our wedding reception here on the 7th November. The staff totally make this place. We got to know quite a few of them including Marion, Patrick, Ross, Martin, Sushil and Luis (sorry if i've mispelt your name). They were all superb and couldn't have done more for us. Marion was super-organised and on-the-ball throughout the whole planning process which gave us total confidence on the day. As expected everything went smoothly. The Chef had obviously taken note of our comments during the tasting and totally rocked it on the day with delicious food. All our guests thought the venue was awesome. Our wedding was perfect and the Morrison literally pulled all stops to make it that way.",5,2015,11,13
237,hip and clean,"newly renovated, hip, and clean.  Staff is attentive and definitely appreciate the umbrella provided in my room.  The hotel is across the river from Dublin Castle , walking distance to Trinity College, and everything exciting.",4,2015,11,11
237,Disappointing ,"I prebooked here as had stayed for work. This time I booked 3 rooms for 6 friends and asked specifically to have the 3 rooms beside each other. Firstly when we arrived there was no parking on the car park next to the hotel where they have preferential rates. On checking in we were basically told sorry we couldn't have rooms together and it was only because I kicked up a fuss and said I had asked several times when booking for This was the request accommodated. At 2.45 we were told only one room was ready for check in. When I asked re the parking we were told to use another car park they didn't have preferential rates with or park on the street! This all put a dampener on what was supposed to be a a special trip id organised for my best friends birthday. Eventually after complaining we were given 3 rooms beside each other despite being told earlier this wasn't possible as the hotel was fully booked. The check in lady did come through in the end and help us out, just a shame it took so much effort to do. Amenities in the hotel are good, rooms are nice  and the bar is nice. On checking out the next day the lady at reception did offer to pay the difference of where we parked compared to the parking garage where they had preferential rates. For the same rate as marker and shelbourne not sure I'd stay again. ",3,2015,11,11
237,"Great Property, and location","This property is within easy walking distance to the Temple Bar Area and has discounted parking with a parking garage a half block away.  Shopping, restaurants, and popular attractions in Dublin not more than 20 minutes away.  Rooms are clean and well appointed, and the hotel staff is excellent.",5,2015,11,09
237,Beautiful hotel friendly staff and central location,"I stayed here for a long weekend getaway to Dublin and absolutely loved it. The hotel itself was lovely and clean the rooms had everything you needed and the added bonus of free bottled water, free wifi and bath robes were all appreciated. The staff I encountered were all very friendly and up for a chat or to offer suggestions on what to do whilst in the city. A free warm cookie on arrival is a nice touch. Breakfast was included with my stay buffet selection but also included a menu that you could order freshly made eggs etc. Would highly recommend ",5,2015,11,08
237,Very friendly staff & best location,"It is a best location hotel, almost across the Temple bar (crossing small bridge by 2 minute walk) which is tourist area. Staff is very friendly and willing to exceed your expectations, specially breakfast team people, concierge & reception. It is 6 minutes walk from O'Connell street, the main street where you take tour bus, airport bus. nice restaurant inside & outside next door two nice restaurants. Little pricey but worth... What you pay is what you get!",5,2015,11,08
237,"Beautiful hotel, spotless","No complaints at all.  Centrally located, my room in the back was quiet.  Bed was firm but comfortable.  Top-notch linens.  Bathroom was well stocked.  Staff is attentive.  The breakfast buffet (a little expensive) has something for everyone.  The Morrison is a gem.",5,2015,11,05
237,Weekend Stay.,"Booked The Morrison  for our first weekend visit to Dublin  , and what an excellent choice it was. Lovely staff, first class room overlooking the Liffey and breakfasts that kept us going over a busy weekend. When back in Dublin we will be booking  The Morrison again",5,2015,10,30
237,Great stay ,We enjoyed our stay at the Morrison. It has a great location. The breakfast was really good too. The staff was very friendly and helpful. My only complaint was that our room got hot from all the pink lights and our fridge wasn't in the best working order. ,4,2015,10,28
237,Wonderful experience for my 50th birthday!,"I stayed here with my partner, a friend and some family members as we celebrated my 50th birthday party in the hotel.  I chose the hotel because of its central location and great flexible function rooms.  Sally was amazing to deal with.....the party all went like clockwork....the room looked amazing and my guests were raving about the choice of venue and the great food.  The staff were super-efficient and friendly; Darren was very helpful with lots of bits and pieces.  The accommodation was gorgeous....very modern but not stark.  I loved the cookie at check in and loved all of the little extras in the room(e.g. the lights in the wardrobe, the little reading light that pops out from the headboard).  Breakfast was truly delicious; we had the Eggs Benedict.  Check out was quick and easy but I was sorry to be leaving.  Stay at the Morrison; you will not be disappointed.",5,2015,10,26
237,Friendly Clean and Convenient,"Really pleasant surprise to stay at such a conveniently located and reasonably priced hotel. Staff were invariably helpful throughout our 3 day stay and the rooms were immaculate, modern with an excellent view overlooking the river and Temple Bar.  Top marks.",5,2015,10,26
237,Can not fault it!,"My boyfriend and I visited this hotel this weekend and, admittedly, it was our second choice of hotel as we had stayed in another right on Temple Bar and had loved it! Due to the UFC and half term weekends, we didn't book in time and it was full. However, we are so glad it was because we ended up with this hotel and we couldn't have asked for any more. 

We had a really early morning flight and a 3pm check-in seemed an age away. After grabbing breakfast we headed to The Morrison about 10am where we were greeted by a really lovely lady, from Brazil, on reception. She greeted us as though we were her first customers of the day, gave us a chocolate cookie and told us she had a room ready for us now if we wanted it? This was music to our ears. We were exhausted and had tickets to the UFC event in the evening, so we needed rest. 

When we got to the room, we were really impressed. It was clean and fresh and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. The only issue we had was that we had booked a King room and there were twin beds in there. As the lady was so helpful and had let us check in early, we debated saying nothing, as it was only for one night after all but we wanted what we paid for. I went downstairs and spoke to the same lady. I told her the room was lovely but we did have twin beds, immediately she apologised and said, ""Oh it should be a king for you!"" She knew without checking our booking. She said she would have it fixed immediately and she did. 

We had breakfast the next morning, which was €15 for a full breakfast plus a choice of anything on the menu. It was delicious. 

The hotel is right across the bridge from Temple Bar so you get a great location without the noise. It is also a 2 minute walk down the same road for the tram, which takes you to the 3 arena and the Jameson Factory and lots of other places. 

Couldn't ask for any more from this hotel and will definitely be returning.",5,2015,10,26
237,"Super Modern, Central Hotel","Me and my Fiancee stayed here for one night, was able to check in online using the HHonours app which made my journey through reception very efficient. On arrival we each received a warm cookie which is a nice touch. The general appearance of the hotel reception, lobby areas, bathrooms was that of a five star hotel providing those small touches that make the experience all the better such as having complimentary fruit available in the lobby area and providing individual cotton hand towels in the public bathroom areas. We stayed in a ""King Guestroom"" which are really clean, super modern and of a good size, the room has plenty of storage space and again the small touches which make this hotel feel 5 star like the complimentary toiletries, tea, coffee, hot chocolate, bathrobes, slippers and many towels. The hotel also boasts complimentary wifi. Lastly the location of this hotel is excellent you are literally across the river via the hapenny bridge from temple bar. Secure Parking is available very close to the hotel for 12 euro for 24hrs. I have stayed in a number of hotels in Dublin over the years but this is now my number 1 choice!!",5,2015,10,25
237,Personal and professional,"Great hotel, good staff and rooms are fab. Amazing location in the centre of a town close to the Luas and connecting travel. Welcoming lobby, incredible breakfast room. Gym is a little small and the equipment is limited but good for a hotel.",5,2015,10,25
237,"Great location, fantastic service, modern hotel","Stayed here for 3 nights in the king guest room with my husband. We arrived early for check in and were warmly greeted by Darren who is the epitome of Irish charm. We were given a freshly baked cookie and water on arrival which was a nice touch! Darren gave us an overview of things to do and recommended a great pub for lunch whilst our room was being prepared. The room was very spacious, the location is fantastic as its a short stroll across the bridge to Temple Bar, trams etc. will be returning for our next trip!",5,2015,10,23
237,Vacation in Ireland,"I chose the Morrison because of the reviews, because I am a Hilton Honors member and because of it's location.

The location is great. It's just across a footbridge from the Temple Bar area which has lots of great bars like the Norseman, lots of energy and great people watching.

The Morrison is also right on the bus and tour bus lines, is surrounded with restaurants and close to shops.

And the staff go way out of their way to please.  Although there are countless restaurants and pubs in the vicinity, we decided to use the hotel's restaurant one night.  Service was great. It was quiet (which was exactly what we wanted) And the food was fantastic -- like a dry aged Hereford filet cooked to perfection. 

As a place for tourists who want to be near everything but also to be able to escape from the hubbub, it's a great location.

237,best first honeymoon night,"we are a couple that stayed in the hotel a month ago. We got married and the hotel was where we spent our first night of our honeymoon, that had dublin as a starting point. 
we would never forget that night because the hotel gave us the best room available as a surprise...we were speechless...
the room was incredible and has a perfect view of the river. They even left some sweets and a greeting card wishing us all the best. 
Definitely a very nice gesture form the manager, because they had that room available and offered it. 
we higly recommend the hotel, wich serves a very delicious egg benedicts among many other things for breakfast for example. We will definitely will comeback and recommend it. Thanks!",5,2015,10,22
237,Morrisons hotel in Dublin,I stayed at the Morrison's for business reasons. Many of my colleagues too. Perfect reception. Good rooms.  Bit of a hassle to get to the business centre at Grand Canal Quays. But you could walk it in 30 mins. Perfect location for picking a restaurant or bar for the evening hours. No complaints at all.,4,2015,10,21
237,Room is definitely worth the price,"I usually stay in non-big-name hotels when traveling Europe, but am quite pleased at the decision to stay at this Hilton property in Dublin.  The location is absolutely perfect for walks in all directions.  Just 2 blocks north you'll find a large shopping mall with 2 grocery stores, making it easy to pick up drinks and other supplies. The room is very comfortable, the beds excellent and with a good safe.  Front desk staff are knowledgeable and eager to help. Of greatest delight was arriving at 10 am from our overseas flight and being immediately placed into a room.  Bliss!  Just being able to lie down and nap for 2 hours really made our first day in Dublin a joy.  Thank You Hilton!  Our room was on the second floor facing a small street and there were no noise issues.  HHonors status will give you vouchers to the very excellent breakfast buffet.  In fact it was one of our favorite breakfasts throughout our 2 week Ireland visit.  The bar downstairs makes delicious drinks and is a very comfortable spot to begin or end your evening out.  If you visit make sure and visit the restaurant ""The Church"" just two blocks away.  Good food, drinks and a free Irish Dance show.  Wine Bar Ireland is also fantastic!  A bit more of a walk, but you'll be exceptionally pleased with the food and wine selection.",5,2015,10,20
237,"Convenient, Modern with Staff who are happy to please!","This is currently one of my preferred hotels in Dublin. The hotel is in good order, recently decorated. Rooms are well equipped. Nice buffet breakfast with a la carte options. All topped off with friendly staff who go out of their way to help. 

The only issue is finding the damn switch that turns off the in-room purple mood lighting... 
... the secret is that it's on a timer!",5,2015,10,20
237,Great location for Dublin's tourist attractions,"The Morrison offers exactly what you'd expect for the price you pay; it's bright, modern and functional with some funky touches.  The staff are generally helpful and friendly, particularly on the reception desk.  Our room was a standard double but offered everything you could possibly want for a weekend stay and more.  The menu only caters for carnivores so we didn't eat at the hotel but we used the bar a couple of times which was very pricey but a cool and sophisticated place to start and end your evening before you dive into the delights of Temple Bar.",4,2015,10,20
237,"Awesome location, clean rooms, not so comfy beds.","Pros:
Excellent location. Walking minutes from Temple Bar area.

Nice staff. Very quick to respond when needed more towels or power converters. 

Very clean rooms. 

Had a decent continental breakfast in the lobby for guests leaving before the regular breakfast was served.

Cons:
The beds were not very comfy, quite hard in fact. Bedding was ""crunchy"" like over starched perhaps.

The room temperature was severely regulated, so when we were hot we couldn't make it any cooler.

Room service pizza was awful. Literally tasted like a microwaved frozen pizza... we didn't even eat it.

As with most hotels, the breakfast wasn't very good and was really expensive.

Parking:
The hotel doesn't have parking. They tell guests to use the parking facility next door. Be sure to bring your card in to the hotel to validat it as you will get a cheaper rate.

The parking garage is closed from 2-7am, so if you head to airport sooner than 7am, you need to move your car the night before to the street.",4,2015,10,19
237,Very unpersonal hotel,"Booked this hotel because of good remarks on the internet and the very central location. It turned out to be one of the most sterile and unpersonal hotels I ever have stayed in, both the staff and the localities. Poor sound isolation between room and street, I needed to check several times that the window was not actually open. Breakfast not included in room price which was not clearly announced at booking.",2,2015,10,18

Check in was easy and efficient. The room was perfect, comfortable, and ultra modern.
The hotel is located conveniently to all Dublin sights and transportation. 
The restaurant and bar were vibrant and the menu was varied. Best of all, they make a great Cosmo!",5,2015,10,14
237,Everything but the pillows...,"My only issue with this hotel was the rock hard pillows in my room. Everything else was great - check in and check out were very easy, the room was easy to find, and the concierge was very helpful when we asked for a restaurant recommendation.",4,2015,10,11
237,"Clean, nice hotel","We stayed for 4 nights.  The hotel was quiet and nice.  Breakfast was good. Rooms are clean and the staff is accommodating. Great location also.  Lots of shopping and across the river from all the great spots to visit.  Dublin is a great city and easy to walk,  being a woman i felt safe walking alone. ",5,2015,10,10
237,Trendy,"Great location, awesome staff, rooms were trendy and bed was comfy. Location was fantastic , did not eat there but bar was good. Hotel was a bit pricey though. Would definitely stay here again. Getting a taxi was easy as well. Stayed there two nights, not together, and both rooms were clean and comfy. Still a bit pricey.",4,2015,10,10
237,Excellent experience,"Thank you to the friendly and hospitable folks at the Morrison who made us feel very welcomed.  Greatly enjoyed our breakfasts every morning - make sure to try the smoothies! The location of the hotel is perfect for walking to many Dublin locations.  We highly recommend the Morrison!
",5,2015,10,10
237,Nice hotel - but impossible to sleep if you're on the river,"Is a lovely hotel but stayed here a few times and always noisy - particularly bad if you're on the river where there's a nightclub over the road that has banging music till 4am.  Lovely room but shame you can't sleep in it! 

Food is nice and the cookie on arrival is a nice touch.  But I'm afraid the value I rate most in a hotel is being able to sleep in it which is nigh on impossible.",2,2015,10,07
237,The superb staff saved the day and a very poor review.,"Second time here and although a bumpy start, it didn’t let us down. 
Checked in early and was pleased to be informed that we had been upgraded to an executive room, which we were delighted with. In our room with all the normal hotel welcome literature was a letter informing us of possible noise from an event, as we had been there before, we were not too concerned as we had been there when the live music was on and you could hear it but not enough to be concerned. 
After a few Guinness’s in Temple Bar we returned to our room to hear what appeared to be a disco from within it, the music from the function was so loud, we contacted reception and were offered another room, but as we were already dressed for bed we declined. If there were free quieter rooms why we were not offered one at the start?
We were offered a meal in the restaurant and the rest of the service was exemplary.
If you are going to stay make sure you check about any functions that will be on during your stay.",3,2015,10,07
237,touch of class,I had my stag do this past weekend at this hotel. Before you think the worst. We all decided that we all work too hard  to do the typical stag thing.. We are all slightly older than normal for this type of outing and we have all grown fond of our creature comforts. we had twelve in total staying and i have to say from the cookies on arrival to the checkout at the end we were very well looked after. The only complaint that i personally have is the lack of a residence bar. Not that we needed to avail of it of course by the end of the night but for anyone else thinking of this please bare this in mind. There was an event on the saturday in the main ball room. From the looks of it i would say there was in excess of 300 people attending. Even with this we all found the service to be excellent. Accomodation again was very good. Will definitely be paying another visit with the new missus.,4,2015,10,07
237,Great Hotel in a great City,This is a good hotel in a good location.  The staff were very helpful they went out of their way to help us when we had an early morning tour at 6.50am. The room was clean and comfortable. The hotel was in easy walking distance to everything.,5,2015,10,06
237,Great Hotel,"We were in Dublin for a weekend - our first visit the City. The hotel is really well located -...really relaxing atmospere in the lobby and restaurant / bar area but less than a two minute walk over the bridge to the action in Temple Bar. Rooms were small but clean and boutique style decor...very tastefully done
On our last night it was raining hard and we decided to eat in the Hotel restaurant. It was one of the best meals we had during our two week trip round Europe - compliments to the Chef - really top quality food and the same price point as other City restaurants. A special note to the compliment the team at the front desk...very friendly and very efficient. Maite is one of the lead reception staff. She is a true credit to the Hilton Group - an exceptional young lady who provides the kind of discreet personal efficient service you would expect to find in the very top end London or New York locations !!",5,2015,10,05
237,Fantastic ,"Absolutely fantastic couple of nights at the morrison, really couldn't fault any part of our stay. The decor, the food, the location, the staff all great. Wouldn't hesitate in recommending this hotel to others. ",5,2015,10,04
237,"Once you find it, a great place to stay","This hip hotel is well located in Dublin. Amenities were good, staff very helpful. Breakfast was tasty with the exception of croissants, which were doughy and chewy. We had a tough time finding the hotel as we drove in to town as the single sign on the door facing Lower Ormand  Quay was very faint. And in reality the hotel front door faces a side street. I chose this hotel because the Trip Advisor reviews for other Dublin hotels were so marginal.",5,2015,10,04
237,Luxurious and modern hotel with convenient location,"We stayed 2 nights at the Morrison, and enjoyed the modern amenities offered.  The room was generously sized with a fantastic view of the river Liffey.  It was a quick walk to the Temple Bar district, Jameson Distillery, and Dublin Castle/Christ Church cathedral.  Very easy to take the tram, bus, or train from here.

The only thing that could make the room better would have been better air circulation.  We felt like we needed to open the windows at night but found the street noise to be very noisy on the river side of the hotel (all hours of the night/early morning).  If you want a good night's sleep, opt for a non-river facing room.",5,2015,10,04
237,awesome place,outstanding location and staff. very friendly and helpful getting around dublin and all rhe tourist areas.rooms are great can not say enough about the morrison execpt we would stay there again no matter what.,5,2015,10,04
237,Excellent location,"This hotel is perfectly located, right on the river, an easy walk to Temple Bar where all the bars and restaurants are.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The hotel accommodations are nice, fairly large room.  We had a room on the 4th floor, and, at the recommendation of other reviews, had a room facing away from the river.  No problem with noise at all.  
A few things about the room could use improvement:  there's no drawer space and almost no shelf space, so living out of a suitcase is pretty necessary.  However, there's only on luggage rack and really no place for another, so if you're a couple, one suitcase needs to sit on the floor, very inconvenient.  There's no outlet in the bathroom for the hair dryer and the outlet near the mirror is near the floor.  Good thing I'm short or the cord would not have been long enough for me to dry my hair without contortions.  Lighting in the bathroom is terrible for applying makeup.  These are fairly minor inconveniences, but all together, they were annoying.",4,2015,10,03
237,Excellent hotel at excellent location,"We had a room that had two twin beds on the HHonors floor. We never heard any of our neighbors, but we know we had some because we saw dishes outside their room. Excellent sound proofing between rooms. 

Fantastic location. Close to Temple Bar, shopping, restaurants, but without the noise. An easy walk to a lot of attractions.

Staff was very helpful as well. Only nit was that they took so long to bring up our luggage that we had to call down for it.

I would have given the hotel 5 stars except for one thing. The beds are very VERY hard - much harder than what you would find in U.S. Hotels. If you sat on it, it didn't give. At all. They did provide us with a mattress topper that helped some.",4,2015,10,01
237,Excellent Customer Service in the heart of Dublin,"Wonderful stay at the Morrison. We arrived early and were delighted to find that 3 out of our 4 rooms were ready for an early check in.  Our entire family enjoyed the warm cookies upon our arrival.  The customer service was excellent.  Everyone at the hotel was warm and welcoming. Jane at the front desk was particularly helpful throughout our stay.  The rooms were clean and very comfortable.  I particularly enjoyed the robes and slippers.  Breakfast the next morning was incredibly delicious - a huge buffet to choose from - scrambled eggs, sausage, chorizo, bacon, smoked salmon, sausage cakes, fresh pineapple, fresh pastries, roasted tomatoes, mushrooms, tea, orange juice.  It was all around a fantastic stay!",5,2015,09,30
237,Great Experience at the Double Tree!,"Excellent stay, cookies on arrival was a really nice touch. Great idea! we attended a wedding and the staff were super friendly and efficient. They could not have helped more in ensuring that our stay was enjoyable. Thank you!",4,2015,09,29
237,Great Weekend,"Stayed for a long w/e with friends.  Cannot fault the hotel at all. The staff are all super friendly and go overboard to ensure you have a good stay.  The warm ccokies on arrival were very welcome, as was the offer of complimentary bottles of water as we left the hotel.  The breakfast was excellent with a very good choice of a la carte or buffet food. Road traffic noise was only a problem if you had the window open.",5,2015,09,29
237,Awesome vacation in Dublin,I used my HHonor Diamond points for a recent vacation to Dublin Ireland. With the help of trip advisor I found the Doubletree Morrison to meet and exceed all of our needs. Location was great. There was a shopping mall 2 blocks away which had a wonderful grocery store. Peter & Darren at the front desk were very helpful with check in and what was going on around town. Darren set up our tours & gave easy and enjoyable options for day trips out of the city. Peter gave very good restaurant suggestions. Marcio in Halo for breakfast was very helpful. Overall I can't say enough about our great treatment we received here.,5,2015,09,28
237,Nice location,"3.75 stars. This hotel is in a great location. Previously to Hilton acquiring this hotel it was owned by the Mayor of Moscow's wife. On our arrival we were welcomed with the typical cookie. We were not upgraded even though we are diamond members because of some space issues (we were ok with that. The room decor is a bit trendy but tends to fall short. The Pink lighting in the rooms was the first thing I really noticed. It seemed as if they had all these ideas but ran out of money and just decided to paint to give it a more up to date look. The room overall was decent but nothing special. The headboards on the bed were soiled and we did not get fresh towels if we left them on the bed (no biggie). The breakfast was buffet style including powdered eggs and cooked to order items from the menu which were not impressive. I did make due with the fruit, yogurt and pastry items.",4,2015,09,27
237,Perfection,"I stayed here last night to meet a group of friends in town and had a wonderful evening, greatly enhanced by Sally's help and professionalism. The hotel's decor is a type of sumptuous minimalism, rooms are large and immaculate, and food very tasty. Most importantly every staff member is warm and welcoming - a special mention for Darren, Ross and Patrick. I will definitely stay here again. Thank you!",5,2015,09,25
237,Great place to stay in Dublin!,"This hotel is right downtown and just across the river from the Temple Bar district (5 minute walk).  It's also within walking distance to just about everything in Dublin.  We took a couple of day tours and we walked to the pick up areas -- all within 10 minutes.  Hotel staff is extremely helpful and knowledgeable.  The staff focused on ensuring we had a wonderful experience (not only within the hotel, but also where ever we wanted to go in Dublin).  Rooms were large -- the bed was dreamy!  Not much on TV but who cares!",5,2015,09,24
237,Great location,Stayed here for two nights. Staff genuinely friendly and helpful. We didn't eat here but had cocktails which were expertly made and reasonably priced. There are plenty of places close by to have breakfast if you don't fancy paying the 15 euro they charge. I would stay here again if I visit Dublin as its close to the bus routes and within easy walking distance from O'Connell Street and Temple bar area,5,2015,09,24
237,Dublin Weekend,"We stayed here for 2 nights as part of a wedding anniversary trip to Dublin & Galway. Upgraded to a suite on check-in, which was enormous - large sitting area & bathroom. Very helpful staff, especially the restaurant waiter on Thursday who produced complimentary desert & champagne. Restaurant very nice with good food. Buzzing bar. Windows facing the Liffey & very central location. Quite noisy at night. Good breakfast.",5,2015,09,24
237,5-star performance.,"Great hotel that met my needs and more- walking distance to downtown Dublin, well- appointed room with Liffey River views, genuine customer service ( special mention to Maite da Silva), relaxed tastefully-designed contemporary lobby, filling Irish breakfast. I wished I stayed here again over The Marker after our return drive from around Ireland. This was home to me and would love to stay here again on my next visit.",5,2015,09,24
237,Great location,"This might be the best location for exploring Dublin.  Overlooking the River Liffey, across the river from Temple Bar.  Food is quite good and accommodations very nice.  You can feel safe out at night in this city, especially this area.",5,2015,09,23
237,Great location,"Across from the Temple Bar area, you are near the action without all of the loudness that comes with it. This hotel was clean and contemporary with very good staff. The 1st floor staff were very alert and security conscious that made me feel comfortable considering the amount of people out on the the street.",4,2015,09,22
237,Where to stay in Dublin,"This is a great hotel for vacation in Dublin.  Not like a Double Tree, in the U.S., much more upscale. We were unable to upgrade our room, but when we opened to door to ours, we laughed. No need to upgrade; room was spacious, comfortable, and well-appointed.
Mostly quiet, always kept informed by hotel about goings-on in the hotel. Very close to all the action across the Liffey, but don't ignore the great restaurants close to the hotel! There is also a shopping mall a 5 minute walk away. Very walkable to all the major attractions.
The only reason I gave a 4 was the breakfast restaurant circus every morning. Getting waited on was by chance some mornings ( we were there for a week). Tables not ""restocked"" after people left. Many times I stole butter, pepper and milk from other tables. Sometimes requests for those things forgotten by serving staff. They were all very nice people, but service was not organized. Food- stay away from the buffet, but anything ordered from the kitchen was very good.
Best part of going to breakfast was seeing the hostess Niamh McCarroll everyday. Sweet, kind, friendly; remembered our names and length of stay. The day she was off was a seating fiasco. Hilton, fix breakfast and you really deserve the 5!!",4,2015,09,21
237,"Great location, wonderful staff!","We arrived at this hotel early morning after a Transatlantic flight.

The staff was able to expedite our getting into a room by 11:00AM. There was a problem with our first room, the AC was broken. They helped us move to another room and did not charge us for dinner that night.

The staff at The Morrison are excellent. They went above and beyond , Adam thank you!

Stay here!",5,2015,09,21
237,Dublin Hotel,"Excellent hotel for exploring Dublin.  I arrived from the US at 9:00 AM, so room was not ready.  I stored my luggage with the VERY helpful front desk staff and went shopping in a nearby area.  The front desk called me within the hour to notify me that my hotel room was ready.  The room was very comfortable and the size was typical US standard size.  Also, the wifi in the room and other areas of the hotel was amazing!

The Morrison is also very centrally located.  Temple Bar is across the river and everything is within walking distance.  Guinness Warehouse (20 minute walk) and Aviva Stadium (40 minute walk) are examples that you can get everywhere in Dublin by walking.  If you want to take the light rail, the LUAS is a block away and very easy to use.  Taxis are also available in front of the hotel.

I recommend eating the Irish breakfast in the hotel restaurant.  It was very well done and very tasty!",5,2015,09,21
237,Great Location in Dublin,"This is a great location, near the ""action"" found in the Temple Bar area which is just across the River Liffey.  Other sights like the Book of Kells/Trinity College, Grafton Street, Dublin Castle, Christ Church are all approximately 10 minutes away. St. Stephens Green might be 15 minutes away.  The staff are extremely friendly and helpful.  They held our bags for us as we arrived very early in the morning. By the time we finished sightseeing in the afternoon, the bags were already placed in our room for us. Saturday night was a bit noisy with revelers outside but it's Dublin and the Rugby World Cup was going on.  The Morrison helped make our Ireland trip memorable.",5,2015,09,20
237,Couldn't have been happier,"This was the perfect place for our stay in Dublin. The front staff was welcoming and the concierge went out of his way to map out where we should go. Our room was immaculate, and the location is perfect for exploring the city. Upscale and stylish, with a warm Irish hospitality.",5,2015,09,20
237,Excellent,"We spent 3 nights at The Morrison a few weeks ago it was a first class hotel with friendly helpful staff. We loved the modern decor and soothing colours, not sure of the bird man in the dining room though! Our bedroom was big with everything you need. Would recommend this hotel to anyone, a pleasure to stay there.",5,2015,09,20
237,Central Hotel with a warm welcome,We were greeted by excellent staff who gave us a very warm welcome as we pulled up in our car and our bags were whisked away and we were guided to the car park. The receptionists could not have been nicer or more helpful. The hotel is modern with funky furniture and fittings. The rooms are a good size with contemporary furnishings. Breakfast had great choice and good food. Would definitely recommend the hotel particularly for the excellent staff.,5,2015,09,19
237,Fabulous hotel in Dublin - I want to go back!!!,"We stayed for five nights at the Morrison in September 2015 in a deluxe double room on the second floor.  The staff there is absolutely wonderful (especially Darren).  The room was very comfortable, spacious with soothing colors.  Lovely bathroom with walk-in shower.  Comfy king bed.  Nice controls for room temperature.  We took the gobus from Galway and then walked to the hotel.  It is very easy to find, being right along the river.  We walked to most of the major sights.  Nearby are Starbucks, fabulous Butlers chocolate.  We went to Marks & Spencer on Grafton street which has an excellent grocery in the basement. Temple bar is a five minute walk away.  We took some day tours that left from O'Connell street (Gray Line) which was only a few minutes away.  The hop-on hop-off bus is a block away (we didn't use it).  But really the staff were excellent, they made our stay so memorable.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2015,09,18
237,Good location by the river,"stayed here one night on a Sunday , booked a last minute deal on the internet that was very good value.

Very modern, clean and spacious rooms. a little bit funky , very warm check in, cookies given on arrival still warm - a very nice touch, could not fault the room apart from two small niggles - for ladies who want to use a hair dryer , the mirror is too far away from the hairdryer power point and not enough signage for the hotel making difficult to find.",5,2015,09,16
237,Very good location & good service,"Hotel was very centrally located and tastefully furnished with a funky twist. Room was decent sized and very clean. Staff at reception were very friendly and helpful - thumbs up to the housekeeping, reception and bellhop staff for their service level.
Would stay at this hotel again on our next trip to Dublin.",4,2015,09,16
237,Horse racing ,Hubby and I were invited over to attend a horse racing event at Leopardstown so we decided to stay in Dublin and make a weekend of it. We arrived on the Friday and the room was very nice. When we checked in we were given cookies. It was pouring down so we decided to eat in the hotel sadly the restaurant doesn't open in the evening but we had a meal in the bar. Whilst I would say the food was very good it would have been nice to eat in a restaurant. I cannot fault the breakfast it was truly five star. We would like to say every member of staff we spoke to was extremely happy pleasant and professional. We traveled home Monday and I can honestly recommend this hotel. ,4,2015,09,15
237,Excellent location and customer service,"Went away for a girls' weekend  - a special occasion! The location is ideal - opposite the river near the Temple Bar area. Staff were extremely helpful - Marcio not only offered us water to 'hydrate' ourselves on our way out,  he even offered 'coffee to go' as we checked out! Rooms were modern, clean and tidy with free wi. Again water in the room was eplaced every day. Breakfast had a wide choice and was a good value. Smoothies cute in jam jars and milk supplied in mini milk bottles. Extra menu items were an added bonus and well presented. Would I go again. - absolutely!! Nothing was too much trouble!",5,2015,09,14
237,Location is perfect,"Fantastic hotel right on the river. Rooms are a little small. They do have unique decor and look very modern. Live music each Friday and Saturday night. We stayed in the back (room 319) and it was still a bit loud. A bit expensive for what you get, but you are very close to everything, especially temple bar.",4,2015,09,13
237,"Great location, perfect stay",We were delighted with our choice of hotel for our stay in Dublin.  The Morrison simply could not have been better for location but was wonderfully quiet so a good night's sleep was not a problem in such a vibrant city.  Our room was large and very comfortable with an excellent bathroom supplied with good products.  We didn't have breakfast as we wanted to optimise eating in restaurants but the bar was excellent.  The staff were charming and could not have been more helpful.  I would definitely stay there again on a repeat visit to Dublin.,5,2015,09,13
237,Pampered in Dublin,After several nights of charming b and b's - it was a thrill to have luxury! The staff here was wonderful. Had an early check in and Darren helped us plan our time. This is a great location and is quiet and restful. Leaving for the states at 6 am - it was nice to have coffee and pastries in the lobby.,5,2015,09,12
237,Attentive Service Sets The Morrison Apart In A Saturated Hotel Market,"Manager Jane Bridge and her staff were outstanding. As an American ex-pat living in Ireland, I've traveled through Dublin frequently and stayed at many hotels there. Upon arrival early morning, they graciously facilitated early check-in as well as late check out for departure, enabling a rejuvenating stay. 

Our room was modern with a comfortable bed and pristine bathroom. Service in the bar and restaurant was gracious with tasty food and beverage. 

The hotel's location is excellent with access to shopping and Temple Bar nearby but removed from the late night racket. 

In the end, hotels in specific price points generally offer similar amenities and facilities. It's customer service and staff that create an exemplary experience. The Morrison staff clearly strive to accomplish this.  

Thanks to all the above mentioned, the Morrison is our go-to hotel in Dublin.",4,2015,09,12
237,"Perfect Location, Fantastic Service","We stayed here for two nights in September 2015 whilst on holiday in Dublin.  The hotel’s location is perfect:  it’s right on the river, within walking distance of Temple Bar and many of the top tourist attractions in Dublin (in fact, we were able to see everything on our Dublin itinerary without boarding a bus, train, etc.—we simply walked from the hotel).

The hotel’s staff was perfect—they exuded the hospitality for which the Irish are famous.  We arrived quite early off of a flight from the United States, and they worked hard to check us in to one of the two rooms we had reserved so we could get settled.  The concierge was anxious to make recommendations about things to see and do around the city and immediately provided maps, etc.  As we left, the woman who checked us out could not have been more pleasant or helpful with the baggage, etc.; she was so friendly and helpful as we loaded into a taxi that the taxi’s driver commented that she was “born to work in hospitality.”  Similarly, breakfast staff was very helpful and accommodating.  

The accommodations themselves were good.  The hotel’s decor is modern, and the rooms were bright white with splashes of pink; while modern, they were not cold.  The bed was superbly comfortable.  There were plenty of outlets, and a nice working area.  Everything was very clean and housekeeping did a good job during our stay.  My only complaint in one of the rooms was the shower—it had a rain shower head, but it was put in the position of a traditional shower head (i.e., at an angle from the wall); this caused much of the water to fall against the wall of the shower.  This, combined with relatively poor water pressure, made showering a bit difficult.  The other room, which had a properly mounted rain shower head (i.e., on the ceiling of the shower) did not suffer this problem.

Our room rate included breakfast, and it was very well done.  Breakfast was served in a bright space with lots of light.  The buffet included several hot options (eggs, bacon, etc.) as well as a nice variety of fruit, cereal, pastries, and yogurts.  Additionally, staff were happy to allow each member of the party to order something off the menu (omelettes, etc.) if they pleased.  It was a very pleasant way to start the day and a substantial enough breakfast to allow us to have a relatively light lunch each day.

We did not eat the hotel’s restaurant (lunch and dinner were served in a space separate from breakfast), although it appeared to be very chic. 

Overall, a lovely stay and a perfect way to begin our Irish holiday.  Highly recommended for both pleasure and business.",5,2015,09,11
237,An excellent choice downtown,"Great rooms with a very nice bathroom, excellent breakfast with several order choices, very professional and efficient check-in/out and a great location on top.
All together a great experience in a vey new hotel",4,2015,09,11
237,"Not just a nice room, but wonderful people","The room was spotless, modern and very comfortable.  The highlight was not the check-in chocolate chip cookies, but the remarkable staff. Michelle made the excellent breakfast buffet a treat and even brought a plate of perfect smoked salmon when I ordered the bagel and lox without the bagel and cream cheese.  Darren patiently explained how to get to Kilmainham Gaol by tram and then back to central city by bus and recommended a perfect local pub for dinner before a trip to the Abbey Theatre. We were able to walk to everything but the jail from this excellent central and quiet location.",5,2015,09,10
237,Continues to impress,"I've stayed here a few times and find the location ideal for the centre of town, especially Temple Bar and the hotel very new, clean and modern. None of that has changed, but what I did sense on this one night trip was that the staff were going out of their way to be very accommodating. The rooms are still very fresh and everything works. The quality is very high, for example the towels are large, thick and soft. I even had an inward facing room, which was very quiet. The only thing that comes to mind as negative is that the shower head in my room was too close to the wall at the tap end of the bath, making it tough to get fully underneath. The taxi service has improved too, but I still advise that you book one in advance. I will be back. ",5,2015,09,10
237,Great Stay!!,"We stayed at the Morrison the beginning and the end of our 10 day trip. The Morrison is awesome, great location, great rooms, very clean and the staff is wonderful.  Right in the middle of everything.  The warm cookies is a plus!!",5,2015,09,08
237,Best stay ever at a hotel,The staff here are incredible- friendly and efficient. The room was beautiful and very clean!Also very quiet even though we were easy walking distance of the Temple Bar district. This hotel certainly exceeded our expectations!,5,2015,09,08
237,"Great location, relaxing hotel","location was great, allowed me to walk around at night and see the city. hotel was clean and modern and the staff was friendly and nice. breakfast had a good variety even for veterinarians and I would be sure to stay here again on my next visit",5,2015,09,08
237,Lovely hotel in the heart of Dublin,"We stayed here four nights a couple off weeks ago, one night before a 7 day tour,. one night after the tour and two nights before we left for home. Staff is very friendly ~ Breakfast was great. My husband is a Diamond member, so breakfast was free ~ the beds were very comfortable. We would definitely stay here again!",5,2015,09,07
237,Husbands birthday treat,Stunning hotel very modern  and trendy . Having  stopped in a couple of hotels in Dublin this hotel is top of my list now and   will definitely be stopping here on my return again next year ..  Our room was a one bedroom suite and  was very spacious for our three night stay over .. All staff in the hotel was very nice and polite  so welcoming from checking in to checking out .... If you fancy a treat would recommend the afternoon tea .. And a couple cocktails in the bar ..,5,2015,09,07
237,"Great location, Great Hotel","We enjoyed our stay at this clean, bright, modern hotel.  The staff was friendly and very helpful.  They greeted us warmly, got us situated and pointed us in the right direction for things to do, and places to eat.  The cookies at the desk are a nice touch, and they offered us waters, even as we were leaving which was nice.

The neighborhood felt safe for walking, and it was just a short (walking) distance from key attractions (Guinness Storehouse, Temple Bar, etc...). 

No parking, but there is a carpark just doors away that offers a discount for guests. Lobby entrance on the side street (Swift's Row, I think) not Lower Ormond Quay, so be prepared to make a quick left when you see the hotel.

We would stay here again.",5,2015,09,07
237,Little Gem of a Hotel in Dublin City Centre!!!,"Loved this hotel from the minute we arrived, requested early Check-in on a busy Saturday morning, when we arrived at 11am we were able to check in right away, staff were very informative/helpful on arrival and the complimentary cookies were a nice touch too. Room was modern, clean and most importantly quiet compared to other hotels in Dublin city centre. The décor is beautiful - lovely little quotes all around the hotel. Booked B&B but unfortunately didn't make it to breakfast the next day, so cannot comment on that, but I'm sure it was just as good as every other aspect of the hotel. 

Loved it so much we are staying again in December - looking forward to it!!",4,2015,09,07
237,Flawless Stay,"What can I say, you expect a certain standard from DoubleTree, but this place surpases it all.

I arrived at check-in although it was busy, I was looked after with in a few minutes. The rooms are big, clean, and flawless. There isnt much of a view where this hotel is, but the location is fantastic. You are within walking distance of all Dublins major attractions, and if you are in a party mood, temple bar is right across the Millenium Bridge so you are close without being in the middle of it all.

The bar / food and staff are great. Nothing was too hard, and they always had a smile. 

Highly recommended.",5,2015,09,07
237,Outstanding hotel! ,"I strongly recommend this hotel. First, I give five stars to the location and the cleanliness of the rooms. Service is 5++. Everyone at this hotel is super friendly and they go above and beyond to make your stay pleasant. We give special recognition to Jane who exceeded our expectations and worked very hard to make our stay simply perfect!",5,2015,09,06
237,"Great location, fantastic check in staff and nice modern rooms!","We stopped in Dublin on our way to the UK from the U.S. for a weekend break. We arrived very early at the hotel 6am to be precise and by 10am they had a room ready for us and kept our bags while we went for an early coffee.

Location is fantastic as its across the river from temple bar meaning a little less noise but walking distance of all places. We walked to the Jameson distillery, Guinness storehouse, trinity college and of course temple bar!

Room was contempary modern style, bathroom maybe a little dated but not complaints everything we needed and wanted.

Would definitely stay here again.

237,"Great location, staff, rooms!!!!","Arrived in Dublin 8/24/15..Had an early flight arrival and in advance requested an early check in.  Our room was ready upon our arrival..Staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  Rooms were clean, well decorated and recently renovated.  Plenty of room for two people.

 Darrin and Adam were extremely instrumental in seeing that our needs were met.  They gave us tips about food, day trips etc.  Our tours were booked for us by them.  We are extremely grateful for all their help!!!

Location, location, location...just across from Trinity Bar area..made it close enough to this hopping part of Dublin and yet far enough away to be sheltered from the night time noise.

Impressed by the staff's prompt responses with such things as room services, help with our safe(tip: when closing safe..hold door closed until it locks otherwise it won't close) and getting luggage for delivery to room and leaving for home.

I would definitely return to this hotel.",5,2015,09,02
237,Nice hotel,"Hotel is modern, clean and in a good area, within walking distance of temple bar and shopping areas. When booking in on arrival got a cookie which was a nice touch! The breakfast was too notch - both menu and buffet to nibble while you wait. Only down side is the price... Very expensive compared to other hotels in the area.",4,2015,09,01
237,wondeful hotel and great location,"This is my favourite hotel in Dublin - great location on the river and opposite from Temple Bar - however no need to leave hotel as the bar and the restuarant are great.

Service in the hotel is second to none and the staff cannot do enough for you.
I would recommend the hotel to anyone - very boutique hotel - lovely reception area - the bedrooms are just to dye for you dont want to leave - the room is stocked with mini bar, iron hairdryer everything you  would expect and then lovely bathroom with lovely fluffy towels.
Breakfast is great and nice choice
Wonderful relaxing hotel",5,2015,09,01
237,"Amazing, Wonderful, Impeccable, Fabulous.....","...And any other great words you can think of. This hotel is one of the best I've been to in the world (if not the best). I have been going here for years for the odd drink, lunch, etc. and I finally stayed two nights here recently and it was out of this world. I held my wedding reception here and had a BBQ and buffet. Staff were completely amazing on the day. They couldn't do enough for us and our guests. From the planning phase to the actual day of the wedding, staff were always on hand to help. Our guests are still talking about the hotel and how wonderful the staff were. Our room was beautiful and I saw two other rooms where my family were staying and they were beautiful too. The hotel is always spotless and decorated very tastefully with a kind of funky modern twist. The food has always been lovely anytime I've eaten here and for our wedding BBQ there was a huge choice and staff went above and beyond our expectations and even cooked some African food as half our guests were African. If you're thinking about having a wedding reception or any kind of function here, then go for it. The prices are very competitive and the location is brilliant as it's on the Luas line and right in the city centre. We had some wedding photos taken on Millennium Bridge just opposite the hotel. If I ever become a millionaire I think I'd like to move into this hotel permanently! I will continue visiting the bar in this hotel and intend to stay some night again in the future.",5,2015,09,01
237,"Very nice, very modern","Great location. The rooms are very modern and very nice. Nice customer service in general. The restaurant and bar had a live band playing and that was very nice touch. The food was good, and it was really a lively restaurant for a hotel. Recommended for a short visit!",5,2015,08,31
237,Fantastic service,"This hotel is very central for places of interest around immediate area of Dublin, not our usual hotel when myself and daughter stay in Dublin, but bit of luxury was a lovely change. Greeted by a lovely, friendly and helpful young man called Darren who went out of his way to ensure that we were allocated a very fresh and modern room, plus warm cookie on arrival was best ever!!, he even sent up a tray of chocolate brownies which was unexpectedly welcombed. Although we couldn't check in until 3pm we were able to leave our bags at hotel and revisit our usual pubs!!, another special mention to Jane Bridge who quickly rectified a shower and hairdryer problem we had.
We used the gym facilities which were spotless and had supplies of bottles of water and towels if needed, breakfast was outstanding, so much choice, probably ate more than I would at home but its not everyday you go away, all in all I would go back to the Morrison if I was after some luxurious surroundings, thanks again to Darren,  sorry about the football score!!",5,2015,08,31
237,How a hotel should sort out a problem,"We needed a hotel fairly close to the National Museum of Ireland, as I was giving a talk there the following morning. We also had some HHonours points to spend. The Morrison met both of these objectives. It is situated at the corner of Ormond Quay Lower and Jarvis Street on the bank of the Liffey opposite the Temple Bar area. Our standard room was on the first floor at the back, which we thought was fine on a bank holiday weekend and given the fact that it was paid for on points. It was reasonably spacious, well equipped and with a large and comfortable bed. We also thought that it would be quieter than the Liffey side. This was not actually the case, as the evening wore on it became obvious that the party noise and music from the ground floor was not going to lessen any time soon. So at 11 pm my wife rang the dedicated guest help line and spoke with Eric, the Duty Night Manager. She politely and reasonably pointed out our difficulty, that I needed a good night's sleep to prepare for tomorrow. Eric replied that there was a corporate party taking place, he fully understood and would try to help. Less than five minutes later he rang back to say that he was moving as to a junior suite on the Liffey side and would be up in a couple of minutes to assist us in moving. On installing us in the very spacious suite, Eric told us that he would also add a complimentary breakfast for our trouble. By 11.15, we were unpacked and in bed in a blessedly quiet room. The next morning we were greeted at breakfast by Jane, who presented us with an a la carte menu each, to add to the already ample breakfast buffet. We both chose Eggs Benedict, which were top notch. So in summary the Morrison treated us extremely well and has gained two very satisfied customers. Full marks therefore to Eric, Jane and indeed the HHonours programme!",5,2015,08,30
237,Great hotel,"Amazing location; walking distance to Temple Bar, Grafton St and all major attractions. The room was spacious and very clean. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Definitely would stay there again !!",5,2015,08,29
237,Great Small Boutique Hotel,"Stayed here for 5 days on a short vacation to Dublin. Choose the hotel because of location and reviews and we were not disappointed! Room was large by European standards, modern and clean. Nice bathroom and good wi -fi. The breakfast in the morning (free for Diamond Hilton) was excellent, and the entire staff was very courteous and friendly. But the best part was the location, location, location! On the river, one block from the red line Lucas tram, 10 minute walk from the 747 airport bus, and 10 minute walk to Temple Bar area and all the sights. We will be back!",5,2015,08,28
237,Couldn't have been better,"We booked 3 nights at the Morrison, 2 rooms, one booked using money and the other using Hilton Honors points, with interconnecting rooms so the kids could use one. As a Diamond Honors member, I was hoping for a room upgrade, and when we arrived, after we had got our standard issue cookies (very nice), they told us we had indeed been upgraded to a one bed suite, interconnecting to a standard room. So up we went, to discover that on the particular floor in question, these rooms were not interconnecting because of a different layout from other floors. The staff member was very apologetic and went off to resolve. 

Very happy to hear him come back to say that instead, he could offer the penthouse suite, interconnecting to a standard room. What a wonderful room, with a large living room, a large bedroom separate from it, with a bathroom the size of a typical hotel room, electric blinds and curtains, a controllable coloured light display over the headboard and a shower large enough for a family. Not to mention a small balcony overlooking the Liffey.  So that was all fantastic.

The hotel is presented in a pretty modern style, very pleasant and dairy. We only ate at Quay 14, for breakfast, and the breakfasts were excellent, with a large range of hot breakfasts, cereals, breads, cold meats, juice, hot chocolate and a menu of made to order items including eggs Benedict, pancakes and so on. Nice dining room and very good service. 

Car parking is at an adjacent shopping mall park, with a discount for hotel residents. The mall opens at 7am weekdays and later at weekends, so if you need the car to early on Sunday, think about your arrangements. The hotel has a small fitness room with 6 or 7 pieces of aerobic equipment and a cable machine, which is perfectly adequate for a short stay. Runners can run to the Phoenix Park which is about 2 - 2.5km away, fairly flat run. Good wifi throughout the rooms, and pretty good choice of TVs on a smart TV. 

The hotel is located along the river on the north side, just opposite a bridge to Temple Bar. The Halfpenny Bridge is just along a few yards further, so we tended to use that. It is about 15 minutes walk to Stephen's Green, and about 10 to Christchurch or Dublinia. 

Through our stay, the staff were unfailing helpful and courteous, the hotel and room were very clean and tidy and I would unreservedly recommend it, even if you don't have the luxury of the Penthouse Suite ;-)",5,2015,08,28
237,Excellent holiday,"I stayed here with a friend, and despite having been in Dublin before, we have never treated ourselves to this kind of luxury. Everything from our arrival and greeting to the room itself was just wonderful. Massive thank you to the lovely staff and especially to Cian at the front desk who helped plan for us awesome activities and helped us with all of our requests during our 3 night break. The hotel itself is in a really good location, near to Temple Bar and some nice shopping and dining areas. It was worth paying a little extra for.",5,2015,08,27
237,A treat to stay here,"Fabulous hotel. Great location, 2 min walk across the bridge and you are in Temple Bar.  Very modern interior, absolutely spotless inside.  Great room with everything you needed - even an umbrella! Which unfortunately we did need! Breakfast was brilliant 10/10. Drink prices were actually cheaper in the hotel bar than the pubs in Temple Bar.  I would definately stay here again, and would recommend it to anyone. I would also recommend the city bus tour €10 for 2 hours - excellent way to see Dublin.",5,2015,08,27
237,Quality hotel in great location,Stayed 3 nights in this modern hotel on the banks of the Liffey only 5 mins walk from Temple Bar and 10 mins from city centre. Food quality high as was standard of accommodation and levels of service. Staff very friendly. Go for a high floor as street noise intrusive through night.,4,2015,08,27
237,Awesome 5-night stay,"First time in Dublin, and wanted something that was close to everything we wanted to do.  This fit the bill, but was much more than just location!

Hotel is very well kept up, and every employee we came across was friendly.  Even dealing with such things as jet lag, plenty of walking, and perhaps plenty of drinking...the beds were very comfortable and sleep was not a problem.  

The hotel was just about full for most of our stay, but we never had any issue with noise from other rooms or people.  Our third-floor room overlooked the side street alongside the hotel, which was probably quieter than than if we had been along the main street.

Used the hotel bar twice...once for drinks and appetizers and once to check out a Friday night band.  The food was good, the ambiance was great.  Prices are a little elevated compared to more local pubs/eateries in the immediate area.

We want to come back to Ireland; this will be our first choice of hotel when that happens!",5,2015,08,26
237,THE BEST...,"I just spent a lovely 3 nights here while on holiday.  As a first time visitor to Ireland, the staff could not have done more to help me see and enjoy everything this wonderful city has to offer!   Let's start with location.   Hotel is very close walking distance to 2 pedestrian bridges across the River Liffey and easy walk to all major sites including Temple Bar and Trinity College.   Many good restaurants and tour bus stops also very near.   The full Irish breakfast here is delightful.. be sure and try the vanilla french toast!  BEST.. the staff.. they generously took time to collect info and arranged great custom tour options for my group and gave us directions ..frequently!  I'm sorry I didn't get more of your names as several of you deserve mention.   Special appreciation to Jane Bridges for making this one of my best holidays ever!  ",5,2015,08,26
237,"Beautiful, splendid hotel","Service and a luxury guest experience are #1 at this hotel.  It is beautifully designed and classy, and you are a welcomed guest from the moment you walk in.  I had exceptional service from Adam, at the front desk, who showed me all the best things in Dublin, catered to my interests. Excellent staff, lovely hotel.   Worth the money to stay there- you won't regret it!",5,2015,08,26
237,Funky Hotel,"I stayed here for my sisters wedding which was at the hotel,from the moment we walked in to the Morrison we were greeted by extremely friendly staff who did their upmost to please,Food was excellent from canapés to the main courses,.the manager was there all night making sure my sister and husband wanted for nothing,above and beyond call of duty.The rooms are also very spacious for a city centre hotel and tastefully done,very modern.",5,2015,08,25
237,Nice rooms but no soundproof,The rooms are really nice and the hotel in general is really fancy. The only problem that I had is that the rooms are not soundproof at all. I was woken up 2 times because the doors of rooms when closing are slamming and they make too much noise. Voices can also come loud inside the room. Rather than that is a lovely hotel.,4,2015,08,25
237,Excellent stay,"I booked this through lastminute and chose the secret hotel deal. Paid just over £100 for room only which didn't matter as we left early to catch a plane. Room on the 4th floor, excellent room and service. Good location, walkable distance to shops, bars restaurants, Gaiety Theatre. Close to nightlife but it was quiet at night.",5,2015,08,25
237,Perfect Location to Temple Bar Area,"My Partner and I, and two other couples stayed at the Morrison Double Tree at the beginning of August for a weekend visit. The staff where extremely attentive to our needs, even when we asked to move rooms. The hotel itself was directly over the river from the Temple Bar area and the Grafton and Camden street (bar/restaurant area). It is also walking distance from the Guiness Factory and the Jamesons Factory, which came in VERY handy =)",4,2015,08,24
237,PURE MODERN LUXURY IN HEART OF DUBLIN!,"I can't fault this hotel....4star modern luxury on the river in the heart of Dublin! Staff are very friendly and the breakfast is excellent... Spotless fresh white room with soft purple lighting in every corner, including the wardrobes! 2 mins walk to temple bar, 15 min walk to Guinness tour and 20 mins walk to Phoenix park and dublin zoo.",5,2015,08,23
237,Family wedding following by a great day,"My brother and his partner recently had their wedding at the Morrison Hotel. I found the staff to be extremely helpful before, during and after the wedding. The staff at the Morrison went out of their way to facilitate us in whatever way they could which resulted in us all having an amazing day.  The next day we decided to stay and have lunch and Louis from the Brasserie continued with the excellent service and provided us with lovely ambiance, fabulous food and nothing was too big a problem! Well done to you all.  I live in Dublin and would never have thought to go into the Morrison  for food but I'll definitely be visiting again, their afternoon tea looked fab!",5,2015,08,23
237,"Family trip, great hotel!","We had a great time staying at The Morrison. The rooms are very clean and fresh, we love the colours too, it is very modern. The size of the room and the bed are just perfect for us with two small children. Shower and bath are very nice. The staff are friendly and very helpful.",5,2015,08,23
237,Excellent staff and a great location,"When I first checked into my room at the Morrison, I was already taking stars away from my review in my mind.  My husband and I stayed two nights at the Morrison on our last days in Ireland.  We have stayed at this hotel before and enjoyed it so we were looking forward to it.  We arrived around 1 pm and were pleased that our room was ready.  However, we were disappointed when we were given a handicap accessible room and saw that the bathroom was reminiscent of bathrooms in retirement homes and hospitals - very depressing and unlike everything else in this hotel.  One of the things we loved about our previous stay at the Morrison was the lovely shower! This bathroom had a tub with shower head that had no water pressure and was so slippery we were afraid of falling!  So disappointing! Hotels should tell guests in advance of their stay if they will be in a handicap accessible room and they did not request it.  Otherwise, we should have been offered a discount on this room because it was not to the standard we were expecting!  We would have booked another establishment had we known how awful our bathroom would be.  Now that that is out of the way....The Morrison is still a trendy, clean, quiet, well-located hotel.  Our bed was comfortable, and our room was very clean.  There are an interesting selection of channels on the TV. We paid for bed and breakfast and ate at the buffet both days.  We also had the option of ordering from a menu, but we chose not to do this.  The buffet offered a good range of hot and cold foods, and the food was good enough.  It's nice that the buffet opens at 7 am even on weekends, and we were able to eat at the hotel before catching our early flight home.  The staff is really what makes this hotel memorable.  We booked a taxi to the Dublin Airport with the Morrison's concierge. When we got to the airport, we discovered that we had left a backpack in the taxi. I phoned the Morrison, and the reception folks tracked down the driver through the taxi company, and he brought our bag, full of souvenirs, back to the airport.  We were so grateful!  Next time I will make sure to put in my reservation that the accessible room is not acceptable (unless I need one at that point).",4,2015,08,21
237,Very nice modern hotel in top location in Doublin,"Me and my wife spent few days in Morrison on our vacation in Ireland. The location is absolutely fantastic, just across the road from the Temple Bar district. All the main tourist attractions are accessible by foot (Doublin castle, City Hall etc). The rooms are very modern, comfortable and sophisticated with a lot of amenities. The bed is also comfortable. Reception is very friendly and very helpful with advices where to get food, go out, what to see etc.
The only point which was not that great is that the window from our room was not transparent, having a frosted glass, such that you cannot see what's outside, but you get some light thru it during the day. The reason for that was that the window from our room was apparently overlooking the hotel restaurant (we understood it by the sounds, as we were not able to open the windows either).
For me it is quite important to have a real window and look outside to see how the weather is, or just to have more light in the room. So it was quite a lowlight of the room. Other than that everything was really fantastic and we really enjoyed the stay.
I would still highly recommend this hotel!",4,2015,08,20
237,Unimpressive,Although the location was good the hotel and staff were nothing special. The staff at check-in was not very helpful from an informational perspective regarding Dublin. The room was nice but the beds and pillows were not comfortable which is unusual for a Hilton property. The safe malfunction during our stay and it took awhile for them to get access. Selection for dinner was limited although food offered was good. Staff in dining was friendly and service good. I expected more given price paid. Not a good value.,3,2015,08,20
237,Friendly staff & convenient location,"Stayed here while my daughter and I were visiting colleges.  The location is good, and we were able to walk to most places: Trinity College, good restaurants, etc.  It's just north of the river, so most of the places we went to we just had to cross the river and walk a few blocks.  The staff was super friendly, and we ended up getting an upgrade to a great, updated, comfortable room.  My favorite hotel in Dublin is the Westin, but this place probably has more value for the money.",4,2015,08,19
237,Amazing hotel and staff,"This is our second trip to the hotel but this time with our 8 year old. From the moment of check in the staff blew us away - straight away a welcome with drinks and cookies. Double upgrade of room FOC (as we had the little man!). The room was beautiful and we couldn't have wished for anything more. Jane (reservations manager) phoned ahead all of our other hotels we were visiting to make sure we had good rooms and a bed for our son. Then recommended restaurants for that nights meal. On checking out Jane brought us a breakfast selection and cookies for the journey while we waited for our taxi - fantastic, above and beyond - thank you so much!!!!!",5,2015,08,19
237,A disappointment,"Treated ourselves with a suite in this hotel. It was nice and spacious. Bed was good and the large bathromm was great. But we got disappointed after reading all the good things about the hotel. It is all about those things that just adds up to making us not consider it again.
- We arrived 2.30pm and room was not ready (nothing to say about that as inchecking is 3pm). We were told that we would get a call on the phone when room was ready - reception even checked the number. After waiting and waiting in a park, we went back and the staff said "" we have been looking for you"". We never received a call.
- Suite is a corner room with heavy traffic outside (we knew about the traffic). One window was not properly closed and could not be either. That made the traffic noise in room high.
- We had to repeatedly ask for refill of coffee and water (complementary in room)
- We had to repatedly ask for order form for in room breakfast
- In room breakfast: From average to way under. Juice is not juice but seemed like consentrate and water. One time with so much sugar that it was undrinkable. ""Fres fruit"" was one time really odd looking and tasted so old that it was not recommended to eat at all. 
- Several nights there was a noice coming from inside of hotel that sounded like a car with the engine on most of the nights. Have no idea what it was. Air condition in another room?
- We hang the sign ""Clean"" out on the door at 10am. Came back 2pm and had to wait in reseption for 1hour and had to run up and down several times to see if the room was ready.
- Wifi was extremely slow although the hotel says otherwise. It was like that on all devices even the hotels own tv. Both Wifi (the password protected and the open were slow)

This may seem little - but we spent a lot of money on the room and all those things made the stay average. We of course let the staff know some of it - and we got a refund on the breakfast bill (it may be a little cheap to not offer breakfast for the price of a suite, but that is another discussion). But if we should have complained every time things were not in order - the holiday would have been all about that. This hotel have a lot to work with!!

One positive thing though: Location!!!",2,2015,08,19
237,Contemporary comfort,"My husband and I agree that this was one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at.  We were quite taken aback on arrival, as the spacious, ultra-modern reception area gave us the feeling that this would be an impersonal sort of hotel.  Our one-week stay proved us completely wrong: the staff were, without exception, absolutely charming, unfailingly helpful, interested in what you were doing each day and faultless in their hospitality.
Breakfast was a delightful experience to start each day.  Free copy of the Irish Times, free bottled water each day in our room were unexpected little touches - as was the umbrella hanging in our wardrobe when we arrived (what a lovely idea!).
We would definitely stay here again if we re-visit Dublin in the future.",5,2015,08,18
237,Good location,"Just spent a long weekend in Dublin and stayed at The Morrison, excellent value for money, good facilities, lovely breakfast, all the staff were very polite, and could not do enough for you.

The hotel is ideally located for Temple Bar, shopping and you are close to some excellent restaurants.  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,08,18
237,Perfect night's stay,"Our first time stay at Morrisons, not the first visit to Dublin.  This is my new favourite Dublin hotel.  Excellent stay, very helpful staff, good nights sleep, great location!  Thank you for the free upgrade and welcoming warm cookie.",5,2015,08,18
237,"Great location, comfort ","We are just about to leave this hotel to head off on a driving holiday, we chose this hotel because of the excellent reviews about the location which were absolutely true, we walked every where temple bar was very close and stops for hop on off buses very close. We also chose this hotel because of the king beds offered and the fact that we had a 20 odd hour flight from Australia and wanted some comforts on arrival, we were not disappointed. Room was extremely roomy with all requirements. Staff at the desk were amazingly helpful and welcomed us in a very friendly helpful manner. We didn't eat here as we walked to many restaurants nearby. We would absolutely recommend this hotel but it is not a budget hotel.",5,2015,08,18
237,Excellent short break in Dublin,"Stayed at The Morrison for two days and could not fault the hotel. From the moment my wife and I walked in we were made to feel very welcome, with all the staff being extremely helpful throughout our stay. Our room had clearly been recently refurbished and was immaculate throughout. 
If you are looking for a quality hotel in an excellent location in Dublin then I would definitely recommend The Morrison.",5,2015,08,18
237,The hotel needs to decide its identity... a Hotel or a Pub.,"I stayed at The Morrison Hotel August 8 – August 16 2015, Room 133. During my trip to Dublin. After reading reviews of various hotels in Dublin, I found The Morrison to be on the scale I was looking for.

When we arrived the staff was very help full, our room was not yet ready, (We arrived early) the staff however took our suit cases and secured them. I was told they would call me when the room was ready, so we could go get something to eat. I asked the staff it see if there were any upgrades available.

We had not finished out lunch when the hotel called as advise us a room was ready and I could have an upgrade for $$ per night.  When we arrived back at the hotel, the luggage had already been taken up to the room and everything was set. I had and issue with the internet not working, called the front desk and they set someone up. (It was my mistake not theirs) Very fast service.

This was a good hotel in a very good location for sightseeing. Hotels restaurant was good, and worth visiting.

But I was let down by a few issues that brought my rating of the hotel down.

Our room,133, Street noise and pedestrian noise was very bad, it was as if the the vehicle traffic and pedestrian was walking around in the room.

 One evening we had a group of people blowing horns and cheering right under our window for hours. It appeared the hotel was hosting a party.

The wooded flooring in the room was damaged sometime before and a very bad repair was made, as a matter of fact, I got a splinter walking around in the room.

The night before we left, the hotel bar had what sounded like a live band playing, and out room was right over the bar area, needless to say sleep was not going to happen that night.

The hotel needs to decide its identity... a Hotel or a Pub. During check out I mentioned this to the desk clerk, ad was simply ""I will advise management"".

Visiting Ireland in the future, I would not consider to stay at this hotel again.",3,2015,08,17
237,Wonderful stay,"This is an amazing Hilton property.  Very european feel, wonderful breakfast, gorgeous, very clean rooms.   We are diamond members so breakfast was included but it was incredible.  Smoothies, smoked salmon, yogurts, and a cooked to order menu.  The location is very central.  You can walk to Temple Bar area in 5 minutes.  Loved every minute of our stay.  The staff are really helpful and nice as well.",5,2015,08,17
237,Perfect Getaway,"My fiancé and I took a quick trip to Dublin from London. The hotel was just a quick trip from the airport. To my surprise, the hotel was beautiful and modern on the outside. Although my fiancé booked the hotel for us, the staff was able to incorporate my HiltonHonors membership number and upgraded our room to the HHonors floor. Our room was lovely- very modern, clean, and well-appointed. We loved being within walking distance to attractions on both side of the river. The staff was very helpful- they called taxis for us when needed. Perfect for a weekend getaway. I will definitely stay here again!",5,2015,08,17
237,The World's Friendliest Staff! Great Location and Best Breakfast in Dublin!,"It's impossible to overstate just how friendly and helpful the staff was during our week-long stay! For example, when one of the front desk attendants realized that we needed to leave very early next the morning for an excursion,and would not be able to eat anything until lunch the next day, she arranged to have snack bags made for me, my wife, and our children. She surprised us with them the next morning. We could not believe someone would be so thoughtful and sincerely appreciated this gesture!

We rented two rooms, one was facing the courtyard and one was facing the street. Because of all of the activity in the courtyard, the street facing room was definitely quieter. 

The hotel is perfectly located and within easy walking distance to dining, shopping and everything we wanted to do and see. Additionally, is was very easy and convenient to get to all modes of transportation including tour buses and the train. 

We did not eat any meals other than breakfast at the hotel but I can honestly say that their breakfast's were outstanding in every way and once again staffed by cheerful, accommodating, friendly, and helpful people.

We were very pleased with our stay here and would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2015,08,16
237,Modern Hotel on the river Liffey,The room was ultra modern and comfortable.  The hotel is right across from the river from Temple Bar area.  We used the hotel as a stopgap to give us one more night in Dublin on our final night in Ireland (rather than stay at the airport).  It was a good choice.  We used none of the hotel's amenities other than the free Wifi so I really can't comment.,4,2015,08,15
237,Great Hotel in a good Location,"Excellent hotel located along on North side of the river but within easy walking distance of the city & bars/restaurants - would happily recoomend & stay again.  Very friendly & helpful staff.  Nice bar, restaurant & reception.  Very clean.  ",5,2015,08,14
237,Great Location matched with excellent & friendly service,"The hotel overlooks the Liffey & is opposite the Temple Bar district.  All of the staff have been exceptionally friendly and helpful.  The room we had was spacious, comfortable with all of the immenities that you'd expect.  Would recommend Dublin as City to visit and would absolutely recommend the Morrison as a great hotel to stay at.",5,2015,08,14
237,Well worth it,"Only stayed the one night, but would have happily stayed more.
Did a lot of research on hotels in Dublin - location, comfort, reviews and price
Yes it is does cost slightly more, but was worth it.
We had a standard King size room and the room was larger than I thought it was going to be. The breakfast was one of the best I have had at a hotel.
Reception staff were excellent - Think it was Darren who recommended The Church just up the road as somewhere to eat and thanks for that as it was just right (bonus hotel gets 15% off with their Dublin Passport book)

We have stayed is some nice hotels over the years and varying prices and to quote my wife ""one of the best overall hotels she has stayed at""",5,2015,08,13
237,A great choice,"The Morrison is well situated for a short stay in Dublin and we were delighted with our choice.  Arriving by car isn't easy because the main entrance is on a busy street with little parking space outside.  But any worries were soon set aside as Darren and Adam, the charming and very knowledgeable concierge team sprang to our assistance.   They proved to be a reliable source of local information and advice and we really appreciated  their enthusiasm and knowledge, not to mention their sense of humour!

Our room on the 4th HHonours floor was clean, fresh and well maintained, though a little tight on space.  It was fine for a couple of nights, even if the ""pinch points"" did get a little irritating when we were both trying to get ready to go out.

There's a great selection of breakfast dishes and the buffet is frequently replenished with fresh items.  Service here is good, too, and throughout the hotel we found the staff to be friendly and attentive.

In all, the only real shortcoming we identified was the lack of adjacent parking.  Making use of the public car park down the street didn't worry us unduly but the busy one way traffic system in the area does mean that it can take quite a while to manage the parking operation.

We'd recommend The Morrison without hesitation.",5,2015,08,12
237,Quite good,"The place is nice, people are very kind and everything is clean. However, I do not feel like it is worth the money I paid. Breakfast food is not very good and there is not much variety. As for the room, it was all right except for the bathroom. The toilet was hideous, our sink was useless and the hairdryer was broken.
It is a good place were to stay, but I wouldn't rate it as a 5-star hotel.",3,2015,08,12
237,Goods and not so goods,"Modern and friendly hotel in the most central location possible for Dublin. Accross the bridge for Temple Bar, one block from O`Connell Street. Except for Guinnes and the Gaol, all attractions are in the surroundings. The location is the best thing in the hotel. There are other good items, staff is pleasant, wifi is good and breakfast is also fine. Parking is close up the street, not in the building.
The modern room, however, was kind of small, with not enough places to storage things (like drawers and hanging hooks). It is called King River View room, and the view was there, beautiful, but the bed is in fact Queen size, 1,60m wide. When asked about the reception informed that they call this bed a King - all right, but King is 1,98 m wide. It would not fit in the room, anyway. The bed was on the other hand very comfortable.
We had two issues at the reception, in one of them the receptionist asked the night before to have a taxi scheduled for the airport at 06:30 next morning simply did not do it. Had to find one in the street.
Stayed two days; two weeks earlier we (couple) stayed two days at the Radisson Blue Golden Lane, at exactly the same price and a slightly inferior location, but would prefer the Radisson for another stay.",3,2015,08,12
237,Superb Hotel,"Stayed for my 60th birthday and enjoyed the most fantastic stay. The hotel location is great, right in the middle of everything. 
Hotel staff were the most pleasant, helpful and charming I have ever experienced. Absolutely nothing was to much trouble and every request carried out with a warm smile. 
I have to mention Mark Macintosh in the bar/restaurant what a fella looked after the two of us and was a great laugh and made us very welcome.
Overall I can not fault this hotel and it would always be my first choice for any future visit to Dublin 
Thank you Jane Bridge for looking after us. 
M Nolan",5,2015,08,11
237,Outstanding stay,"Had an amazing 4 night stay in this hotel at the beginning of July 2015.
From the second we arrived we were heartily welcomed and made to feel right at home. Nothing was too much trouble for the entire stay. All members of staff were excellent - from front desk, restaurant, bar and cleaning staff - but in particular thanks to Darren (Concierge) who was a fountain of local knowledge and particularly kind and helpful to my family members who had flown in from all corners.
Location of the hotel is fantastic right on the north bank of the River Liffey in close walking distance to all major tourist landmarks.
Rooms were tastefully done, clean and airy with a distinct boutique feel.
The welcome cookie was also gorgeous. Good job all around. I hope to return.",5,2015,08,10
237,One of the Best Hilton Properties Ever,"My wife and I stayed at the Morrison and found it to be one of the very best Hilton properties we have ever stayed in.  Everything from the quality of the room, the service, the restaurant, the staff and the location were outstanding.  We reserved a King Junior Suite and it was amazing.  Although in a very old building, the hotel is very modern and extremely clean.  Our room was very very large and although not having a clear view of the River Liffey, we had a small balcony that we could go out on and enjoy the fresh air and see some of Dublin.  The bathroom was extremely large and contained all the amenities one could ask for.  Everything about the room was first rate.  The staff could not have been nicer or more helpful.  From recommendations on restaurants, to sites not to be missed, to suggested tours, they were always happy to help.  The location of the hotel is perfect for visiting the city.  We walked almost everywhere we went, although we did take a taxi to dinner once and another taxi to return from the prison after visiting there.  Other than these two times, we walked everywhere.  As far as the restaurant, the breakfast that was included in our rate was outstanding.  A full selection of anything you could ask for on the hot and cold buffet, plus several items that could be ordered off the menu at no extra charge. Although we did not eat in the main dining area, we did enjoy an afternoon drink there and thoroughly enjoyed the ambience. All in all, we loved our stay at the Morrison and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2015,08,10
237,"Good Hotel, Good Location, Excellent Service","The hotel is modern and pleasant enough. Rooms are nice, with modern decor and we enjoyed our bathroom and amenities. He location is right on the river, across form Temple Bar. 
What we really enjoyed about the hotel was the service. Friendly  and efficient from the front desk to the restaurant staff, to the bellmen. They seem to enjoy their work and are happy and eager to please. 
As a a hhonors Diamond member we received comp breakfast and I believe evryio e gets comp wifi. 
The rate we payed was high and would have seen overpriced if it were not for the friendly service. Will probably try a different hotel next time.",4,2015,08,10
237,Short Trip,"A very brief stay at this pleasant centrally-located hotel.
Had to eat on the restaurant as my late arrival meant places outside were closing.  Good was fine and the bill reasonable.
Good buffet breakfast priced a bit more keenly than most which was nice.
First floor room was fine but lacked a bath - I prefer them to showers.
Overall a very reasonably- priced stay.
Would stay here again.",4,2015,08,10
237,GREAT LOCATION,"We arrived at DUB at 0830 and took a cab straight to the hotel. No problem locking up our bags and giving recommendations on where to eat. The hotel is in about as great a location as one can ask for. The bridge to temple bar is less than a block, the view of the River Liffey was great, O'Connell street is two blocks over and the nights were quiet. Free Wi-Fi worked fine for us. I would recommend this location as well as stay here again.",5,2015,08,09
237,Excellent ,"Rooms very spacious clean and full of all the mod cons. Situated in the heart of dublin city centre. 

All staff from cleaning to bar staff very friendly and polite.

The hotel food and bar are exceptional.

We will be back",5,2015,08,09
237,Great location - very nice hotel,"This hotel is in a great location - literally right across the river from the Temple Bar.  It is ultra modern with lots of pinks and purples and interesting lighting, so if you are looking for a more traditional Dublin experience, this would not be for you.  We opted for a Junior Suite, and we couldn't believe how big and roomy it was.  One odd thing:  the door to the bathroom is glass with just some opaque parts, so that's a bit weird.  I suggest a higher floor (we were on the Mezzanine level) so as to avoid being bothered by any street noise.  The front desk personnel were very friendly and helpful.",4,2015,08,06
237,An excellent hotel with friendly staff in the heart of the city,"We stayed for one night at the Morrison and we are left with the best impressions. The general décor was modern and pleasant,  the room was spacious, very clean and fully equipped. The location is so convenient if you want to see the important sites of the city. Breakfast was very good and the waiters polite. Finally we want to make the most positive remarks about the gentleman at the reception (with short blond hair – unfortunately I do not recall the name) who was so courteous and helpful. If we are ever again in Dublin, we will stay at the Morrison.

Costas, Limassol, Cyprus",5,2015,08,06
237,Modern chic,"Stayed here under a last minute reservation. 
The room was internal view which disappointingly was no view...just a curtain. The bed was comfy and funky decor was nice and modern. The reception area was lovely and a warm area to relax and take it all in

 Hotel is well located....close to temple bar and oconnell. Traffic around the quays is mental so better to avoid driving if possible.",4,2015,08,05
237,Dublin trip,"The Morrison has an excellent location, walking distance from all the main shops, attractions, and bars. The hotel is very clean and the room are all remodeled and quite comfortable. The breakfast is excellent too. 
However...Don't believe the desk staff when they say they will order you a car to the airport. Or if they tell you the cabby will accept visa. 
We ordered a car at 11am for a noon pickup and it didn't show up until 12:30pm. The staff even called them three times. Then, after confirm with the staff that cab would take visa (since we had no more euros left), and the desk person insisted that ALL their approved drivers do, of course he did not. So on top of getting a late start, we had to find an ATM. ",4,2015,08,05
237,Great hotel with a great location ,"This hotel has everything you could want . On site parking , baggage help from the lobby to the room , very nice spacious rooms , etc. 

Nice bar and food that was very good . Service was friendly and helpful . 

Tour buses picked up here . 

I could go on, but this is a very nice place . ",4,2015,08,04
237,Good hotel. Funky decor,Good hotel. Great location. Helpful staff. Funky décor--lots of written quotes on the wall. It is supposed to look hip... doesn't do it for me. Wifi was excellent. Breakfast was good but not included in stay.,4,2015,08,04
237,Nice hotel,"Hotel is great for business, the hotel has recently undergone a revamp so the rooms are very trendy and modern. Breakfast was great with good variety and quality. Restaurant also lovely with a view onto the canal.

Service in general was ok, if you arrive early for check in you unlikely to get a room until check in time which is not great, we often book an extra night just for this, so they are not helpful in this regard.",4,2015,08,03
237,"Nice hotel, convenient location, good breakfast","Lovely, modern hotel in a convenient location.  Walkable to all Dublin sights.  A short walk from the airport bus, although a return taxi to the airport was under 25 euros.  Excellent breakfast, which is free if you are a Hilton Gold member.  Helpful front desk.",5,2015,08,03
237,Excellent staff and services ,"I recently spent a week in dublin. 
The Morrison Hotel was amazing boutique feel lovely rooms food restaurants. 
Staff very kind and helpful especially Darren in reception nothing was any trouble really appreciate it and Mark at the bar for his kindness and help. 
I will be back for sure. 
Once again we loved Dublin!! ☺😊😀😂",5,2015,08,03
237,Great stay,"Stayed here with several friends as we wrapped up our golf trip throughout Ireland and what a great stay it was. Very professional employees, comfortable rooms and great food at their restaurant. Centrally located and only a mile from Guinness, you can definitely find what you are looking for close by.",5,2015,08,02
237,Yet again..... Exceptional.,"I was asked by one of my colleagues to book 6 rooms in Dublin for the night and only 1 hotel came to mind.
Everything about the Morrison is exceptional !
Just one small thing... I have been trying to sign up for the Hilton honours but have had no luck, even after speaking directly to the club on numerous occasions. While at the hotel I did ask a member of staff to look into it, so here's fingers crossed.

I look forward to my return",5,2015,07,31
237,"Fabulous location, nice hotel and excellent breakfast","Expensive but nice. We had 2 rooms for 2 nights, not adjoining but right next door to each other.  Very clean, modern and comfortable.  Discount parking was a half  block away ($12/day).  

Easy walking distance across the bridge to Temple Bar, Trinity, and restaurant row.  Far but fun walk to the Guinness Factory (took a cab back!) Interesting, diverse  neighborhood (i.e. Asian restaurants, tattoo parlors, and something called the ""PantiBar"") immediately surrounding the hotel.

Breakfast buffet had the usual but included anything a la carte - lovely smoked salmon platter!  Staff were friendly and helpful.

We'd certainly stay here again if we return to Dublin.",4,2015,07,29
237,SUCH A GREAT WELCOME,"Booked 2 rooms when going to a wedding close by.  Had asked for early check-in.  When we arrived (early), the woman who greeted us (Jean I think) was so friendly and helpful. She gave us a really nice room and when she saw that my son had a baby, she upgraded them to a suite.  We were able to go to our rooms straight away and get ready for the wedding.  Breakfast was super - endless choice and freshly prepared scrambled egg with smoked salmon was delicious.  All staff were efficient and helpful.  Of course, this hotel is in the city centre and close to everything.",5,2015,07,29
237,Business trip - midweek,Recommended this hotel by a colleague and it was well worth it. The hotel was excellent in every way - from service staff to facilities and food/drink etc. Would definitely stay here again. Well done. Top marks.,5,2015,07,29
237,"Great Location, Awesome Staff",Hotel is in an excellent location. Dublin is a very walkable city. The rooms are spacious and decorated in a modern decor.  The staff was attentive and friendly. They gave us some great recommendations where the locals eat. Highly recommend this hotel!,5,2015,07,28
237,Great staff,"Staff are the jewel in the crown for this hotel. Dissapointed not to recieve reward points for my stay as I did not book directly. Having stayed at other Hilton hotels, I felt the room was basic with a poor selection in the mini bar. Not great value for money.",3,2015,07,27
237,"Fantastic, first time in Dublin","Stayed on a Saturday night and was impressed by the hotel throughout. The decor is modern and contemporary with a sophisticated feel. The rooms are good size with good attention to detail including free safe, iron, hairdryer, shoehorn, umbrella and every other amenity you could ask for. 

I have stayed in several 'better' hotels that have far worse offerings for breakfast. Plentiful with fresh smoothies, bread selection, omelettes etc. The fitness center was ample by city hotel standards and the wifi was better than average (and free). Concierge was also helpful with directions.

One thing i could point out to be improved is for those approaching who are not familiar with the city it can be difficult to spot with a lack of signage outside. Easy to miss but i understand the wish to look modern and discreet.
Would return again in a heartbeat.",5,2015,07,26
237,Good couple of stays - minus the food,"I stay in this hotel when my usual one is unavailable in Dublin. It is of good quality, the staff are friendly and as with all Double Trees, the cookie on arrival always goes down a treat. The rooms are spacious and modern with great lighting and little though about details such as a pull out shelf beside the mirror to rest your straighteners/etc on whilst getting ready. Which is also conveniently located beside a plug! The bathrooms are large and well stocked. My only problem is that the breakfast is sometimes lacking, in that many items will be gone from the hot buffet and they are not replaced quickly. Also during a stay in the last couple of weeks, the room service menu was different to what used to be in place, it seemed to be coming from the restaurant rather than the bar, so it was rather fussy compared to what you would really want from room service (i.e. simple and easy food). Aside from that recent issue, I always have enjoyed my stay.",4,2015,07,26
237,"Clean, pleasant, good location","A nice place right by the river with good service, good restaurant, and a friendly bar but smallish rooms and gym subcontracted out to a local place down the street (due to reconstruction I think) detract from what is otherwise an acceptable business hotel.",3,2015,07,25
237,A Central Hotel,"This is a centrally located accommodation on the north bank of the River Liffey just opposite Temple Bar.  Rooms are spacious and decorated in contemporary style and the art works around the public spaces are phenomenal and unique.  Our visit was in June of this year.  
The owner has done an outstanding job of making your stay at this hotel a totally guest-oriented experience.  The staff is amazing from the minute you step into the lobby to your departure.  A special mention and thank you to Darren and Piotr who were our saviors in Dublin.",5,2015,07,20
237,"LOVED this hotel, fabulous setting, location and staff","We arrived on Friday and were immediately met at the door by a chap who offered to help with our bags, check in was quick and our rooms were ready.  We were given our warm chocolate cookies (wow!!) and went up to unpack .. lovely size rooms with huge bathroom.  Very comfortable beds and lots of wardrobe space including free safe and full size iron and ironing board, bathrobes, slippers and umbrella!  Loved the hair straightener 'shelf' which slid out above the plug!

We ended up staying in the hotel bar in the afternoon as it was raining so much - it was no hardship as the cocktail list was extensive and the wine list a good price! We chatted to Lewis the Restaurant and Bar Manager about places to eat and not only did he recommend a fabulous Thai Restaurant close by (Koh) - but he went and reserved a table for us! He obviously recommended the restaurant in the hotel too - and we went there for dinner on the Saturday night - it was well worth a visit, and I will review it separately.  There were a duo playing as they have live music on a Friday and Saturday night (called The Prelude), they were brilliant and the bar was full which was a great atmosphere .. one of the staff went and reserved a table in the bar while we finished our meal so we could go and watch the band after.

I would definitely recommend this hotel and would love to go and stay again - the staff are a credit to the Company, all friendly and helpful.  Brilliant location for Temple Bar and shopping - just go!",5,2015,07,20
237,Loved this hotel. Perfect Location. Lovely Rooms. Awesome Service.,"We spent a total of 5 non-consecutive nights at this hotel a couple of weeks ago. The location is perfect, almost immediately across a bridge outside the hotel and you're at the entrance to the Temple Bar area (Without the noise of the hotels in Temple Bar itself). Dublin is small and this is sort of right in the middle with major sites and areas within walking distance in all directions.

We were in both a regular River View room and a corner river-view suite...both were very well appointed and comfortable with all the amenities you could need. (If you can swing getting in one of the corner river view suites, you may not ever want to leave Dublin...truly awesome room in terms of spaciousness, elegance and light/views from the windows.

The staff went above and beyond everytime we interacted with them.

We also thought breakfast was really well done, top notch and certainly had the best Irish Brown/Soda bread we had on the trip. (And we tried it at many spots around town.)

It's definitely one of the more expensive hotels, but we didn't regret that at all once the experience was complete.

I WANT TO GO BACK AND LIVE IN ONE OF THOSE CORNER ROOMS FOREVER!!!",5,2015,07,17
237,Wonderful family stay,"Can't rate this hotel highly enough. Staff were wonderful and very helpful. Welcome cookie in arrival and tea and coffee whilst we waiting was a nice touch. The rooms were clean, well designed and equipped. Had a very comfortable nights sleep. Breakfast was excellent - plenty of choice and a comfortable atmosphere. Would recommend this hotel",5,2015,07,16
237,"Very comfortable hotel,  friendly staff","The Morrison Hotel is incredibly well situated in Dublin - in the center of everything, right on the river across from Temple Bar.  You can walk in every direction and find shopping, restaurants, pubs, museums.  It's great.  The hotel is super trendy but very comfortable.  The staff are lovely.  Although I did not eat in the restaurant, it looked very nice and the bar was hopping.  We would definitely stay here again.  Breakfast is not included, but it's not expensive. - maybe 12 Euro.  My brother-in-law had breakfast when he arrived from the States at 7am and said it was awesome.",5,2015,07,16
237,"Nice Hotel, Uncomfortable Bed","The hotel is great overall with a friendly staff.  They give you cookies and water at reception plus a map of Dublin.  The location is great - super convenient.  The mini bar has the best snacks.  The rooms/hotel was also quiet.  The not so good aspects: (1) Parking is in another building, which I didn't see on the website and I think there are certain hour restrictions to access the car there.  (2) The bed was hard.  I could sleep but not very comfortable.  (3) The toilet was weirdly really hard to flush.",3,2015,07,15
237,Good value for money,Good hotel at the heart of the city. Staff was supportive and helpful. You will find all services you would expect. It is definitely good value for money. You will not regret staying at The Morrison Hotel.,4,2015,07,14
237,"Location, Service, Quality; Why Stay Anywhere Else?!?","I stayed two nights at the Morrison at the conclusion of my road trip across Ireland and am glad that I did. The Morrison is located just across the Millennium Bridge from the Temple Bar district and is an easy 20-25 minute walk from the Guinness Storehouse; but then again, Dublin is a pretty walkable city. The front desk was friendly and very helpful in providing restaurant recommendations and taxi reservations. My room was originally set up with 2 twin beds, but they conveniently pushed the beds together and brought in a King mattress for me while I was out. Although the nightly rate is about $250, I think the Morrison provides value with its location and quality of service and rooms; additionally, this is about the average rate for comparable hotels in the area. Overall, I would definitely stay with the Morrison again if I were in Dublin.",5,2015,07,14
237,Perfect location!,"The front desk people were very helpful with euros and getting us smaller bills as well as where we could get travelers checks cashed!  downside the cookies were not like the cookies we usually get! But the place was very nice cool decor.  Breakfast was great and nice to choose from menu as well fresh, fresh juice!",5,2015,07,13
237,An Excellent Option when in Dublin,"We were not expecting much since our opinion of DoubleTrees hotels was just being an affordable lodging option.  We were totally surprised with how nice the hotel was with its sophisticated modern interiors.  The staff at the front desk, restaurant, and bar were all VERY friendly and helpful.  The included breakfast was very tasty as opposed to the usually soggy scrambled eggs and limp bacon free breakfasts we are used to.  The location of the hotel is also excellent as it is convenient to exploring Dublin North or South of the Liffy.  I would definitely stay there again if visiting Dublin.  We usually stay at Marriott hotels but we may have just been converted.",5,2015,07,13
237,Lovely stay in Dublin,"We very much enjoyed our time at the Morrison. The staff was attentive and friendly. The lobby was welcoming and gracious. The room was clean and the furnishings fully updated and modern. All of our needs were fully met. A single exception was a wedding which took place just down from our room. The event was loud, as good weddings should be, and went quite well into the night. Short of being invited to the festivities, which would have been fun, I think that the hotel should have tried to accommodate room changes such that hotels guests who were not invited to the nuptials didn't feel like they were unwelcome guests at the reception. Other than that we very much enjoyed our stay.",5,2015,07,13
237,Stay in Ireland,There could not be a better location when staying in Dublin.  This hotel is right on the river and next to Temple Bar.  The breakfast in the hotel is a great way to start your day before a busy day of site seeing.,4,2015,07,13
237,Excellent stay in Dublin!,"My friend and I had a great 3 night stay here to kick off our 12 day trip to Ireland. The staff were lovely (and being greeted by a warm cookie doesn't hurt!), and the hotel is modern and chic and ideally located close to everything, but just out of the mayhem of Temple Bar. Despite there being private parties in the restaurant downstairs on several of the nights, as soon as you are upstairs you here nothing! Nice to come back to a quiet ""home"" after exploring all day.",4,2015,07,12
237,Very Nice Hotel Close to River & Temple Bar,"We enjoyed the last two days of our honeymoon here.  The lobby is plush, modern & represents the hotel well.  The rooms are much the same, though a bit small.  Located just across the bridge is Temple Bar, a short walk away is St. Stephen's Green, Trinity College & a short Uber ride away is Kilmainham Goal, Glasnevin Cemetery & everything you're looking for in Dublin.  The breakfast spread was a hot buffet, in addition to select menu items as well as croissants, toast by request and hot coffee, tea, juice, etc.  The staff was extremely friendly.  And they also left us some sweets in the room as a honeymoon gift.  There is a safe in the room, as well as mini fridge, ironing board/iron, hair dryer, etc.  I really enjoyed the stay here & will probably be back the next time I go to Dublin.",5,2015,07,12
237,Comfort and Convenience under the Euroglitz,"My wife and I chose this Dublin hotel for the first stop on our trip to Ireland. It was right on the river Liffey, a perfect location for exploring both the North and South sides of the city. 

When we first arrived in the room, we were a little surprised by some of the decorating touches - colored lights that came on as accents along with the bedside lighting, for example, but you quickly get used to this unique 'look' i as you realize how comfortable and quiet the room is. 

Service was thoughtful and efficient, and the desk was happy to provide us with any assistance we required. It was the perfect start to our vacation.",4,2015,07,09
237,"Excellent Staff, Well Located, Room a bit Small","We had absolutely perfect service at the Morrison, from the front desk staff, to the concierge to the wait staff. The rooms are charming, though a bit small for the price, and the twin beds are tiny. Our air conditioner was too loud with an underlying whining noise that drove us a bit crazy as we were jet-lagged and sleeping poorly. The bathroom door made a horribly loud noise and when we complained, they fixed it immediately. The Eggs Benedict at the Breakfast Restaurant was the best I've ever had (and I've had a lot of Eggs Benedict). Well located. Convenient. Fairly priced.",4,2015,07,09
237,great hotel,Its a good hotel but not enough for the high price we paid. Very plain and simple lobby was nothing compare to other hotel in the same price range. When you step out of the lobby you step right into the street.,4,2015,07,08
237,reunion trip to Dublin,"absolutely brilliant stay x Staff were friendly and very helpful x Full marks to Darren on reception he was an absolute gem, nothing was too much trouble for this guy, if everyone had Darren then their stay in any hotel would be such a blessing. He was so helpful and gave us lots of info on different places to see. Sorting out timetables for us.",4,2015,07,08
237,Excellent hotel perfectly located!,"We found our stay at The Morrison to be absolutely perfect.  We were greeted warmly when we checked in, and offered tourist information if we needed it.  The room was very modern and comfortable.  It was spotlessly clean when we checked in, and well stocked with towels (I hate it when you have to beg for more towels....no begging here!). We happened to be at the back of the building, and on the mezzanine level, so our view wasn't great...but it didn't matter as all we did was sleep when we were there.  And we were hardly ever there because the location of the hotel was so awesome.  Just a quick walk, and there was shopping and points of historic interest.  Cross the river and with just a few steps we were in the Temple Bar area.  The Hop-On-Hop-Off sightseeing busses and city transport all have stops very close to the hotel if you need to use them.  It was a perfect home base for our first ever trip to Dublin.  We never ate at the hotel restaurant, so I can't speak to the service/value/quality of that, but it appeared to be well visited by other hotel guests.  When we checked out, the front desk was kind enough to hold our bags while we did some last sightseeing before leaving the area and made sure we were taken care of in terms of transportation to our next stop. Everyone we encountered at the hotel was friendly and knowledgeable. I'd definately recommend this hotel for the location alone; the nice staff makes it even better.",5,2015,07,07
237,Fantastic hotel,"The best hotel I ever stayed in. The room was stylishly decorated in purple and white and very modern.    It was Christmas time so there were beautiful decorations all over the hotel.   For breakfast there was so much to choose from,  the selection was fantastic.  The hotel is situated a short walk from the Jervis shopping centre which leads onto Dublins main shopping streets.  I would have no hesitation in staying here again.",5,2015,07,07
237,"Comfortable rooms, great breakfast","The rooms at the Morrison are updated and very comfortable. Parking is available although I did not use it. The hotel is centrally located so walking and easy access, right out the front door, to public transportation is very good for all city locations. The breakfast offered is wonderful, both a buffet and menu choices are available. A great place for a quiet stay that we will definitely use again when in Dublin.",4,2015,07,07
237,Relaxing place to rest your head.,"Air conditioning! So incredible to have air conditioning. Beds were soft, and you get more than one pillow per single bed. Water pressure was great, didn't have to stand there for a long time to rinse out shampoo. The staff are very friendly and willing to help out wherever they can. Location was great. Couldn't hear any night life noise. Would stay here again.",5,2015,07,07
237,Excellent Hotel - Perfect Location for Seeing Dublin,"Hotel is situated in an excellent location across the river from Temple Bar area.  Close enough, yet far enough to avoid noise and late night antics.  Check-in was seamless, although there was a wait to get into the room at 2:30 or so.  Room was large, clean and modern.  Bathroom was huge based on European standards.  Service was efficient and cheerful.  Would stay again next time in Dublin.",5,2015,07,07
237,"An Excellent, Modern Hotel in the Center of Dublin","Right on the River Liffey sits the Morrison DoubleTree, an old building that has been completely redone in modern decor that is striking, a little quirky, and welcoming.  My wife and I spent five nights there for Bloomsday festivities, and we loved the friendliness of the staff, the comfortable and quiet room with up-to-date bathroom, and decor of the public areas.  Free WiFi reception was good throughout.  The music in the bar and dining area was a little loud for us older folks, but the food was good enough to make up for it.  Their breakfasts are especially good and generous.  We highly recommend the Morrison DoubleTree.",5,2015,07,07
237,outstanding,The most amazing place to stay in Dublin. The hotel is very modern but what makes it stand out are the staff!! Anita and Michilina(?) and the other F&B staff and front desk went out of there way to help us and make our stay wonderful. The hotel is perfectly located in the center city!!!,5,2015,07,07
237,"A central, stylish and friendly hotel ",We were visiting Dublin for just one night so wanted somewhere central. The Morrison delivers - right on the banks of the Liffey across the river from Temple Bar it's perfectly located. The room was gorgeous - comfortable and stylish. When we arrived at 10am the reception staff were welcoming (we each got a warm cookie!) We left our bags and the gave us maps and advised us where to visit. Highly recommended.,5,2015,07,06
237,Best Hotel I have ever stayed in,"This hotel will cater to your every need. The staff are helpful, friendly and remember me every time i visit on business. Every time i visit i am surprised and delighted with a cookie on arrival, a sweet treat brought up to my room and occasionally a room upgrade.  The best part is the reception staff-  they make everything easy for you.",5,2015,07,06
237,Lovely and modern,"We had a difficult time finding the hotel, but once there we completely enjoyed our stay. The room was spacious and very clean, the staff incredibly friendly and helpful and the location ideal for exploring the city. The buffet breakfast was incredible and so beautifully arranged. I'd highly recommend The Morrison and would absolutely stay there again. ",5,2015,07,05
237,GREAT HOTEL,"The hotel is wonderful. Staff was extremely nice. Wonderful location. Don't miss it!
The room was great, breakfast too. Right in front of the river, next to a bridge taht
conects the two parts of Dublin.",5,2015,07,05
237,Worth that extra Penny,"Hotel was very lovely, 24 hr reception staff and very helpful in basically everything. 

Great location, walkable to really anywhere you needed to be. 

Room would always be cleaned no matter how much time was given to clean it. 
 
Loved our stay in Dublin!!",5,2015,07,05
237,Loved It,"This is a brilliant hotel which hits every mark. Just perfect location with reduced-priced parking nearby. Rooms are big enough and well furnished in a modern style. What sets this hotel apart though is it's wonderful staff - completely charming and welcoming and full of useful information, wittily imparted. ",5,2015,07,04
237,Very good hotel in a great location,"We spent two nights here in mid May 2015 and really enjoyed the experience. It is centrally located on the River Liffey, with Temple Bar just across the river and the main shopping precinct less than 5 minutes walk away. Restaurants and bars abound all around. The room was modern and functional. Breakfast was more than adequate and similar to other hotels of this standard. Staff were cheerful and helpful. We would be happy to stay here again.",5,2015,07,04
237,Great hotel with central location.,Loved the Morrison Hotel where I stayed for two nights in June. The rooms are well decorated with coffee maker and free wifi. The bathrooms are large and well equipped. The Breakfast room is a beauty with lovely art work. Would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2015,07,02
237,"Great stay, with extremely helpful staff, and a great location","In the heart of Dublin City Centre, you're walking distance to all the sights.  The rooms are large, roomy and quiet.  The staff is attentive, and responded to our every need.  Even if there was a little issue now and then, they resolved it.  The only time there was a problem was when a wedding celebration in the courtyard went into the wee hours of the morning, but staff had already informed us it was happening, so we were prepared.  I'd stay there again any time.",5,2015,07,02
237,Becoming my favourite hotel in Dublin....,"Great central location on the banks of the river Liffey - as its a Doubletree you get the warm cookie at check in, which is always welcomed!

Rooms very spacious and bright / clean.

Breakfast great and very friendly bar staff. Will be back again....",4,2015,07,02
237,Thoroughly Modern,Very modern hotel with great location-just across the river from the Temple Bar area. Very friendly and competent staff. Close to the Tram line. Very reasonably priced parking garage nearby. Several excellent restaurants within 5-10 minute walking distance.,5,2015,07,02
237,Short birthday visit to Dublin,"My husband and I stayed at The Morrison for three nights to celebrate my birthday and we were pleased with our choice. The best asset of this hotel is its location. It is a short taxi ride from the airport and it is very close to Temple Bar. You can easily walk to quite a few tourist attractions as well as great shopping streets. It is also close to lots of bars and restaurants and overlooks the river. For my birthday dinner we went to The Winding Stair which was recommended by the hotel and was very good and within walking distance.
Our check in was ok, the lady at the front desk was not very friendly and did not explain about the free wifi but gave us our complimentary warm cookie (a Double Tree standard) and when I asked that she check my dinner reservation she did do it and called up to the room letting me know it was done.
Our room was on the first floor with view of the building in front and no balcony. I had requested a quiet room when I made my booking. Unfortunately as it was on the first floor, on Friday night we could hear music which we guess was coming from the bar downstairs and there was also noise coming from the street outside.
The room itself was a good size with a large comfortable double bed although the pillows were a little hard ( in our opinion). There was a large flat screen tv and the decor was modern with purple lights. They provided slippers, bathrobes, free water bottles, tea and coffee making facilities and they even left us a nice plate of fruit and macaroons for my birthday. The bathroom was also a good size but there was no shower only a bathtub and it did not  we have  a hand held shower.There is not a lot of closet space and there are no drawers but there are cupboards with shelves and for a 3 night stay it was fine. 
Check out was fine although we did notice throughout our stay that there were not very good English speakers among the members of the front desk staff.
We did not include breakfast in our daily rate as it was expensive however on our last morning we decided to pay for breakfast at the hotel and the food was very good. All in all a very pleasant stay and we will stay again provided the rate is good.",4,2015,07,01
237,Dublin in the finest,"The hotel is excellent, the location is fantastic and the staff is superb.  We were within walking distance of shopping, sightseeing and attractions.  The restaurant has excellent dinning, we elected to dine there each evening we were in Dublin.",5,2015,06,30
237,Beautiful Hotel in a great location,"I was lucky enough to win a competition for 1 nights stay here and to watch Kodaline play live at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham.
What a beautiful hotel, lovely room, very spacious, with a great interior. In fact the whole hotel was very modern and stylish.
Just a short walk over the bridge to the Temple Bar area, which we were grateful for when we staggered back after a great night watching a fantastic band then partying.
I would certainly stay here again, as I feel I need to revisit this fabulous city again.
Breakfast was very nice as well, especially liked the fresh orange juice.",5,2015,06,30
237,Anniversary Getaway in Dublin,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Morrison.

It is very well located - just a few steps from Temple Bar, the Jamesons Museum & the shops.

It is a plush boutique hotel with very comfortable rooms - if not a little quirky as our room had lyrics across the wall from a Hothouse Flowers song!

There were a few conferences & events on when we were there & its location makes it a good venue for business.",4,2015,06,30
237,Another great stay at the Morrison,I can't recommend this hotel highly enough. The staff are so welcoming and helpful. They are all a credit to Jane the manager. I have only been to Dublin twice and stayed here both times and I will only look at this hotel if I return. The surroundings are always spotlessly clean and the bar staff are very quick serving and the prices aren't too high for the hotel. The rooms are spacious and again spotless and you don't even need to bring toiletries as they always have lovely ones supplied. Thank you again for a lovely weekend,5,2015,06,30
237,Wonderful,"We stayed here when first arriving in Ireland.  The staff was very helpful and the desk even helped me with my sim card change in my cell phone.  The room was top notch, bed very comfy especially after a long flight from the USA .  Short walk to Temple Bar and without the noise of the T B district.  We would stay here again and would recommend this hotel to others.",5,2015,06,28
237,Great hotel at the right price,Great hotel in a very convenient location in Dublin.  Within walking distance of all the major sites and convenient for all forms of public transport including the airport bus.  Nice bright new interior with some really stylish artwork throughout including in the rooms.  Breakfast was great - much better then average - with both buffet style and a good selection of food that can be ordered from the menu.  The bar area was good over looking the river.  My only reservation is the price and we paid Euro 200 per night which was probably at the top end of what we thought right compared to other hotels in Dublin.  I note that much higher rates are advertised so at the right price this hotel is excellent.  Also check your bill when you leave as ours was wrong with the cost of an upgrade being charged which we didn't get.,4,2015,06,28
237,Excellent,Stayed here for a first trip to Ireland and a weekend get away with a now ex girlfriend. Excellent hotel. Reception area is very modern and the room was spacious and very clean. Didn't eat in the restaurant or have breakfast. Will definitely be visiting again one day in the future and most probably use this hotel again. Only qualm is my view was a brick wall on the other side of a small street but apart from that great location and what a city!,5,2015,06,26
237,A wonderful stay with an equally marvelous location,"This hotel truly deserves a 5 out of 5 rating. My wife and I stayed there on our honeymoon and chose the hotel for its location, price and clean-cut looks. Checking in to the hotel was an ease and we got our rooms within a few minutes. The staff were very friendly and helpful, even offering up their signature hot cookie, which proved to be really useful in filling our grumbling stomach. 

The room was presented to us in a pristine state. The carpet was clean and the room smelt fresh. As important, the room was actually pretty spacious, giving more than enough room for ourselves and our luggage. The amenities (tea, water, soap, shampoo, etc) were well stocked and we had no problem finding everything. The bathroom was also squeaky clean and spacious, and I couldn't ask for more.

The location proved to be another plus point. It was by the river and right opposite Temple Bar. A short walk across and we reached the famous Temple Bar (the bar itself). Over at the other end, its also another short walk to O Connor Street where the famous (or infamous) Spire lies. Though you couldn't just ""hop on"" to either of the tram lines, there is a convenient bus stop right outside and taxis are almost everywhere all the time. 

A slight disadvantage is that parking wasn't free. If you drive, you would have to park around 100m down for 10 Euros a day. Still pretty good IMO.

Overall, we had a wonderful stay and wouldn't hesitate to go back there. Bravo!",5,2015,06,25
237,Irish hospitality,"We spent a week in Ireland earlier this month and one night in Dublin at the Morrison. Very nice hotel in a great location. Close to all the sights but across the river from all the partying in Temple Bar, so it was both convenient and quiet. 

Best part, as was the case in the rest of Ireland by the way, was the people. Great staff who were very friendly and helpful. Restaurants at the hotel were excellent as well. Great stay and I would certainly stay there again if we get back to Dublin.",5,2015,06,24
237,"Modern, stylish, clean rooms; great breakfast and location","Loved everything about this hotel. Check-in was friendly, quick, and easy and I love those warm chocolate chip cookies! Our room was obviously recently renovated and very modern/stylish. Very comfortable bed and shower, but the rooms are on the small side. As a Hilton Gold member, received free buffet breakfast in the morning. Good selection of hot and cold foods. 

Would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2015,06,24
237,My Trip Home to Dublin,"I've wanted to go home to Ireland and Dublin since I've been a child.  Due to business meetings this became a reality.  The welcoming staff, beautifully luxurious rooms, music and restaurant I will honestly say I found my home away from home at The Morrison.

My trip was part business and part pleasure.  This hotel is most conveniently located near Trinity College Dublin and the Irish Parliament buildings.  Shops lined the streets near the hotel and public transportation was easily accessible.  Most enjoyable was the limousine ride to the airport arranged by hotel staff. 

The hotel staff could not have been more professional and more welcoming. What can I say, I went home to Dublin and was welcomed and well cared for at the Morrison, Double Tree.",5,2015,06,24
237,Stunning hotel,"This hotel is just stunning. The staff are extremely helpful and welcoming and were happy to help at all times. The bar is really good with live bands who play and the bar staff have all designed their own cocktails which are lovely and they had fun with 'competing' with one another over who designed the best one. Throughout the hotel there was a feel good welcoming atmosphere. The room was a good size, with a very comfortable bed. Everything was immaculate. The location of the hotel was excellent and despite the hotel being full for both nights of my stay, staff always took the time to chat and make you feel valued.   I loved this hotel and the cookie on arrival was so good, I ate 2!",5,2015,06,23
237,"Awesome staff, wonderful location, and comfy hotel","Stayed at this hotel for a week, the staff was amazing. Changing my room so I could check in at 7AM after a long flight, greeting us as I entered every day with a smile and hooked us up when we needed to stay another day even though they didn't have any more room. (They found another cheaper 4 star hotel, booked a room, called a cab and allowed us a very generous late checkout time with no extra charge). 

This hotel is exactly the reason why I stay with hilton hotels no matter where I go.  ",5,2015,06,22
237,Lovely spot,"Hotel gives a nice feeling of fresh air, in other words new and clean. Hotel staff were friendly. The suite we stayed at was spacious, clean, with a comfy big bed and beautiful windows overlooking the liffey river. Bath was big. We paid for breakfast which was a buffet with selections of breads, juices, eggs, bacon and a few a la carte items. It was good. Lobby was nice. Location was spot on, across from a cafe and a few steps (5 min walk) from temple bar area. Also walking distance to jarvey shopping street with a giant Penneys, marks and spencer, cinema and tons of shops and some pubs.
We enjoyed our stay.",4,2015,06,22
237,Great Location,My husband and I recently went on a two week tour of Ireland.  We added two days on the front and two days at the end of our tour to be on our own.  My husband found this great hotel in a perfect central location to get around easily in Dublin.  It is located right on the Liffey River and a 5 minute walk to the Temple Bar area.  The hotel itself is very modern and clean with all the amenities you need.  The front desk personnel are very helpful too.  If visiting anytime soon I highly recommend staying at this hotel.,4,2015,06,21
237,Location and class,"Great location to all the sights of Dublin, water views, shops, bars & Temple Bar across Millennium Bridge, and luxury thrown in with fantastic service and hospitality (and the warm cookie at check in). Would stay again without hesitation!
",5,2015,06,21
237,Central location...delightful bar...very nice rooms!,"The Morrison is within walking distance of many attractions in Dublin.  Dublin is a very walkable city and the weather was delightful!   The bar in the lobby is very comfortable and the bar tenders are very attentive to your needs.  The breakfast is a complete Irish buffet in a well appointed dining room.  Our room was very nicely decorated and the bed was extremely comfortable.  
I would highly recommend a stay in this hotel.  It's a great hotel in a great location on the Liffey!
Lee and Marsha",5,2015,06,20
237,"Great location, good hotel","We just stayed at the Morrison hotel and it was a very pleasant stay.  The check in time was quick and efficient, the hotel staff was very helpful.  The rooms were clean and looked new.  The location of the hotel was great and made getting around Dublin very easy.  We ate breakfast every day and it was good and had dinner at the Grill one night and that was very good.  The rooms had great view the Liffy River.  The Wifi service was very good.  There were a few things that were not great; (1) there was no outlet in the bathroom, so my wife had to use the hair dryer in the room, which made it difficult to sleep, (2) the twin beds my kids had were very close and (3) there was no clock in the room.

When we go back to Dublin, we will stay at the Morrison.",4,2015,06,20
237,The Morrison is a must,"Lovely hotel, really friendly staff, great location, I never comment on trip Advisor but felt this was a must this time. Will definitely go back when I return, the bar at night had a lovely atmosphere too.",5,2015,06,19
237,Best Location in Dublin,"Located on the river, the Morrison is directly opposite the must see & vibrant Temple Bar area of the City from which it is easy walking to almost any where of interest. The Rooms are decorated to a very high standard & spacious. The Grill bars serves great food , the breakfasts are excellent, & most importantly the staff are really nice friendly people. A  Great 4 Star Hotel in our opinion.",5,2015,06,19
237,Would always choose to stay at the Morrison when in Dublin - LOVED it,"Great place to stay in Dublin - located in perfect spot for walking, restaurants, seeing the sights, people-watching, etc.  Very, very nice staff - in fact, some of the best ever in terms of service and recommendations.  ",5,2015,06,18
237,Very Cool Hotel / Very Good Location,"This was a really cool hotel.  If you are a fan of boutique type hotels this one fits that bill, while also being part of the Hilton chain!   Staff was great throughout the stay.  I had tickets to the Ireland/Scotland soccer game delivered here a week before we checked in.  They were waiting for me when I checked in!  The check in was a breeze as well.  Room was large, with very comfortable King Size bed, very cool pink lighting, couch, large bathroom.  Very nice and comfortable.  We only used the bar once, the night before we left and the staff was great, very social and entertaining.  Very interested in making us feel welcome, we enjoyed the bar very much.   Now lets talk about the location, it is right across the river from the Temple Bar area AND there is a bridge right outside the door to walk over.....perfect!  Easy access without the noise and clutter that is Temple Bar.   If you like Hilton/Doubletree hotels, want good service, but you are looking for something ""different"", give this hotel a try.  
One little issue we had, was our room was right beside the cleaning staffs storage room.  So, on Monday morning at 7AM there was a constant closing of the door.  Not sure how we could have avoided this without knowing, just a little tip and a little frustration to what was otherwise an excellent hotel.  ",5,2015,06,18
237,Staff Goes Above and Beyond,"Great experience at this hotel!  Staff regularly wen the extra mile for us on this trip, particularly when we encountered problems or issues.  Very outgoing.  Rooms were good - very modern - and the location felt outside of the touristy area even though it wasn't and was within walking distance of several main sites.",5,2015,06,18
237,trendy hotel in a great location,"I spend my last few nights in Dublin at The Morrison and really enjoyed it.  The hotel is a short walk to everything - great location.  The hotel is modern/trendy, bright, clean, quiet and expensive.  The rooms are good sized and the bed super comfortable.  The check in process was easy and quick but the girl wasn't overly friendly - everyone else was great.  The breakfast was very good and offered a good variety of choices.   If you have some extra money it's worth splurging and staying here.",5,2015,06,17
237,Clean hotel in great location supported by helpful staff,"Across the river from Temple Bar, very walkable and close to many sights but quiet enough for a good night's sleep.  Excellent staff who were friendly, respectful, and helpful.  This hotel was recently updated and is in great condition.  Free internet was a nice feature.  Room service was very fast and food quality was superior.  No complaints at all.",5,2015,06,17
237,"Very clean, very convenient and great staff.","We had won the trip to Dublin (courtesy of buying a packet of crisps at The Guinness Storehouse in November 2014) and had a great time. The Reception/Concierge staff were very keen to help, especially Darren, who is absolutely full of the joys of spring!! The room (although it didn't have an ""outside window"") was very comfortable and clean. Breakfast in The Halo was excellent, albeit the Morrison Grill restaurant did somewhat overcook my dinner choice one evening. We enjoyed it!!",4,2015,06,17
237,All front & no substance,"The hotel is uber cool and unusually furnished which is pleasant enough, the basics of hotel keeping are missing from laboured check in to unfriendly and unhelpful staff. If your look to be anonymous then this is the place for you if you seek a little humanness then go somewhere else",2,2015,06,17
237,Good Location - high price,"This hotel is in a great location, however there is no sign out front to indicate it is a Double Tree.  We were lucky that our taxi driver knew that the ""Morrison"" was recently renovated.   The price of this hotel was high for a small room (we paid extra $ to upgrade to the larger room which was still small).  The staff was helpful in regards to directions and taxis.  When we returned from a day out at 4pm our room had not yet been cleaned.  We opted to make our own bed and let the maid give us new towels.",3,2015,06,15
237,Good location but some problems,"This was our second stay at the Morrison. The staff were very friendly and helpful. This hotel is just across the river from the temple bar area and just south of excellent bars/pubs such as The Church. We were disappointed, however, by a couple of things. First, we put a room service card on the door for breakfast for our day of departure and they lost it. Second, one of the two small elevators was not working and there was a ton of traffic trying to use the one elevator in the morning.",4,2015,06,14
237,Great place to stay,"We can't fault this hotel - the service particularly was truly great - the staff were helpful, kind and accommodating - nothing was too much trouble.  The rooms  were clean and modern, the restaurant was good enough (large portion sizes) and the bar well stocked and again very good service.",4,2015,06,14
237,"Superb location , friendly staff, restaurant ok","Renovation work going on during the days we were there. Would have been nice to have been advised this by the check in staff, went to the room after a long day travelling for a quick nap then the drilling started!

Asked for a quieter room away from the work, got shown to another room but wasn't much better, got offered a reduced rate which was a nice touch and made it acceptable for the inconvenience.

Note to all hotels: people do not check the front pages of your website to see if there is building work going on. You usually have email addresses, a quick email would be good.

Anyway... Rooms very comfortable, location perfect, just across the river from the main action at the Temple Bar area and a 10minute walk to the main shopping area.

Had lunch in the restaurant, it was a new menu, we got 20% off for trying it but it wasn't good at all. Service was great and other reviews are good so I'd possibly give it another go if I return.",4,2015,06,13
237,Great hotel with great views,"We researched our hotel options and tend to prefer boutique type hotels with great locations.  The Morrison didn't let us down.  From the very friendly and welcoming staff, to our great King Junior Suite with a view of the river.  
The breakfast and room service was also very good.
Overall, this is a perfect location and a great value for what you are getting ( a very large comfortable room ) and great service staff.",5,2015,06,13
237,One of the best Hilton hotels.,"This is a 'must do' for anyone looking to enjoy their stay in Dublin. I only stayed one night and the Morrison Hotel ranks as one of the best Hilton experiences I have ever had, and this is high praise as I am fortunate to stay in Hilton hotels all over the country on business.

The location is perfect and only a short walk to the best bars in town! The staff are very welcoming and the room was excellent. I would also recommend the restaurant as the quality of food far exceeded any other Hilton that I can remember. 

Overall, this is a great hotel and I will return for sure. The outstanding reviews posted by others are fair comment and I can only agree with them.",5,2015,06,12
237,"Expensive, yet properly valued","My brief stay of 1 night was expensive, but I was also treated like I was the most important person they had seen all day.  My peers had the same experience so it wasn't a fluke.  Rooms are nice, but service was extraordinary.  A credit to the management and staff.",4,2015,06,10
237,Perfect for walking,"The Hotel is located in a perfect area that requires no car and it is close to many of the shops and cafès and restaurants and pubs of the old City.  Also the Museums, Churches, Trinity College and the Guinness and Jameson plants are close.  We suggest the visit at the new Museum of Wiskey near the Trinity College entrance.",5,2015,06,09
237,Fabulous!,"My wife and I stayed here for close to a week in late May at the end of two weeks in Ireland during which we stayed in several other hotels. I am a Hilton Diamond and have stayed at numerous other Hilton properties around the world. This was a fabulous experience. The room was large, extremely nice, sharply decorated, and comfortable. The bathroom was quite large, marble, rain shower, with plenty of soft towels and nice products. We especially enjoyed the breakfasts and the breakfast staff was always in good cheer. I had one of the best beers ever in the restaurant on the recommendation of our waiter, so good that I snuck back down to the bar later in the evening to grab another. The front desk staff were quite helpful with directions, recommendations, etc. The location is really great, It is just across the Ha Penny bridge from Temple Bar, which makes it a shortish walk from Trinity College. The LUAS tram is quite close. Additionally, we were able to walk to Heuston Station. There were several restaurants within walking distance that we frequented, as well as a grocery store not far away. I am glad I trusted the outstanding reviews because this was an overall outstanding stay and I would feel lucky to ever get to stay here again.",5,2015,06,07
237,Good location in Dublin,"This was the only hotel we stayed at on our 10 day trip throughout Ireland.  We wanted a central location in Dublin and the Morrison worked out perfectly.  We got there earlier than the 3 PM check in time and only one of three rooms were ready.  Even at 3 PM the other two rooms weren't ready.  We left all of the bags in the one rooms and headed out.  The hotel doesn't look like much from the outside, but is clean and modern inside.  The rooms were clean, spacious and well appointed.   I would definitely stay here again.",3,2015,06,07
237,Perfect City Centre Hotel,"Very nice, modern and quirky hotel.  Assigned lovely bright room on fourth floor looking out on side street.  Heard traffic noise but to be expected as it is right in Dublin city centre.  So close to all the local attractions; Temple Bar, shopping, etc. Reception staff very helpful and welcoming.  Great buffet breakfast spread.  Service by staff at breakfast and afternoon tea a little lacking but food quality excellent.  Overall a great city centre hotel that ticks most of the boxes.",4,2015,06,07
237,A very recommendable hotel,"Good location in the centre of town just opposite temple bar area, the hotel had been recently redone, beautiful rooms, helpful and friendly staff, fantastic breakfast, good food at the restaurant overlooking the river Liffey, we had a lovely stay.",5,2015,06,06
237,24 hrs in Dublin,"I am a Diamond member with Hilton. We had a 24 hr layover coming from Croatia and decided to cash in points. The hotel is VERY modern, clean and right in the city center. Breakfast was reasonable and transportation to the airport was reasonable. For a Hilton property, I say a solid 8.5.",5,2015,06,05
237,Typical four star but nothing special,"Stayed in the Morrison on a business trip for two nights, while it had all one would expect from a four star hotel, free water, quality toiletries,plenty of amenities, warm cookies on arrival and a spotless room it was what I'd consider basics for a four star hotel and for this price. 
The location is of course exceptional in Dublin city centre, but small annoyances brought this experience down,such as the smell of very strong chemicals in the corridoor, or my partner getting stuck in the lift as his key card malfunctioned. 
I also think our bottled water could have been replenished for the second day but was not.
The breakfast was very good but once again, herbal tea being out of stock and the cooked breakfast being kept in bainmarie heaters is less than expected for the price of this hotel.
Overall lovely but a few minor changes needed.",4,2015,06,03
237,Clean and central ,Clean and updated room and hotel located in the center of the city right on the river.  Hotel recognized my diamond hhonors status and upgraded our room and provided free breakfast. No on site parking so they have a negotiated rate with a car park across the street. ,5,2015,06,03
237,"Beautiful, modern hotel in the city center","This hotel was like an oasis after a long day of traveling. It has everything going for it...lovely exterior, great location, a modern, stylish lobby, restaurant and bar, cool, comfortable rooms and a very friendly and accommodating staff. Plus, you get cookies when you arrive! We were upgraded to a junior suite which was awesome. The room was HUGE! It looked brand new. The bed linens were high end. The bathroom was crazy nice with a lovely tub, a nice rain shower, nice toiletries, and lots of space. 
The room had a very reasonably priced mini bar that had beer and wine, snacks, and candy. I had a candy bar one night and it was only two Euro. I thought that was a pretty good price! I think a can of beer was €5. There was a kettle and plenty of tea, sugar, and milk in the fridge. 
Our room was located away from the street and we didn't hear a peep from outside.
I needed a sweater dry cleaned and a staff member was at my door within a minute or two after I called. It was returned perfectly cleaned the next day. I asked them not to use scented products and they didn't. 
We had a beer and an apple tart with ice cream in the restaurant. The food and drink were yummy and the servers were prompt and friendly. 
The Red Line tram is just a couple of blocks away. Bars and restaurants line the surrounding streets. We walked to Hueston Station and it took about 20 minutes. A pleasant walk.",5,2015,06,03
237,A perfect and trendy place to stay in Dublin!,"Wow, what a great experience!  We spent three nights at this hotel.  The rooms were very trendy and clean.  The bed was super comfortable.  The location is great.  We were able to walk over to the Temple Bar area within a few minutes and enjoy some pints and music.  The breakfast was great.  We ate off the buffet one morning, which is standard.  The next morning we ordered off the provided menu (also free) and were very happy with the food.  The staff was so polite and engaged us in conversations.  We received water for free when requested, directions to the ATM, and had a taxi called for us immediately when needed.  We couldn't be happier with this experience.  Plus, the cookies and treats provided at check-in make for a good first impression!",5,2015,06,03
237,Great experience at the Morrison!,"Myself and a friend visited the Morrison last saturday for afternoon tea and i must say it was a delightful experience! We only planned to stay for the afternoon but ended up staying until much later. This was due to the fantastic service we recieved, the dellicous food and the lovely atmosphere.
The staff were very friendly and accomodating and i must particularly mention Mark who served our table, He was very professional, helpful and friendly. He made our stay there all the better.
We wil be back again for sure! Thank you all :)",5,2015,06,03
237,"Very Nice ""Boutique"" Hotel","Those of you have read any of my other reviews will know that I like ""Boutique"" hotels and The Morrison does this very well. It has a simple entrance with a nice reception and staff are very friendly. I had a room on the 4th floor which was very modern and spacious with a view over the internal part of the building.
There is a very good restaurant, The Morrison Grill and also an excellent gym. The hotel is very well located on the river and across the road from the bars and restaurants of Temple Bar.
The other thing that the Morrison has got right is wi-fi access. It's free, it's quick and you just click and connect with no additional information required.
Three small things that the hotel need to improve on:
- Comfort of the bed. Not bed but not up to other Hilton bed standards
- Water pressure in the shower could be much better
- Access to the gym. This is controlled by key card and on both days it wouldn't let me access so had to go back to reception.
All that said I would highly recommend the Morrison for a good stay in Dublin in an excellent location",4,2015,06,03
237,Centrally located hotel with high standards and skilled personell,"A hotel with high standards, modern and located square in the middle of Dublin. We stayed for four nights, and except for a bit of confusion in the restaurant on the premises while waiting for our food one of the nights (which I won't blame the hotel for), everything was well worth the trip. 

Strongly suggested!",5,2015,06,02
237,Fantastic,"I loved staying here. Great location, easy to walk to Jervis/Arnott's for shopping, Temple Bar, Grafton Street, Trinity College, even Guinness! Right by the cute Ha' Penny Bridge. Darren (sp?) at concierge was a delight and gave great recommendations. The breakfast hostess gal was also extremely friendly and loved that we are PSU alums because of her best friend! They also had the best dryer of any place I stayed in Ireland. I will seriously consider The Morrison again for my next trip, even if its years away.",5,2015,06,02
237,Great stay...very friendly,"We had a great stay at the Morrison for 8 nights. The staff at the front desk were very friendly and very accommodating! Great location...close to shopping, food and bars! Very clean and nice rooms! Breakfast was wonderful. The cocktails in the bar were delicious. ",5,2015,06,01
237,Awesome place to stay,"Great hotel, sophisticated, classy and the rooms were gorgeous.  After 18 hours of travel (from USA), we were exhausted and arrived at 11:00am, and Jane found us a room even though the hotel had been sold out the night before.  We were soooo grateful. Darin (front desk) was absolutely awesome and had lots of tips to help us make the most of our short time in Dublin.  Breakfast in the Halo restaurant inside was delicious.  You could pay 15 euro for a ""hot buffet"" which had exceptional food, or 12 euro for the ""cold buffet"" (cereals, yogurt, breads, fruits), which was perfect for hubby.  Alice greeted us very enthusiastically, so we would have eaten there, just based on her personality.  Would HIGHLY recommend this hotel as it is within walking distance of ALL the attractions.",5,2015,06,01
237,Great stay at the Morrison!,"Great location and close to Temple Bar, St Patrick's and Trinity College to name a few.  All the staff at the Morrison were exceptional with superior service.  Breakfast buffet was delicious.  We'll be staying at the Morrison on our next trip back to Dublin.  Mike and Mary Ellen-Chicago.",5,2015,05,30
237,Location can't be beat!,"The Morrison Hotel is in the center of everything you want in Dublin. Literally a stone throws away from the Ha'Penny Bridge, Temple Bar and very close to O'Connell Street, Trinity College and Dublin Castle. The hotel offers a very modern setting with a generous breakfast (included) with an onsite grill, bar and fitness center. The rooms also have a very modern arrangement yet, small for the price. The rooms are well decorated and with good amenities yet the beds are basic, comfortable enough but tight for a couple or if you're traveling with kids.

Breakfast menu is available in addition to buffet. Don't expect a gourmet experience but it's a generous offering considering it's included & served til noon",4,2015,05,28
237,Location and Welcome!!!!,"This hotel is in a great central location in Dublin.  You can hop on and off the green bus nearby for a tour of the sights on the outskirts, but you can walk LOTS of places from this hotel.  Temple Bar is right across the bridge, Trinity College, Dublin Castle, Whiskey Museum.....and of course lots and lots of pubs and restaurants. I hate that I don't remember the young man's name that welcomed us, but he was great, he was so nice and informative, and gave us many recommendations.  The rooms are nice, clean and modernly furnished.",5,2015,05,27
237,Hilton Double Tree Hotel Dublin Eire,"An excellent Hotel from the moment we entered and were greeted by staff, from reception to dining area wonderful friendly people, the  accommodation was first class with everything we needed and breakfast was superb.  Truly a great Hotel in a great location well done Hilton/Double Tree would highly recommend.",5,2015,05,27
237,Great location!,"We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel: very well located (temple bar, historic dublin, grafton street, bus and luas within a few minutes walk) friendly and helpful staff, beautiful room with  a very comfy king size bed, free wifi in the whole hotel, lovely breakfast buffet with "" a la carte"" specials! I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,05,26
237,Nice place to stay in the middle of Dublin,"The Morrison was a great place for us to stay for our first night in Ireland.  The rooms and hotel facilities were beautiful, and the people at the front desk were very friendly and helpful.  The location of this hotel is very difficult to top.  It is right on the River Liffey in the middle of all of the action, which makes it an easy walk to everything.  The only downside to this hotel is that it is definitely a bit pricey.  The rooms are expensive, and parking costs extra as well.  Overall, though, it was a great place to stay.",4,2015,05,26
237,"Great Location, Friendly Staff, Great Value","Pros:
Great location (close to shopping and bars)
Great value 
Clean and modern
Staff that was willing to go above and beyond - We forgot electric converters so they let us borrow some for our stay
Excellent restaurant on premises

Con
I can honestly say that I didn't have one for the entire trip",5,2015,05,26
237,"Great Location, Great Service","Top marks go to The Morrison for service.  My husband had arranged a gift basket and flowers for mother's day.  The staff arranged the whole thing and I believed shopped themselves for the goods.  It was lovely.  There was nothing the staff wouldn't do to help.  We were given pastries and coffee on our way out.  Our room was fabulous with the pink accents and very fancy lighting.  The hotel is just a walk away from everything you need.  O'Connoll street is just down a few blocks, where there is shopping and arrangements for the green hop on, hop off bus.  Temple Bar is just across the bridge which is very convenient for fun and only a block away is the stop for the bus.  It is all very lovely and well located.",4,2015,05,26
237,"Great hotel, lovely helpful staff, brilliant central location!!!","I stayed at The Morrison whilst my husband was in Dublin on work.
From the moment we arrived and were presented with the lovely warm cookie, to the moment we checked out and were offered nice cold bottled water the stay was perfect.

The staff were brilliant, very helpful and recommended places where they went to eat (not your touristy offerings) - leading to good quality and decently priced evening meals.

Room (335) was lovely too although the air conditioning was not as cold as I would have liked - this was promptly solved by the addition of a fan by the staff.
Courtroom view but nice and quiet. Lovely bathroom with large bath.
Wifi worked well.

Very central location to Temple bar, historic Dublin and Grafton street shops! Again couldn't fault this.

Would recommend hotel and location to anyone whether business or pleasure - staff were a credit!",5,2015,05,25
237,Beautiful with a great location,This hotel is super it has amazing views and is very near to everything with a short walk through temple bar in Dublin you could be almost anywhere within the city. The hotel is trendy and very private. Rooms are well equipped and decor is amazing. I would highly recommend this hotel and would return. Never visited the bar but it seemed a busy place.,5,2015,05,25
237,Good location,"Stayed here for 2 nights on May 20 & 21. Location is great as the hotel is just minutes walk from the main  conveniences. It's one street off the quay along the Liffey River, and once you cross the river, you're at the Temple Bar area which thrives at night as a food and entertainment area. Also nearby are shopping areas. Some attractions such as Guinness Storehouse and Trinity College are within walking distance. Rooms in the hotel are clean and functional. The one thing I did not like was the wooden floor, which transmits noise. You can hear the wooden floor creaking from adjacent rooms at night. The good thing is they provide a very good breakfast here. The breakfast buffet spread is excellent, with wide choices and the breads are especially good. You can also order your choice of main breakfast item in addition to the buffet spread, which all adds up to a very hearty breakfast !! Wifi is free and fast, so staying plugged in is not a problem. Overall, a hotel worth considering for a stay in the city.",4,2015,05,24
237,Best staff anywhere,The staff is the best. We stored luggage for a week and you would have thought we were doing them a favor. Very seldom do you get hugged at reception but we did. The bar is also great and the food was also good. The location is right across the river from Temple Bar and only three blocks from the center of town. Can't get any better.,5,2015,05,22
237,Great Location - Great Price,"We arrived at the Morrison via taxi from the Dublin Ferry terminal. We were greeted by the excellent staff and informed that the upgrade I had requested was available. We had a beautiful room overlooking the river Liffey! The location of the Morrison is superb. All the major attractions are within walking distance, except maybe the Guiness Storehouse. O'Connell Street, Temple Bar, Jameson Distillery and the Book of Kells are easy to walk to.",5,2015,05,21
237,great location,"Very comfortable hotel in a great location by the river and 5 minutes walk to Temple Bar. Modern design, well furnished rooms and clean & attractive bathroom.  Good buffet breakfast with served hot menu and pleasant service staff.",4,2015,05,21
237,Central location,"We were able to take the 747 bus from the airport to the City center and walk 5 minutes to The Morrison. As a Hilton Diamond member I was not offered any room upgrades, even after specifically asking for.  Front desk staff  was friendly and helpful.  In room wifi was good, having decent speed and signal strength.  Room had good blackout curtains, if trying adjust for jet lag.  Decor of the room was very contemporary.  Not my style, but not a problem. Bathroom was large. Just across the river is the Temple Bar area - about a  5 minute walk.  Other local attractions (Book of Kellls, St Patrick' , etc..) are a walkable distance.  Room service was prompt,  though the food
Was average",4,2015,05,20
237,wished i was somewhere else,"First of all the pros..great location, very nice and friendly front desk staff, excellent cookies, housekeeping very nice and thorough.  Con's.  Expensive, our upgraded junior suite faced a brick wall with broken windows, our room beside the housekeeping room, very noisey, beautiful bathroom with tub....that wouldn't keep water in it, plug broken, patio doors nice for fresh air...lock broken, had to call daily for a nice man to come unlock the only not broken lock at the top, the platform bed, extremely hard and very uncomfortable, only given tiny amounts of cream and sugar, had to call for addition to our complimentary beverage, no room in mini bar to put anything, horrid pink lights in night stands, tacky,  room service fast but almost zero choices for vegetarian, but chips are always good.  Very over priced Irish breakfast, set outside and at the corner you can have better and more for half the price.  Bottom line, we stayed here because of the good reviews, will read many more of the less spectacular reviews.  I would pass by this one.  Staff is lovely, accommodations, very disappointing for the money.",2,2015,05,20
237,Shades of ireland,The hotel was beautiful. The room were excellent and the beds were comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful. The food was excellent and had a wide range to select from. Bonus when you check in get a warm cookie which is delicious. It is centrally located not far from Grafton street.,5,2015,05,19
237,Great service and great location,Great hotel with the best location with only a few minutes walk to all the best restaurants and sights. Also very easy to access from the airport as the aircoach stops a few minutes from the hotel. The service and the staff is execellent!,4,2015,05,19
237,Enjoyed Our Stay,"Clean, decent breakfast, good wi-fi, courteous and helpful staff. And conveniently located, Except for out of town tours, things were within walking distance. A bridge across the Liffey is practically at the front door, walk across and there is all the food and drink you will want in Dublin. We stayed so that my wife could run the Rock N Roll Mini Marathon in Phoenix park.",5,2015,05,17
237,Top class,"stayed here recently. Loved the personal service, super atmosphere and delicious gourmet food. The location is great for easy access down town. It doesn't have a pool which would have been welcome. I will be back.",5,2015,05,17
237,Service and Location!,"It is not easy to find a hotel in the heart of Dublin that is close to where you want to be. The Morrison is just that hotel. We booked a long weekend for just me and my husband in Dublin and wanted to be near the sites but also wanted quiet and luxury. We could not have been happier with The Morrison! We arrived before our room was ready, with a huge crowd arriving for a wedding party. the Hotel staff seamlessly handled large groups of people with ease, checked everyone in, providing the signature warm cookies and kept our bags so we could grab some lunch. We walked one block to a local restaurant, ""The Church"", which was an old church turned into a restaurant. Very good food. Our room was ready when we returned, though we had requested a king the room had two doubles. when we called,the staff immediately offered to fix the beds as we left the hotel.  It was done when we returned. The room is average size, with unusual modern decorations.  Clean, comfortable, and i liked the robe. The bathroom was not on the large side, but big enough for two of us. the hotel overall was very modern in design,  and seemed to have lots going on, from the busy restaurant to the banquet halls, bars.  During the weekend we asked several times for assistance - how to get to the Guinness Storehouse, where to find good italian food, help for a taxi, a bakery.. all of our requests were handled so graciously. the staff went out of their way to help us.  One front desk member walked us outside to show us the way.  All of the recommendations were spot on (excellent italian food one block away) and we even used the umbrella provided by the hotel.  The service is worth coming to the hotel on its own merit.  I am a huge fan of polite and efficient service. my only complaint - our room was on the street side and i heard yelling (from the tourists leaving temple bar across the river likely) in the middle of the night.  my husband never heard a word and it was not bad, but i would ask for an interior room next time. we stayed on the rewards floor, which was really nice. I cannot say how the other floors are. We also ate dinner in the restaurant, as we heard it was good. it was delicious and the staff was friendly, there was live music. the Dining room manager came and talked to us and offered much advice about visiting the sites.  A very nice touch that impressed us.  
As for location - this hotel is about a 10 minute walk to the Temple Bar area.  You literally go out the door, walk across a bridge, and you are on the tourist side of town. You can walk to Trinity college, and Dublin castle - we walked to all of the spots that we wanted to go for a long weekend.  The location and the service is really worth staying at The Morrison. Highly recommended!",5,2015,05,16
237,Great European surprise,"If you're used to the tiny hotel rooms typical of most European capitals, The Morrison will shock and delight you. Our room seemed the size of a football field -- spacious, comfortable, and well-designed for spending time in. The bathroom is luxurious. Service was terrific. The bar and restaurant have a great vibe -- cool and low-key, perfect for unwinding after a busy day. We stayed 3 nights and found the location perfect for Dublin - a short walk to the Luas light rail Red line (Jervis stop), near lots of other transportation options, easy walks to major attractions, across the river from Temple Bar (so not as noisy as that area). Recommended without reservation.",5,2015,05,16
237,Fabulous,"By far the best hotel we have stayed in all over the place.
Lovely staff and rooms were spotless.
Breakfast the best ever. Thank you to all the staff from cleaners to management.... You made my 70 th birthday special.
From a very happy Scottish couple. X",4,2015,05,15
237,Great Central Hotel,"We loved our stay last week at The Morrison.  The room was very clean and modern. There was good light in the room to apply makeup. You received 2 free bottles of water everyday which was nice. The area surrounding the hotel was great, with plenty of restaurants and shopping within a 2 minute walk. ",5,2015,05,15
237,"A Well-located, Modern Hotel But Lacking Heating in Rooms","The hotel is in a great location in the centre of the city, overlooking the River Liffey and very close to Temple Bar and Dublin's central attractions. The room was very modern and clean (although a bit on the small side) with a good sized modern bathroom. The room had a flat screen TV and air-conditioning but it only gave out cold air as the heat function failed to work and on a cold, wet day when I was feeling a bit under the weather the heat was sorely missed. I called down to to reception and a maintenance man was sent immediately. He fiddled around with it and said it was fixed and that in a few moments the temperature would reach 32 degrees Celsius. This failed to happen and it was still only blowing out cold air so I called down again and he returned very quickly. 

He spent quite a while fiddling around and then said it was working, was blowing air at 29 degrees and would soon reach 32 degrees. Actually 22 degrees would have been perfectly fine for me but it was still only blowing out chilled air but time was getting on and I had a dinner reservation so the best solution was to switch it off and I filled up the sink with hot water and left the shower run hot in a bid to heat up the cold room while I hid under the covers of my bed.

Staff were very friendly and on our early Monday morning arrival we were able to store our luggage and told our room would be ready by 3pm (they told us the hotel was completely full so could not get a room ready earlier for us, but this was fine for us although I am sure the hotel was not completely full as we barely so any other guests other than a few at breakfast). That was fine for us and we went out to enjoy the sights of Dublin and returned shortly before 5.30pm. We were disappointed that the room was still not ready and we had to wait until they got it ready for us. 

Although I had requested a higher floor on booking, I was informed that they did not have a room available on a higher floor but they were able to upgrade us to a deluxe room on the 1st floor. No big deal but I would recommend people did not pay for an upgrade to a deluxe room as the difference in what you get is very little (e.g. deluxe rooms are the same size but have a typically overly-expensive mini-bar, and come with slippers and bathrobes). We never use a mini-bar if it is stupidly overpriced when there are shops nearby as in this case and there was only one bathrobe left for two people and no slippers at all. In conclusion, not really an upgrade as far as we were concerned.

The free wi-fi was very slow in our room but this wasn't really a problem for us as we were able to use 3G for free on our UK phone tariffs.

Breakfast was good - the typical buffet fare as well as a menu to order from - but wear warm clothes as the breakfast room is open to the lobby which in turn opens into the street and can be cold and draughty. There is not a lot of seating so be prepared to wait if the hotel is full (although this was not the case on our visit), especially if you are disabled or have difficulty getting up and down stairs as the largest seating area was upstairs in a mezzanine area. The breakfast staff was very helpful and friendly although rushed off their feet.

Despite the niggles I would return to the hotel as the room was clean and modern and the location was fantastic. I would definitely confirm with the hotel first though that the heating was working fully before booking outside of the summer months, otherwise I would give it a miss.",4,2015,05,14
237,Perfect Location in a Busy City,"My parents and I stayed in The Morrison this past week and had a wonderful experience. The location is perfect and makes it easy to walk to many of the attractions in the city. The staff is friendly, helpful and obviously wish to make you have a memorable stay. The biggest highlight for us was Darren. He is the BEST. I will admit that when we landed in Dublin, we were not very impressed. However, after talking with Darren, who grew up in Dublin, he gave us suggestions on how to make the most of our visit. When we said that we wanted to see the country side of Ireland, he gave us a detailed map and told us to visit Howt, a small fishing village. This turned out to be one of the highlights of our entire trip. He is fun to talk to and made our stay in Dublin a positive one. He is a good representative of The Morrison and made our Dublin experience one that went from starting out negative, to a fun and unique memory. Darren is amazing and I would suggest anyone staying at the hotel to talk with him. Even if they know what they want to do, he is just a fun person to talk to!",5,2015,05,11
237,"Great Location, friendly staff","The front desk staff are very friendly and accommodating. Hotel is modern and newer. The location is great and you can walk to almost all Dublin sights; Temple bar is less than 5 minute walk for some nightlife and food. 

One of the best hotels we stayed in in Ireland.",5,2015,05,11
237,Comfortable rooms and great location,"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. Overall we were happy with the comfort of the room, the bed and pillows- there were a couple to choose from, however temperature wise the hotel inside was just too warm. We had the cooling on the lowest setting and were still hit in our room. 
Buffet breakfast was really good, had a choice of al a carte as well as the buffet which had good choices.
Great location and easy to walk around many parts of the city.",4,2015,05,11
237,"Great stay at The Morrison, very friendly staff.","My husband and I spent 3 nights at The Morrison in Dublin.   We liked the hotel very much and the location was great.  Close to many attractions and the Temple Bar area.  The staff were very accommodating - special thanks to Darren and Alicij at the front desk.  Our original room overlooked construction work and when I called the front desk, they immediately moved us to another location.  We did not eat at the hotel, but we did enjoy the music and a few cocktails in the bar area.   My only complaint would be the temperature of the rooms, they were quite warm, however, if we opened the window the road noise was quite loud since our room was located at the back of the hotel.   We would definitely stay at this hotel again, we would just request a room in a quieter location.",5,2015,05,09
237,Great Location,"A popular hotel if the lobby is anything to go by, on arrival it filled me with dread, but I was checked-in promptly and with pleasant help from nice, kind and considerate staff.

The room was very clean, and a nice layout, very comfortable with a view of the river, a real bonus. (I took a walk alongside the river, as the view tempted me).

Given how busy the venue is the corridors and room are quiet, a nice undisturbed sleep was pleasing.",4,2015,05,09
237,What a wonderful hotel with exceptional staff!!!,"Just had the best stay here for my 40th!!!! The staff, in particular Jane Bridge, went above and beyond to make it memorable.  The rooms are stunning, and the view from our room of the river was perfect.  Everything you could need for your stay is available and nothing is too much trouble.  The location is perfect for sightseeing Dublin - temple bar, bus tour to all the main sights etc.  Beautiful place and beautiful people.  Thank you so much xx",5,2015,05,09
237,Problem Solvers,"We had a couple of  problems during our stay at the Morrison, but as expected from a Hilton property the hotel addressed them immediately. We were visiting Dublin for the first time and appreciated the hotel's excellent location, just minutes from the Grafton St. and Temple Bar areas.

Our king-bed suite was a large room with quality bedding and all the amenities expected at a Hilton.  Employees were very accommodating and dedicated to assuring customer satisfaction. We especially appreciated their willingness to allow us to check into a room upon our early morning arrival from the U.S.  

Unless you're a very sound sleeper, be sure to request a room that does not face the River Liffey!  Skip the mediocre breakfast and instead visit Brother Hubbard or the Bake House, both just a short walk from the hotel.",4,2015,05,07
237,Top Bloody Mary,"Good for drinks and people watching. Very good Bloody Mary in the Quay bar…some beetroot and pomegranate in mix apparently…nice and spicy. Mojito and the Craigies Ballyhook Flyer cider very good too. Thought the choice of 3 mini dishes for €9 was good value: had beef slider, chicken nuggets and spring rolls with sweet chili and oniony ketchup dips. Staff friendly too. New lighting nice, but furniture could do with an upgrade! Perfect for those planning to hit Templebar on their weekend in Dublin.",4,2015,05,06
237,Wedding at The Morrison- Amazing!!,"Myself and my partner chose The Morrison Hotel as the venue for our wedding ceremony and reception. From the initial meeting with James the Events Manager we knew that this venue was the perfect one for us. From then until the day after the big day the service we received was nothing but flawless. Every member of staff could not do enough for us. A special mention to Lewis, Martin and Patrick. Throughout the whole day they were on hand for anything that was needed. Our guests are still talking about the venue and the food- especially the fillet steak! The evening food was also a big hit, very different to the usual food that is offered at most wedding venue. Big compliments to the kitchen team. There was so many small special touches throughout the day that exceeded our expectations. Thank you to all in the Morrison for helping to make our day so special and we can't wait to return for a meal in your gorgeous restaurant. ",5,2015,05,06
237,Great location for Dublin,"Ive just returned from a weekend with my wife for our anniversay. On arrival we were checked in quickly despite lots of people in the lobby. Warm cookies were provided for the wait but a coffee would have been a good accompaniment. We had booked a one bedroom suite. It waslovely. Room 330. Overlooked the Liffey and had a corner aspect. The liffey Iis a very dirty river and certainly isnt much to look at. The room was spacious. NESPRESSO coffee machine and macarons on arrival with a welcome note. Complementary glasses of bubbly arrived from the bar which was nice. The rooms are very modern but a bit minimalist. 2 flat screens, one in living room and the other in the bedroom. The tv in thr bedroom was mounted sideways against a wall and was awkward to watch. Huge comfy bed. Couple of bad points. The curtain rail in the bedroom was broken and coming away from the ceiling. I had to get an extra towel from housekeeping. The rokm was noisy being so close to the road. Police sirens sounded like they were coming through the door. Breakfast was adequate for a 4 star hotel however staff were clearly rushed even though im sure they knew how many people there would be. The breakfast greeter provided you with a seat but then you had to wait for a server to take your tea or coffee order. Then you were sort of left to it. It was quite shambolic on sunday morning when it was busy. There is a concession for car parking which is around the corner in Jervis Street from €24 to €12 for a full day which is great for Dublin. Close to O'Conneell St and the Temple bar area but far enough away for a bit of peace. Fast checkout despite being busy.",4,2015,05,04
237,Great Location,"We stayed here for the value and proximity to Temple Bar. The room was great and very clean and well stocked everyday. I would stay here again, but the warm breakfast wasn't worth the price to us, I recommend eating breakfast elsewhere. The hotel is a quick walk across a small foot bridge to Temple Bar. I would stay here again/",4,2015,05,03
237,Amazing,Just back from a one night stay in Dublin.  The hotel was stunning. The decor and ambiance were modern and calming  but what makes it amazing are the wonderful staff.  A huge thank you to Jane. You made this a city break to remember.,5,2015,05,03
237,Fantastic,"What a fantastic place to stay. From the warm chocolate cookie on arrival and the very helpful receptionist, to the delicious evening meal and excellent variety at breakfast, our stay was brilliant. All the staff were great. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend to friends and family. The hotel room, although on the 2nd floor with a River Liffey side view, was noisy from traffic, what do you expect...you're in a vibrant city! Can't wait to return.",5,2015,05,02
237,Nice rooms and great cookie at checkin,The best think I liked about this hotel is that it is in the heart of downtown Dublin.  I was able to walk to many of the local sites and great places to eat.  The room was recently remodeled and had a beautiful bathroom.   The bed was very comfortable.    The lighting in the room was very cool and modern.   The service was good.   They gave me a warm delicious cookie during check-in and a bottle of water during check-out.,4,2015,05,01
237,Superb,My wife and I had a fabulous stay at the Morrison. The staff were both hospitable and attentive. We were fortunate to receive an upgrade to the Penthouse suite which was awesome. The hotel is very well located for visiting all of the major attractions and there are plenty of good restaurants if you want a change from the hotel,5,2015,04,30
237,Dawns 40th birthday,"I would like to say a huge thank you to jane for making dawns birthday a day to remember. The room had balloons and banners and also a plate of macaroons with happy birthday wrote out in chocolate on it. The room was stunning it had the best view of  the river. The staff are very helpful and cannot do enough for you. I would highly recommend this hotel and be will definitely becoming back.
Thank you so much for our stay we had a blast.

237,"Great staff, good food, great location, lovely spacious rooms","I really enjoyed here. Check in reception staff very friendly...and a warm cookie on arrival. Bar is lovely, and big glass windows looking on river with nice wine by glass selection. Lovely spacious room . Great location , close to everything",4,2015,04,28
237,This price with no hot water.,"Freezing weather in Dublin, with rain. First night warm bath water, 2nd night had to add hot water from boiling kettle, 3rd night no hot water, no bath. 
Mentioned to front desk, not very interested, still charged the expensive full rate.
My request for the room was high up floor facing the river, booked months ago. Allocated 2 nd floor facing building on side. Said the hotel was fully booked, however this was not the case when I booked. Don't think this hotel deserves rating .",3,2015,04,27
237,My husbands 30th birthday,"We stayed at the Morrison double tree for 3 nights. The hotel was brilliant. Very clean, well presented and modern. It was central to all shops, bars/restaurants and located on the river Liffey. The staff were amazing and could not do enough for us. We had a free upgrade and the room was decorated with balloons and 30th banners when we arrived. A very helpful member of staff named alicjia recommended a fantastic Italian restaurant in temple bar called la caverna they also have us a complimentary desert to celebrate my husbands birthday all arranged by alicjia. Had a great time would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,04,27
237,Summit in Dublin,"I have been in Morrison Hotel in Dublin for a Summit but unfortunately I couldn't sleep there because it was fully booked. I just want to mention the fantastic behavior of the reception, concierge and event staff. During the whole period of the summit they have shown a marvelous avalability to help and solve any time of problem we could face. I only had the opportunity to taste their food during coffee and lunch breaks and I can say the the quality is really excellent. Hope to have the opportunity to come back and stay in Morrison  ! Thank you all !",5,2015,04,26
237,"Great for a business trip, but be wary of time to get a taxi","I've stayed here a few times and always found the hotel to be in a great central location, and extremely modern in look and feel throughout.  This time I had a room above reception on the first floor and did notice road noise from around 7 in the morning.  My only other issue was that on one morning, even though I had pre-booked a taxi, there was clearly an issue and a backlog, which caused one of the receptionist to go outside and hail some taxis.  Mine was 10-15 minutes later than I had booked, which was OK for me, as I was not in a rush, but could have been an issue for someone going to a meeting, so leave yourself enough time. I bought a tin of the cookies as a present.",5,2015,04,25
237,Great hotel great location ,"We stayed in the Morrison hotel for 2 nights at the end of February. We arrived on an early flight so our room wasn't ready when we arrived. We checked in and left our bags at reception. The warm cookies on check in were delicious! 
The hotel is really well located on the Liffey just opposite Temple Bar. We had a river view room which was lovely but quite noisy at night with the road outside and the noise from across the river. 
The room was very modern, clean and well equipped. The bed was huge and comfortable and the pillows were the best I've ever had in a hotel. Wish I'd looked what they were so I could buy some for home!! 
We didn't eat in the hotel, found breakfast was expensive so opted for local cafes, but we had drinks in the bar in the evenings and on Saturday they had live music which was very good. 
Overall we enjoyed our stay and would stay again when visiting Dublin. ",4,2015,04,24
237,Brilliant!!!!!,"What can I say, from beginning to end the staff at this hotel went out of their way to make our stay relaxing and enjoyable. Yes the warm cookies on arrival were delicious but the macaroons they sent to our room as it was my 50th were even better. We were lucky enough to get checked in early giving us a relaxing first day. The location of this hotel is second to none. The rooms are modern and extremely comfortable but it is the staff that make this place, from reception to the bar and housekeeping to the breakfast staff, always a friendly smile and a 'can do' attitude. We shall certainly stay here when we are back in Dublin.",5,2015,04,23
237,"Fantastic, central location Dublin city and a very comfortable stay","So glad I decided to stay here for my first few nights in Dublin on holiday for sightseeing.  It is in a fantastic location, very central and a short walk to many pubs, sites, shopping, restaurants.  Reception at checkin was friendly and welcoming, room was nice and comfortable, and even the restaurant/bar was a reasonable and nice venue my first night there when I was too tired to go back out to eat.  I would definitely recommend this DoubleTree as a place to stay if in Dublin for vacation.",5,2015,04,22
237,"Great Hotel, Great Location","We stayed here over  a weekend, check in was easy and straight forward with the added bonus of all been given a lovely warm cookie!
Rooms were a good size, very modern with comfortable beds.The bathroom was great, with an excellent shower. AC was slightly noisy but thats a minor really. Great location too.
Free Wi-fi, always a winner!
All the staff we encountered were very friendly and smiling. We had an afternoon tea here too which was excellent value for money, and they were fully booked with locals, which is always a good sign.
Breakfast is served until 12, which is marvellous if you have been sampling the delights of Temple Bar, which is literally just over the Liffey.
I will definitely book this Hotel again for any future visits to Dublin.",5,2015,04,22
237,Very comfortable hotel,"Room comfortable, clean. Breakfast good, restaurant good. Excellent WIFI. Very nice cookie on arrival. Would use again gdsfjgsshfvfljfdhuhdfhvshdvkcgbsduhjvcgs.kdjc.ksdgvcjhsgdvcjsgvcjshgvcjhsgvjshgvcjs.vgc",4,2015,04,22
237,Great location,"This Hotel is in a great location for walking to most of your main attractions, the staff are great, helpful and friendly with a lovely warm cookie on arrival. The rooms are very clean and bright with a lovely comfy bed my only disapointment was the bathroom which was for disabled use as there was not a lot of room to have a comfortable shower with a bar on one side and shower curtain on the other and no shelf around basin to put your toiletries(so maybe ask for a non disabled room when you book) but overall a lovely place to stay and will definatley go back.",5,2015,04,22
237,Fantastic,"We enjoyed a fabulous 2 night stay at this hotel. It was our first time in Dublin and we were happy to find this hotel was in an excellent location just a 5 minute walk from the bars and shops. We arrived at the hotel at 10am hoping to be able to leave our luggage at reception until check-in time however our room was ready so we were happily able to check-in early. When we checked out we still had 8 hours until our flight home and once again the staff were very accommodating and allowed us to leave our luggage in reception (for no extra charge) We were warned on arrival that there was a wedding taking place one night and a DJ the next and that we might hear the noise in our room as we faced onto the courtyard, however we did not hear a thing!  The room (209) was spacious, comfortable, clean, well equipped and beautifully decorated. The only thing missing for me personally was a bath (I was looking forward to a long soak following lots of walking around Dublin) but there was a lovely walk-in shower. We did not eat at the hotel, preferring to eat at some of the many restaurants and pubs that Dublin has to offer but we did spend some time in the hotel bar where the staff were very welcoming and the atmosphere friendly. We would definitely love to visit Dublin again and will definitely choose to stay at The Morrison!",5,2015,04,22
237,"Great hotel, great staff, perfect location","Enjoyed an extended weekend in Dublin at the Morrisson. The hotel was very clean, modern, and the staff was super helpful and friendly. The breakfast was excellent and if you feel like staying in for dinner, the hotel's restaurant was delicious with a perfectly prepared steak. And location? Absolutely perfect for crawling Temple Bar or launching out to all of the great sites Dublin has to offer. Would stay here again for sure.",5,2015,04,21
237,Top Hotel 👍,"Very nice people at the Front-desk. Papa Diob was really nice and helpful, also 6.30 am when I came home from the Bar. We had a nice talk and I got a good advice for the light. Thanks a lot. Greetings from Austria, Karim 😜

Very good Breakfast in the Morning. Nice Rooms. Good to sleep 👍🏼",5,2015,04,20
237,Perfection!!!!,"My husband booked a suite for the weekend. I loved our room. It was spacious, updated, elegant, and faced the river. I loved everything about it!!!  The staff went out of their was to be accommodating to everyone. Even the cleaning staff were beyond friendly.  The location was perfect. I will stay here again!  Thank you for making our weekend special and perfect!",5,2015,04,19
237,"Great location, beautiful room, some service issues","If you want a hotel ideally located between Grafton St. and O'Connell St. this is it. Modern, sleek and clean, this property is great for parties with Temple Bar directly across the Liffey via the Millennium Bridge, shoppers at a nexus of Dublin shopping and right on the public transport and hop-on/hop-off tourist bus lines. My one complaint was sloooow service in the Grill. Food/Tea service were good but staff needs training or is being asked to do too much. A niggling detail.",4,2015,04,19
237,A fabulous location with some rare gems for staff!,"My husband and I had am unbelievably wonderful experience from the moment of our arrival which unintentionally coincided with St. Patrick's Day until our departure several days later.  The hotel, location, restaurants and room accommodations were excellent but the true gems here are some of the staff...several of which have given many years service with a warm friendly smile and greeting as well as good advice on some of the smaller haunts and establishments not just frequented by the everyday tourist trying to fit the whole experience into one day.

To name my personal favorites I will never forget a jane who was so helpful upon our arrival...Marciel who always smiles and is willing to be helpful in any way he can!  Additionally, my heartfelt thanks to Katarina who makes a killer latte and I s truly one of the most charming people I hsve had the pleasure to meet on our adventures!

237,5 Star,"The absolute best accommodations. I recommend this for any traveler that wants a peace of mind. % star rating, at 4 star price! Excellent staff as well. I would stay here again. y stay was in Dublin... Thank you!",5,2015,04,14
237,50 Wild Boys To A Room!,"My title refers to the great Irishman Mick Hanly and some of the lyrics from his song from 'All I can remember' which are written on the bedroom wall! Luckily it wasn't the above line but the referral to a Morris Minor...adds to the atmosphere in the very good room I stayed in and the purple mood lighting!
A late evening check in and a warm friendly greeting and directions to the bar which I had to decline!
White fittings may be taken by some to be a bit sterile but it works and the one night I spent there in a very comfy bed and after an 18 hour flight was very welcome.
Bathrooms are also excellent, great size, rain shower over the tub and good lighting...
Air con worked in the room and got it to run warm....
Amenities are also good with water, dressing gowns, mini bar and a Samsung TV.
Would have been nice to open the balcony window but it was locked down.
Breakfast next morning with friendly greeting by Katrina and a very good sized bright and cheerful room. Buffet spread was very good with some excellent choices...food could have been hotter but there is an order from the table option for some items.
Great location near the Liffey, short stay but no time to explore before heading off...",5,2015,04,14
237,Great Taste of Dublin,"I stayed here in late February for a business trip.  The accommodations were great, and the hotel is located perfectly in the heart of Dublin right across from the River Liffey.  I will definitely be returning here for a 6 Nations Cup tournament soon!",5,2015,04,14
237,Perfect Easter Weekend,"We took a 5 day Easter Break, with our 2 adult daughters, and were delighted with this hotel. Its location in the heart of the City and right on the river enabled us to explore and eat in or elsewhere with ease.  The interior is modern with traditional style and service.  Breakfast was extensive and good quality and the Restaurant and bar would be worth a visit even for non residents.  All staff went out of their way to be friendly and helpful.",5,2015,04,14
237,Amazing Anniversary Weekend,"Beautiful hotel which could not be in a better location right on the river across from the Temple Bar Area and a minutes walk from the shopping district.

When we arrived the staff were very welcoming and we even received a special room upgrade with an added happy anniversary message from the hotel staff which was lovely and made our trip all the more special . 

Breakfast is well worth it the sausages are tasty and there is plenty of choice of hot food fruit, continental etc 

We will defiantly be returning !! 

A huge thank you to Jane and her team !",5,2015,04,14
237,Great romantic escape,"Modern hotel in the centre of Dublin. Short walk to all the main attractions, airport bus stop, shops, restaurants, pubs etc. Our room was comfortable, modern and quiet. We also had a really nice little surprise for our anniversary. By the way their cookies were delicious! Excellent stay!",5,2015,04,12
237,Great position,"lovely hotel and perfect for walking around Dublin. The staff were pleasant and accommodating. We only used the hotel for a base and did not eat in the restaurant.
The only reason I haven't give the hotel 5 star was two things. The shower was rather poor for a luxury hotel and the room had locked windows with no natural light of fresh air which I found rather claustrophobic. There was air con and heating but I would alway prefer a window. ",4,2015,04,12
237,A completely modernized hotel,"Everything about the hotel was great. We were in the heart of Dublin, within walking distance to nightlife, the train station, the Guinness factory and just about everything we wanted to do. The hotel was recently refurbished and had the most modern bathroom of all we had experienced in Europe. It also had multiple outlets for charging our many devices. The restaurant was great and we couldn't have asked for more.",5,2015,04,10
237,A memorable holiday stay,"My husband and I fondly remember our stay during Christmas/New Year’s Eve 2014.
The hotel has a fine team that knows how to make guests feel special. It is in a convenient location (close to cultural and historical sites, awesome pubs and restaurants, etc.). The hotel also appears to be “the place” to hold numerous wedding receptions, which makes for a lively atmosphere at times. Even so--we found that hotel staff were responsive to our needs and made accommodations. Thanks for recognizing guests who travel for comfort and serenity. We hope to return again one day!",5,2015,04,08
237,Great Easter break ,"We stayed here with our four year old daughter for two nights over Easter and loved it! The hotel itself is clean, stylish and comfortable and in a great central location by the river. We booked a king suite and it was everything we expected. (Only slight disappointment was the view) Food in the bar and restaurant excellent but what made this stay really special was the level of service and friendly team of staff. Especially in the bar, the restaurant manager (Lewis) and his team made a real fuss of our little girl, keeping her entertained. We will definitely be back!
",5,2015,04,07
237,"Great service, great welcome, very comfortable","From my first approach to book a room they went out of their way to be helpful.  I was arriving at 12 noon from Sydney, could I book in early?  No problem, they would try to have a room ready and they did.  On my return to Dublin I sent my luggage ahead of me by a day - no problem they would store it for me and it would be in my room when I arrived.  And it was.  I could not find the parking entrance - no problem a reception staff member walked out to show me where it was. They were charming.

The hotel has perhaps lost a little of its original edginess, but it still minimalist, clean lines, comfortable and clean, with generous sized rooms and bathrooms, and comfortable beds.  I would happily stay there any time.

Very well situated within walking distance of everything, by the Liffey.  The wifi is fast, and free, the bathroom product if good quality, and the coat hangers are not captive.  I love that.",5,2015,04,06
237,"Great location, quiet and comfortable","Couldn't be better located for on foot touring of Dublin.
Right beside the Liffey and two great restaurants less than 5 minute walk.
""The Winding Stair "" and ""Woollen Mill"" both in the same road beside the Liffey.
Would definitely stay here again.",4,2015,04,05
237,Great hotel in a great location!,"I traveled to Dublin with my family (husband and 1-year old son) and my in-laws. We stayed at The Morrison for 9 nights. We loved the hotel and the location. The staff was great, very helpful and conscientious. They paid attention to what my son ate each morning at breakfast and would always have a banana set aside for him. The location couldn't be better. It is near everything. I would definitely stay here again. On a personal note, I am a hilton honors member which is why I chose this hotel. It was very good for a European Hilton.",4,2015,04,04
237,Getting it right,"Super hotel, staff were professional and attentive, room quirky but slick with comfy-comfy beds.
Did food well after ten due to our late arrival. Breakfast offering is good all round a slick but yet friendly operation. Ten out of ten to the staff that made it a top visit in Dublin.",5,2015,04,03
237,Excellent,I was booked into this hotel with a trip I'd won from work.  I can honestly say I can't wait to return.   The room was fab the whole service was fab the staff couldn't do enough for us.  Excellent service. Beautiful place.  Thank you ,5,2015,04,01
237,Beautiful Hotel! ,"We stayed at The Morrison for four nights at the end of March. We absolutely loved this hotel! The location is perfect because it's very close to and within walking distance to many attractions in Dublin. The staff at the front desk is very helpful with directions and calling a taxi when needed. Our package included breakfast and it was  really good!  There is more than enough choices and you can order off of a menu if you choose.  We had dinner one evening at The Morrison Grill and were very pleased. Our room was very clean and had enough space.
We would definitely recommend staying at The Morrison and will stay there again next time we are in Dublin! ",5,2015,04,01
237,Top quality service,"I would award top marks to the teams working at the Morrison as the best i have encountered in many years.  It really did feel like it was their pleasure to look after us.   The location of the hotel is perfect as you are within walking distance of all the sights.  The food was very, very good too!",5,2015,04,01
237,Great location!,Awesome stay in Dublin.  Location is wonderful and you are in walking distance to almost everything.  Rooms are very clean and updated and staff was very helpful.  Great view of the river.  Would definitely stay again!,5,2015,03,31
237,Wedding,"The room was very clean and the staff was extremely courteous.  The Hotel was very easy to find and had easy access to two main streets.  The location of the Hotel was very central to Temple Bar and allowed us to walk to many tourist attractions, rather than using a taxi.  Great trip and a very nice Hotel.",5,2015,03,31
237,EXCELLENT STAY,"We stayed in The Morisson for 4 nights and I cannot recommend this hotel enough. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. We were especially helped by Maite, Alijia and Jane.  We had a mix of a one bedroom suite, junior suite and deluxe. All rooms were extremely comfortable and stylish. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,03,31
237,Best service in a hotel I have ever experienced . ,"I was upgraded to a junior suite on my arrival and all I can say about the room was it was fabulous - huge bath, comfy bed, plenty of space - the only tiny downside was the shower tray flooded when taking a shower but it really wasn't the end of the world. 
Breakfast was first class; probably the best I've ever had in a hotel and the service was second to none. The staff went out of their way to give the best customer service possible but without being false about it - the whole team was genuinely fantastic and if I am in Dublin again I will absolutely be staying here! ",5,2015,03,29
237,"Lovely Stylish Hotel, Friendly Staff, Good location","We spent a couple of nights here for a business trip. We arrived quite early and the staff did their utmost to get the rooms ready asap. While waiting for the check in they offered us a yummy choc cookie which was very much appreciated.
The gym was not available on site but they offered  us free entry at the gym just around the corner. 
The room was clean and comfy. Breakfast was really good offering lots of options.
The only thing I didn't like is that when l went to the bar and asked for a soy latte they said they didn't keep any (even though it was available in the morning for breakfast). I think the barman was just being lazy, I am not lactose intolerant because I chose to, so it would have been nice if the barman would have been a bit more understanding.",4,2015,03,29
237,Great location & Beautiful Breakfast,Loved the hotel and service provided to us on our stay. Breakfast in the morning had a large range of choices and was delicious. We didn't spend much time in the room because of its great location. I would recommend staying here.,5,2015,03,28
237,Cool !,"The Morrison is simply superb. The decor is miminal, in the rooms and public areas. Airy, cool tones of white mixed with shades of pink. Fresh Flowers adorn the public areas. The rooms are light and airy, our bathroom was enormous with a huge bath, seperate shower cubicle with rain head shower. Luxurious! We overlooked the River Liffey, this hotel is in an excellent location, right across from Temple Bar so within easy walking distance of all Dubli's main attractions. The staff are friendly and attentive. The food, especially chicken pot pie was fabulous. Better chicken pot pie than in the New York pub we tried! Our first Dublin experience was great, thanks mainly to the excellent stay at The Morrison. Just book a room now!",5,2015,03,28
237,middle og everything,"this is a really nice situated hotel, just across the bridge from the temple bar area, walking distance to just about everything

The hotel has a nice standard , clean and good rooms, the hilton honours floor is very nice.

A good bar and restaurant area and very nice breakfast.

the staff is friendly and serviceminded, and we could not find anything to complain about.

can be highly recommended if you like to stay in the middle of everything.",5,2015,03,27
237,What a refuge from our crazy day!,"We stayed at another hotel Monday through Friday morning, but due to our own snafu, we didn't have a flight out of Dublin on Friday morning as we thought, Our options were to be on standby at the airport all day or book a flight for the next day. We opted for booking a flight for the next day and enjoy an extra night in Dublin.. We booked our room and rental car on or cell phone while at the airport and decided we would deal with the flight when we get to the hotel.

So an hour from our booking we arrived at the hotel. We expected to have to beg to get checked in so early, or leave our luggage while we went to do stuff. Nope. I waited in the car (parking was unclear) while I waiting in the car and my husband went in to try to get an early check in. In a short time I see him walking toward the car with a little brown bag containing a warm chocolate chip cookie. Behind him is either a reservation clerk or manager. They all dress and behave very professional so you don't really know by appearance who is management and who is not. He grabbed my bag and walked me up to our room while my husband went to park our car in the parking garage. We were so tired so this was very welcome and very much appreciated. 

After a short rest in our room and getting settled in we came down to the bar to decide what to do for late lunch/early dinner. As we sat there drained a guy walked by my husband and said you look like you need a beer. Ah! He knows what we need! We talked a bit, and then he recommended Koh since we asked for a good Thai restaurant. We went and agreed that it was fabulous!

Love the staff.",4,2015,03,27
237,Faultless in every respect,"Albeit a very short trip the experience the ensured next time we are in Dublin we'll be staying here again. From the minute we checked in to the moment we checked out staff at this hotel were probably the best I've come across, and I've stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world. 

Greeted with a hot cookie on arrival and then coffee and pastry on an extremely early departure were great touches. The room was spacious, clean and well thought out. The view wasn't great but it was one night so didn't really matter, plus this is a city hotel so it's to be expected. 

Beds are comfy and you have a choice of soft or firm pillows so I slept well. 

We only had time for one meal here and that was breakfast. The 2nd best breakfast buffet I've ever had. Didn't feel like buffet food as they will make whatever you want (within reason) and it's of a very high standard.  

Hotel is conveniently located on the river and close to the centre. Takes about 40 minutes to get to the airport during peak periods but only about 20 when quiet. 

Highly recommended
",5,2015,03,25
237,"Great location, Hilton service!","We booked our three day visit well in advance; we were well received by knowledgeable front desk staff.  Our dinner booking in the Morrison Grill was quickly arranged.  Room was a bit small but not lacking in luxury.  High standard of cleanliness.  Attentive and friendly breakfast staff.  Breakfast was well presented, well-stocked buffet.  Bar was friendly though busy.  Grill was great, we had tea one day, dinners with local guests two evenings, every menu item we tried was excellent.  Looking forward to our next visit.",5,2015,03,25
237,Superb Hotel in the heart of Dublin,"A highly enjoyable stay in the heart of Dublin in a superb hotel. The Morrison has recently been refurbished and is now fitted out to a high standard. 

Rooms are clean, very comfortable and come with thoughtful extra touches (like an umbrella in the room which is needless to say essential when visiting the Capital of the Emerald Isle!). Staff were universally charming and always happy to help, especially when it came to storing our bags for the day following check out for our flight home that evening.

A credit to the Hilton chain and look forward to returning soon.",5,2015,03,24
237,Did the job,"Bed comfortable, room nice, service good. Only comment would be that the restaurant service was a tad slow and the options were very limited. Had steak and there is no option should you want some to have vegetables with it. Came with 1 solitary potato and one onion... apart from that very good stay and would 100% go back. Maybe just be more specific when i order or eat elsewhere!!",4,2015,03,23
237,Great hotel,"Fantastic hotel which even belonging to the Hilton chain, has a unique flavour which adds a lot of character. The staff is very helpful, the rooms are big, the food in the restaurant delicious and the bartenders create some seriously amazing cocktails. The gym is small but sufficient and the location of the hotel is great- straight on the Liffey, right in the middle of the happening. I always stay there when I'm in Dublin, a guaranteed good experience.",5,2015,03,23
237,Hotel is Near to Everything in Dublin,This is a newly remodeled hotel that is nicely situated in the middle of Dublin.  Directly across the river from Temple Bar and about 4 blocks to Jameson's Old Distillery and Tour.  The Hotel is comfortable but thought the rooms were on the small side (no unusual for Europe).  The room  had a contemporary look and feel to it.  Done in all white with pink accent lighting.  Only down side was the Gym was being remodeled at the time of our stay so you had to walk outside in the freezing cold to go to one about a block again.  That should be corrected by the time of this writing.  I would stay there again.,4,2015,03,21
237,Chic and central,"We stayed here for three days in March. The hotel goes out of its way to be smart and edgy. The rooms have a one line song lyric on one wall. The lighting in our room was  pink which I found quite garish at first but it grew on me. All the facilities in the room were first class. The bed was huge, the room was also big and the step in shower was lovely. The staff were all very helpful and went out of their way to exceed expectations. The hotel itself is in a great position, across the bridge from temple bar and right on the river. Parking is in a car park about 100 yards down Jervis St, this costs 12 Euros per day as long as you do not need your car in that time - otherwise 3 Euro per hour. The Morrison does manage to combine style and quality, which is tough to do. If you are travelling to Dublin without a car, I heartily recommend this hotel.",4,2015,03,20
237,Absolutely Amazing!!!,"As a christmas present, I decided to take me and my boyfriend away to Ireland for St. Patricks day, as it co-insided closely with our year anniversary together. I spent a long time looking for the right hotel, and I can definitely say, I wouldn't have found anyway more perfect. 

The hotel was situated just over the bridge from temple bar and perfect for all the places we wanted to go. It was even an easy bus ride to and from the airport which cost us just 10 euros each and a 4 minute walk away.

On arrival we were offered gorgeous cookies however unfortunately, me and my boyfriend had given up sweets and chocolate for lent so reluctantly couldn't accept. Next thing we knew, after we have been shown to our gorgeous Junior Suite, there was at the door and the kind lady at reception (I'm so sorry I can't remember your name - Blonde and Irish!) had sent up some other little cake treats and lovely strawberries to compensate for cookies! That set our stay off to a lovely start! .. 

The room was super clean everywhere, and so beautifully decorated and designed. It had a small lounging area (where we enjoyed eating our take-aways at 4am on return!!) and new, easy to operate television with simple instructions for our personal wi-fi. The cleaners did a beautiful job of cleaning the room whilst we were out, arranging everything and doing little touches like organising my makeup I had left all over the worktop in the bathroom- so nice to return too! 

The bed was huge and we had the best nights sleep, no noise from the outside or neighbouring rooms.

Saint Patrick's day was fantastic, great vibes and so much to do! On our second night we decided quite late that we wanted to go for a nice meal somewhere. Alicia was at reception so we went to ask for her advice. Within minutes she was on the phone ringing around to find us a table (which proved a little difficult as it was late/busy everywhere). She was so lovely and managed to get us a table at a very popular restaurant in Dublin- FX Buckley - Bull and Castle. Me and my boyfriend shared the chateaubriand, medium rare and it was the nicest steak I've ever had in my life! 

Breakfast was amazing.The first morning we got down there with 10 minutes before the end, and it was no trouble for any of them. They waited for us to have everything we wanted and all the food was fresh and tasty! The smoothies we really yummy and a nice touch on the breakfast spread. The croissants were also so tasty, as if they had just been made that morning!! The second morning, we got down to dinner too late unfortunately and of course the lovely staff got us some little white take-away bags for some pastries and a smoothie which we were very grateful for! 

We had the most amazing time and would like to thank you all so much for going out of your way for us. 

Thank you!!!! 

Amy and Jules.",5,2015,03,19
237,Just Amazing,"Recently stayed in this hotel in Dublin over St Patricks Day.   The hotel is fantastic, stylish and spotlessly clean.   The staff were all lovely, wishing me happy birthday, and sending a decorated plate with macaroons on with a personal note, to my room.   On St Patricks Day they were so helpful about where was the best place to watch the parade.   We ate in the hotel on the evening of the 17th for a bit of peace and quiet after a hectic day.   The food was fabulous and served promptly.   I would recommend this hotel for location, style, service, cleanliness and the food.",5,2015,03,19
237,Amazing! ,"Stayed here on the 6th March 2015, for two night's with my girlfriend. Can not fault anything at all, everything was absolutely amazing, when we arrived we were handed two warm cookies as a welcome gesture, not only was this very thoughtful we also found out that we had been upgrade to the junior suite, this just made the stay even better than it already was. The room was amazing, big flat screen TV, separate seating area, big walk in shower and big bed! Would definitely be back to stay here, hopefully in July for Ed Sheeran 👌👍

237,Afternoon Tea. ,"Recently visited for an afternoon tea with a group of friends. It was a Groupon deal. Was super. Very tasty ,very relaxed and great service. 
If I was to make one suggestion it would be more  bit more savoury and a bit  less sweet. That being said it was a fab spread and really enjoyable experience.  Definitely recommend",4,2015,03,18
237,Staff went above and beyond when we were in need!,"Stayed at the Morrison the weekend before Saint Patrick's Day. Unfortunately, one night when we were there, we ate at one of the nicer restaurants in town where we had informed the restaurant of my friend's peanut allergy. At dessert, they accidently served him peanuts and things went downhill from there. We tried to find a pharmacy open, but nothing was open at the time. Went back to the Morrison and informed the Food & Beverage Manager and he immediately got a nurse on the phone to speak with us. Also offered to bring up anything we needed. The next day, the front desk manager (Diane - I believe) called us to check in and make sure everything was ok, offered to go pick up some medication and allowed us to stay past the checkout time to 2pm right before our flight left. This was the kind of attentiveness and care we really appreciated. 

Separately, we just loved the hotel bar, which stays open late for hotel residents. The area is filled with light, and incredibly comfortable (more like siting in someone's living room), rather than in a dull hotel bar. We were served three times by Gary, the bartender who provided wonderful service and an amazing humor. 

Rooms are smartly appointed and well laid out. Sometimes the hot pink everywhere can we a bit much. 

Only critiques, were that they sheets were not as soft as I hoped, they maybe use too much starch. 

Otherwise, a wonderful stay with a really nice staff.",5,2015,03,18
237,Afternoon delight,"Recently had the pleasure of the Morrison's afternoon tea experience. The fare was excellent, with a full range of delights, served by attentive and friendly waiting staff. The Hotel itself, despite being close to the City Centre, was quiet and relaxing.
Altogether a very enjoyable experience, well recommended.",4,2015,03,17
237,"Great choice - fabulous location, clean and modern hotel.","We recently sent 3 nights in a lovely junior suite with a view of the river. Lovely spacious room, clean and tidy, comfy bed etc. so no complaints. If you can afford to upgrade I think it is worth the extra cost for a lot more space/view etc. Really convenient spot for a walking tour of this city, lots of bars and restaurants on your doorstep together with a great bar in the hotel with live music of Friday / Saturday evenings. Staff friendly and professional. Would certainly recommend and stay here again on future trips.",5,2015,03,17
237,Gorgeous hotel in city centre,"The Morrison has beautiful rooms, I stayed in the double guest room with a balcony. The room was spacious and the bed was huge. The only issue I had was that the plug in the bath was broken and so therefore the bath wouldn't fill up and the shower was only lukewarm and didn't heat up anymore. Other than that the hotel staff were so helpful and friendly. Be prepared to pay €100 deposit for the mini bar when you're checking in though.",5,2015,03,17
237,Our weekend break,"Just returned from a weekend break in Dublin for my husbands 40th birthday. 
Absolutely fantastic hotel,I couldn't  have chosen anything better. The staff were really friendly and helpful and  the lady on reception  arranged for  some  macaroons to be sent up to the room  on a plate that said Happy  Birthday. Room was lovely and clean and  so comfortable. If we go back to Dublin we would definitely stay here again. Also  breakfast was great with lots of choice, good value for money .",5,2015,03,16
237,Fabulous modern hotel with amazing service,"We arrived at the Morrison tired from driving across the country (from Galway), and after driving around the block several times finally spotted some signage. Unfortunately, we didn't have any idea where we were to park, so my husband just pulled over on the relatively quiet side street while I ran in to ask for directions to the car park. A wonderfully attentive gentleman came back outside with me and pointed out the garage. However, when he learned the time of our flight out the next morning, he stopped us from parking in the car park, as it didn't open until 9 AM on the following day (Sunday) and suggested we park on the street. Conveniently enough, someone had just cleared out of a metered space right in front of the hotel. This lovely man helped us save the spot (by standing in it!) while my husband moved the car and I guarded the bags. He also volunteered to get us change so we could feed the meter, and helped us with our luggage as well. All before check-in! That's service. Our room was 409 on the HHonors floor, and was immaculate. I loved the bathroom design, especially. Very well laid out and thought out room. We both LOVED the shower head! (If someone from the hotel reads this review and could tell me the brand and model of the shower head we would really appreciate it! We would love one at home!). Had drinks at the bar - the dirty martini with peat in it was the most delicious martini I've ever had. Breakfast was served in a spectacular room, and the staff there was also incredibly attentive, even offering us coffee or tea to take away. The cooked to order items were delicious, plus they had a very broad selection of hot and cold items on the buffet, including made to order fruit smoothies! 

You won't go wrong if you select the Morrison. Service with a small, and lots of style and comfort.",5,2015,03,16
237,Afternoon Tea,"On Saturday 14th (day before mothers day), I brought my mam into The Morrison for afternoon tea. I had purchased a voucher on living social, before Christmas, and it was a two for one offer. On Friday 13th March, I realised that the voucher expired that day, and I immediately rang the hotel. The lady I spoke to was extremely accommodating, and told me not to worry that they would give an extension on the voucher. I asked could I book in for the next day, and again she was extremely helpful, and fitted us in, on what was already a pretty busy, and heavily booked day. When we arrived in I handed over the voucher, and we were seated, and our glass of prosecco, was delivered immediately. Usually I am reluctant to hand over a discounted voucher at the start, as you always expect second best, in this case, this couldn't be further from the truth, we were extremely well looked after, from beginning to end. On another occasion, I had brought my mam to The Gresham for afternoon tea, and was extremely disappointed in it, from the tea, which you could make tar out of, to the lack of staff attention. The Morrison, totally out shone The Gresham. I can't recommend The Morrison enough, and we will definitely be back. Well done to all the staff there, they should be proud of the service the provide.",5,2015,03,16
237,"Lovely friendly hotel , excellent service , great location","Stayed here one night for a concert , happened to be St Patricks Day celebrations so Dublin was very busy . Great location , shopping in one direction and Temple Bar literally a stones throw away . Plenty of good restaurants near by too. Hotel staff friendly , helpful and professional and hotel modern and clean with lovely wee touches that add to the feeling of being pampered . The warm chocolate chip cookie on arrival is great too .....",5,2015,03,15
237,Love The Morrison Will Be Back Soon,"My daughter and I stayed here and we loved everything about this gorgeous hotel. The staff were excellent and gave us great suggestions on where to eat. In the perfect area for walking to quite a few great pubs, coffee shops & shopping.  We will definitely stay with you again. Can't wait! Dublin is such a fun city!",5,2015,03,15

237,Fantastic hotel in great location!!!,"Stayed at the morrison dublin for 2 nights on 13th march. WOW what a lovely hotel with brilliant staff, they couldnt be more helpful esp jane the manager.Rooms wer lovely and we had a nice river view. Food at the hotel is to die for and the service is 10/10 lovely waiter with good banter. The hotel is in a great location walking distance to everything u need. Would definatly reccomend this hotel. Thankyou for a great stay. Will definatly be returning. X",5,2015,03,15
237,Great central location,"Stayed here for two nights in March for a wedding. Lovely rooms, very modern and comfortable. Only had drinks in the bar, but the service was friendly and efficient. The location was perfect - thirty seconds from Temple bar and an easy walk to Grafton street. Lots of great shopping and food outlets nearby. 
The shower was my favourite bit - best water pressure I've ever seen! 
Wi-fi was excellent as well as each room had its own network, as well as the general hotel one. 
Decent sized wardrobe with a proper ironing board and iron.",5,2015,03,13
237,Good but will be better after renovations,"Hotel is currently going through renovations. If you like afternoon naps or quiet time this hotel may not be for you, at least through the month of March, 2015. The work stops well before evening and night time so sleeping is not an issue.",4,2015,03,12
237,Great Location!,"Stayed here in November 2014 for our anniversary. Upgraded to a river view, which is fantastic. The location is central to everything, close to shopping, Temple Bar, train stops, and within walking distance to Guinness, Trinity College, and plenty of other sights. The room was decently spacious and clean. I'd highly recommend staying here if you're in Dublin.",5,2015,03,12
237,Like coming home...in Ireland!,"This was our second stay at The Morrison, again after an overnight flight to Dublin.  And it was perfect once again!  The welcoming staff, the beautiful river view suite, the delicious breakfasts, and the proximity to Temple Bar...this hotel cannot be beat for a trip to Dublin!  
While there, wander across the River Liffey to a pub called the Old Storehouse.  There's live Irish music every night.  The mood is lively and entertaining (and the fish and chips is great too!)
We had our son, 7, along and it was great for him as well.
The Irish Hospitality cannot be beat!",5,2015,03,11
237,Great place,"Great hotel.  Room was comfortable, bathroom was large, and the location of the hotel is great- within walking distance of many attractions, restaurants, and bars! Across the river from the Temple Bar area and nice walk to many of the historic churches in the area.",5,2015,03,11
237,Great for cocktails,The cocktails here are to die for. The hotel is on the north side of the quays (river liffey) and is situated close to Henry Street. So you can get a quick tram (luas) close to it. Trendy bar with a young professional vibe about it. Bouncers can be picky at times - but in Dublin that's the way it is. Great place for a few cocktails before hitting the hard pints later.,5,2015,03,11
237,Great hotel in a fantastic location,"We stayed here for 3 nights in march. Fantastic hotel in a great location, a 1 minute walk to temple bar, jarvis shopping centre and the tram. 3 minutes to O Connel street. Clean hotel, huge beds, good bar and restaurant, we couldn't find a single fault.",5,2015,03,09
237,Unbeatable,Visited over the New Year period and had a fantastic time at the Morrison. Had our room upgraded on arrival and found it more than suited our needs - spacy and comfortable. Ideal location on the river for exploring Dublin and within minutes walk of Temple Bar restaurants and bars. Can't wait to come back!!!,5,2015,03,09
237,Top Drawer,"Cosy, comfy and quiet. Duvets were MASSIVE BTW.

Food was great, beer cold etc all the usual.

HOWEVER, this would be my 1st choice EVERYTIME when back in Dublin.

Stayed in a few in and around the town centre and this is by far, the best.",5,2015,03,08
237,Dublin Rugby Weekend,"Staying 2 nights in this hotel whilst expensive was enjoyable. Great location and staff. Atmosphere was very good. No problems and again staff very friendly and helpful eg giving directions to the Dart, organising cabs to airport etc",4,2015,03,04
237,Well worth a visit,"Excellent hotel at the very heart of Dublin, both North and South, making it easy to explore the vibrant city.     Excellent facilities and extremely helpful staff.     Restaurant and breakfasts both very good.  Would certainly recomment to anyone.",5,2015,03,04
237,"Chic Style, Good Service, Perfect Location","I just completed my fifth stay at The Morrison and I have to say that I like this hotel better and better every time I stay there.  I honestly believe that it's the perfect hotel in regards to location and amenities anywhere in the heart of Dublin.   I've had the opportunity to stay here both on business and personal time and it has suited me well on every occastion.

If you're coming to Dublin on vacation, you'll save money just on taxis alone due to the hotel's excellent location.  You are walkable to everywhere in Dublin and, with the exception of the trips to/from the airport and a lazy, rainy morning to Guinness, we didn't use a taxi once.  You are literally a short walk across the bridge from touristy, but fun, Temple Bar and a few minutes further from Grafton Street, Trinity College and Dublin Castle, just to name a few.

I've stayed mostly in standard King rooms in this hotel, which are fairly standard in size for a city hotel - fine for two people in the main area with a typical cramped bathroom only accomodating for one.  But the King Junior Suite provides the best value in the hotel, with an extra large sitting area, balcony (in some cases) and a very large bath with seperate soaking tub and shower.

Breakfast is a highlight, fully stocked with anything that you'd need including fresh jucies and smoothies and a ""bread cupboard"" that is delicious.  You can choose your hot dished from the buffet or order a la carte off the menu.   The Morrison Grill also provides a good choice for bar food or a full dinner if you don't wish to leave the hotel.   It can also be used as a great meeting spot that isn't too loud or as crowded as anything across the river.

Service here is quite accomodating and responsive.  Complimentary candies or cookies usually await me on my first night, along with a handwritten note from the manager.  They do their best to get you in a room early if you have arrived early on an overnight flight (10:30am on this last stay, even though they were sold out the night before).

I'll certainly be staying here in the future.  It is now my go-to hotel for Dublin city center.",5,2015,03,03
237,Another Great Hilton Property,"We spent 6 days in Dublin and really enjoyed The Morrison. The location is great, relatively quiet but only a short walk to the busy downtown. Our room faced the Liffey which I highly recommend. The bed was very comfortable and the room was average size. Staff was extremely helpful and kind, even offering us a ride to the airport at the end of our trip! We didn't eat breakfast here as we prefer a local restaurant. Right next door is a nice spot to get an Irish breakfast and coffee. When we return to Dublin we will definitely be staying at The Morrison!",4,2015,03,03
237,Sad about the rugby result but not the hotel!,Was in Dublin to watch England at the Aviva stadium. Although the result did not go our way this great hotel eased the pain a little. Superb location and a wonderful room. Lovely bar and fantastic breakfast choices. Would definitely stay here if in Dublin again.,5,2015,03,03
237,"Perfect Location, Friendly Staff","Stayed 4 nights in this city centre hotel.  Lovely large, well- equipped rooms.  Very friendly & helpful staff - booking taxis, recommending & booking restaurants etc.

Breakfast fairly standard buffet style although there were some options fir fresh- cooked.  Buffet standard varied over the 4 days.  Sunday morning very very busy but staff still very attentive and apologetic for any delays.

Room very warm even after turning thermostat to lowest setting.",4,2015,03,02
237,Great break in Dublin,"Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights after Xmas. Got upgraded to a suite and were given a lovely warm cookie on arrival.
Hotel was very nice and ideally located just across the river from Temple Bar.
The only downside was the room was quite cold but it was Boxing Day!
Would stay again.",4,2015,03,02
237,Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed here last night with my partner. Cookies on arrival were lovely. The hotel is modern but there is a welcoming warm feeling as soon as you enter. Dean on reception was a gentleman and was so helpful and friendly. 

We booked a junior suite. Room is beautiful. Had drinks in the bar staff were lovely and the atmosphere was great. 

We eat in the italian restaurant across the road for early bird menu the food was top class and great value for money. 

Great hotel great location i will be back again for sure. ",5,2015,03,02
237,Fine. Not mind-blowing.,"Great location, clean, comfortable, no complaints but lacked a little soul. Breakfast was very good. Great spot for hitting the shops. Bar was quite busy with non-hotel residents. It could do with another room for hotel residents only like a library or lounge or something.",4,2015,03,01
237,Amazing staff and really nice Hotel,"My husband and I, we stayed here on 21st, 22nd and 23rd of February. The front desk Manger Piotr Marek and Aliya K, were brilliant and very helpful, we would definitely go there again :D. Absolutely wonderful staff and really nice clean and friendly Hotel :), and you are welcomed with lovely warm cookies :).",5,2015,02,28
237,very dissappointing,"I have just returned from a 2 day break in the Morrison. It was a special Birthday occasion and as the Hotel came highly reccommended I couldn't wait to get there.
I had been told that the rooms were spacious and beautifully decorated. Yes the room was lovely decorated but was very small and I believe it was a single room with 2 single beds put together and everything including wardrobe space was only accommodating 1 person.
On arrival I mentioned at the desk it was a special occasion for me.But little interest was shown.
The Hotel was lacking atmosphere and the bar area and dining area was extremely cold.
The second night we decided to eat in the Hotel .That was the icing on the cake.The meal was like a prepared meal .Cafe food would have been more tastey.
When we advised the manager of this she kindly said I could have a complimentary Breakfast. The last night was awful the noise on the corridor kept us awake all night so we checked out at 5.30 in the morning glad to be going home. The man on the desk said hehad thrown out the noisy quests. and why  did we not ring him during the night to advise him as they had been knocking doors and making noise for 2 hours. Is this my job?
There are many beautiful Hotel in Dublin.Never again.",2,2015,02,28
237,Very Good,Stayed 2 nights on a business trip. The location is fantastic. Also the quality of accommodation and the service was very good. I will surely use this hotel again. The breakfast was very good. Gym was few blocks away but very convenient.,5,2015,02,26
237,Morrison Hotel - Top notch / low price in the heart of Dublin,"Clean, modern, well designed and spacious.  Has a hip 'W' hotel vibe.  Bed was firm but comfortable.   Good water pressure in the shower. Nice breakfast buffet with lots of options for 15€.  Service was very friendly.  Location is fantastic - just two blocks to the Temple Bar, plenty of restaurants nearby.  Free wifi, and easy to connect without having to login and/or register.",5,2015,02,25
237,Great Hotel,"My partner and I stayed at the Morrison in February 15 for the weekend, its a very clean and well presented hotel on the river front. The staff were very helpful and friendly, the rooms were very clean and tidy with great selection of TV channels and well stocked mini bar. The bar down stairs was very well presented with good seating area, I must say that the bar is not cheap in the hotel but Dublin is not a cheap place to go to full stop. The food in the hotel looked great, we didnt have an evening meal here but herd great reviews. The hotel is slightly on the North side of dublin it is all only a short walk away but I must admit we found our selves walking a lot. It was a lovely hotel but for the cost and the location I would have a look for something else. 

Nothing wrong with the hotel but for me I wouldnt stay in this one again.",4,2015,02,25
237,Toasted Sandwich par excellence,"I had the pleasure of eating a lovely toasted sandwich in the Bar ( Quay 14 ) of the Morrison Hotel on Monday 23rd February 2015 - it was excellent. I was served by a most friendly and efficient Lady and I look forward to my next visit, hopefully not to long a wait. The Morrison is located near the Luas stop and is convenient-also- to Woodquay, where the wonderful Open Air Opera is held every Thursday in August and it's free. Mile Buiochas Morrison Hotel",5,2015,02,24
237,Meh! Not Convinced.,"Only the breakfast had that ""cut above"" sense to it that you expect from a four star hotel, and that you would certainly expect for the price which was e100 dearer than the local three star business hotels I have stayed at in the area for work before. However, a good scrambled egg and some nice bread is not enough, in my view to justify the large price difference.
The rooms are generic. Some staff are snobby and a touch judgemental . For example as a lady dining alone at breakfast dressed casually they did not show me to a table and never enquired how my food was. I could not catch their eye to ask for more milk no matter how hard I tried. By comparison group of men in suits at a nearby table were fawned over. Humph! However the staff on reception and outside the breakfast room were faultlessly friendly and pleasant.
Would not go again.",3,2015,02,24
237,Lovely,"Really lovely place to stay in the heart of Dublin close by to all the convenient spots

I'd definitely stay again and recommend to friends 

Very clean nice bar etc

The food is very nice. On of the best places I've stayed in dublin

Great service, friendly staff too",5,2015,02,23
237,Best service bar none,"Not a big one for writing reviews whether good or bad but couldn't let it pass without giving the credit that this hotel and more importantly the staff deserve, myself and gorgeous wife got married on the 21 feb and while I understand we were the bride and groom we still received a service above and beyond anything I have experienced in any other hotel in the world, guests didn't stop raving about the food and service, so a big thankyou in particular to james, Patrick and marceo but to all others who made the day so special, could not recommend this hotel enough",5,2015,02,23
237,Great Place to Explore Dublin,We spent a wonderful three days at The Morrison. We had water leaking from the bathroom into the hallway and were quickly moved and upgraded into a new room. Breakfast was excellent every morning with very good service. Within walking distance to everything to sight see in Dublin.,4,2015,02,23
237,Amazing steak,"We found this place by accident, but we're extremely glad we did. The food and atmosphere was amazing. This place doesn't do the cheapest steak in Dublin. But it's definitely worth paying slightly more for. ",5,2015,02,23
237,My GO-TO hotel while in Dublin,"Location, and convenience. This is where I always stay while in Dublin. Close to most attractions, yet quiet, nice and fresh boutique hotel. The breakfast is excellent, very filling, and the staff is very attentive to your needs.",5,2015,02,23
237,Pretty standard,"Trawling through hotel reviews for our mini honeymoon following our wedding the week before, I spent hours looking for an ideal hotel. I came across The Morrison, and from the other reviews, word of mouth and recommendations we were excited to book a one bedroom suite in the hotel.

First thing I will mention, and very positive is that the hotel is extremely central and is right in the middle of the City Centre. A 2 minute walk from Jervis Shopping Centre - however, there is no hotel car park so you must make use of the Fleet Street Multi-Story car park which is chargeable however discounts are available to hotel guests.

The hotel is lovely, the decor of the reception / bar / lobby and restaurant is amazing. The quirky little quotes all over the hotel are fun and entertaining to read. 

The lift area is quite small, very difficult to manoeuvre around with other guests trying to get in and out with baggage but we managed.

When we entered our room, we were highly dissapointed. The living area was very small and the bedroom area also very small. The reason that the hotel get away with calling this a one bedroom suite, is there is sliding ""wardrobe"" style doors which come out from the TV stand which cut off the bedroom from the living area. The room is very misleading from photos both on the hotel website and tripadvisor. The hotel had provided a complimentary bottle of Prosecco and chocolate dipped strawberries for us as a gift which was very much appreciated.

We didn't let our expectations dampen our trip, we enjoyed every moment of it. 

Upon returning from the hotel we stopped at the hotel bar for some cocktails, which we enjoyed and were quite reasonably priced which is great. The hotel had some live music on too, but we were a bit late as the guys were just finishing up.

We went back to our room, and decided we would get a desert delivered up to finish our night but when we called the room service line, we were told that we could only order sandwiches or a curry after 10.30 which is a bit of a shame as there is no indication on the menu that deserts are only served until 10.30. The main courses, and other options have time's noted on them however the deserts did not so we were disappointed with this.

All in all, a good stay in a modern and clean hotel however it simply didn't live up to our expectations and what exactly we wanted from the hotel.",3,2015,02,23
237,Faultless!,"My boyfriend took me away for my birthday/valentines weekend and chose this beautiful hotel for us to stay in. Well it was perfect. We arrived and were created by helpful friendly staff and they arranged a slightly later checkout for us on the Sunday. Then we were given warm freshly baked chocolate cookies which was a lovely touch. The hotel was clean and modern throughout and had a lovely pick/purple theme. We stayed in a king deluxe room that was spaceouse and had lots of nice touches. The only complaint was the room didn't have a bath. The location was great near to everything in central Dublin. We also had breakfast in the hotel that had a wonderful selection too. There was everything from your traditional break fast to fresh smoothies, a selection of freshly baked breads, fruit and yoghurt. Really enjoyed my stay here.",5,2015,02,22
237,Superb location,"Superb location. Its literally over the river from Temple Bar and a short walk to the shopping areas on O'Connell Street. The service was impeccable as was the standard of furnishings and cleanliness of the room. The only fault I found was that there was no electrical sockets near a mirror which made life for a female difficult! However I contacted guest services and they brought me an extension lead within 5 minutes, so situation was resolved but nonetheless I feel it is a major design flaw with the room. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2015,02,19
237,"Lovely staff, beautiful room and idyllic location! ","From the minute we walked into this hotel we were made to feel special!
The room was always immaculately cleaned and well presented!  The beds were to die for (we had executive kingsize bedroom) really spacious, super comfy pillows and nice firm mattress! 
The little touches made the trip perfect such as the complimentary cookies, dressing gowns and umbrella (which was a lifesaver!) 
Was sad to leave and would definitely return without question!
Thanks again for a fabulous stay!",5,2015,02,18
237,Weekend in Dublin,"Warm, friendly staff all round. Perfect position for exploring the City - on the north side of the Liffey but straight across the bridge into TempleBar. 
Given a HHonours room with a HUGE bed, clean, comfortable with lots of extra little touches - slippers, robes, fridge, mini bar.
Would definitely stay here again and would recommend to anyone visiting Dublin!",5,2015,02,17
237,Not bad but could have been better,"I've been staying in Dublin 2 or 3 nights a week for more than 2 years and this was my first time at this hotel. Great location and a good first impression with reception and the room. Impressed me enough that I asked them to get in touch with a view to me staying more often. 

Unfortunately it was all downhill from there. Bar staff trying way too hard to be funny were just odd. Breakfast was pretty chaotic - no clean tables and ended up sorting one myself. No one ever did contact me about me staying there regularly but can't say that I'm too sorry.

Not what I expected from a Hilton.",3,2015,02,17
237,Excellent beds and more,"Like many reviewers, we loved this hotel for its overall good quality.
No remarks whatsoever.
And the beds are of excellent quality.
Forgot to order eggs Benedict at breakfast, so we will have to come back ;-)",4,2015,02,13
237,Incredible Staff....,"Stayed here 3 nights in beginning of February.  The staff was professional and also very down to earth.  I needed to switch rooms and it could not have been more smooth.  The hotel has a great vibe, I would highly recommend a night(s) here.",5,2015,02,12
237,"Cool hotel, perfect position","I've been staying in Dublin for many years, but this was the first time at this hotel, and this will be the first review of a Dublin hotel, because it was so good.  For a business traveller, it was the perfect balance of sleek, unfussy comfort, with a warm and friendly service without being over-powering.  The location (and I usually stay at The Westbury) was perfect, river views, and stright across the footbridge into Temple Bar (which enevitably brought on the traditional Dublin pastime and headache in the morning.  Perfect.",5,2015,02,11
237,Fantastic Hotel,Stayed for 6 nights and would highly recommend. Location is good and the hotel is modern with fresh decoration and good facilities. Breakfast was very good as was the hotel restautrant for evening meals. All members of staff were friendly and helpful. I would use this hotel again if travelling to Dublin without doubt.,5,2015,02,10
237,Excellent hotel,"We enjoyed an excellent weekend at the Morrison. Ideally located on the north bank of the Liffey just across the river from Temple Bar and only a short 20 minute taxi ride from the airport. The hotel interior is immaculate and the staff were all extremely friendly and polite. We stayed in a corner room (419 on the hilton honours floor) which was amazingly light and airy thanks to it's large wrap-around windows. The bed was very comfortable and the room had all the usual ammenities.

Breakfast is served in a very impressive split level ground floor room which again is very light and well decorated. There is a good selection of hot and cold options including both black and white pudding with the cooked breakfast. You can also have pancakes or French toast and other dishes cooked to order.

In terms of quality, service and location this is an excellent hotel and one I would highly recommend.",5,2015,02,08
237,great place,"stayed for 3 nights, all clean and perfect, breakfast is good, restaurant was nice as well.  only issue is fitness suite is currently being refurbished so closed until april '15 - though they have arranged access to nearby gyms",5,2015,02,08
237,Will be back!! 😊,"Went here weekend 23rd January for my birthday, been here before and it never lets us down.
Brilliant staff couldn't be more helpful, lovely cocktails 
Lovey food, close to everything 
And last but not least gorgeous rooms.",5,2015,02,07
237,Superb hotel in the centre of Dublin,"Morrisons is a bright, modern hotel located by the Liffey, just across the river from Dublin's Temple Bar area and a very short walk away via the Millennium Bridge.  
Reception was well staffed and we were served immediately both on checking in and out with no waiting.  The staff were friendly and efficient and, despite arriving well before the official check in time, we were given access to our room as soon as we arrived (and the complementary warm cookies were delicious!)
The room itself was large and bright, with plenty of storage and all the expected facilities, including room safe, etc.  The bathroom was also large with a full bath / shower combination.
The buffet breakfast was tremendous, with a huge range of hot and cold dishes to choose from. Our only minor niggle was that the plate warmer was apparently broken during our one-night stay so the breakfast plates were cold - not a major crisis, but it did put my wife off taking the excellent hot breakfast.
While quite expensive, the hotel facilities and location are excellent, still making it a very good choice.  While literally a two minute stroll from Temple Bar, the location on the other side of the river makes for a much quieter night's sleep",5,2015,02,06
237,Very good overall,"First, a couple of points about finding the hotel (and the car park, if you're planning to use it).  The signage outside the hotel is not particularly large or eye-catching - we drove past it the first time without realising.  Hotel guests get discounted parking at the Jervis Street car park, and the hotel's website tells you this is on Jervis Street.  Forget that and look for Swifts Row, which runs along the side of the hotel.  The car park is a block or so further on, on the same side of the street.

The hotel itself has a luxurious feel to it, with nice modern décor. Our room was comfortable and a good size.  On both nights that we stayed, housekeeping left us 2 hand towels and 2 bath towels but only 1 flannel (strange).  The one small towel rail was not really big enough to hold all the towels, but overall the facilities were good.

The location is excellent - close to shops, restaurants, bars, and just across the bridge from the Temple Bar area.  We were attending a gig at the Olympia Theatre, which is just a few minutes walk away on the other side of the river.

We went out for breakfast as the hotel option seemed expensive - there are many choices close by that offer good value for money.  One final point - when we went to check out, I noticed we had been charged for breakfast both days, despite not setting foot in the hotel restaurant.  When I queried it, the clerk said they had charged us because we had asked what time breakfast was served and they therefore assumed we were going to have it. They removed the charge on the spot, but if you don't intend to eat breakfast in the hotel, I suggest you make this very clear at check in.",4,2015,02,04
237,"Perfectly located, great price, super friendly, exceptional service.","A perfect location for a City break in Dublin, this hotel is right on The Liffy, a few minutes walk from Temple Bar, but far enough away to have a fabulous  nights sleep in one of the contemporary, clean  and well appointed rooms.. From the moment we walked through the door, the service was second to none, with  friendly, helpful and humorous staff who could not do enough to help us. A slight error with my  room booking on an independent website,  which could have ended up a disaster, was resolved in minutes by the rooms Manager Jane Bridges who is one of the most accommodating efficient and 'Can do' member of the hospitality industry we have ever met, and the biggest reason why we decided to write a review. Her efficiency was evident whenever we saw her helping guests, and the little extras touches  such as hot cookies and coffee to go us each morning just added to the whole Irish experience. We plan a trip in June and we will be coming back  here without a second thought.  A wonderful time made perfect due to the staff and service at this  fabulous hotel.",5,2015,02,03
237,Looked after ,"Firstly a big thank you to Jane Bridge for organising our early check in , nice rooms and a small birthday surprise for the terrible twins . 
This hotel is as clean and modern as previous reviews state . As close as I wanted to Temple Bar and all areas . There was a party / function on Saturday night but closing our windows shut out the noise . Found it strange "" last orders "" were 12.30 am on  Saturday night when we were enjoying relaxing in the hotel bar after a long day . Never had breakfast at the hotel but nice Cafes in the area . More tea bags and milk in room would be good although I never did ask for extra . 
I liked this hotel enough to return if back in Dublin , but the city has priced itself out of my thoughts as there are many more European cities which I will enjoy as much not paying the shocking £7.50 pint etc . ",4,2015,02,03
237,Fab Stay,"We had the pleasure of being guests at this hotel last weekend.
what a lovely treat geting hot cookies on arrival.
We were so thrilled to get upgraded to a suite room 230 is unreal.
There are limited on street parking spaces but a public car park next door for 12 euro for 24 hours for hotel guests.

The hotel is so central to the main shopping streets like Henry street etc.
We had a wonderful stay again thank you to the Morrison for our wonderful stay.",5,2015,02,02
237,Fabulous,"This hotel was fabulous, the room was perfect, the staff were lovely and the breakfast was delicious. A lovely stay, the perfect way for us to belatedly celebrate my husbands birthday. We will definitely be returning to stay for longer next time.",4,2015,02,01
237,Newly refurbished. Great hotel & atmosphere,Great hotel. Very close to Temple bar area and shopping area. Can walk to anywhere in central Dublin within 15 mins. Never took a cab but walked everywhere (but did not rain). Nice bar in hotel. Did not eat hotel but restaurant looked really nice. Costa coffee shop was 2 mins walk away. Will come back and stay here when return to Dublin if the Conrad hotel is too expensive again...,4,2015,02,01
237,"Modern hotel, great location, superb staff.","We stayed here for two nights over the weekend. This hotel is close to shops and just across the bridge from temple bar, easily found and a great base for all activities in Dublin. Check in was a little rushed, but it was busy, and we were given some warm, yummy cookies on arrival.

Room was clean with everything you needed. It was an adjoining room, meaning it's not just as quiet as others, but this didn't impact our stay at all. We were greeted in the room with some macaroons as it was a birthday celebration, a very thoughtful touch! Bathroom has all the essentials, but I feel better use of the space, eg a towel rack beside the bath would free up some space around the mirror and sink, particularly with two girls sharing. 

Breakfast is served until midday at weekends, meaning it's much more relaxed and you don't experience the same free for all as in other hotels. Smoothies juices, cereals and hot food all available, and a menu supplied for cooked to order dishes such as omelettes. Our first day our omelettes were slightly overdone to our taste, but no complaints about anything else. 

We didn't drink in bar, but it was always busy with a great atmosphere.

What makes this hotel is the staff, who are all very friendly and eager to go the extra mile to make sure your stay is perfect, particularly the girls at breakfast. We will definitely return, not just for the location and interior, but for the staff, best we've experienced in a long time.",4,2015,02,01
237,Excellent Service,"The hotel is very modern and nicely done, with a great location right on the other side of the River Liffey from Temple Bar. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the helpfulness and friendliness of the front desk staff in terms of welcoming me to the hotel and helping me out with various arrangements.  In particular, I checked in early in the morning after a sleepless transatlantic flight and the staff worked to get me a room early, before my check in time. This is one of the better hotel experiences I've had.",5,2015,01,29
237,Perfect!,"If you are looking for a hotel in central Dublin that takes care all the big things (like comfort,cleanliness, great food, a relaxed atmosphere,midday check-out,excellent service etc) as well as all the little things (like warm cookies on arrival, bathrobes and slippers in each room, modern interior etc) then book this hotel!",5,2015,01,28
237,Simply the best,"Simply the best hotel we have ever stayed in!  Having chosen Dublin as the surprise destination to celebrate my husband's 40th birthday with friends I then set about choosing a hotel which would help make the trip unforgettable.  I read the previous reviews on TripAdvisor and felt confident with the positive messages that The Morrison Hotel was the one for us - it's the best location for nipping two minutes over the bridge and straight into the Temple Bar area for a pint of the black stuff (though when you go on the Guinness tour they will tell you it's ruby red really).  I contacted Jane Bridge, the Rooms Division Manager, for help in booking the two rooms we required and there were also several other emails back and forth regarding additional surprises for my husband.  Jane was also great with recommendations for restaurants and things to do to help create the perfect experience.  On arrival I would say we received the warmest welcome I have ever had in the world - genuinely.  The reception staff were lovely, happy, smiley people and any time any of us approached reception to ask a question or check something the staff were as helpful as you could possibly hope for.  We were then taken to our rooms - I suspected nothing and as we were led along the corridor of the 4th floor to a door with its own doorbell (!) I could not have imagined we had been upgraded and were about to enter the Penthouse Suite for our stay.  The giant birthday balloons I had ordered were just inside the door - fantastic (and I think perhaps Jane or another member of staff may actually have collected these from a local store themselves?). Jane - we've said it already but we can't thank you enough for this wonderful, generous surprise for our celebration.  The room was amazing, unbelievable and we feel so lucky to have experienced this.  We had arranged to meet our friends back in reception in 15 minutes so had to drag ourselves away from the suite to go back downtairs.  We were approached by the duty manager - Patrick - who was lovely and wished my husband a happy birthday.  He then showed us all to the bar area where a table had been set for us to enjoy some bubbly and then Patrick returned with the cake I had ordered.  Oh my word - what a cake.  Thank you so much to the pastry chef who created such a beautiful cake (and there was me thinking it would be a simple Victoria sponge!).  Our whole stay at the hotel was wonderful - the bar staff were great as were the breakfast staff (oooh, delicious breakfasts!!).  And the downside?  We've been so spoiled by the service of the staff that we're convinced no hotel, ever again, will come close!  So, we'll be booking a return trip as soon as possible and would stay in the broom cupboard if necessary as long as the staff keep up the amazing work they do.  THANK YOU ALL SO VERY MUCH.  Jo & Barry.",5,2015,01,28
237,Woudn't Stay Anywhere Else,"This hotel was perfect, stayed five days in December My wife and I had had a nice room with a view of the Liffey. We didn't experience noise in our room but we got up early and went to bed late. The staff was super, the restaurant and bar also great.  our room included breakfast. The breakfast couldn't have been better It included everything you would ever want and more. The location could not have been better. Only a few blocks to O'Connell St. where we watched the lighting of the Christmas tree and a very short walk over the bridge to The Temple Bar area where the Pubs are,. great Hotel. The front desk arranged a taxi to the airport for us the night before our departure. It was the safe way because in the morning rush hour you don't want any problems.. Intertainment on the weekends in the bar. A very comfortable stay..",5,2015,01,27
237,Lovely hotel in a great location,Just come back from a 3 night stay at the morrison. We could not fault it. We had a river view and although u could here some traffic noise we didnt find it a problem. Breakfast was exellent and the staff were all very friendly a special thank-you to jane bridge to went out of her way to make our stay memorable. If we come back to dublin we will be staying at the morrison.,5,2015,01,24
237,Excellent Refurb and Top Notch Customer Service,"I stayed at the Morrison the first week it opened ages ago, and since then every time I travelled to Dublin.  Double Tree have done an amazing job in revitalising the décor, the comfort, the restaurant, the bar, etc...  and to top it all off the customer service is second to none.",5,2015,01,23
237,Very enjoyable break.,"We were given a two night break at The Morrison by our daughter as a Christmas present and as we had not been to Ireland before we were really looking forward to it. The hotel did not disappoint. The welcome that we received was excellent and although we were too early to check in to our room our cases were taken from us and we were shown to the restaurant where we had a very welcome breakfast before setting off to begin our sightseeing. We cannot praise the staff enough as they were all so helpful,efficient and friendly and made us feel as if we were the most important visitors. Thank you so much and we hope to return to the Morrison in the not too distant future.",5,2015,01,22
237,Excellent location to explore Dublin,"A modern, trendy hotel in the heart of Dublin, on the River Liffey.  Minutes walk across any number of bridges to Temple Bar, shopping, Trinity, and more.  Our room was a huge junior suite and had all the amenities.  One issue I had was the fact that the very high ceiling in our room (it was about two stories high) made it difficult to get the room warm and cozy; there was only one heating unit for this large room and that left the bathroom very, very cold as well.  Trendy restaurant and bar, very lively.  Friendly front desk staff.",4,2015,01,20
237,Superb!!!,"We chose this hotel as it says it was in the centre of Dublin. So we got to the hotel via starbucks and it is set in a lovely location right next to the river. We arrived at the hotel and was greeted by the most kindest receptionist I have ever come across, she told us that our room wasn't ready yet and asked us what we were doing the rest of the day which was sightseeing and eating. So she gave us a map and our cookie and off we went to explore. So we went to all the main attractions and had lunch and went back to the hotel to see if our room was ready. It was ready so we got our key and headed to our room and to our suprise it was gorgeous. It was all white with pink lighting we just fell in love with it. We slept like babies in the huge bed. The next morning we didn't have breakfast in the hotel as we thought it was quite expensive so we went to the cafe across the road which was really tasty. After a quick checkout we were on our way back to Manchester. 
Overall hotel was just amazing in a superb location.",5,2015,01,20
237,Back for more cookies,"I had a two night trip to Dublin and booked into the Morrison, having not stayed here for a few months. Check in went smoothly and I made my way to my room with my cookie. The rooms was very modern, clean, comfortable and stylish.  Getting a taxi here isn't always easy, so if you need to get somewhere on time, book a taxi from reception in advance. I didn't eat in the hotel, but popped over the river to Temple Bar, which is very close and convenient. ",5,2015,01,17
237,Great modern hotel!,The rooms are clean and modern. There is tons of space with a fridge and tons of outlets for charging electronics. It is is an easy walk to the Temple bar area and many others.  The staff was very helpful when we had issues with parking . ,5,2015,01,16
237,Excellent location and lovely hotel,"This hotel was perfectly located. It sits at one end of the footbridge which directly leads you to the Temple Bar and shopping areas.  On the doorstep of the touristy fun yet away from the noise and bustle!
The hotel itself was clean, contemporary and served  a great selection at brekkie. The cocktails were lovely too (we didn't have these at brekkie!!!) Staff were friendly and rooms lovely. 
All in all I can't find fault (although the hubby says that beans with brekkie would perfect things!) 
Deffo recommend! ",5,2015,01,15
237,Fantastic hotel with friendly staff,"Visited Dublin for my partners 50th birthday. I had emailed the Hilton head office three times before arrival requesting a bottle of fiz for the room, three times I was advised they had forwarded my request to the hotel and that somebody would be in touch, that never happened. when we checked in I showed the receptionist the emails, She could not have been more apologetic. She spoke to her manager who straight away upgraded our room and sent a few glasses of prosecco up along with a desert that said happy birthday, he followed up with a phone call and an email. Found them to be so helpful and really concerned with what had happened. The rooms were gorgeous, food fantastic, location excellent and the cocktails were amazing.  Will definitely be back again",5,2015,01,11
237,Afternoon tea.,Went with friends for afternoon tea. The food was great and the staff were very attentive. I would definitely anyone looking to go for afternoon tea with friends to go to The Morrison. You won't be disappointed. ,5,2015,01,10
237,"Friendly and accommodating staff, nice rooms","You simply cannot beat this location when staying in Dublin. Less than a five minute walk, and you're in Temple Bar!

As far as the hotel goes, once we got our room situation straightened out, I have no complaints. My husband is a Rewards Diamond Member, so we stay in Hilton hotels all the time. We were initially given a room on their rewards member floor with a view of the courtyard. The room was spacious, clean, and new. Only complaint? The room was SWELTERING hot - even with the windows open and the heat turned off (and this was in December/January, so by no means warm out.) I'm talking we were actually sweating it was so hot. We had maintenance come to our room, to be told that the AC unit was broken. 

Thankfully, after a quick trip downstairs to speak with the front desk, we were placed in a new room - one with a working AC. Even with the AC off and the window closed, the room thankfully was much less warm than our previous room. The room was on the same floor, and actually a bit nicer than the original. We actually encountered overly warm rooms on our trip throughout all of Ireland - I guess people there just like it super warm when they sleep? Maybe living in Florida I am just used to keeping the room cold for sleeping. Either way, we were happy to have had the problem fixed so quickly.

Breakfast was included with our stay and we ate breakfast all three mornings. You have the option of a decent hot buffet, or cooked breakfast. We just stuck with buffet. We also had several cocktails in the bar by the lobby and found service to be good.

Overall, provided you can get a room that isn't sweltering, or don't mind sleeping in VERY warm conditions, this is an excellent hotel with the same service we have grown to expect from high-end Hilton hotels. And again - the LOCATION is priceless!",4,2015,01,10
237,"Lovely hotel, highly recommended, fantastic staff","This was my third or fourth stay and once again a near-perfect experience. Staff on reception, in restaurants etc are excellent; really friendly and helpful. 

I was upgraded to a ""junior suite"" which was really just a big room with a bigger bathroom, but lovely nonetheless. Very modern, spacious, nice lighting, nicely decorated, great shower, although over the bath; a walk- in is always better. 

Wifi is free, fast and everywhere. This is a real plus when so many hotels charge a fortune for even crummy wifi. 

Excellent full breakfast. Didn't eat dinner in the restaurant this time but I know from past experience that it's excellent. 

Location of the hotel is great; just a short walk over the bridge into town. 

All in all, difficult to fault this hotel. Highly recommended.

237,Highly recommended,Wonderful traditional and continental  breakfast. Excellent services from the staff. Staff really go out of their way to make your stay a pleasant one. Very conveniently located. Tastefully decorated rooms.,4,2015,01,08
237,Amazing room and food,"Stayed here in October for my girlfriends birthday, staff are very friendly and welcoming with cookies and extras on front desk, it's based right in the heart of Dublin other places would be cheaper but you then have to travel. The room had everything we needed! High end finish. Only downside is the bathroom they feel small and more at home in a travelodge/premier inn. Had breakfast in bed which was lovely and had a meal in restaurant down below the food and service is great! Only down part is we stayed above the bar/restaurant and the noise can get a it loud. 

Would stay here again in a heart beat

237,Fantastic Hotel,"Fantastic hotel.  we booked this hotel as a couple looking to explore Dublin.  The location is perfect, right on the river and a very short walk across a bridge to Temple Bar.  Close enough to enjoy but not hear.  In the other direction it is a 5 minute walk to O'Connnell Street and Grafton Street where the main shopping areas are.  The hotel itself was extremely well presented from the reception up and the staff were efficient and helpful.  The room was large and comfortable and very well equipped with flatscreen tv, iron, hairdryer, mini bar etc with a comfortable bed which was great after a day walking around Dublin.

Next time I am in Dublin I will be sure to stay at this hotel.",5,2015,01,05
237,Exceptional Staff,"From the moment we arrived we were treated exactly as I would expect from a Hilton property and then some. The staff recommended local restaurants that exceeded expectations. The hotel is within walking distance of the Gothic district which includes the Dublin Castle and the Temple Bar district, if you are into that.
We were surprised by the decor of the room, not that it was bad, but it felt cold and night clubish, which I guess fit the area but not our taste. Really though, I would stay here again without hesitation, regardless...",4,2015,01,04
237,Comfortable Stay in a Great Location,"Pros and Cons:

Pros:
Great location! The hotel is walking distance to all the major attractions and the temple bar area. 
Staff is helpful. Anytime we had questions we were able to get them answered and they could recommend places to eat or visit. 

Cons:
Bed was not very comfortable, otherwise no complaints!

I would highly recommend this place, and will definitely stay there again. Especially for the location!",4,2015,01,04
237,Great stay,"We were here for a wedding and everything was as good as you can ask for. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. The showers are brilliantly powerful.

237,Hotel very well located,"The hotel is very near Temple Bar and the commercial zones. It is because you can go by walk almost everywhere The room is comfortable, and the bed very big We had breakfast every morning, and the quality was excellent. Sometimes, when there was a lot of people,  the buffet was not restocked quickly. The gym is not very big, but for me was enough and pleasant. All the machines looked new In conclusion, I recommend this hotel",4,2015,01,03
237,Excellent stay,"I recently stayed here with my family over the Christmas holidays. This was a great place to stay in Dublin. It's very close to all of the places you want to visit in Dublin, including the Temple Bar area, Dublin Castle, the Jameson distillery, etc. All of these are about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. The staff was very helpful and attentive. Rooms were comfortable and clean. Will definitely stay here if I ever find myself in Dublin again!",5,2015,01,03
237,Another excellent stay at the Morrison,"Second stay didn't disappoint.  All staff extremely helpful and friendly.  Rooms, clean, spacious with more than adequate supplies/comforts.  Hotel is ideally located for all Dublin's main attractions.  Would definitely recommend and we will definitely be back.",5,2015,01,03
237,Very good!!!!!,"This hotel was so nice!! We are pleased with absolutely everything here! The room was perfect! Modern, delicate and spacious. It just look so classy and inviting! And a good working free wi fi! The bed is really good, almost too good - to be honest we looked forward to jump in there again when we were walking Dublins streets. The staff is so polite and helpful and the service in the bar and breakfast is also exellent. We felt so warm welcommed overall. We sure will be back and also we will recomend this hotel to our friends. And the location couldn't be better - just cross the bridge outside the hotel and you are in the Temple Bar. And 5 minutes walk the other direction is lots of shopping everywhere. It's in the middle of everything!",5,2015,01,03
237,Fantastic hotel and service,"We first stayed at this wonderful hotel ten years ago, as a two night stop gap on our honeymoon. We have just returned from celebrating out tenth wedding anniversary. We were slightly anxious that it would not be as brilliant as we both remembered, but in fact it was better.
The hotel has undergone a huge revamp since we last visited and it looks fabulous. Lots of thoughtful touches, clever design and spotlessly clean. 
Our room was comfortable, spacious and had everything you could expect in a hotel room. 
The breakfast was outstanding, there is a fantastic buffet to choose from as well as other items cooked to order which arrived very quickly and piping hot. 
Special mention though should go to the amazing staff...from the second we walked through the door we only ever came across smiling friendly people who made us feel incredibly welcome. Nothing was too much trouble. The Morrissons stands out from others as a result of this. 
We wouldn't hesitate to recommend the hotel to others, whether to stay or just to pop in for afternoon tea ( fabulous) and will definitely be back.",5,2015,01,03
237,"Beautiful Hotel, with superb facilities but.....","This Dublin Hotel, recently purchased by a Russian Millionairess is a wonderful experience in that it's ambiance is so customer friendly. I think that its furnishings are specifically the work of International Fashion Designer, Paul Costello. But I'm afraid that the quality of some of the food leaves much to be improved upon. I thought that the cost of the full Irish breakfast (€15) was a little pricey. If that could be addressed satisfactorilly, this would be a superb experience I feel.",3,2014,12,31
237,Perfect Stay,"We stayed at this Hotel for Christmas. The room Twin Deluxe was modern sparkling clean walk in shower in fact perfect. 
I must comment on all the Staff who throughout our stay was helpful in every way.
The Buffet Breakfast was excellent. 
We shall be returning to this Hotel definitely.",5,2014,12,30
237,Double Tree delight in Dublin,"Instead of exchanging presents that we don't need at Christmas we decided to have a city break in Dublin. We chose this hotel as it appeared to have a wow factor and was near the city centre. But it was still a bit of a blind pick as we hadn't been to Dublin before. The hotel definitely has that wow factor and couldn't have been better situated for access to the city as it was almost opposite the Millenium bridge over the River Liffey which gave immediate access to the Temple Bar area.

The hotel is modern and has a stylish meets functionality feel about it. We loved it.

We were given a warm welcome and the traditional warm cookie that is a trademark of Double Tree Hilton.

The room was furnished with a stylish combination of white lacquer and mirrors with purple accents. Simple but effective. There was a line from a Damien Rice song on the wall. I love his music so this was a nice surprise. There are lyrics from Irish musicians  throughout the hotel. The bed was huge, about eight feet wide and very comfortable. The bathroom was clean, tidy and had plenty of towels.

Our lovely bairns, unbeknown to us, had contacted the hotel and had arranged for a bottle of Moet & Chandon and rresh berries to be in the room as a Christmas treat. The hotel didn't let them down. Nice one Morrison, nice one the bairns.

We ate in on our first night after a foray into the bars at Temple Bar. We both had something from the Josper Grill. Superbly prepared fillet steak. Good food and good service in a calm environment made for a memorable experience.

We popped in and out of the hotel during our stay and were very impressed with the staff and the welcome in the bar area.

Would I go back to this hotel? Definitely. No hesitation whatsoever.",5,2014,12,29
237,Fire alarm,"If you stay in this hotel and the fire alarn goes off in the middle of the night....there are no announcements made
The alarm just makes one hell of a noise....no idea if is false alarm or real.
No staff checking floors
Lots of confused guests wandering  around. 
Would expect more from this hotel chain.

Just so you  know.

Otherwise, a great hotel. Enjoyed our stay! ",5,2014,12,28
237,Excellent,"Great location for both sides of the liffey. Friendly staff who were very helpful, professional and not overbearing. For breakfast I strongly reccommend popping downstairs to Panem. Very stylish layout in the rooms too. Only gripe is that the shower was fitted wrong end of the bath. You'll need feet size 36 or smaller to get closer to the showerhead.",5,2014,12,28
237,Perfect Place to Stay in Dublin,"I feel like I had a great stroke of luck in choosing to stay at this hotel. 

-Well-maintained, nice sized rooms with necessary amenities
-PERFECT location. Right across a foot bridge from all of the action. And in Dublin, you by no means want to stay any closer to the Temple Bar area!
-Nice, helpful staffers
-Delicious breakfast offered

Don't have a single negative remark about this hotel. Would stay here again!",4,2014,12,24
237,First Class again and again,"I have had the privilege of staying in the hotel 3 times in the last 6 weeks.  The welcome, care and attention we got on the first occasion made us re-book again and again. On the last visit we were celebrating my sisters birthday and Jane made sure everything was looked after to perfection.  This is the norm for JANE.  Jane ensures that each guest is looked after and has the most relaxing stay.  Everything about this hotel is first class, the location, the rooms, the breakfast, the staff and the service they offer, even the products in the bathrooms are Fab. If you are staying in Dublin book this hotel without hesitation.  It really is first class.

Thank you for looking after us in 2014 and look forward to seeing you in 2015.  Happy Christmas",5,2014,12,24
237,excellent as before,"This is our second visit to this hotel as a pre Christmas treat. Would not hesitate to return any time of year. Everything was excellent, breakfast, staff, service, facilities and near the centre of Dublin easy walking 5-10 minutes.",5,2014,12,24
237,Fab Stay,"Had a wonderful experience staying in the Morrison Hotel last Saturday Night. Paul Joy excellent also Jane in reception. Would deffo recommend this City Centre Hotel. Fab staff, Fab Food and ideally located.",5,2014,12,23
237,Excellent Dublin City Centre Hotel,"This was the first time we've stayed at The Morrison and based on our experience, it won't be the last time.  Upon checking in, we got some warm cookies and a letter from the General Manager - this probably comes from being an HHonors member so it was a nice touch.  Reception was also nice and when I got on the room, she even called to see how things are.

We luckily got a suite which had a living area with a dining table (with 4 chairs) and a couch.  It also had a Nespresso coffee machine and a small refrigerator.  The living area has a flat screen television.  The bed was a Super King (which was actually firm) and we were able to sleep with no problems.  The bedroom also had a flat screen television.  It has a mirrored closet with bath robes and slippers.  It also had the usual ironing board, iron, and in-room safe.  There were two entrances from the living area to the bed room and can be closed (though not locked).

The bathroom was excellent.  It had a double sink, a separate bath and shower area.  The toiletries were from Crabtree & Evelyn (the Citron range).  These were excellent.  It also had two entrances (one from the living area and the other from the bedroom).  The bathroom doors seem to be auto close which was a plus for me.

The room is on the side of the Liffey which had a good view of Dublin.  But being on that side also meant that you could hear some noise from the outside which is normal being in the city centre and on a weekend at that.  This didn't bother us.

Breakfast is in one of the restaurants which had two levels.  It had a screen projector showing some show (but there's no sound).  Breakfast had excellent choices and very good service.  They had the usual hot and cold buffet and the different juices.  And they have a separate menu where you can order Eggs Benedict/Florentine, Pancakes and others.

They also supported Careline which is a number you can call to make your stay better.  I didn't use it as our stay was as perfect as it could be.

This is definitely a hotel we would stay in again whenever we're in Dublin.",5,2014,12,22
237,lovely hotel,"14 of us stayed at this hotel, a birthday wk- end. The rooms were spacious & clean. The staff couldn't do enough for us, even finding a restaurant that could take 14 people at short notice. The hotel itself is situated over looking the river very close to shops & bars. We all would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2014,12,19
237,did not sleep for three nights,"The bed I slept on felt like a penance so I complained and two weeks later they said it was a new bed that's why it felt like a total torture... DONT stay here its overpriced and I had to deal with people in their Pyjamas at breakfast.. really staff are not responsive to customer needs try other places e.g. Camden court same star rating excellent value I would never stay at the Morrison again EVER, their breakfasts were truly horrible for the money listen go elsewhere even eat breakfast elsewhere and you would be better off ...had it not been for my company paying I would have gone 1st night ! Pure Rubbish That's is what got Ireland into trouble economically in the first place they ask too much and give so little",2,2014,12,19
237,4.5* - great shower pressures!,"Stayed here on the weekend - room in the HH floor (4th and top floor of hotel).  As HH gold, we got internet access and standard buffet plus cooked breakfasts (egg Benedict and egg Florentine).   The room has 2 single beds joined as a king - beds were very comfortable, tea / coffee making facilities, flat screen TV.  Bathroom was spacious with shower (no bath). However, the shower head was a thin long handle with 3 sprays of water with great pressures (loved it).  Bathroom amenities were basic.   The hotel location like everyone said was excellent - within walking distance of airbus transfer, and to Temple Bar areas, shops and restaurants across the river.",4,2014,12,17
237,Can't wait for our next stay!!!,"The location of the hotel is fantastic with only a short walk to the shops.  On check-in we were informed that we had been upgraded to the Penthouse!!! It was stunning with a sitting room, dining room, large spacious bedroom and bathroom, we even had our own Christmas tree.  The reception staff especially Jane Bridge were very friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble.  i even have to mention the warm cookies that you get on arrival my husband is still talking about them. Overall the hotel was modern, stylish and clean, we could not find fault with anything and we cannot wait to return. :)",5,2014,12,17
237,Ideal for Business and Leisure,"I always stay in the Morrison when in Dublin due to the convenient location, friendly staff and high quality of both public spaces and guestrooms.  Standard rooms are smallish and the modern decor (all white) is probably not everybody's taste, but beds are comfy and bathrooms offer all amenities. Rooms are well-kept and clean. Stay clear of the Liffey-facing rooms as traffic and nightlife in the area are loud. Great breakfast selection and an always-lively bar with excellent food as well.  Overall, mostly worth the money",4,2014,12,16
237,Very nice and excellent internet,Room accommodations were very nice. Internet was great! Shower water temp was excellent and consistent. AC unit was somewhat loud. Sometimes street noise was a little loud. Gym facilities were nice. Breakfast and laundry services was pricey.,4,2014,12,16
237,Great hotel,"fantastic location next to the river and near to the shops on both sides. Also close to (5 mins walk)half penny bridge and temple bar (10 mins walk). Rooms are modern and comfortable and staff where helpful and friendly. The hotel bar and restaurant was busy with local guests as well as people staying in the hotel, so had a fantastic atmosphere. The food was good and decent priced. I'd recommend this hotel and will be staying again in future. ",5,2014,12,14
237,"Very, very nice! But parking sucks!","We got into Dublin after 4pm on a Thursday evening and it took seemingly forever to make our way to the parking garage near the hotel.  Luckily, this was the parking garage the hotel uses too.  You just must pay the general public rate.  The only problem was we had to leave for the airport at 4am the next morning (for a 6am flight) and the parking garage didn't open until 7am.  This would have been nice to know in advance.  If you have to get your car out during ""off hours"" - good luck!  We were a little disappointed the hotel didn't ask us when our flights were in advance and warn us about this.  Fortunately, we were paying attention and got back to the neighborhood JUST as the evening street parking became free (7pm I think), and got our rental car out in into one of the spots out front of the hotel. The rest of the spots on the street were full by 7:05pm.  I am not sure where we would have parked if not for the perfect timing.  
Now, the good stuff.  The room was awesome.  We were upgraded to a suite of sorts which was spectacular.  I wish we had more time to spend in it!  I think we slept for 3 hours in the room and then headed to the airport!  But we enjoyed our night in Dublin regardless.  The location of the hotel was great for the nearby shopping district, as well as the Temple Bar district just across the river.",4,2014,12,13
237,Very enjoyable meal and high hotel standards,"Invited to a professional body dinner. 1st impression very professional and clean. Unsure if rumour is true but the russian billionaire owner has refurbished the hotel to an exceptional high standard. Xmas atmosphere and the dinner was excellent, steak medium rare to due for. Definitely will go there again",4,2014,12,13
237,"Good service, catty receptionists, flawed design","From my first night in the hotel, I noticed that my room was warm as long as I turned the AC off, but my bathroom was freezing cold. Apparently, there is like, an ""air vent"" that brings in cold air to the bathroom. 
I contacted the receptionists to fix this issue since it was December, and it got really cold at times, and all they said was that the hotel was designed in a certain way where we cant do anything about those air vents. They just have to be there, i guess.
I asked for a real solution, and one of them suggested that I keep the bathroom door open, like all night long, since the bedroom was much warmer! Didnt really work, to be honest.
The rooms are well designed, well-lit, the bed is comfy. My window was kinda tiny, but its not big deal.
The service was good, the receptionists were really helpful, but 1 or 2 of them had a catty attitude, and seemed to be mocking me!! I knew what they were doing; I just chose to ignore them. Im not sure if this only happened to me, or is sometimes noticed by other customers, but I didnt appreciate their attitude, or their attempts to be ""funny"" at my expense.",3,2014,12,12
237,A magical experience,"I stayed at the Morrison on the 1st December. As I was planning on prosposing that weekend I had asked the Morrison if there was anything they could do to make it special. 

We arranged some bubbly in the room, and the hotel staff could not do enough to make the stay a special one. My room was upgraded to a stupendous room on the 4th floor, so good that we really had to tear ourselves away to go to a gig that night, and we more or less ran straight back.

All in all the best hotel stay I've ever had, with superb service from Jane, Maria and the team at the Morrison, thanks so much.

P.S. She said yes by the way :)",5,2014,12,12
237,Great Mojito but don't be late for breakfast!,"A warm cookie on check in - lovely, modern rooms & city centre great location. Fab cocktails in the bar/lounge...yum...yum. Be sure to arrive down to breakfast on time(early), we were denied access as they had cleared the buffet prior to the cut off time. We were accommodated else where but it marred the experience",3,2014,12,12
237,"Exellent, but ...","The room was cold. I told the receptionist, and she vas very helpfull and contacted the ingeneer imidiately.  But it never got to a normal temparature - especially the bathroom was very, very cold.  Philip Rendtorff",3,2014,12,11
237,Good for city break,Lovely hotel along the quays just minutes walk from both Henry Street shopping and Grafton Street shopping. Lovely staff on arrival and departure. Bedroom was lovely although attention to detail and cleanliness in the bathroom needs to be looked at. Noise from the street was a bit disruptive but not terribly intrusive,4,2014,12,10
237,Great Location - Wonderful Hotel,"We were only in Dublin one short night before our early flight out, but the location of this hotel made it super easy to hit our highlights which were the Guiness Storehouse and Temple Bar area.  It is also conveniently located right by the shopping district if you need to pick up any gifts.  And they give you warm cookies when you check in - who doesn't love cookies?!  Also, every time we asked a staff member a question about directions, they came out from behind the desk and physically walked us out to point us in the right direction.  They were all very helpful, professional and friendly.  My only complaint would be that the parking deck that they use (with a special 12Euro rate) is owned/operated by another company and is not open 24 hours.  Since our flight left early, we could not leave our car in the deck (unless we wanted to pay a ridiculously high ""call out"" fee to have someone come open the garage after hours) and had to secure our own street parking.  That being said, there is free parking right across the street from the hotel after 7pm.  If you find yourself in the same situation, I would recommend having your car ready to park, if not already idling with you in it, right at 7pm.  We parked at about 6:58PM and all of the spots were full within minutes.  We were super happy to be upgraded to a suite, which was pretty sweet!  It was a very posh, comfy and large room with a separate living room area, and were only sad that we didn't get to stay longer to enjoy the hotel and all that Dublin has to offer.  We did enjoy a week of touring around and would recommend that too though - loved the country, the people and the culture!",5,2014,12,09
237,Great Hotel,"I stayed for a night in early December and was thoroughly impressed by the hotel. A very comfortable room and an ideal location for Dublin's main shopping areas and Temple Bar. 
The breakfast buffet was amazing with a broad selection and the option of ordering dishes from the menu.
My only criticism was that as a HHonors Gold member, I wasn't offered an upgrade! Overall I would thoroughly recommend this hotel",4,2014,12,09
237,the morrison on a friday night,friendly and helpful staff but beware of the friday night live music event.  My room was directly above this event and the party raged until 2-3am.  Not a wink of sleep was had that night.  The food is marginal - breakfast is better than dinner.  The beds are really small - ask for anything but the doulble/twin configuration.,3,2014,12,09
237,Brilliant Hotel,"Me and my friend stayed here Friday 5th December to Sunday 7th December. It was our first time visiting dublin and we was very impressed with the pick of this hotel. It was the perfect location for everything. Also very clean, modern and the staff were all friendly. When you check in they give you a local map and show you around the map on where to go and what to see. Over all it was a alovely find and we will be back next year.",5,2014,12,09
237,Doubletree Dublin,A warm welcome and an immediate upgrade. A fantastic room with all the amenities required for a comfortable stay in a wonderful city. Excellent facilities and good food. Recommended for business or pleasure.,5,2014,12,08
237,Great hotel - just watch out for the noisy functions,"Stayed for Fri/Sat night in early December. First floor 'deluxe' room was very comfortable and the rest of the hotel seems very stylish. Staff were uniformly excellent.

The only issue was around noise at night. On Friday night we were informed a function would be ongoing until 1am. Luckily we were out until about half-midnight and when 1am came the music did indeed stop promptly. 

On Saturday night there seemed to be another function in full flow, as well as a band in the bar.

In short, if you are looking for a quiet hotel to enjoy some romance, this may not be the place for you. I would recommend asking for a room on a high floor to minimize the disturbance. Other than that, the hotel is warmly recommended.",4,2014,12,08
237,"""Looking forward to another visit already""","My husband and I have just returned from a fabulous (one night only-wish it was longer)trip to the Morrison.
We may not have been there for a long time but we sure enjoyed it!
The location is excellent, couple of mins walk to the shopping areas. Car park right beside it for great value (€12 for the night).
Staff were really helpful, friendly and genuinely happy to help and eager to make our stay a good one (big mentions to Jane at front desk, Martin and Gary in the bar and restaurant area).
We had the pleasure of eating in restaurant and enjoyed all we had- sparkly prosecco, tasty ribs off the grill, fish pie and gorgeous burger...not to mention a dessert that is a must-the salted caramel mousse with banana ice cream.
We stayed on for drinks, as they had a great live band followed by a Dj.
Breakfast was plentiful and fresh and what a choice!
The rooms were Amazing - what a comfortable bed, great bathroom and overall modern and contemporary. 
Would highly recommend this hotel, not just for its location, style and amenities but for its warm, welcoming staff that exceeded our expectations..thank you.",5,2014,12,07
237,"Perfect Location for a Fun, Quirky Stay","My friend and I stayed at the Morrison for four days while in Dublin to see a match at Aviva and we found a place that we will stay again and again.  The price point is higher than some other spots, but is well worth the treat and the location.  In fact, we chose the hotel because of its location - and we could not have chosen better!  The hotel is situated across the Liffey from Temple Bar and so is perfectly removed from the hustle and bustle of that area of the city.  Also, you can easily walk to Christchurch, Trinity, and Grafton Street (but do check out some of the shops on Cow's Lane, too) within 10 minutes; you can also meander on foot to Aviva (20 minutes), the Guinness Storehouse and Kilmainham Gaol (30-40 minutes), and Glasnevin Cemetery (45-60 minutes) in comfortable shoes.  The National Leprechaun Museum is also only a block or so away (a little gem), and there is nothing so nice as walking over the Liffey in the morning to one of any number of little coffee shops for a nice Americano and a scone (or, if at Dwarf Jar, great crepes and, if at Queen of Tarts, absolutely anything!).  

I'll admit that we had been a little nervous that the hotel would lack some of its former personality now that it is a Hilton; however, we could not have been more wrong.  The rooms are modern and fun, with pops of vibrant color (pink accent lights for us!), songs lyrics scripted on the walls, and a lovely, sizable bathroom (complete with robes!) with great water pressure.  The juxtaposition between the clean, contemporary room and the older architecture and stone outside our window (room: Mezzanine 5) was also really great; we got sufficient sunlight, even though we were not facing the Liffey.   

Lastly, the staff was so kind and helpful; we arrived at 9 AM and they kept our luggage locked away until our room was ready and gave us those warm cookies one expects from a DoubleTree.  Our room was not quite ready by 3 PM, so they then gave us more cookies and complimentary tea until the room was ready.  I have to single-out Jane at the front desk, who was just fantastic.  She gave us directions to various spots, talked football with us, and was even kind enough to lend us her personal umbrella for the walk out to Glasnevin!",5,2014,12,07
237,"Great Hotel, with even Greater Team Members!","My Wife, Father and I came here on Holiday from the US for a few days and had the pleasure of staying at this great Hilton.  Beautiful Hotel, AMAZINGLY Helpful Employee's (Specially Jane Bridge) and many more!  I would recommend this hotel option to anyone looking for a hotel in Dublin.  Their team has been amazingly helpful every single step of the way, at every moment with everything from getting a cab, to planning a day to visit sites, dinner plans, pub hunting and more.  I can't say enough about this being one of the BEST if not the ABSOLUTE best Hilton Properties out there.  As a Gold Member of Hilton I stay at a lot of hotels (a lot of Hiltons) but this really is OUTSTANDING and it's really due to the Employees!",5,2014,12,06
237,A Top Class Hilton!,"As a special treat from family, my wife and I were booked in here on the day of the Ire/Australia rugby international.What a treat it was too!
Firstly, the arrangement for parking in Jervis right next door , at €12 for 24hours is convenient and so painless.
 
Reception staff were so friendly  and efficient (and the welcome cookie a nice touch), and our luxurious spacious  accommodation on the mezzanine floor was so inviting and comfortable, with every amenity available -bathrobes, slippers, tea/coffee(and hot chocolate) making facilities, high quality individual toiletries, well stocked bar, comfortable seating area - and - an oh so comfortable bed and pillows.Nice touch the way  towels and cloths are tied up with a little bow- great attention to detail.

The decor in the room (and throughout the hotel) is contemporary , highly distinctive and very attractive---obviously no expense spared on this and it shows. The bathroom was large and elegant -huge deep bath and separate shower ---so seldom as opulent in many 5* hotels.

Service in the bar and particularly at breakfast the next morning(a Sunday) was faultless and very friendly again , with a wide selection of cereals, fruit juices, hot and cold items and a menu for  individually cooked items (eggs benedict etc)-all included in our B&B rate.Full marks to the hotel for serving breakfast until midday----a nice treat to have a bit of a lie in in such comfortable surroundings.

The hotel is 4* officially, but in terms of what counts to us -it ticked all the boxes, and we felt as if it was 5* in so many important respects.

Right in the busy city centre on the quays , this is  such a nice haven of tranquility, and to be thoroughly recommended!",5,2014,12,05
237,Tried hard...but failed !,"Booked 4 * - special trip - for birthday celebration, assured of good room and quiet location. On arrival room like sauna - temp turned to low and window open ( on 28 Nov ! ) This may have helped with heat but "" quiet "" room turned out to be located over outdoor bar / function area, where drunken party carried on, merrily, until 3.30 am. In all fairness Manager moved our room to lovely upgrade for the next night - but it was like Siberia !! neither us nor staff could get heat working. Had dinner - on first night we ordered Goats Cheese with beetroot as starter - Goats cheese arrived, all alone ! and on enquiring about the beetroot, we were informed that Chef had run out !! Again staff tried and offered alternatives - very pleasant guy. And as a final treat for us, on Sunday morning - the WC backed up completely, in our room, leaving both of us very hesitant to use the bathroom and we checked out ASAP  !!! Certainly memorable - for all of the wrong reasons !!",3,2014,12,04
237,Pleasant stay,"Stayed here for 2 nights recently on a business trip. Room was spacious and clean, fairly modern and not lacking anything key.  Breakfast was ok, nothing special.  Didn't use any other amenities so have no comment.  Staff were helpful and attentive.",4,2014,12,03
237,Morrison is great!,Morrison is great! It is a lovely hotel inside and is placed a 7 minute walk from Temple bar and all the action that Dublin has to offer.  The hotel rooms are beautiful inside and the staff were extremely helpful and courteous.  One negative would have to be the parking (or lack of).  We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and the carpark next door to the hotel was full.  I had to drive down to a shopping centre and park on the 4th floor of it..nightmare.  Why dont they offer a valet service for this...I for sure would have paid for this.,4,2014,12,03
237,Very comfortable,"We ended up being very happy at this hotel. Check in was a little bumpy: I'd read the reviews about the street noise, so had requested a room away from the river side and not on the street level. On check in, we found we were upgraded to a room on the ground floor facing the river. As others have mentioned, some of the windows seem to let in a lot of noise. But the hotel staff went out of their way to move us to a quieter room, on a higher floor, facing the back--which we absolutely loved. It was cozy, private, and quiet-with a huge bathtub. We never heard any noise from other rooms. The breakfast buffet was also of a noticeably high quality: delicious Irish cheddar, excellent fruit. We would definitely return, particularly if we knew we could stay in the same room. Great location also: just a couple of short blocks to walk to the airport bus.",5,2014,12,02
237,Great place to stay,"we walked in to this hotel and stayed here for few nights and really enjoyed. Rooms are beautifully designed, modern and clean. Decor and ambiance is beautiful all around in the lobby and bar, wide selection of cocktails available. staff very attentive, friendly and professional. Would recommend to everyone and will be back.",5,2014,12,02
237,Excellent Honeymoon Stay!,"We stayed for 2 nights for honeymoon in April and it was awesome! We arrived and were immediately impressed with the staff and hotel (and really enjoyed the warm cookie upon arrival). They upgraded us to a absolutely gorgeous suite for our honeymoon! The location is great, the staff is extremely helpful and friendly, the food/room service was great and the hotel/room was one of the best we stayed in during our 3 week honeymoon. We will definitely return to the The Morrison!",5,2014,11,30
237,Great hotel in the perfect location,"The hotel will give you an excellent stay when visiting Dublin. The staff at reception welcomed us with a warm cookie each and a friendly and helpful welcome. It is in easy walking distance from the Temple area just the other side of the River Liffey which offers various bars and restaurants. The main shopping areas are no more than 5 minutes away. Dublin is an easy City to walk around and you can cover a lot of the main sites on foot. The City does offer two hop on hop off bus services for those areas away from the hotel.

Back to the hotel, our room was spacious as was the bathroom. It was clean and well stocked with a mini bar, robe, slippers, safe and tea making facilities. There is also free wifi and a comfortable bed. My only gripe and hence the 4 star and not 5 is that the double glazing is not the best and therefore some street noise does come through into the room.

We did not try the restaurant so cannot comment. The hotel obviously has a full restaurant service but we chose to eat breakfast in the cafe on the opposite corner. €7.50 for a full breakfast.

The hotel does not have a car park but you do get favourable rates in the Jervis Street car park at €12 a day. This no more than a 100 yards from the hotel entrance.

This is a very good inner city hotel in a great location and come highly recommended.",4,2014,11,30
237,Perfect location,Very nice room which was very clean. And all the staff at the hotel was very friendly and helpful. Perfect location in Dublin City Center. Walking distance to almost everything. Great breakfast with a lot to choose between.,4,2014,11,30
237,The Best hotel ever!!!,"I have stayed at a lot of Hilton hotels and other lovely hotels...but this truly has to be the best hotel I've stayed at. My sister and I travelled here as a surprise for her 30th birthday. We arrived at the hotel around 11am to place our bags in we were greeted immediately by one lady asking if she could help with bags and then another who took us to reception to check in our bags. All the staff were so friendly and couldn't do enough for us..they explained that they would store our bags and phone us when our room was ready....so we went to start our shopping. At around 2pm they phoned to let us know that our room was ready..we got back collected our key and open the doors to our room and wow what can I say the room was so beautiful I had arranged a bottle of bubbles and chocolates for my sister but the hotel had a lovely plate sitting with happy birthday and some macaroons. My sister was absolutely thrilled. Our stay that night was incredibly comfy...bar was excellent and again staff soo friendly. We woke the next day and had the most amazing breakfast in our room (would defo recommend this) We were so sad to be leaving the hotel at check out time and if we hadn't had our flight booked would have stayed another night....overall I can't speak highly enough about this hotel.
Fab staff, fab food, fab rooms and fab location...will be back in the future :-)",5,2014,11,29
237,"Great Service, Great People!","I hosted a group event at this hotel which was a total of around 50 people. in a nut shell they could not do enough for you to ensure that the event went well for us. They went above and beyond the level of service that you would expect. 
The whole team lead by ""Lewis"" were 1st class and worked with us in making a great night for our clients. 
Breakfast was excellent and the staff remembered your name and type of coffee you liked (thank you Polina) and brought it to your table. its the little things like this that make the service stand out from the rest.
Would highly recommend this hotel!",5,2014,11,29
237,"""Great Break""","I booked the Morrison based on the reviews on trip advisor and wasn't disappointed.  We arrived earlier than the scheduled check in time due to an early morning flight and just expected to leave our case and check in later.  Not a problem, we were greeted with a smile, a warm cookie and a room ready for us, great service.  Our room was lovely, spacious, clean with everything we needed.  The location couldn't have been better, really easy to get around the city, just cross the river and straight into Temple Bar.  We didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on that side, but based on our stay we're already planning a return visit in June, can't wait.",5,2014,11,28
237,First Class Stay with Excellent Staff,"I checked in and was greeted by a friendly team and wasmhanded a warm cookie, the reception staff were polite and very efficient and could not do enough. My was room on the Mezzanine floor was spacious and very well equipped, oversize bath tub for 2, rain shower, and a large very comfy bed with white linen.
I was their on business and the Duty Manager Lewis Newman was amazing, he went above and beyond with his customer service skills making us feel very welcome. He and his staff on Duty that night are a credit to the hotel and made the function I was attending a pleasure. 

Breakfast Buffett in the morning was again excellent and Lewis was back again on Duty to make it run smoothly.

Wifi is free and superfast and is available all over the hotel

The Morrison is by far one of the best hotels I have stayed in Dublin whether on business or pleasure I can recommend this hotel as a great place to stay.",5,2014,11,25
237,Fabulous stay!,"Checked in to be greeted by a smiling receptionist and a warm cookie! Room was pleasant, airy and massive, large bathroom with rain forest showers and all amenities. Extremely efficient staff, nothing was too much trouble, led by duty manager Lewis Newman, who personally looked after  us and is a true credit to the hotel and went above and beyond when we lost our coconuts!!  Would highly recommend this hotel as the best in Dublin 
",5,2014,11,25
237,Couldn't ask for more,"The staff were so friendly, helpful and made us feel so welcome from the minute we walked in and were presented with our warm, arrival cookies; we couldn’t ask for more. The hotel was lovely, the food was delicious and the room was perfect. Furthermore I was absolutely chuffed with the surprise I asked them to organise for our arrival. It is such a great city and we didn’t see half as much as we wanted to, even though the hotel is right in the heart of the city and in perfect distance of everything you want to see and do, so we will definitely be making another trip sometime in the future and wouldn’t hesitate to stay at The Morrison again.",5,2014,11,25
237,A very solid Dublin hotel,"I stayed here a few weeks ago. The hotel has been recently renovated and it shows--though the design is little trying-too-hard in modern style. Nonetheless, everything is clean and fresh, just what you'd look for in a hotel. The location is optimal, right across the river from Temple Bar but still very quiet. Restaurant in the hotel was also excellent.

Also, for reasons not worth explaining here, my stay was divided up into two separate ""stays"" without a break in between. The hotel staff was extremely easy to deal with, and allowed me to stay in my room for the duration.",4,2014,11,24
237,Brilliant location - spacious room,"Really enjoyed our 2 night weekend stay here. Lovely modern rooms, spacious with tea/coffee making facilities and fridge/mini-bar. Lovely touch with the free warm cookies at check-in. Very smooth check-in and check-out process.
We did not eat in the hotel but had a couple of drinks in the bar with good live music. Very comfortable with lovely staff.
Good parking one block away - weekend rate €40 discounted with hotel to €21 
Excellent location and we were able to walk around the city from this hotel.
The only issue I had was housekeeping waking us before 8.30am on Saturday to clean our room. This was not appreciated after a Friday night out in Dublin.",4,2014,11,24
237,Perfect stay,"Stayed at the Morrison for 9 nights last week for a business trip. Hotel staff was very friendly, especially a young man at the reception who was exceptional. Had a charger delivered to my room in 2 minutes, every morning arranged my taxi on time.
The food in the main lounge bar was great (big portions) and always a lively&busy place.
Perfect location, just 3 min walk from Temple Bar area, loads of places around to shop just 2-3 min away, bars & restaurants.

Definitely booking it for my next trip.",5,2014,11,22
237,Fabulous Hotel in great location,"Morrison is a freshly updated, classy place with an excellent breakfast and larger than average rooms.  Staff is very helpful and rooms are spotless.  Location is right alongside the Liffey, in easy walking access to O'Connell St, Temple Bar and the IFSC/Customs House.  Restaurant has a good selection of  beers, beef and other selections.  breakfast buffet is extravagant.",5,2014,11,18
237,"Most friendly staff, excellent service, overall good hotel","Receiptionist are most friendly naming a few Pietr, Mia, Diana always willing to help, going the extra mile to make guests feel welcome.  Breakfast service always good, came back to room which was always perfect. On occasions, shower pressure is insufficient or found water to be lukewarm just reported to the guys at front and it was always sorted in no time.",5,2014,11,18
237,A very nice Toasted Sandwich in a very nice Bar,"Today the 17th. November 2014, I enjoyed a very nice toasted sandwich and coffee in the "" Morrison "" Bar and it was most enjoyable in very nice surroundings. Many thanks, to a very friendly and efficient team. My friends and I, spent nearly three hours there - which is an indication of the magnetism of the place",5,2014,11,17
237,"All hotels, including other Hilton’s should model their hotels and staff on this particular hotel.","I have stayed in a few 5 star hotels and a few Hiltons… this is by far THE best hotel I have ever stayed in - what makes it THE best is the excellent care and customer service from the staff. 

My friends had booked this hotel for the 4 of us to celebrate my 30th Birthday, which didn’t start off great as one friend was too poorly to join us (which we were all very sad about) and we went to the wrong hotel (some of you may have made that mistake too and arrived at The Burlington Double Tree by Hilton… no… just us!). So on arrival to The Morrison Double Tree by Hilton, we were very glum at what should have been a really exciting time – that rapidly changed on check-in. This is where we met the lovely and fantastic Jane Bridge, who gave us a yummy cookie  .

This review is about the hotel but also contains details about the surrounding area and how we found things, you never know you might find it useful.

STAFF
Absolutely helpful, every hotel should model these staff… all those 5* Hiltons take note of this 4*, which should be a 5* without a doubt. 

After dropping our bags in our fantastic room Jane invited us down to a glass of fizz in the bar, compliments of the hotel to celebrate my big birthday. Jane also helped us with restaurant recommendations and reservations. She really looked after us and made us feel like the only guests that were in the hotel, which of course we weren’t as the hotel was fully booked with the rugby and she was looking after everyone exactly the same – I think this is just Jane, going the extra mile for everyone. She took care of us on a personal level, remembered our names and our plans for the day and would ask how we all were and how those plans had gone. I came back to the room one afternoon to a bed decorated with birthday banners, balloons and a plate of scrumptious macaroons – thank you Jane.

One night that we were going out we wanted drinks in the bar while we waited for our taxi, there weren’t any tables left, one of the managers spotted us looking and cleared a dining table so we could have a seat while we waited, he then also gave us recommendations on where to go for a night out after my “surprise” meal (which was at Marco Pier White’s restaurant, steak was out of this world). I think that was the Grafton Street area, very nice and classy, these bars suited us much better and they are just like going out to town in Manchester. 

I am a keen parkrunner, I’d researched getting to Tymon park on the Saturday morning for my run to start at 9:30am, the only problem I’d researched it from where I thought we were staying, The Burlington… Spoke to the staff on reception and they helped me figure out a new bus route. 

ROOM
Such a lovely room, we had one on floor 1 and one on the HHonors floor. The décor is lovely, especially the coloured light box, the beds are the comfiest I have ever slept on, I’d be keen to know what the mattress is as I want one on my own bed – that comfy. The bathroom is spacious, TV, enough wardrobe space, iron and ironing board, a safe, hairdryer, basic toiletries were provided as well as brewing up facilities with tea, coffee, sugar milk etc… There is also a payable minibar in the room. Loved the room, enough space for 2 girls with all their clothes, make-up, shoes, space to get ready.

BREAKFAST
I was lucky enough to have a champagne breakfast sent to my room after I got back from my parkrun, I got absolutely soaked out running so this was heaven. After jumping in the shower I put on my Morrison bathrobe and slippers and indulged. I actually thought the breakfast was for the 3 of us, the tray had so much on it. Pastry selection, preserves, fresh fruit, yoghurt, muffins, macaroons and bucks fizz. The girls ate their breakfast in the hotel restaurant and had a full breakfast, they said it was amazing and well worth the money. I ate with them the next day and couldn’t agree more. There is so much to choose from, something for everyone. There is a special menu that you can order from, as well as that you can also have things from the buffet. This consists of pastries, muffins, porridge, cereals, fruit, yoghurt, toast, smoked salmon, cheeses, meat selection and everything you could ask for to have a full English (Irish) breakfast. Hot drinks are served at the table and juices are on the buffet table. I would recommend having breakfast in the hotel. 

LOCATION
After researching everything back home unknowingly from the wrong hotel! I was really pleased once I had got onto the hotels free Wi-Fi (accessible from everywhere in the hotel, fast and free - how great is that) and found that this was in a better location, central to everything we wanted to do/visit. We actually walked to everything we needed to do, unfortunately for us the weather was miserable so we didn’t get out as much as we wanted. The umbrella in the room definitely came in handy. 

We were right across the road from the start of Temple Bar, literally cross the bridge and turn right and that’s it. On the first night we had a wonder down and a bit of a pub crawl, this was my 2nd time to Dublin but my friend’s first so definitely a must do. Along here we spotted a restaurant that had an early bird 2 courses for around €13, they also had cocktails for €5, pleasant enough for a cheap and casual bite to eat. 

We also visited the Grafton Street area, during the day for shopping and souvenir shops. I think it was this area where Marco Pier Whites restaurant is, what fabulous food, I have never had steak so nice, if you want to visit book well in advance. We were extremely lucky to get a booking on the day, unfortunately it was very early sitting as that was all we could get, I think it was with the help from the wonderful Jane although everything on that night was a surprise for my birthday. I think we went to Bar 37… and we ended up in Sam’s bar where the music was right up our street, the Ireland Rugby team were in the upstairs private area celebrating their victory, which was a nice surprise to see. 

Needless to say I am very impressed, the attitude and caring nature of the staff really make this hotel. I have just started travelling on my own, I hopefully plan on going back to Dublin next year – This is where I will be staying for sure. Thank you to Jane and all the wonderful staff, if only more hotels had standards this high.

237,Great stay!,"We had a great two-night stay at The Morrison! The location is fantastic. The rooms were very comfortable. I think the real highlight is the staff -- all of whom were friendly and went out of their way to help. We were celebrating our anniversary, and they even sent a beautiful dessert to our room. When we walked by the front desk, they even greeted us by name. We had a delicious breakfast at the hotel restaurant both mornings, and there was a great selection. We were upgraded to a junior suite (I have Hilton diamond status). I also saw in the regular rooms, and they were also very nice. We were definitely stay here again.",5,2014,11,16
237,Wont let you down,The hotel really does deserve all the high praise it gets. It has been totally done over and the finish to the hotel is excellent. The best bit has to be the warm chocolate cookies on arrival every evening - simply divine!!!,5,2014,11,13
237,A luxury haven in the middle of Dublin,"From the onset it was all good!! Check in at reception was friendly & efficient! The room blew me away - stylish, spacious with calm colours and mood lighting. Bottled water complimentary! Great bathroom well stocked with all a girl could need. Nice touches all round. Breakfast was even more exciting with fresh fruit, good quality natural organic yogurt, amazing selection of bread, ham, cheese etc as well as a full selection of hot cooked food. Staff were absolutely excellent! Great hotel in a great location.",5,2014,11,12
237,You won't be disappointed!,"I had never been to Dublin before so didn't really know what to expect, but this is a beautiful hotel in the most perfect location. The staff are without exception very friendly and helpful.  It is a little expensive, but I'm so glad I spent a bit more than I normally would. It's worth splashing out on, especially for a romantic weekend away!",5,2014,11,12
237,The Way It Should Be......,"We booked at the last minute due to a late offer of tickets to the Ireland vs. South Africa rugby match and were glad of any room at the inn.
We checked in at lunchtime and were greeted with a wide smile and a warm cookie by Pieter, our room wasn't ready so we checked in our luggage. They called us a taxi to take us to the Aviva and offered us umbrellas.
When we got back, after our marvellous victory over the Springboks, we were handed our room key and told that our bags were already there. The room was stunning ! We'd been upgraded and the room was a suite !!! We had panoramic views of the city which looked lovely at night.
Although the hotel is just across the river from Temple bar we heard no noise at all.

We enjoyed a few drinks in the bar, where again the service was prompt , friendly and exact. T

We reluctantly checked out the following day.

The hotel is lovely, modern, trendy but comfortable and easy going. But it is the friendliness and service provided by the staff that we'll return for.",5,2014,11,12
237,Nice Hotel in the middle of everything,"We had a nice Dublin weekend at The Morrison. The staff was doing everything to get our stay pleasant. Friday night ther was quite a lot of noise from outside, and we expected that it was from a nearby party. Next day we was advised, that there was a function going on (again) and we were warned about noise. - That information combined with posters around the hotel about the friday function sat one and one to get two. The staff did a proper compensation for the function party, and the hotel i recommendable for a stay close to the centre of Dublin.",4,2014,11,11
237,"Lovely, but not great value for money","This hotel is in a great central location for visiting central Dublin and while it's of a high standard, it delivers poor value compared to other 4* competitors.    Here's why (these are the comments I left in their customer satisfaction survey);   Issues with: blocked sinks, no coffee machine cups, no toilet brush, no mirror near plugs, no booking confirmation sent, wrong bill provided.  Only reported the problem with the slow running/blocked sinks on departure as didn't want to have to waste time waiting in the room while it was fixed.  I managed to improvise with the Nespresso machine and removed the shelf so that we could use the large mugs that were in the room (Nespresso cups were not present).  Again, only reported on leaving as we wanted a quick coffee and didn't have time to wait while it was rectified.   Thought it was very odd for a hotel of this calibre that there wasn't a toilet brush in the bathroom or a dressing table with a mirror and plugs so that I could dry my hair.  I mentioned that I was disappointed with the room in relation to the cost due to these issues and got the impression the member of staff who dealt with me wasn't used to the answer being 'no' in response to 'was everything OK with your stay'.  I was then given someone else's bill which I didn't spot until after I left.  Couple this with not receiving an email booking confirmation (due to there being some issue with the original card booking), I have no idea what was actually booked and paid for!!  Every member of staff was lovely and very friendly.  It was just little things like the above and the shabby paint work on the public toilets, the slightly soulless nature of the room that all add up to my being disappointed.  We normally stay places like the Abode, Sofitel, Citizen M  and they manage to bring together an experience which really feels like an all encompassing luxury escape.  I'm afraid the Morrison fell short of this (although loved the warm cookie on check in, very nice touch!).  To have exceeded my expectations, I would have liked the member of staff I reported the issues with to have seem genuinely concerned that we weren't happy with our stay (and to be given the right bill!).  (It would also have been great to have a little note by the bed that there were softer pillows available, only found them in the morning!....just while I'm on a 'how can you exceed expectations role' ;)  We originally booked a river front room but asked to be upgraded to a suite if possible (this was done at a very reasonable fee).  If we had paid £140 for the room, the above would have been small niggles but at over £200, I do expect these things to be right.",3,2014,11,11
237,Great boutique hotel with fantastic staff,"We just got home from a 5 day trip to Ireland and we can't say enough about this hotel! We were greeted with warm chocolate chip cookies after a 7 hour overnight flight. It's located less than 5 minutes by foot from Temple Bar and 10 minutes from the Tara Street DART station.The lobby/hallways were modern and warm with accents of purple throughout.  We arrived earlier than expected and the staff moved mountains to get us our room early because they saw how tired we were.  When we got to our room, the safe had been left open and locked by the previous occupants. The apologetic staff came up in less than 3 minutes and looked genuinely upset that there was any concern. The beds are firm and have purple lit nightstands so you don't have to turn on all of the lights at night. We ate at the hotel's restaurant (The Morrison Grill) the first night. The food was light yet with all of the flavors and feels of Ireland. The chicken pot pie came in an iron pot with sides of whipped potatoes and haricot verts. The wine/beer list was thorough and of course Guinness was on tap. Checkout was a breeze and the staff got us a taxi to the airport that was on time (5:30am) and takes credit cards (a rarity in Dublin). By far, a wonderful experience. I would definitely stay at the Morrison again the next time I'm in Dublin. The only thing I would change would be the carpets as they are a bit dated.",5,2014,11,10
237,Never lets me down,"My wife and I had to attend a function in Dublin on Saturday night and there was only one hotel that came to mind. 
We love the Morrison !!!!
The warm chocolate cookies on check in, the very friendly staff, the beautiful rooms, the gym, the food, the beds, I could go on but I think you get message.
Nothing beats staying somewhere like the Morrison and having a great night then a walk through the streets of Dublin shopping.
Thanks for everything to everyone at the hotel and we can not wait till our next visit ",5,2014,11,10
237,One week at the best!,"We stayed at the Morrison from November 2nd through November 9th and just could not have been happier with our choice.  First and foremost, the location was perfect.  We could walk all of Dublin (from Glasnevin to the north, Kilmainham to the west, Connelly station to the east and St. Patricks and beyond to the south.)  We of course loved the proximity to Temple Bar area (the first day) we really enjoyed the pubs and sides on the north side of the Liffey.  The location was not the only perk, the staff here was amazing, the rooms big and beds comfortable and the general ambiance relaxing and welcoming.  When we return to Dublin we will make this our home base again.  I want to give a special shout out to Kim who was a server in Halo for breakfast each morning.  Her helpful tips and sincerely welcoming and caring personality started our days off wonderfully. We happily and highly recommend this property.",5,2014,11,10
237,Central hotel with friendly helpful staff,"We stayed for 2 nights at The Morrison and can thoroughly recommend this hotel. It's situated on the bank of the river and very central for all the sights, Temple Bar and O'Connell Street. The decor is modern, the room was a good size with a very comfortable bed.  Breakfast was fantastic, the best we've had in a long time. The buffet selection was good and piping hot, there was also a menu with a lovely selection of freshly cooked dishes eg, eggs benedict, eggs florentine and scrambled egg with smoked salmon. The homemade bread and the croissants were warm and to die for.  The restaurant staff were all very friendly and went out of their way to look after us.  We arrived to check in at 10.30am and were delighted to find that the room was available so early.  The reception staff were also very accommodating and happy to give us a late check out as our flight home was late afternoon.  The only negative comment I have was concerning the shower in our room which was on the Hilton honors floor.  A rain shower has been fitted over the original bath and it just doesn't work.  The showerhead is too close to the wall which meant leaning back to stand under the flow of water.  It was also necessary to stand on the bath plug which was uncomfortable and meant the bath filled with water when showering.  Overall a great hotel, we would definitely go back.",4,2014,11,08
237,Fabulous stay,"The Morrison is clean, modern hotel with personal touches.  Our room was minimalist in a good way and very clean.  The bar is extremely busy with amazing cocktails!  Probably the nicest fitness centre I've ever seen in any hotel.",5,2014,11,06
237,October 2014,"My wife and i have traveled the world and been to many hotels but the Morrison beats them all. The rooms are excellent the service is very friendly and nothing is too much of a trouble and all with  smile.

The food is of a very high standard and value for money and we will  return as there is so much to see and do in Dublin but we did not get a chance to cover them all.",5,2014,11,05
237,Clean room. Good service,"We stayed at the hotel, in a quiet room overlooking the courtyard, for 2 nights (sat-mon) in oktober 2014. 

The room was clean, the staff excellent and it was generally a good experience. 

The only thing I want to mention is the airconditioning - Our room was awfully warm at night.",4,2014,11,05
237,Great experience!,"The Morrison Hotel exceeded our expectations on all levels.  The beds were comfortable, the hotel quiet, the staff extremely helpful and the breakfast, awesome.  The rates were fair, also, for everything we received during our stay there.",5,2014,11,04
237,An enjoyable stay,"I stayed here for 5 nights and was very impressed with the standard of this hotel. I had a quiet room (overlooking the courtyard) that was spacious, clean and well appointed. The restaurant is a tad pricey but the food great. 
The breakfast buffet had all that you could want for breakfast.The location of this hotel is another huge plus point, in central Dublin with views of the river Liffey and walking distance to almost any attraction in Dublin including Temple Bar,Trinity College etc.
The staff were all very pleasant and helpful. 
No complaints and more than happy to stay here again.",4,2014,11,04
237,"Not fabulous, not awful","Here's why I didn't give this hotel a 5:
1) I stayed at The Morrison for a week for a business trip. After reading reviews about street noise for outward facing rooms, I was ecstatic to have a courtyard room...until I discovered the kind note from the general manager that a function would be held in the courtyard that night. I was awake from 1130 - 130am due to party noise. I received similar notification for two other nights. While I appreciate the notification, visitors should be aware that this is a relatively small hotel with no dedicated conference or party space. The courtyard serves as multi-purpose.
2) I struggled keeping the room cooled down. Like many European hotels the key card lives in a slot by the door that controls power for room functions. When you leave for the day and take the key card with you, all power shuts down. Despite keeping the window cracked during the day, I found the room stuffy. This was compounded by no bathroom fan to clear post-shower humidity.
3) The front desk missed my wake-up call one morning. They confirmed they had written down my request, but just missed it. I appreciate their honesty and desire to correct the mishap.
4) I found the bathroom lighting cast a lot of shadows which made accomplishing detailed work like make-up application very difficult. I kept on having to run to the window for natural lighting. Also there were no power sockets in the bathroom for the blow dryer and curling iron. 

Here's why I didn't give this hotel a 1:
1) The location along the river and across from Temple Bar was very convenient.
2) Although I found the restaurant pricey, the food and service was good.
3) On one occasion the woman at the front desk discovered I was taking an early bus tour the next morning. Without me requesting it, she arranged for a breakfast bag with fruit and croissants be available for me to take with me.
4) The gym is quite extensive with machines and weight-lifting equipment.

Should I visit Dublin again, I am most likely to explore other hotel options. I would stay at The Morrison again, but am quite open to other opportunities, especially given the price.",3,2014,11,01
237,Disappointing,"We stayed here for 2 nights and it was an unpleasant experience for us.  The aircon in our room was not working properly.  We tried to adjust the temperature as best we could and even opened the window (it could only open very slightly) but by 1.30am, we were perspiring.  We called the front desk and someone came to our room.  He agreed that our room was hot but as it was in the middle of the night, nothing more could be done until the morning. He offered to let us leave our belongings in the current room and let us sleep in another room.  We did exactly that.  In the morning, we were informed that the replacement parts for the aircon would only arrive the next day.  They offered to lend us a fan for the night, but we knew that that would only be cirulating warm air in the room.  The alternative was to take the room that we had slept in the night before.  We decided to go with that, and had to go through the hastle of packing all our things. 

Not once was there any offer of some form of compension.  My husband had to ask what their management could do for us for the trouble we went through.  The next day, the girl at reception told us that they will be sending something up to the room, ""something sweet to eat"" she said.  It never came.  Surprise surprise.  She was also the person who told us that there would not be any extra charge for booking a taxi the night before, to go to the airport.  We found out when we were in the taxi on the way to the airport that there is a €2 surcharge for bookings.  

Things like that should not happen in a 5 star hotel.  Needless to stay that we won't be returning here again.  I would not recommend any of my friends and family to stay here either.  Very disappointing. ",2,2014,10,31
237,Excellent location. ,"I stayed here overnight with my wife. It is an excellent location for a social evening with Temple Bar so close. Shopping in the area is also excellent.  
We will return shortly. 
The decor in the hotel is modern and attractive. 
The restaurant is as good as it gets. ",5,2014,10,29
237,Excellent location,"stayed here last weekend for our anniversary, we were too early to check in however the ladies on the desk were very helpful, gave us maps and orientated is to surroundings, also gave us a warm cookie each, a nice touch. We left our luggage, which when we returned had already been taken too our room. The bed was amazingly big. The room was lovely and we had a nice view of the river Liffey. Temple bar was a bridge cross away, and the bus stop for the on off bus tours was a 5 min walk away. We are at the hotel on our second night. Food was very nice. Good checkout time too 12pm which was very good seen as we were flying at 3pm. Would recommend this hotel",5,2014,10,29
237,Wonderful Hotel,"This is an excellent hotel. Superb staff, great rooms, and superb dining, from the great breakfast to the exceptional cooking in the Morrison Grill restaurant. In addition the location is perfect. Cross over the River Liffey using the pedestrian bridge just yards from the Hotel door and you can stroll around the Temple Bar district, crammed with pubs, restaurants, shops and buskers! Music follows you as you walk. I was sorry to leave and have every intention of returning!",5,2014,10,28
237,Don't book the wrong hotel,The hotel has an excellent central location for sights and shopping.  The staff were genuinely attentive and the breakfasts were excellent.  One major point is that I was expecting to stay at the Burlington - they have stupidly renamed the Burlington to the Doubletree Hilton and there are now to Dublin hotels with the same name and they wouldn't rebook me in the hotel I had wanted.,5,2014,10,28
237,Highly Recommended,"The best thing about this hotel was the staff. Very friendly, attentive and nothing seemed too much trouble. The restaurant was really good. I normally avoid hotel restaurants as they are expensive and the food average. I ate in this one on arrival as I didn't want to go out. It was so good I ate there a total of five nights.  The hotel location is perfect for the city and nightlife.  I will most certainly be staying at this hotel on my next trip.",5,2014,10,28
237,Excellent location in the center of Dublin,"This hotel is located right on the edge of the river Liffe and just a very short walk across the river straight into the temple bar area. Although the hotel is very close to the nightlife you really don't notice any additional noise. We had a room at the front of the hotel over looking the river and although the road runs right past the hotel, once the windows were closed the room was very quiet.

The service from the reception staff when we arrived was fantastic and made us feel very welcome. We had arrived early in the morning and although we couldn't check into the room until the afternoon our bags were stored and when we arrived back at the hotel later in the day once the room was ready our bags had already been taken up to the room for us. Very nice touch.

We ate in the grill restaurant on the second night of our stay and had a great meal, and the service again was first class through out the meal. However..... when we came to pay for the meal at the end I was very disappointed with one of the waiting staff regarding the gratuity we left on the receipt of the restaurant bill. We had a three course meal and a bottle of wine so left a 10% tip which we added to the bottom of the bill; so quite a nice tip. A few minutes after we handed back the bill a member of staff came over to us and told us that the gratuity was very nice but it would be better if it was paid in cash because the staff in the restaurant do not receive the tips. This made me feel very uncomfortable and although I did in the end remove the amount from the bill and gave cash instead, by the time I got back to the room I really felt that I should have just refrained from giving anything at all. I do understand that tips paid on credit cards do go into the payroll of the hotel and shared equally but this was not a problem for me. I just felt it was very unprofessional to approach a customer in this way.

Apart from the above comment regarding the gratuity I would really recommend this hotel for the excellent service and location and this is why I still gave 5 stars.",5,2014,10,27
237,Good option in Dublin,"This hotel is across from the Temple Bar; on the other side of Liffey river. Very convenient to go to all spots set T Bar. We were there during world cup time so saw the semi finals at a few bars nearby. The hotel bar is nice but dead. 

Rooms are like any other European room; small and functional. If you get the hotel below EU 200 then its surely worth the price. Even up to 250. The  breakfast spread was good. Besides that we won't know we didn't try any other meals. Alcohol is expensive at the hotel bar.",4,2014,10,27
237,"Fabulous, but bring ear plugs","Just back from a weekend break in this fantastic Hotel.  Loved the staff, location, bedroom, gym, cookies on arrival and the amazing breakfast but didn't get much sleep due to the noise from weddings which went on until late on both nights.  Then delivery lorry which arrived after 6am on first morning just below our window on the side street, room was double glazed but could do with triple glazing even a motor bike roaring past on second night was soo loud.  Then the guests from weddings were also on our floor and were making a lot of noise going to there rooms.  Maybe place these guests in a location away from the other guests PLEASE, surely the Hilton reception staff are trained in guest room management?  Also there was a private door beside our room which staff entered and banged all night long!  This building needs to be assessed by an acoustics engineer ASAP just too much noise.  Whilst going to gym I then noticed all of the doors make a loud noise when closed this is a problem through out the Hotel and needs to be addressed.  I would not stay here again because of the noise, it ruined our stay we went for rest and recuperation and came home exhausted.  This needs to be looked at urgently by the Hilton as its not what I expected.  Please put a Hilton executive in room 114 during a wedding venue on a Friday night and see what they think!  I've stayed world over and this has to be the worst for noise level.",4,2014,10,26
237,"Location, location, location!","If you are looking for a cozy hotel filled with Irish charm and warmth, this is simply the wrong hotel--but it has just about everything else.

This is a modern Hilton DoubleTree Hotel located in the Center of Dublin right on the quiet side of the  River Liffe, which is filled with all the Irish charm that you will need.  The hotel is literally steps away from the Ha'penny footbridge that leads to the infamous Temple Bar district of Central Dublin which is packed with pubs, restaurants, shops, street performers and pedestrians.  You will be in walking distance to everything that you want to see in Dublin.  The only time that I needed to take a taxi was for business purposes.  There is even a shopping mall 1 block away from the hotel that has nearly everything that you might need to include a Tesco.

The lobby is ultra contemporary and doesn't have any spots to have a quiet chat with another businessman, but the front desk staff are wonderful.  There are restaurant and bar areas.  They offer a breakfast buffet for 18 Euros, which did not seem worth the price, but if you are a Hilton Honors member, breakfast is included.

The rooms are a bit too contemporary for my taste, but huge by European standards, as is the bathroom, and immaculately clean.  The rooms had everything that I wanted or needed.  Air-conditioning, a comfortable king-size bed, flatscreen television with channels in a number of languages, free wifi, small refrigerator, hotpot with tea.

My business partner chose the courtyard-facing room and complained about noise from parties at night.  I chose the street-facing room and was not bothered by any noise.  In fact, it's quiet enough to sleep with the window open at night.  There's not much of a view at all, unless you enjoy peeping into the apartment building windows meters away, but I was still quite happy with my room.",5,2014,10,25
237,One night stay,"Very good hotel, close to Temple Bar area of Dublin and therefore close to great Irish Bars and restaurants, staff were helpful and the bar was great. I will be staying here again on my next trip to Dublin to be sure, to be sure.",4,2014,10,24
237,The place to stay in Dublin!!,"Where to start..... I booked 2 rooms for The Morrison for last weekend for my 30th Birthday, before arriving I emailed Jane Bridge to request that if possible our rooms would be close together as we were 4 ladies together for my birthday. I also asked for recommendations for restaurants during our stay. Jane and myself had multiple emails back and forth, she recommended local restuarants and provided menus and as much information as i needed, as a vegetarian it is important that i see the menu's before hand where possible. We decided to book the hotel restaurant (The Morrison Grill) for one evening and the restaurant, Fire for the other. We arrived at the hotel much earlier than check in so dropped our bags off, had the most amazing warm cookie and took a little wander around Temple Bar which is only across the bridge. When we returned our rooms where ready so we went upstairs to find that Jane had arranged banners, balloons, and some yummy goodies for our arrival, this was such an amazing gesture!! thank you Jane! The rooms are spacious and bright and the coloured lighting really sets off the room nicely. The rooms are very clean and have all the amenities you could want and more. Jane also called up to our rooms and made sure everything was ok and to confirm our booking at the Morrison Grill (i'll leave a seperate review for the restaurant but put it this way the food is amazing!!) We had the most amazing breakfast in hotel and met the day manager who was Welsh just like us, (im so sorry i forget your name) who made the effort to come over and have a chat to us for about 15 minutes and listed good places to go and things to see in the city. We then set out, the lovely ladies at reception helped us booking taxi's for the whole weekend and were always very friendly and helpful. Later that evening we went to the Fire restaurant and Jane had arranged for the waitress to bring over glasses of processco to celebrate my birthday, again such an amazing gesture. Due to late flights out on the sunday we asked for a later check out which again was no problem and we were all very sad to leave the hotel behind. We have all stated that we would not stay anwhere else when staying again in Dublin.  The staff absolutely make this hotel, they go above and beyond to help you in any way and make your stay the best they can. The Hotel itself is in the most fabulous location, close enough to Temple Bar that its just a short walk but far enough away that you still get a peaceful nights sleep. Im sure i could go on and on but I'd just like to give one final praise to Jane, the lady is an absolute asset to the hotel, she completely went out of her way to make our stay special, nothing was too much trouble and she did things (the banners, the wine etc) which were totally unexpected. Look forward to seeing you all again soon.",5,2014,10,24
237,"Great Location, Friendly Staff","Great hotel in a great location.  Very large rooms with all modern amenities, modern décor and clean.  If your looking for cozy, turn of the century Irish feel, this is not the hotel for you, but it had everything needed for a very comfortable stay right off a long flight.  Location close to Temple Bar and Trinity College and I could see the HaPenny Bridge and Liffey river from my window.  When we checked out, the lady who was helping us asked where we were headed to next, we told her, and she made a special call to the staff at the next hotel, (who she knew) to make sure we were taken care of.  Above and beyond and a really nice touch!  Also was a great hotel that accommodated to my 2 year old well.",5,2014,10,23
237,A Cut Above The Rest,"My husband and I recently had the opportunity of spending 5 days at this wonderful hotel.We have travelled to many major cities throughout North America and Europe and by European standards this is definitely one of the better laid out hotels particularly regarding space ( even for guest rooms not suites). 
  We arrived early but while we waited we were provided with coffee, cookies and a lovely resting spot in the cafe while they prepared our room. It does clearly state on their website that check in is 3p.m. so the problem was with us.
  Once we reached our room we were pleasantly surprised not only with the spaciousness but with the high standard of cleanliness. What an oasis of calm . Did I mention that although the location is right on the Liffey River central to transportation  near Temple Bar  and other attractions we heard absolutely no noise at any time.
    One morning we were late for breakfast and we must point out the Marcio (a wonderful young man in the Halo restaurant) welcomed us in although the breakfast buffet had already shut down and ensured that we were able to get a delicious breakfast. We also found the price of the buffet breakfast well within European standards.This was definitely beyond the call of duty.
    Now to the best part the Room Division Manager, Ms. Jane Bridge. This charming young lady was outstanding with both her level of professionalism and help with everything from travelling directions, visitors suggestions , to even printing out our boarding passes for us. She is a credit to this hotel.
    We cannot say enough about the wonderful stay in this hotel. Treat  yourself to an excellent location as well as luxury service!",5,2014,10,23
237,Could have been,"Ugh...Where do I start. Well I will start with the good....The location!! Amazing...Far enough from the noise of Temple bar and yet and couple minute walk to get there! Fresh yummy cookies upon arrival. Next door had the best cafe I've EVER been to in my life...Mochaland Cafe! A must try. 
OK now for the not so good...
Arrive to check in at 2pm. Our room is not done and they tell me check is is only guaranteed for 3pm. 
3;30 still no room. So I try to get some work done on there lobby computer. It is not a business centre...it is simply a computer in the middle of the lobby. Does it have Microsoft Office on it? Nope. So I couldn't do any work after all while I waited for our room. I think they finally got our room around 4pm. By now I was trying to finish my work on my Ipad. Would have brought my laptop but hotel kinda implies its a business centre. 
I enter our room....SMALL holy SMALL. Could barely open my suitcase on the floor. Restroom SMALL. Tub so high I banged my foot a couple times trying to get in and out. (Not for elderly)
There is a balcony...I'm thinking...""Cool"" Nope...It's locked. Security keeps it locked so ""Drunk people don't come back to their room and jump over"" Their words not mine. Next day we returned after a long morning and afternoon out for a rest at 3;30 to find we still had no housekeeping. I had to phone to ask for our room to be done and then we had to skip our nap to let the girl do the room. 
18 Euros for breakfast. WHAT? Thats about $25. I checked to see what you get for that....not enough! 
But I'm glad they charged a FORTUNE because I would have never found Mochaland. 
Check out was good. We left around 10am and the girl at the front desk was very lovely and helped us grab a taxi. Was happy to leave though. 
We left to meet up with friends at the Croke Park hotel and although a bit further away....it was amazing. Wished we woulda stayed there from the start! 
Would not return even though the people are friendly and location amazing.",3,2014,10,22
237,Great hotel located right in the centre of Dublin,"Clean,modern hotel with large and very new feeling rooms.
Reception staff greet you with a smile and a warm cookie on check in,
Toiletries are extensive and good quality.
Breakfast (with the exception of the most overcooked scrambled egg I have ever seen) is buffet style with loads of choice and served in a really nice restaurant .
The hotel itself is a stroll over the river from the shops ,bars and clubs in the city centre.",4,2014,10,19
237,Great Location - Good size rooms and bathrooms.,"After going to Rome where the rooms were the size of closets and we doubled up - I made a point to get my own room when on this trip to Dublin.  Turned out the room was plenty big enough and so was the bathroom.  I had a walk in shower that was more than large enough.  Rooms come with robe and slippers, flat screen tvs, hair dryers, hot pot to make tea, small fridge (it has some wine, beer, snacks in it but you will be charged for them if you partake.  I used the fridge for wine I bought outside the hotel).  I had a king size bed and there was also a small padded bench you could sit on or use.  The location of this hotel is on the North side of the Liffey river - right on the river so it is close to everything south and north.  Plenty of bridges you can walk over to get to the south side if you want to check out the Temple bar area, which had plenty of pubs.  St Patrick's cathedral is also on the south side and it is a must see.  One more thing - 1 block up Jervis street - nice little pub TP Smiths - excellent and close by.",4,2014,10,18
237,The Morrison,"I spent a month at The Morrison this year,2 weeks in August and 2 weeks in September.....I loved everything about my trip,the hotel,Dublin,the staff ...everything...Roll on next year,I will be back...",5,2014,10,18
237,Comfortable...,"Great location, comfortable and clean rooms, friendly staff (mostly).  It is one of those hotels with attention to detail, from the perfectly lined up toiletries, they way they leave your towels rolled and tied with a ribbon, etc.

It is walking distance from several attractions (Temple bar, Christ Church, even Guinness storehouse and Jameson Distillery)

For the room lights - make sure you're patient! It is not immediate to turn off or on, takes 2-5 seconds after you press the switch (pink lights in particular).

The breakfast has good variety, but I would have more options at the Morrison Grill, as options can be a bit dull after a while.",4,2014,10,18
237,Simply a great hotel,"I was slightly concerned about potential noise at this hotel given it's proximity to local nightlife etc. However, like everything to do with our stay, it was no problem whatsoever. The Morrison is a very smart hotel, fabulous location, friendly staff, lovely rooms and yummy breakfast. Our welcome on arrival was genuine and all staff we encountered were friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Highly recommended.",5,2014,10,16
237,Clean hotel,While the staff were friendly the service could be better and the menu is the same all the time with very limited choices. The location is excellent and the rooms were clean.It was expensive for the service that was offered,3,2014,10,16
237,Great Location,"We visited Dublin in October, 2014.  We reserved a Jr.  Suite.  The room was very spacious with a large 5 piece bath.  Located right on the Liffey River and 5 min. across the bridge from the Temple Bar area.  The hotel was very accommodating when we needed assistance with local information (Hop-On/Hop-Off bus, locale to meet our tour group, etc.)  The only negative was that our room faced the Liffey and there was a lot of street noise (lots of traffic). The modern interior could use some additional updating but it was comfortable and the room had 5 bed pillows as well as 2 pillows on the sofa and ottoman (important because I was traveling in a post-surgery boot and needed a lot of pillows to prop up my foot).  We visited the hotel restaurant twice and the staff and food was very good.",4,2014,10,15
237,Great location,"Our stay at this hotel was reasonable. The location is great being just near the halfpenny bridge. We booked a junior suite and was disappointed that the room was so austere and didn't seem luxurious, also the bed wasn't very solid so it creaked a lot! We stayed in room 234, here the sounds of the city could be loud at night so if you want quiet, stay away from facing the river or bring ear plugs. The decor of the room is a little odd, its a huge space but with nothing in it! The lighting is very complex and pink! But we didnt feel the room was worth the money we paid. Should have got a normal room.   The breakfast was very nice, although the large bird man statue is a little off putting, especially if you are seated looking right at its behind! That was very embarrassing!   We also ate at the grill restaurant, simply delicious, couldn't fault the food there!",3,2014,10,15
237,Beyond accommodating!,"As a solo traveller, I was looking for something centrally located; the Morrison fit the bill perfectly!  The room was spacious and spotless and the staff was bend over backwards helpful.  From directions to recommendations to answers to idiotic questions, they never batted an eye!  Breakfast (included with my rate) was outrageously varied and tasty. Only criticism?  A bit pricy, but isn't that all of Europe?  Highly recommended!",5,2014,10,14
237,"Perfect location , excellent staff","Morrison hotel is perfectly located at the river in central Dublin with everything of interest within walking distance . Design is modern and rooms well equipped . Staff was excellent and are party of 10 are particularly grateful to Diana at guest services who arranged for dinner reservations for 3 nights all good restaurants and a walking tour with great guide Sean . She also arranged for a perfect excursion to the Wicklow mountains with equally great driver and guide Tony of Paddywagon . Perfect hotel for an extended weekend in Dublin .
Ulflund Sweden",5,2014,10,14
237,Extremely friendly,"The staff at this hotel are phenomenal.  My girl and I were having problems getting cash from our bank during our stay, and they were so kind to call a cab that accepts Visa.  Thanks for going out of your way!

Classy staff here.  I would definitely recommend to stay here.",5,2014,10,13
237,"Perfect location, Wonderful staff","We stayed at The Morrison for 2 nights at the end of September, 2014. Great hotel, wonderful staff right in the heart of Dublin. The room was spotless and the staff were friendly, helpful and accommodating. Located right on the River Liffey at Millenium bridge. Minutes from great shopping and the ever so lively Temple Bar. We stayed on a Sunday and Monday night so the price was great! More expensive to stay on a weekend but so are the rest. We will definitely choose The Morrison on our next visit to Dublin which can't come soon enough!",5,2014,10,12
237,Centrally located in Dublin,"Stayed here two nights.  Overall, the accommodations were fine.  The room was large enough, nothing special, but served our needs.  It has all the amenities needed, hair dryer, safe. The breakfast was worth including with the room. It was very good.  The lobby bar is nice and had a good selection of items.  Drinks were around 10 euros.

The best part of the hotel is that it is central to everything, a short walk to the temple bar area.  You can catch the Dublin hop on hop off sight seeing bus right out the front door.  We don't usually do this, but found it to be a good value and easy way to get to all the sights.  The cost is 6euros per person and it is good for 2 days.  You pay on the bus, have euro coins on hand to plug the meter.",4,2014,10,11
237,Nice hotel; spoilt by noise,"We stayed at the Morrison for a weekend in October 2014.  We booked a river-facing guestroom but were upgraded to a rear-facing junior suite on the mezzanine floor.  If I've not already been up-front enough, the key issue was the noise leakage from the bar.  Kept my wife awake until 1am both Friday and Saturday night.  They left us a note warning us on Saturday (and we didn't even complain ahead of this) but clearly they need to improve the soundproofing.  Try and get a room further up the floors as an absolute must.  The ""upgrade"" was definitely not worth it, in my mind.

If it hadn't been for the noise, I'd have given it 4 stars - it's by no means a 5 star hotel. Is it value for money?  Probably yes - we booked quite late and this was one of the cheaper hotels in the centre.  Would I stay again?  Yes, if they guaranteed me a quieter room.

What was good:
- location is excellent, just across from Temple Bar and within walking distance of just about everything
- service was friendly and helpful
- room was very large (too large, if I'm honest!)
- bathroom was nice, though the toilet was oddly low and for a room of the size, they could have had a separate shower rather than the stand-in-bath affair.  The bath was oddly rectangular too - not sure it would be that comfortable
- complimentary wifi, coffee and water
- clean

What was ok
- the decor is definitely ""designer"" with metallic soft furnishings and pink lighting.  Not exactly to my taste but fine

What let it down?
- Noise
- Noise
- Noise

Tips
- get breakfast somewhere else nearby for less than half the price.  
- bring earplugs",3,2014,10,10
237,Lovely Hotel,"Hotel was brilliant, staff friendly and always helpful. Great location in Dublin, worth the money, parking was just up the road and not a problem, good selection at breakfast and resonable prices at the bar will be back! ",5,2014,10,08
237,Perfect Location! Great Breakfast! Modern Rooms!,"This hotel was right across the river from Temple Bar and made travelling around Dublin a breeze.  
Very quiet, no sounds at all.  Staff was great and breakfast was very good.  They had a very nice menu.
It is a 25 euro / 30 minute cab ride to the airport.",5,2014,10,07
237,Artful Boutique Hotel,This is a creatively decorated hotel with impeccable service and delicious food. The room was compact but used space well and was quiet and comfortable. Desk and Internet supported working in the room. Conveniently located near a trolley stop so it was easy to get around.,5,2014,10,07
237,Great location,"Modern hotel with clean, comfortable rooms. Located half a block from the river, this is a great location for touring Dublin. You can walk to everywhere from here. The breakfast was a surprisingly good buffet with all the Classics as well as a prepared to order menu. All 4 chose the buffet and liked everything we had. The staff here was very helpful, especially Jane Bridge, the Registration Manager who went out of her way to help us with a problem returning our rental car. Jane said, leave it with me and I will take care of it. She did! Exceptional service!",5,2014,10,04
237,Beware of the parking situation,"Pros and Cons: great rooms, dubious service, parking issues. If you like uber-modern decor his hotel will be for you. It is extremely clean and centrally located, good for a quick stay in Dublin where you can walk to lots of interesting sites and restaurants. BEWARE: parking is not free, the garage is a block away, and is not open 24 hours. Your car will be inaccessible from midnight to 7am. We were not told any of this upon check-in and only found out upon checkout at 6am when we needed to be at the airport at 7am. The night manager, Mr Diop, is a polite, kind man who tried his best to compensate us for the inconvenience and the failures of his colleagues.",3,2014,10,04
237,"Excellent Location, Friendly Staff","My husband and I spent 9 nights here for our 15th wedding anniversary trip to Dublin.  We booked a junior suite facing the River Liffey.  Our room was clean and very modern.  The couch wasn't super comfortable and was made of ""rain coat"" material -- strange, but I guess it works with the style of the room.  The bed was firmer than I am used to, but after walking around many miles each day, I ended up sleeping well each night!  Noise was not a problem (we brought a small turbo fan to diffuse the street noise).  Room's light switches are confusing and there are some that don't actually turn on anything.  Was nice to have a Nespresso machine for coffee/tea.  Shower was decent and bath tub a nice size for soaking.  Maid turned off air each day so when we returned from a long day, our room was a bit stuffy.  This hotel is situated right across the street from Temple Bar and has a nice coffee shop next door - Mochaland Cafe.  Breakfast was traditional Irish food - great pastries, but a bit overpriced.  Karl at the Quay 14 bar is a genius.  Very artistic drinks - you can tell he takes a lot of pride in his work!  Ask him to make you his raspberry drink w/chambord and cream.  It is divine.  Front desk staff very helpful and knowledgeable.  Hotel convenient to Jervis shopping center and bus stops.  Crabtree & Evelyn toiletries were quite nice!  Surprised that the bathroom didn't have a plug!  Only for shavers?  I had to blow dry my hair in the living room.  Overall, very lovely room.  Excellent staff.  Perfect location.",4,2014,10,03
237,Wonderful stay,"Spent the weekend in Dublin and was my first time in this hotel. We were there for a family event and from start to end the staff were so helpful and friendly. We got to the hotel before official check in time but they got our room ready immediately.

At check in they offered lovely warm chocolate chip cookies and said we could have more at any time. Got to our room and there were little pastries and meringues by the tea and coffee facilities. Again a lovely touch.

Room was decorated well and had robes and slippers, an ironing board and iron, nice toiletries and a really comfortable bed.

Breakfast was a buffet and plenty of choice. Top tip would be to order the eggs, tea and toast as soon as you get to the restaurant as when it's busy this can take time.

The party we were going to was in the Gallery. Beautiful room and pleasant staff but very expensive for drinks. I'm originally from Dublin and know how dear it can be but really found here so pricey.

Location of this hotel is perfect for Dublin tourist attractions, shopping and public transport. It is right on the river but the rooms are quiet.

Great stay and even checking out there was a chilled bottle of water offered. All these little extras made it a very personal stay. Would definitely go back",5,2014,10,02
237,Excellent Hotel for events and level of Service impressive!,"We have just organised our wedding party at the Morrison last saturday, and we couldn't wait to recommend it to all as we just had the perfect event for us, but also for our 180 guests! 
Indeed, we got married abroad, and just wanted to organise an after wedding party for our friends and family, so we have looked at multiple venues, but when comparing different ones, The Morrison really looked like the perfect option...and we were right! Venue is beautiful with a separate reception area, a little garden, and then main reception rooms that can be setup at your taste. The lights in the room ( different choice of coulours) made our picture even more beautiful. Hazel in the Management Team provided us great guidance in terms of food choice, flower arragements, and everything to ensure we did not forget anything to make our day the more personnalised possible! All went well and our guests were impressed with the modern style of the hotel rooms and the level of service of all the employees. Honestly, if you want to organise a more relaxed wedding party, or any events for that matter, do NOT miss this fantastic place!",5,2014,10,02
237,Very Impressive Renovation,"We really enjoyed our two-night stay at the Morrison.  After a week in the countryside at several B&Bs, it was fun to be in a very modern, edgy hotel.  While my dad and husband returned the rental car to the airport, my mom and I waited in the lobby, and we were very pleasantly surprised by a girl from the front desk (Maggie, I believe) bringing us a tray with DoubleTree's signature warm cookies and tea while we waited.  The staff was all very friendly, the beds were comfortable, and we felt well taken care of.  My only complaint would be the lack of clear signage on the building.  We arrived about 20:30 as it was getting dark, and we went right past the hotel as there's only a small sign up in the corner of the building.  It might be more helpful to explain that the hotel's entrance is actually on Jervis Street and perhaps improve the hotel's signage on the street to assist guests.",4,2014,10,01
237,Excellent hotel and service,"Brief visit and two different nights stay.  helpful & courteous staff.  both rooms excellent.  first night corner room oversized & appreciated. great new remodel in hotel and amenities. staff provided assistance and very helpful. only minor item, took several attempts at check in desk to access internet wifi. restaurant recommendations very good. suggested travel times to destination via auto - underestimated by 100%.  don't attempt to drive in Dublin:)",5,2014,09,30
237,Huge improvement but not #6 in Dublin,"It's been a while since I was here previously - before Hilton took over - and the improvement is huge - but it's still a functional hotel w little character. 
Rooms are modern if a tad soulless - but the shower is a planning disaster - great big shower head but about an inch from the wall ( and over a bath ) so nearly impossible to get under the spray. 
Service was pleasant - but I could have been anywhere to be honest.  ",4,2014,09,29
237,Nice Hotel,"We recently spent three nights at this hotel. It is well located in Dublin for walking to many of the site in the city center. The staff were helpful and courteous . There was always some type of function going on, with lots of people in the bar and lobby, but the room was quite.",4,2014,09,29
237,Little treats,"I booked into The Morrison for a staycation in Dublin.  To be honest, before I booked it I had never heard of it!  Apparently, this is something of an oversight on my part as a Dublin resident.

Have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. It is so well located we walked everywhere with ease.  Our room looked out over the Liffey.  Of course, this meant it was noisyish when the window was open given the Quays are right below you.  However, I consider that worth the price.  The public areas are just lovely: when I saw the photos online I wasn't sure I would take to such a modern decor and so much purple but, I have to say, it works.

The room was good, gorgeous bed.  Bathroom a bit disappointing for the level - the bath is over the shower despite there being ample room for a walk in shower to have been added behind the door.  So, okay but not fabulous.  What they do really well is the little things.  BIG, homemade chocolate cookies provided on welcome (these became a late night supper), good quality umbrella provided in room (essential for Dublin).  The staff were also very relaxed.  I'd definitely return.",4,2014,09,28
237,Top Notch,"Took my wife for our 10 year anniversary in September.  We were only in Dublin for two nights but the staff went out of their way to take care of us and make us feel at home.  They even called us by name when we were leaving for the night or coming to breakfast.

One blonde lady at the front desk in particular (I wish I hadn't forgotten her name) spent a good amount of time talking to my wife, helping her with directions and suggestions.

The room was excellent and away from the main street so it didn't get too noisy.  We even opened the windows and had no problems.

It's a great location beside the Liffey and probably a quarter mile from the Ha'Penny.  I'd give The Morrison more stars if I could.  They made our first two nights in Ireland an excellent start to our trip!",5,2014,09,26
237,Nice stay......,"first time in Dublin for over 40 yrs. Chose the Morrison on the basis of Tripadvisor reviews and wasn't disappointed. Great friendly & attentive staff, mix of Irish and other Europeans. Room, great (chose overlooking the Liffey), breakfast room - spectacularly & imaginatively decorated - and great selection inc short a la carte for eggs & stuff. Particularly liked the evening ambience in the lobby area & bar, nice mood music and buzz. Hotel location also spot on for all points exploring and of course just across the bridge into Temple Bar. Would definately use this hotel again....and not wait 40 yrs!",5,2014,09,26
237,Solid DoubleTree experience,"Conveniently located hotel in Dublin with very helpful and kind staff.  Room and facilities modern and up-to-date.  Good for leisure, but also good for traveling business person. Front desk just needs to inform guest on how to turn off a table light that does not have an obvious switch.  The switch has a sticker to mark it, but unless you're told that it relates to that light, it will be missed.  Minor thing, though.",5,2014,09,25
237,Good Hotel .. Great Location,"We stayed at the Morrison for 2 nights. This is a nice hotel with good sized bedrooms albeit the rooms are a little too ""modern"" style for my taste. Located on the Liffey River a short walk to the Temple bar area, Trinity College, Grafton St and Henry St shopping areas etc the hotel is very well located for tourists visiting Dublin. The staff are very helpful and there is a good restaurant/bar as well as a health club on site. A good way to get an overview of Dublin is to take the Hop-On, Hop-Off Sight Seeing Bus that leaves from O'Connell St a few blocks away. A ticket is good for 2 days and offers two routes one that passes most of the historic sights and a second that visits the harbour area. Overall the Morrison is a good facility that I can recommend.",4,2014,09,24
237,walk  (or bus) to everywhere,"The Morrison is situated  for easy walking access to the central core of Dublin (Stephens Green, Fitzgerald's Pub,Trinity, Old City Hall, etc.)), or a brief bus ride to Phoenix Park, or light rail to, e.g., Collins Barracks.",5,2014,09,24
237,Great hotel - excellent staff,"As per many if the other reviews this hotel is in a great position o be lbe to walk to most highlights of dublin city. The rooms were modern, looked like a recent refurb and the 1 bedroom suite we had was great for families. 
My biggest positive for this hotel other than the location and rooms was definatly the staff. Everyone we interacted with was amazing, helpful and provided everything we asked for and more.",5,2014,09,24
237,Modern hotel near the city center,"We stayed a week for our first vacation to Dublin. The hotel is conveniently located just across the river from the Temple Bar area. There are stops for the hop-on hop-off bus tours near the hotel as well. The rooms were modern and had all the amenities that are expected from a Hilton in a city center. The free wi-fi was fast and worked without any issues.The breakfast was a bit expensive so we skipped it, and went to the cafes in the area instead. The bar at night was slow, but did have live music on the weekend which a relaxed an pleasant experience. The staff was helpful with any questions, the food was good and room service delivered very quickly. A good hotel experience in a good location.",5,2014,09,23
237,"Very nice, best location in town","The Morrisson is located within walking distance to the Temple Bar.
So you get all the fun, but you can sleep in a quiet surrounding.
Just cross the river and you are in temple bar.
Many shops and cafes are close by, so the location is perfect

The rooms are modern, nice and very good beds.
The breakfast, esp. egg benedict, are delicous. You can even get a lunch bag
in case you are planning a trip!

Thanks for the great experience",4,2014,09,23
237,Great Stay on River Liffey in Dublin,"Excellent hotel with a spacious room including a very comfy bed, high quality linens  and a fabulous bathroom. Located 1 minute walk from Temple bar and 5 to 10 minutes from historic sites. The hotel is recently renovated.",5,2014,09,23
237,Another example of their exceptional service,"This was our first visit to Dublin and stay at the Morrison Hotel .

After our flight landed at Dublin airport at around 7:00 am we took an airport taxi to our hotel, The Morrison, a Double Tree by Hilton Hotel  We arrived at the hotel around 8:30 am.  The front desk receptionist, Alicja K., was very pleasant while checking us in. She informed us that our email request for an upgraded room was not available because the hotel was fully booked.

One thing that bothered me on the way in by taxi was the fare of 47 Euros, which the taxi meter indicated. I asked Alicja what was the usual taxi fare from the airport to the hotel. She said between 25 to 28 Euros. She was very shocked at the amount that I paid. I told her that the main reason we took an airport taxi was that an article said that most of the Dublin taxi drivers were honest. I did receive a receipt from the taxi driver but found out later that it was a handwritten receipt and not an official receipt, which contains more detail information on the taxi ride. Alicja immediately said she would take ""good care of us."" She helped us store our luggage, said that we would be put on top priority when a room type we booked for becomes available (normal check-in time was 3:00 pm), and accompanied us to their Halo restaurant breakfast buffet, which Alicja said was complimentary for us.

During our buffet breakfast, Alicja came by to notify us that our room was ready. This was around 9:30 am. After a very enjoyable buffet breakfast, we went to the front desk. Alicja already had taken our luggage out from storage and accompanied us to our room.

What started off as a very bad taste and disappointment of our first experience with Irish tourist service/hospitality (a very dishonest taxi driver) was more than positively changed by Alicja's compassion, thoughtfulness and helpfulness. On departing the hotel seven days later, she arranged for the taxi service to the airport.  The driver, who heard about the taxi driver that brought us to the hotel, was also upset by the over charge and informed us that the initial taxi driver probably took us the long way from the airport to the hotel. Our departure taxi fare was only 26+ Euros.

Besides Alicja, the other front desk staff were very helpful answering our many questions and providing the delicious chocolate chip cookies. Also the housekeeping service was great by keeping our comfortable room clean and tidy. The location was convenient-close to many popular tourist sites, restaurants/pubs and a luas station. The fitness center was adequate.

There were some minor disappointments:
-- surprisingly no clock in the room; good thing we brought our own travel clock.
-- my wife tried to make a wake-up call by phone, but when she pressed the wake-up call button, a delivery service (room service?) answered. Subsequently she called the front desk when arranging for wake-up calls.
-- when my wife requested for a second electrical adaptor when it became available (she needed one for her laptop computer and the second to charge her camera battery), she was told by a front desk night staffer that maybe she should buy her own.

Even with the minor disappointments, we would definitely stay here again!!",5,2014,09,23
237,Great Hotel & Location!,"It was a bit tricky to find the hotel, very little signage.  But getting a cookie upon checking in, made up for the frustration.  We rented a car, so parked in a parking garage a block away, 12 euros a night.
The hotel is sleek & very clean.  Upon entering our room, we loved the pink neon lights that were on the nightstands.  Room was very spacious & so was the modern bathroom.
The Temple Bar area is a short walk across the bridge, we loved the location of this hotel.  We were only supposed to stay here for one night, but we loved the set up so much that we stayed an extra night.  The hotel was just easy & very satisfied with everything.  The employees were all friendly & gave us extra cookies and water when we checked out.",5,2014,09,22
237,AMAZING!!!,"The Morrison is a wonderful hotel.  In addition to being in a great location, it is a beautiful, welcoming hotel with an exceptional staff.  We stayed there in August with our two young kids (who loved the extensive breakfast buffet -including nutella!).  

We arrived tired and frustrated because we had failed to hand in our car keys at another location.  When my husband told the front desk staff, Jane said ""I'll be happy to take care of this for you.""  Jane delivered on her promise so that we could enjoy our few days in Dublin.  We will return to the Morrison.  It's really a special hotel!",5,2014,09,21
237,First stay in dublin brilliant,I was in dublin for a concert and stayed at the Morrison. We were welcomed into the hotel and bookings in was easy when we got to the room it was spacious and very clean. The staff at the hotel couldn't do enough for you and we're always smiling and friendly. Will DEFINATELY use this hotel when I stay in Dublin again ,5,2014,09,19
237,Above & beyond,I loved this hotel even before we left without our passports which we left in the room safe! The hotel staff went way beyond expectations to get them to us on the other side of Ireland during Easter break. Truly exceptional customer service. The location can't be beat and we loved both the breakfasts and the dinners. We really need our sleep so I enjoyed being walking distance from all the night life without being awakened by it. Can't imagine a better place to stay. Cheers!,5,2014,09,18
237,"Fabulous staff, rooms need a little improvement","This hotel is in a great location.  Right along the liffey, near the lovely Ha'Penny Bridge.  Shopping and dining very near.  We stayed in a Jr. Suite, which was quite large and minimalistic, which I happen to like. The front desk staff and cleaning person were more than helpful.  Very prompt and polite.  However, the hotel itself needs some work.  There were stains on the furniture in the lobby area.  Stains on the carpet.  Many bumps and bruises along the walls and a few pieces of trim coming loose in our room.  And the beds....oh, so HARD!  Staff was more than happy to provide us with extra duvets to soften it up, which I greatly appreciate but the first nights stay was rough.  They say, you only have one chance to make a first impression and I believe this to be true not only of people but of hotels as well!  If those little details were addressed, I believe this could easily be a 5 star hotel.",4,2014,09,18
237,Nice stay in Dublin,Rooms were good- Really funky décor and furniture    Staff helpful and nice  Breakfast a bit chaotic- I think more staff needed and more cold choices on the light breakfast as the shelves were a bit empty when we got there - otherwise we really enjoyed our stay and would go again,4,2014,09,17
237,Great Hotel - felt special,This hotel has a very modern feel and appearance. The staff are helpful and polite. The rooms were well furnished with modern equipment. The cookie on arrival was a nice touch. Really enjoyed the stay and felt very luxurious.,5,2014,09,17
237,Fabulous hotel,"Great location for Dublin. Nice rooms, very friendly staff, delicious breakfast. There was a bit of a snafu at breakfast one morning and the manager Marion (?) could not have been nicer or more professional. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,09,16
237,Business offsite,"It's a nice hotel by River Liffey with walking distance to many restaurant, The Church, which was serving nice food.  The hotel serves very nice food. However the internet is not so stable.  Overall good experience and stay.",4,2014,09,15
237,Great hotel.location and for the special Night out.,"This hotel oozes class and modern opulence from the time you walk through the door.its location is excellent,smack in the middle of dublin city centre.just stayed here with my wife for an anniversary night,it isa bit expensive but wwe'll worth the money for that special occasion or if you happen to be rich lol.the only down side although the rooms are modern their a bit on the plastic looking side.the lobby offers free cookies upon check-in.free water bottles if heading out.free water in the room.bar and restaurant is lovly.breakfast was fantastic.hotel is 10 mins from everything east,south,west,north.we loved it would reccomend it.good to live the high life for 1 day anyway.",5,2014,09,14
237,Good Stay. Friendly staff.,"Rooms were clean. Close to Temple Bar. A special thanks to Jane on reception.... She was very friendly and when we found out we were in a room near the courtyard which was hosting an event until 2am in the morning, she kindly moved us to a quieter room. This was really appreciated after a 24 hour trip from Sydney, Australia.",4,2014,09,12
237,Convenient location to the Temple Bar district,"The location of this hotel could not have been better, it's very convenient to the Temple Bar district as well as being an easy walk to Trinity College.  The ambiance is very European in style and actually it reminded us of the hotels we stayed in while in Berlin.  The staff was very nice and they were kind enough to hold our luggage for us, provide us with breakfast while we waited for our room to become available.  We arrived the day after the Penn State and Central Florida football game so there was nothing open until later that afternoon.  The provided wifi in the room was excellent and actually the best we had our entire trip.  Very fast for uploading all of my photos each night.  Overall it was a great experience.",4,2014,09,12
237,excellent location,"excellent location situated in the heart of the city, all the staff were very helpful and friendly. would definitely recommend this hotel for business and pleasure. we had a junior suite and this was Fabulous and lots of space.",5,2014,09,12
237,Morrison hotel,We enjoyed our stay at the Morrison Hotel in Dublin Ireland. The room was comfortable and the staff was very accommodating.They do have handicap accessible  rooms that work well especially if you get a larger room.,5,2014,09,10
237,Excellent service from a fantastic team,The level of service from both managers Lewis and Jane last weekend was fantastic. They really went out of their way and beyond to assist me. They managed to make my stay there a truly great experience. I travel a huge amount and this was excellent service. The hotel is in close  to everything - however for me the difference between a good hotel and an excellent hotel is the people and both Jane and Lewis made the difference.,5,2014,09,10
237,Great place to stay in heart of dublin,"Just spent a night here in a King room for one night and loved it. Comfortable bed, trendy and clean lobby and excellent location for nightlife and bus routes. Would highly recommend.

Hotel staff was available to answer any questions and the room was clean.",5,2014,09,09
237,Excellent hotel.,"Overall our stay at this hotel was excellent. Good size modern room, very comfortable bed, vast choice for breakfast, extremely helpful and courteous staff. Location couldn't be better, just scross the Liffey to the thriving Temple Bar area with its many Restaurants/Bars, shops etc. Some noise (shouting and loud voices) in the adjacent side street in the early mornings presumably from revellers returning from Temple Bar. Double glazing the windows fronting the side street would certainly fix this problem.",5,2014,09,09
237,3 days business trip September,The location of the hotel is excellent for people who need to be close to the city center or financial district.  All of the accommodation that you would expect were present with a big plus on the fitness facilities which were excellent.,5,2014,09,09
237,"Great area, fun hotel!","Great hotel in the Temple bar area. Super convenient (walkable!) to many of the attractions in Dublin. Hotel staff was super friendly and helpful. Room was clean, stylish and comfortable! Would definitely stay there again.",5,2014,09,08
237,5 Star hotel for 3 Star Price,"We stayed in 4 hotels over 9 days surrounding the Penn State Croke Park Classic Football game in Dublin and The Morrison by Doubletree was by far the nicest hotel of the lot.  All the amenities of a 5-Star US hotel we sorely missed, including ice cold air conditioning, soundproof windows, super comfortable beds with lots of pillows and a tasteful, upscale, contemporary design.

We returned to Dublin for the last night of our trip and were simply blown away by this hotel.  All the positives mentioned above in addition to a great location on the block north of the River Liffey and the Temple Bar restaurant/bar area.  We even received an upgrade to a Junior Suite without extra charge.  What a treat!",5,2014,09,07
237,Best hotel in Dublin right now!,"We normally stay at Four seasons, shelbourne or the merrion hotel. What a treat to pay much less at The Morrison yet get the most incredible experience. With free mocktails, personal service, beautiful rooms this is the place to stay. Great atmosphere music in bar. Staff genuinely interested in making your stay amazing!",5,2014,09,07
237,Quite good!,"We stayed there for 5 nights. The location is very convenient both to the main attraction (just the other bank of the river to the Temple Bar) and to the shopping street - Henry street. The staff is very welcoming, there are also Russian speaking staff that was extremely convenient to accommodate my specific needs. The rooms are not big ones but well organized. The minor thing was for me - inconvenient pillows (quite high) and also the window does not open in the room and sleeping with air conditioner was inconvenient. The bar was also quite good at the hotel - a cosy one. ",5,2014,09,06
237,Wonderful Boutique Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Morrison August 28 to September 3.  This was our first time in Dublin and we came for the PSU game.   This hotel is very cool and contemporary.  It is conveniently located to The Temple bar area and there are many tourist attractions within walking distance.  Quay 14 is a great place to have drinks and a meal and the bar staff is very entertaining.  We had an awesome time at the Morrison and in Dublin and hope to get back soon!  The staff is very hospitable and we want to especially thank Lewis, Mark and Gary for keeping us laughing!",5,2014,09,06
237,The best of the best!,"The bright interiors of the room are illuminated in bright blues, pinks, and greens, representing the exciting and vibrant history of the hotel. Each room is designed with comfort, style, and functionality in mind. Plush mattresses, fluffy towels, and baby soft linens comfort you during the most important part of the day, bed time. Luxurious touches such as wood floors, plush carpets, large marble bathrooms, and Crabtree and Evelyn amenities ensure that your stay exceeds the four star rating the hotel has received. And finally, electrical points, ironing boards, and a handy hair straightening/curling and makeup application station, make the rooms extremely functional. But the real winning point of the hotel, is its suites. Featuring an oversized bedroom, sitting area, balcony, and huge marble bathroom, the decadent Junior Suite is worth the upgrade, as it features comfort, style, and functionality wrapped up in a more extravagant package.  
With the River Liffey’s shores hugging the hotel, and the iconic Ha’penny bridge connecting The Morrison to the famous Temple Bar nightlife district, The Morrison’s location couldn’t be any better. The breakfast choices were extensive and featured continental and hot options as well as the best a la carte breakfast, which was included in the one price, we had on the trip. We are talking the world’s best French toast with fresh cream and berry compote here, so make sure you DO NOT miss breakfast if you get the chance.The Morrison in Dublin is an amazing hotel. It exemplifies a great value hotel that provides the highest standard in room design, service, facilities, and location.

237,Dublin Morrison Double Tree,"excellent location, excellent staff, room and décor were great. Clean and the food was good. Very helpful . Helped with other places to dine and sights to see. When we had a early departure they even opened the dining area early for us.",5,2014,09,04
237,Warm Steamy and Muggy,"This hotel has a great location, friendly helpful staff, good food at the grill and almost all of the things that you would expect from a Hilton Doubletree.  However there is one glaring negative, a woefully under sized HVAC system.  If the hotel is full do not expect to have a cool room as a retreat.

Other reviewers commented on this and I thought that with 50F nights and 65F days how warm can it get?  If the hotel is full too warm.  Our stay was a week with the hotel sold out for the first half, then occupancy rate lowered and so did the inside temperature.  The room AC started to help out once the hotel emptied out some.

Otherwise it would be a 4-5 star stay.",3,2014,09,04
237,"Great hotel, great location!",Our family stayed in two rooms at this hotel.  The staff was extremely helpful from check in to check out.  The concierge made reservations as needed and the breakfast staff was fabulous.  The location is a short walk from Temple Bar across the river.  It was a very quiet area except for one evening when they must have had a private part.  My daughters took the Airlink express bus to the airport and that bus stop was a short walk away.  There was always a taxi at the ready outside the door.  It was clean and housekeeping did a great job.  Rooms were small but as expected in Ireland.,5,2014,09,03
237,"Great location, friendly staff","We stayed at this hotel during our visit to Dublin. First, the hotel is nice and clean. The rooms are pretty close you what you would find in the states. The staff is super friendly and willing to help in anyway they can. When we initially booked the last night was sold out and was going to move to another hotel. They were able to make the change onsite so we could stay the full time. They always greeted us when we came in and have us cookies! The location is also great. You walk over a bridge and you are at the temple bar area where there are tons of pubs, food and shopping. You can walk to so many attractions within about 10 mins.

We had a great stay here and would highly recommend!",5,2014,09,03
237,FOOTBALL PERFECTION,I used this hotel having never been to Dublin and did my homework online for attending the Penn State college football game.  The location is perfect-close to Temple  bar but not in it-no noise. Property and staff are awesome.  I had toured all of Ireland and had stayed at some other 5 star properties in Country that were not as good as this 4 star porperty. Great job to all the staff !!! Soon to be 5 star no doubt.,5,2014,09,03
237,Great stay,Wonderful staff and great location. Very convenient to major attractions. Close to airport for late arrival. Enjoyed the breakfast.  We stayed for one night in a river view room. Perfect place to start our trip. ,5,2014,09,02
237,Convenient downtown location,"Near Temple Bar area downtown with access to lots of shopping, restaurants and sightseeing.  Staff was helpful and informative.  Modern decor and rooms were clean and quiet.  We didn't eat at the restaurant or use any of the other facilities as we left early to catch a flight.  We had a hard time finding parking lot.  Drove around the building several times looking for the parking garage. Parking is down the street and not on property in the Jervis Parking lot which we learned by calling the hotel. Would stay again.",4,2014,09,02
237,The Morrison in Dublin,"This hotel is a great place for visitors. The location is perfect for inner Dublin city fun, day and night. The staff looked and acted professional. The rooms were clean with all the modern needs. I would stay here again, no question.",5,2014,09,02
237,Perfect place for a glass of champagne to end a wonderful weekend,"Great hotel, a great location on the river and far enough away from Temple bar and Grafton st to sit down and have a relaxing glass of bubbly. Served with strawberries on ice too. Final stop before heading to the airport.",5,2014,09,01
237,"Excelent Hotel, well worth the visit","Just excellent, what more can you say, close to Temple Bar but rooms noise free, very well kept, clean with good staff. I loved the Cookie on arrival.
The bedding good, the bed good, everything spot on. The Breakfast was very good, staff attentive",5,2014,09,01
237,"Expensive, Poor Mannerisms","Well I traveled along to the Morison's Hotel in the nearby bar. While I appreciate that the staff members were quite under pressure, considering there were only two to serve a large group, I was quite taken aback by their mannerisms. By that I mean, that when I ordered my Green Tea as below, I asked what flavors do they have. And his reply was quite rude. He merely says ""Green tea is Green tea Sir"". Well it ain't. I can re-assure you. Its a family name. In the end, when I got the tea, I was treated to a lovely presentation. Lovely bikkie(Biscuits) might I add, and also the tea itself was a loose tea kinda thing. However the tea was so strong, I simply could not finish it. The price was so extraordinary and ridiculously expensive. 3.80 for the tea alone. When I saw the staff member coming over with a tray, it only occurred to me that the tea came from a different area. I could have gone over myself. He could have told me that teas etc., are served in a different area(across from the bar).",2,2014,08,31
237,Convenient and great location,"By far the most modern hotel I stayed in while on my trip to Ireland. I stayed in the country castles and ultimately in this modern decorated city hotel. Beautiful.  Great brunch which was included included in our stay. Very accommodating front desk with setting up taxis to airport. Convenient to everything. Close to temple bar area, shopping, etc. walked everywhere.",5,2014,08,31
237,Doubletree Dublin Hilton Hotels,"This was the best staffed and maintained hotel I've ever booked.  The overall experience was excellent.  The food was delicious, the room was beautiful and well-equipped, and the staff was friendly, efficient, and well-trained.  The Dublin location was perfect for any sight-seeing trips around the city.  We would definitely book this hotel for any future trip to this city.",5,2014,08,30
237,Really friendly and helpful staff.,"Our very first time in Dublin, so was really pleased with the location of the hotel; literally 5 minutes from the main areas and right by the river. We found the staff couldn't do enough to be of help, but not in an irritating way! The rooms are beautiful and clean. I really enjoyed the selection at breakfast. The complimentary warm cookie when we were first greeted was a lovely touch as are the bottles of water in the rooms. Excellent!",5,2014,08,28
237,DoubleTree Hotel Dublin,The hotel was fine and the location is great but the cost for one night $384 EUROS was ridiculous and I would not have taken it but I was just too tired to do the legwork to find a reasonably priced hotel on this particular Saturday night which was a very busy night and most hotels in Dublin were full so I had to bite the bullet,3,2014,08,28
237,"Fantastic hotel, great service and superb food","We used The Morrison for a small meeting this week and could not be more pleased with our hotel selection.
The meeting room (the boardroom) was ideally suited to our team of 6, with good space, really nice day light, which is really important when you are stuck in a room all day.
The meeting catering was fantastic. The coffee breaks brought a superb variety of cakes, smoothies, fruit and the lunch breaks were equally enjoyable with a great selection of cold and hot  finger food.
The food in the hotel overall was really nice, with the Morrison Grill offering a nice selection of dishes.
The service we received throughout the meeting was first class and really attentive and actually all the staff at the hotel are really friendly and welcoming.
On the accommodation front, the rooms are modern and spacious, really clean and very enjoyable.
The hotel is ideally located and you can access so many nice restaurants and entertainment.
So overall, a great hotel whether you are a tourist or a professional and we would highly recommend it.",5,2014,08,28
237,Brilliant (very feminine),I loved the Morrison the hotel is very modern with crisp white walls and modern decor. The room I had was very clean with a massive king bed. I was more than happy with the decor however it is very feminine (lots of purple backlights) my room had a chaise lounge which was very comfortable and great for sitting and reading after a long day. The food was very good and the bonus free cookie on arrival was a lovely touch. The hotel is right in the centre of Dublin with only a very short walk to the main shopping and bar area. It is on the pricey side and there are other cheaper hotels offering the same level of quality and class however I would still recommend the hotel.,5,2014,08,27
237,Excellent hotel,Have stayed at The Morrison hotel on a number of occasions. I just love it so much. The staff are very helpful and friendly all the time. The rooms are comfy and modern. Each room has a different lyric on the wall. The beds are spacious and comfy. The location of the hotel is perfect to the Henry st area and only across the bridge to the temple bar/ grafton street area. Will def be returning to this hotel in the future ,5,2014,08,27
237,Modern and New!,"I stay at The Morrison regularly for work and it is my most favourite hotel to stay in in Dublin. The rooms are super modern with pink mood lighting and cool song lyrics written on the wall.  I love the bathrooms and the showers are great.  The location of this hotel is good if you need to walk to temple bar or grafton street area. Breakfast is great, the sausages are to die for! There's loads of fresh breads/pastries, fruit salad and all the hot cooked favourites.  The staff at the hotel will do anything to help.  I love staying here every time.",5,2014,08,25
237,"Good Location and Quality, Reasonable Price","My usual hotels in Dublin were fully booked or crazy expensive on my latest visit so I looked for something new.  I found The Morrison which is located just across the Liffey from Temple Bar.  The hotel has great access to Henry Street, Temple Bar, O'Connell Street, Dublin Castle and Trinity College and a is just a short walk to Grafton Street.  The hotel is nicely done in a modern style.  Rooms are fairly large, though the sizes vary, and they are reasonably priced.  Since I had two separate stays in one week I saw two rooms and both were similar - most importantly clean and quiet.  Zero complaints about the accommodations.  The hotel has a large bar and lounge area, lots of lobby seating and a good restaurant.  Some of the front desk staff is great, some of them a little arrogant but overall as good as anyone else.

While I found the location to be great with lots of shopping and services very close, I was told by some locals that the area isn't the safest after dark. While the shops on this side of the Liffey do close at night there seemed to be plenty of foot traffic in the area from 'regular' people on every week night.  Temple Bar is literally 150 yards away and sees plenty of crowds and Garda in the area.  I didn't have any concerns at all and, though I'm not a local, I've spent more than my share of time in this general area.",5,2014,08,24
237,2 star experience at 4 star prices,Small hot noisy rooms. Spent over two hours waiting in a stifling room while a technician tried to fix air con. Food pretty terrible. Bad breakfast. Way overpriced and charged a child adult prices. Won't be back.,1,2014,08,24
237,"Great location, clean hotel, helpful staff","We had a wonderful stay, nothing negative to report. Very modern, chic rooms. Best bed we stay in all week traveling around Ireland. Amazing breakfast spread. Staff was wonderful. Great location in the city!!",5,2014,08,22
237,central location,"Great food, spotlessly clean everywhere in the premises, friendly staff & all the main attractions within 20 minutes casual walk.  It will definetily become our prefered choice whenever in Dublin. If your going for a weekend take note of local events, we found some cool local markets.",5,2014,08,22
237,Modern Hotel on the River,"Very very comfortable bed in a large and well-equipped room (e.g., coffee/tea pot, lightd closet safe). But, the room was a little TOO modern - - way to many fancy controls to figure out!  I  especially hated the shower controls - - no way to turn it on without getting water all over the floor.  Also, I never could connect to their wifi (so it's a good thing it was free!). Excellent (expensive) breakfast.  Once if was on, the shower was great, very large.  The hotel is just across the river from most of the typical tourist destinations.",4,2014,08,21
237,"Great Service, Very Nice Rooms","The Morrison is just over the river from the Temple Bar area and very close to the city center. From here, you can walk to many attractions. Rooms are awesome. Clean, and quiet. This is a very good value.",5,2014,08,20
237,Love this place.,"In the middle of a 7 day stay at this hotel.  The staff is awesome--warm and friendly and completely helpful.  Great location, fun bar  and good food.  It's right in the heart of Dublin and a quick walk over the bridge to Temple Bar with great restaurants and nightlife.  I think it's worth saying once more--the staff has bent over backwards to make this business trip a really enjoyable one.",5,2014,08,20
237,"Excellent, will definitely return.","Excellent location and a spacious well appointed room.  Really enjoyed the food in the Grill.  Breakfast was very enjoyable too.  What stood out for us though was the attitude of the staff - they were all superb and I hope they can keep up those standards.  There was some noise on the street at night, but this is in the heart of the city centre after all.  One of the nicest hotels we've stayed in Dublin and we'll be returning.",5,2014,08,20
237,Best hotel,"We stayed at the Morrison for a total of six nights and loved everything about it. The staff was the best of any hotel we've encountered.  From the moment we arrived until checkout, they couldn't be more courteous and helpful. 
Breakfast was great. Location was perfect. We were close enough to Temple Bar, and all the main attractions, to walk each day and night.  if you can afford this very upscale hotel, I highly recommend it.",5,2014,08,19
237,Interesting Hotel,Didn't know what to expect and was a bit nervous based on some reviews.  We had a lovely suite overlooking the river and although the decor is different than most (very modern) it was pleasing.  The hotel staff were pleasant and efficient.  Dinner in their main restaurant was very good.  The included breakfast was excellent and the staff in that restaurant were exceptionally pleasant and friendly.  All good.,4,2014,08,18
237,Excellant Hotel,"Great location next to the Liffy and about two blocks from the Temple Bar area. The staff couldn't do enough for you,very pleasant  the breakfast was fresh and excellent. I have stayed at many hotels all over Europe and in the States this is the best I ever stayed at. Also within walking distance to the Dart and rail station for taking day trips out of the city. Again the best staff,!!!",5,2014,08,18
237,"Comfiest beds, spotlessly clean, v trendy but some noise at night","I loved the Morrison, it's a great location on the Quay, less than 5 min walk from trendy shops and restaurants.  It's also got great futuristic decor, pink neon cubes for side tables in the room, is quite unique and was refreshing not to be in traditional hotel.  Staff were friendly and helpful and obliging.  Twin room was fab, beds and pillows so comfortable, all spotlessly clean. 
Only issue was room was inexplicably hot, and lots of noise at night with window open.  Perhaps ask not to stay overlooking side street. Otherwise, couldnt fault it.",5,2014,08,18
237,Great hotel,"Clean, comfortable, lovely feel and not too big. The restaurant served excellent food. Front desk staff were very helpful and friendly. Easy access to main shopping and Temple Bar. Would stay here if in Dublin again.",5,2014,08,18
237,A Grand time in a wonderful hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Morrison in late July for six days.  The last night, my husband's brother and his wife stayed there also in a separate room.  Our first room was a very nice and quiet.  We opted for the back part of the hotel looking out on the courtyard as we felt it would be quiet. After a few days, there was a problem with the plumbing, which seemed minor, but turned out it was not. When we called about it, a repair man (Boris) was there instantaneously.  Turned out to be a larger job needing more than one person.  They apologized, but had to move us to another room.  The assistant manager, Peter, came up as well, apologized and offered chocolates.  They moved everything quickly and the plate of chocolates was waiting in our new room, which was actually more of a junior suite. My husband's brother and wife joined us at the hotel for our last night there, getting there own room which was also spectacular. 

The breakfast was also excellent.  A large variety of foods on the buffet, complete with a selection of fresh breads and fruits, bacon sausage and juices.  In addition, one could order items from the kitchen such as pancakes, eggs, and daily specials.  The staff was welcoming, cheery and seemed to truly enjoy the guests.  Very upbeat!

We had dinner in the restaurant the first night we arrived with 4 other people.  The 22nd was our anniversary and the two of us dined there, mentioning this to the waitress.  The chief surprised us with a special platter of sweets for desert, with good wishes scribed in tasty piped frosting. 

The front desk was most accommodating and always had time for the many questions I had. They arranged several taxis for us and gave us great suggestions and very accurate directions. 
Patrick welcome us the first day and never failed to as how we were doing whenever we saw him during the week.  Kathy ( I do hope I remember her name correctly) was also extremely helpful and we always had a great conversation about something that was happening that day. 

The location is perfect, as many of the reviews have mentioned.  But I would come back to stay here even it were not in the center of everything.  The comfort and feeling of really being welcome were paramount to me and very much appreciated. 
Thanks and kudos to the management and staff of the Morrison.",5,2014,08,17
237,OK in parts,"Check in desk was crowded and our room wasn't ready so we went for a walk around town and for a late lunch. Standard (small) King room with a view of a brick wall. AC worked but was incredibly noisy and if turner off the room soon became unbearably hot. Small mini bar but even the soft drinks were chargeable unlike other DT hotels I have stayed in. The premium WiFi was down so just left with the 512 speed snail WiFi

Great location for exploring the city and there is a shopping centre nearby on Jervis Street if you want to buy soft drinks,etc without paying their prices.

Dinner in the Grill was very disappointing and I really can't recommend it.

Breakfast was OK but on our first morning we were just seated and left. It wasn't until the second morning that we were told there was an a la carte option.

Pros: Good location, pleasant (not Irish) staff
Cons: AC too noisy, mini bar expensive, small rooms, poor WiFi",3,2014,08,14
237,Great Hotel,"Stayed at this hotel with my sister for two nights, when I booked it, I was worried it would be a bit to trendy but in fact it was amazing, great design, lovely food, great bar with live music and wonderful staff all so helpful.

My only negative was the our room was way to hot and although I did open the window, this had to be closed due to lots of noise, but saying that I would return.

Perfect location, temple bar right opposite just over the bridge.

Room had everything we needed.

Recommend this place

",5,2014,08,14
237,Can't beat the location,"Best location in Dublin, right across the river from Temple Bar. Excellent Hotel, nice rooma albeit a little small. River view was great. Breakfast was excellent. I really enjoyed also the bar and the service was overall excellent.",5,2014,08,13
237,Wonderful Hotel,"This hotel is located very conveniently to all the major sites in Dublin.  The rooms are large and comfortable and the décor is a very clean, contemporary look.  We wanted to know the best way to see the city, and the concierge recommended that we take a private tour.  For a very reasonable cost, the driver (Brian O'Reilly) drove me, my wife and two children around the city for a couple of hours in a Mercedes van.  He gave us the history of the city, explained all the important monuments and buildings, and shared a real insider's view of the history and events that shaped Dublin.  We highly recommend staying at The Morrison and highly recommend using Brian for a tour of the city.",5,2014,08,13
237,Super Hotel,"Great Hotel, service was fantastic, staff couldn't be more helpful! Bar had great food and a lovely atmosphere. The room was super, very trendy but comfortable too. Will definitely be staying here again!",5,2014,08,11
237,Excellent location,"I stay here simply because it is very convenient to my Dublin office. 

Easy check in with a delicious cookie to welcome you.

Standard room is good and the location is ideal. It has all the necessary requirements such as ironing board, tea and coffee facilities.

Only downside is the wifi is poor so this requires an update.

The staff are friendly.",4,2014,08,11
237,You pay for the location,"You pay for the location.  The hotel was very quiet, and everything was within a 10-20 minute walk.  Nice modern design. Housekeeping didn't come until 5pm every day, so if you want your room made up be sure to stop by the front desk and ask for early service.  Booked a king but they only had 2 twins on arrival.  A/C did not work (I heard others complain about this in the lobby as well), and if you open the windows you'll get a lot of street noise.  I'd expect more for the price.",4,2014,08,09
237,Great hotel,"Perfect location, beautiful facility, delicious breakfast buffet. We loved this hotel as it was right in the center and convenient to everything. We were able to walk everywhere especially Temple Bar. Staff was very nice and the accommodations lovely.  Great beds.",5,2014,08,09
237,Lovely hotel,"This was a lovely hotel in the perfect location in Dublin.  Right on the Liffey River, near the haypenny bridge to Templebar.  As a Hilton Honors Gold member we got free breakfast which was wonderful, however they were unable to place us on the Hilton Honors floor, which was a bit disappointing,  The rooms were clean and comfortable with great beds.  The only downside was that it was very expensive with a two night stay for our 3 rooms totaling over $1600.",5,2014,08,08
237,Nice Clean Hotel...small rooms,"This my second stay at this hotel. It has a great location, which is the reason I chose it, but the rooms are small. I would have no trouble recommending this hotel, it us clean, well appounted but it is not cheap. The breakfast buffet is nice.",4,2014,08,08
237,"Location, location, location","Can't imagine a better base camp for exploring Temple Bar and surrounding attractions. Right on the river Liffey, across from the eponymous bar. Big modern rooms, attentive staff. Easy walking (unless the weather's too bad) to airport shuttle buses and the train stations, not to mention the Guinness Storehouse.",5,2014,08,08
237,Great Hotel...,"Stayed in this hotel for a long weekend in 2013 and couldn't have wished for a better hotel to stay in whilst in Dublin. Location, staff, rooms were all excellent! If you want to go to Dublin and don't want to leave thinking you should have stayed in a better hotel, choose this one!

One thing I will say is you want to stay quite high up as you are right by the river and opposite that is Temple Bar!",5,2014,08,08
237,Good but no breakfast,"Just few metres from City centre shops, lake away from the famous Temple bars. And good place to take good sleep. But no breakfast offered as part of the stay. We should pay for the breakfast which is more than 15 Euros.",4,2014,08,07
237,Quite up to expectations,"My wife and I stayed in ""a room with a view"" - i.e over the Liffey and Temple Bar.  I had expected a more spacious room, but that is my only ""complaint"".  The Morrison is centrally located, it's recently refurbished, the staff is very friendly and the breakfast is great - what more can you ask for?
Next time in Dublin - we'll stay at The Morrison.",5,2014,08,06
237,Pleasantly Surprised,"I had expected this hotel to be average, but it exceeded my expectations in all ways.  The decor, service and staff were 5 star.  The lounge was a fantastic place to meet friends before dinner or have a late night cocktail, and the breakfast buffet was great.",5,2014,08,06
237,Good location.,"Staff very friendly, however could have known the local area/amenities better. Really enjoyed our stay, particularly the helpfulness (and free cookie!) during check-in. Did not eat in the hotel but the restaurant seemed busy and staff were trained for busy periods. Very pleased with our stay and would return :)",4,2014,08,05
237,Little weekend away,"Weekend away with the wife and would definately return to this fantastic hotel. Rooms are spacious, clean and have everything you need (Even an umbrella in the wardrobe in case of rain, (very thoughtful!) Food was great both for an afternoon snack and breakfast had lots of variety. Location great and last but not least, the staff did everything with a smile.",5,2014,08,04
237,Fab Treat,"I booked this as a birthday surprise for my partner. We loved it. Nice sized room which was comfortable.
Hotel is well located to everything in Dublin. Temple bar 3mins walk. Don't feel to bad if you don't leave the hotel as the bar is very nice and comfortable with a great selection of Craft beers, gin's and whiskey selection. 
Staff at check in, check out and at the bar were brilliant, made feel at home from the min we got there to the moment we left.
My only tiny gripe was room cleaners knocking at the door at 9:45am to clean the room, so our very rare (we have two kids) lie in was cut short.",5,2014,08,04
237,Not everything it is made up to be,The hotel staff made a lot of fuss on arrival (cookie etc- which I really didn't want. The dinner snack was very poor and really over-pricede for what I got. I also felt that I was being rushed and the location of dining at the street entrance location was not conducive to eating - people arriving to book-in had to walk through this location. Also the front door was locked when I wanted to leave hotel and had to go to side entrance. All-in-all mostly fuss with little substance.,3,2014,08,04
237,Great Location,"Morrison in the city of Dublin is a good hotel in a central location, It appears to have been recently refurbished and the quality is there to see. Breakfast was very good as well. Plenty of information re local events was also on offer.",4,2014,08,03
237,aMaZing!!!,"Stayed at the doubletree for one week in dublin and it was great! Very clean rooms, staff cleaned each day. Gave a cookie during check in which was yummy :) we arrived much earlier than the 3pm checking since we came from America and they had our room ready which was great considering we traveled all night. The best part about this hotel is the location! Walking distance from everything including bars, temple bar area, shopping, and awesome restaurants. Traffic is okay but I wouldn't recommend renting a car around here. The hotel has taxi cabs ready outside if you need to go far. I didn't really talk to the front desk too much, but they were friendly when we did talk. The hotel is modern and rooms are a decent size. We overlooked the water and the city center which was great. Some comments I read said you could hear partying outside but that's not true. I never heard anything once I was in the room. I would highly recommend this hotel!",5,2014,08,02
237,Excellent Hotel in Great Location,Stayed in a junior Suite for 2 nights....staff couldnt be more helpful and extremley proffesional....our Suite was lovely and cleaned to the highest standard....included 2 bathrobes and 2 pairs of slippers....and a brolly provided if needed.....would reccomend the Grill for food absolute must....room service was quick and food was excellent....would highly reccomend this lovely place for anyone staying in Dublin City Centre,5,2014,08,02
237,Don't miss this Gem in Dublin City,"We stayed for 4 nights and would have continued on had our holiday not ended :-(.

Perfect location directly on the Liffey, in the heart of Dublin City and next to everything historic, food and beverage, and atmosphere.

The staff is beyond compare - friendly, accommodating, helpful to a fault, and a smile the entire time, without so much as a hint of annoyance.  

The accommodations are simply beautiful, well appointed, very comfortable, convenient, and always available at most any hour. 

What makes a stay? Staff and accommodations, with 75% on staff - and The Morrison excels at this art :^).  Do yourself a favor, book a night and stay for a week.",5,2014,08,02
237,"Nice Hotel, Great Location","The Morrison is a great hotel in a fantastic location. The room was well equipped and with many amenities. The modern design is refreshing and the staff were very helpful and friendly. The location of this hotel was one of the most appealing aspects, a short walk to Temple Bar, shopping, and Dublin Castle. Unfortunately there was no availability when we returned to Dublin the following week, but we would definitely stay stay there again. ",5,2014,08,01
237,"Great Experience, just wish is was longer!","Stayed in the Morrison recenting for the 1st time since it was refurbised.  Absolutely loved every aspect of the new decor.  The check in was flawless, the staff on reception were efficient and friendly and of course the cookie on check in was delightful.  We were upgraded to a junior suite and the detail in the rooms is fantastic.  Both the room and bathroom were extremely spacious for a city centre hotel. We had drinks in the evening and service was fantastic.  When we returned from our night out we were looked after by Papa the Night Manager and Kaviraj.  We ordered room service and this was delivered promptly and with a smile.  The checkout was smooth and we were offered a cold bottle of water each to take away with us, which was a lovely touch.  Overall a great experience and would recommend to others.",5,2014,08,01
237,A months worth of stay,"All I can say is I am extremely pleased with the service I received and if ever I am back in Dublin, this will be the only place I will reside. Customer service is 100% as well as the quality of hotel.",5,2014,08,01
237,"""Wished we could give a 10 rating""","Upon arrival DEAN was expecting us! Although we were early he worked on our behalf to get us into a fantastic room in which we stayed for 3 nights! Dean, with your good Irish care we will recommend this hotel to all of our friends and family worldwide! We hope the company gives you your own hotel to manage, so one day you can teach all of your employees, how to be the best at customer service possible. Dean is fulfilling Conrad Hilton's aim, "" to be of the highest quality service possible"". Wish there was a 10 to rate our experience! ( Iona at breakfast and Gavin at check out preformed there service and cared for us above and beyond our expectations!)
Thank you all, The Etzels
",5,2014,07,31
237,Always a great stay!,"This is the 3rd time I've stayed at this hotel. While the style has changed from colors of white and brown to a more modern white with bright color accents, the service has thankfully not changed. The front desk and restaurant staff are extremely helpful to their guests.  This hotel is close to so many things to do! If you walk across the bridge you are right in temple bar. Beyond that up to a 20 min walk will take u just about everywhere. ",5,2014,07,31
237,Beautiful Hotel,"Stayed there for one night, couldn't fault the place.. Staff very nice, food beautiful.. would definitely stay again..Close to a lot of amenities. In City Center but room very quiet.  Lovely decor. Ideal for a city get away, very classy.",5,2014,07,31
237,A few niggles but I think I'd go again.,"We arrived for a 2 night stay, checked in by Diana and given a cookie, which was lovely and off to room 222 we went. When I booked the room I requested a high floor away from lifts as I normally do, on stepping out of the lift I clocked our room straight away. I know these requests aren't guaranteed but I was flat. The room was an accessible room I think you would call it so it was a large bathroom with a shallow bath. This room wasn't working for me. I went back to reception and explained and Diana moved us to a hilton honours room 418. Which was smaller than the initial room however in a quite corner on the 4th floor.  Breakfast on the 1st morning was a no ketchup disaster for me, it was an hour before breakfast was due to finish and there was no ketchup, what!?!? Also they took 15 mins to cook a fried egg because the kitchen was busy. There was probably about 8 people in the whole restaurant, so my husband sent it back as he'd finished his breakfast by the time it came. The waitress was apologetic but there was no sincerity. Why not just have the fried eggs out like any other hotel? And 2 requests to get coffee before it finally came. Didn't sleep brilliantly at the hotel as there were people in the corridors at 2am making noise. The positives and there are some, the hotel is in a good location right on the river, the lobby is light and modern and Diana on reception saved the day by moving our room, the breakfast moans are only niggles but when your paying for these things you expect to get them. If I got a good enough deal I would go again.",4,2014,07,30
237,Morrison Grill,Lovely drinks & lunch here for our wedding anniversary ! Lovely friendly professional staff. Excellent cocktails. Food is 'different' & served in a unique way. We had the prawn cocktail & ribs starter both delicious & fillet steak & burger main courses. The red house wine was delicious & the dry rose I chose was also very good. Will definitely return ,5,2014,07,28
237,Amazing place,Just want to share how good and beautiful this Hotel is. The rooms are so spacious and the staff so friendly. Right in the centre of Dublin overlooking the river Liffey. We had a fantastic time and did not want to leave the Hotel even though we were so central. The decor of the room and hotel are second to none and i would recommend it to everyone.,5,2014,07,28
237,"Wonderful staff, great location!","I have just had a night stay in the Morrison which had been booked to go to the Garth Brooks concerts!! I experienced a warm welcome on arrival! Check in was professional and friendly! My room was situated on the hilton honors floor which was great. Rooms very modern if slightly plain but they are of a minimal style. We had a meal in Morrison Grill. We're were served bread and dips  and a free starter as they explained our choice of meal would take a while! (Chateaubriand) which was lovely. Very impressed with the staff and service. Staff at breakfast were again friendly, informative and welcoming! We had pancakes and maple syrup yum!! Great choice! We had a snack before we left in Morrison grill and the staff were fantastic and very accommodating to our specific needs! Thank-you. Location of hotel is great for shopping and Temple bar area. I will definitely return! It's many years since I stayed in Dublin but I found the people friendly, very helpful and great craic!!",5,2014,07,28
237,Wowed by the experience,Great hotel and a staff that makes all the difference. Loved the colour scheme of the various floors. The breakfast is wonderful. Bar staff are pleasant and knowledgeable as are the restaurant staff. Centrally located across the river from Temple Bar - great location. Would definitely go back.,5,2014,07,28
237,Perfect location; price doubtful,"This is a hotel at the perfect location, overlooking the river and Temple Bar from the other side. With all central Dublin hotels being so expensive, it is difficult to call it overpriced, yet it is. There is no fault with the service and amenities, though it is not luxurious. The breakfast hall features a weird ad-tv screen. Perfect sleeping experience; no noise and the bed/pillows great. Overall very good to perfect.",4,2014,07,28
237,AMAZING,"Out of all the hotels in Dublin this is one you cannot go wrong with, the second the doors open to you to the minute you leave the Morrison has it all.
Warm cookies on check in, cool water on check out ? A breakfast to feed every palate, bedrooms with style and comfort, a location to every amenity that Dublin has to offer at a stones through away, staff with just you in mind, 
I love this hotel and can't wait to return again soon.",5,2014,07,27
237,Great hip hotel in wonderful location,This is a wonderful find in Ireland.  The rooms are close to american standards and roomy.  The lobby is very friendly and the breakfast was a great selection and great quality.  Everyone at the hotel is very helpful.  Walking distance to great pub scene,5,2014,07,27
237,A revamp that refreshes The Morrison...,"I stayed many times when it was just The Morrison and it became my Dublin favourite due to its central location and sense of style. 
Its refurb as a Doubletree has lost none of that style in the main areas ...indeed bringing the restaurant out to overlook the Liffey. The rooms are freshened up albeit the executive rooms are a little more sterile.
The prices have jumped though.....",4,2014,07,26
237,"Great Dublin hotel, perfect location","The Morrison was the perfect hotel to stay in while in Dublin. The hotel main areas and room were both nice looking and clean. Breakfast buffet had a huge assortment of food and was perfect for starting a long day of sightseeing. Location was key - not too far of a walk from most sites to visit within Dublin and just a short walk over the bridge from Temple Bar, where we spent almost every night. If taking day tours, you can quickly walk to several of the bus meeting sites. We even ate in the steakhouse and the dinner was really good. Concierge services were okay, but not the greatest. We wanted to book several excursions and some of the staff weren't too familiar with the options available. Nevertheless, we were able to sign up for trips and everything worked out just fine.",4,2014,07,24
237,Very Nice but Noisy,"Arrived on a Friday afternoon. Check in was friendly and went smoothly. The front desk staff were professional and helpful throughout my stay. This hotel is located perfectly for those who want to be in the thick of Dublin, which i wanted to be. Bring your walking shoes, there is much to do and see, ridiculous number of restaurants, pubs, shops, tattoo parlors, street musicians, outdoor markets, museums, etc., you cannot be bored in this city. The hotel restaurant was good and the service was excellent! I was in room 333 (a junior suite), see pictures, the room was modern, clean and comfortable. A few loud/drunk guests were in residence, clearly having way too much drink/fun at the Temple bar area which is a 2 minute walk from the hotel, literally across the street over the foot bridge and around the bend of the alley. Enjoyed walking through the old town, lots to see, eat, drink and buy. Dublin is a bustling city with its share of economic problems, but i did enjoy my stay. Check out went without a hitch, my cab was waiting as i requested and it took about 30 minutes to get to the airport. Would definitely stay here again!",4,2014,07,23
237,"Great hotel, perfect location","The Morrison was a lovely hotel, very centrally located for our weekend stay in Dublin. The taxi is about 25 euro from the airport and we walked to all of our city-centre destinations from the hotel.  It has been recently renovated and is very modern (not particularly my style of décor but I’m not moving in) - it is unarguably clean, room was bright and much larger compared to other Dublin hotels we have stayed in (we visit approx 3x per year).  

They offered great value for the price we paid, and room amenities included robes, slippers, lovely Crabtree & Evelyn toiletries (including a separate conditioner, not some crappy 2-in-1 “conditioning shampoo”) coffee, tea, hot chocolate services, WiFi, golf umbrella (helpful in Dublin), good Air Conditioning, lovely warm cookies on arrival, and service with a smile.  We checked in and out quickly with no issues.  

I like to read the Poor and Terrible reviews as a reference, and it seems like those reviewers either (1) didn’t look at the pictures of the hotel to see the décor (and must all be budding interior designers) or (2) thought they were checking into the Ritz Carlton (and were miffed when their private butler didn’t show up).  Get some perspective people, everyone sounds so uptight even while on vacation!

I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Dublin.  
We did not use any of their dining facilities so cannot comment on those.",5,2014,07,23
237,Top Class Hospitality,"I booked a break to Dublin with the aim of proposing to my other half and the staff at the Morrison certainly did all they could to make it an extra special occasion. From upgrading the room, to the cookies when we arrived, the room being ready early doors and the Prosecco for when she said ""yes"" too - nothing was too much trouble so thankyou guys. The hotel itself is in a great location for Temple Bar, we didn't have any trouble with noise and if you like your decor sleek & stylish, this is well worth a look! The room was spacious with a very comfy bed, clean, although there were just a couple of areas around the bath and shower that could have done with a little extra sprucing up, but all in all, it helped form part of a truly memorable trip.",5,2014,07,22
237,Great Service,"Very pleased with our stay at The Morrison. Went with my partner and we had an amazing time in Dublin. We had decided to spend a little more money on the accomodation and didn't regret it at all! Staff were great, and we'll definitely stay there again",4,2014,07,22
237,Great place to stay,Stayed here for a 3 nights in May. Admittedly we payed a little extra for one of the large rooms but worth every penny. the room was big and gave us a lot of space. very well decorated throughout the hotel. Very modern feel. Does have a restaurant downstairs but we had already pre booked our evenings before we arrived so didn't get to try it out. location is spot on. just the other side of the river to Temple bar. close enough to walk in a few mins but far enough that you don't have the noise of an evening. couldn't fault it,5,2014,07,21
237,Nice hotel in great location!,We spent one night at the Morrison during our vacation in Dublin and couldn't have been more pleased!  The location was perfect and within walking distance to everything. The staff and service was top notch!  The rooms were very comfortable. We would definitely stay there again!,5,2014,07,20
237,lovely way to spend a Sunday afternoon,"Four of us had lunch in the Morrison Grill on Sunday afternoon and we had a lovely lunch with great service.  The starters, oxtail tortellini, ribs, grilled veg and beet salad and mozza salad, followed by the Josper sharing platter, the Morrison grill burger and south indian curry, and finally bread and butter pudding, crème brulee x 2 and apple tart tatin, were all absolutely delicious, the portions were generous and cooked to perfection.  Great location, lovely restaurant, great service and fabulous food.  With a glass of wine, what a way to spend a few hours on a lovely Sunday afternoon.  Very relaxed and enjoyable.",5,2014,07,20
237,Fantastic business stop.,I had to be at the Morrison for business meetings and the place shines from top to bottom. Great food and location. Rooms were so calming and pretty. very classy. Bartender at night made me a drink by asking what I liked and it tasted like my Grammies fruit ambrosia !!! Yummy !!! ,5,2014,07,19
237,Awesome hotel & venue!,Employees did a great job and made sure we had a delightful stay.  We would stay here again on our holiday.  We had a very lovely room.  Breakfast was delicious.  Hotel in great central location.  They also had a nice bar and restaurant.  ,5,2014,07,18
237,Morrison Hotell - Dublin Ireland,"This hotel is in the center of the city and close to everything. All public transportation is easily accessible, Many of the site of Dublin are within walking distance. Again the staff and service are top notch!",5,2014,07,18
237,"Perfect location, comfortable hotel","We splashed out a little when we booked The Morrison for a family vacation, especially as we needed two rooms, but it was the right decision. The location was perfect - just across the river from all the action of Temple Bar but far enough away so that we weren't bothered by the crowds or the noise at the weekend. Rooms were a good size and comfortable - although I struggled a little to work out the taps for the water in the shower and even the toilet flush wasn't immediately apparent :) We didn't eat at the hotel but did have drinks in the bar on both evenings and enjoyed the live music. One of our party had some issues with an erratic treadmill in the gym, but that was hardly enough to warrant a downgrade on our rating. Really enjoyed our stay.",5,2014,07,17
237,Need sleep? Then avoid this hotel,"Though good location, the beds at the Morrison were one of the worst I have experienced.  Very hard mattresses along with flat hard pillows.  I travel a lot for business and a comfortable bed is critical.  Won't be coming back",2,2014,07,17
237,Great Business Hotel,"The Morrison is a great business hotel with a touch of luxury and conveniences.  The hotel is centrally located and close to major attractions, bars and restaurants.  A lot to do if you have time.

I'm in Dublin for business.  The office is about 20 mins from downtown.  Dublin has great transportation i.e. plenty of taxis and public buses, so it was an easy commute.

Booked this hotel per recommendation from my colleague in Dublin.   I really liked the bar.  It is a great place to unwind and to catch up with work emails.   I would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,07,16
237,Great location near Temple Bar area!,"There was a glitch with our reservation, so one night was spent in a sister hotel. The manager did everything he could to accommodate us for the glitch. Upgraded our rooms, included breakfast & wrote us a lovely note to apologize. The upgraded rooms were wonderful! Nice Jr. suites and very clean & comfortable. The hotel & room is modern. We really enjoyed our stay here! Breakfast was really good too! Parking is in the garage across the road, BUT the hours are a bit strange, so take heed. We checked out on a Sunday around 7am to drive to airport & the parking garage was closed until 9am. Normally you have to pay a fee to get someone to come down & open the garage to let you out, but this poor manager that had already done so much to make our stay nice, made sure they got someone to open garage for us & waived the fee for us. He even sent us on our way with a tin of their wonderful cookies. We would stay here again, it's in a great location.",4,2014,07,16
237,Location with Trendy Flair,"Trendy and quirky euro chic decor updates this well located hotel on the River Liffey directly across from Temple Bar via the Millennium or Ha' Penney pedestrian bridges and walking distance to most places you'll want to go.  A car is not needed or recommended.  The river acts as a buffer from the bustle on the other side.  Great breakfast spread available to all and even better when comp'd for Hilton Honors gold/diamond members.  The property exudes big city boutique hip rather than old world charm.  As long as the latter isn't a prerequisite, if the Morrison fits in your budget, you'll be happy.",4,2014,07,16
237,Awesome hotel," We met here for lunch who where staying here, we ate at the bar at lunch on sunday.The morrison burger  was great but our service was slow. The bartender seemed to be more interested in chatting with her friend at the end of the bar.
 This is our only fault with the hotel, everyone we encountered where friendly. The duty manager that evening was extremely helpful with directions and information on how to get to the airport.
 We decided to give the bar another try as our friends  wanted to watch the soccer.
 The 2 bartenders on duty where quite busy but made sure we got menu's but after our lunch earlier we only wanted appetisers. 
 I think one of the Bartenders called Garry recommended we have the steak skewers.
 Boy did they hit the spot cooked to perfection, we decided to have a cocktail after a few minutes. The other bartender asked if he could help with our decision, he asked our spirit base but my wife wanted something sweet and me something with rum.
 The 2 guys both made us cocktails which where amazing and all served with a little humour and a smile which was lacking from our first time in quay 14 this prevented us from giving a 5 star rating. Unfortunately we didn't stay but we  would thoroughly recommend this hotel bar and a special thanks to the 2 guys in the bar who really gave us a great end to our final night in Dublin.",4,2014,07,15
237,Excellent customer service,"I booked the Morrison through booking.com for the Garth Brooks concerts in Dublin at the end of July. The rate I paid was non-refundable. However when I contacted the hotel after the concerts were cancelled they had no hesitation in refunding the payment. 
I certainly intend to stay at the Morrison the next time I visit Dublin. I do not intend to purchase tickets for Garth Brooks ever again!",5,2014,07,15
237,Impressive Hotel,"Stayed at the Morrison for a concert in Dublin. Really enjoyable stay, on check in was given warmed cookies to enjoy in the room with a cup of tea which was a nice touch!! Location is perfect, walking distance from everywhere and just a few doors from the Jevis car park, the hotels affiliated car park. Didn't have evening meal here but did have breakfast the following morning and it was beautiful, loads of choice from the full Irish buffet, breads, meats cheeses and then a menu with made to order choices also, decor was stunning, very modern and clean, I would easily stay again!!",5,2014,07,15
237,"Great Location, good service",We stayed one night in Dublin when we arrived and one night when before we departed London.   The night we stayed upon arrival in Dublin was a blur as we were so jet lagged!  The night we stayed before we returned to the USA was good with the exception of a 3 am wake up call by the fire alarm in the hotel.  The location of this hotel is AWESOME!!!!   The rooms were cool and the beds so comfy.,4,2014,07,15
237,Great location and accomodations,"We were so glad we chose to stay at the Morrison.  The location on the River Liffey, a short walk across the bridge to the 'action'.  We arrived early and they were most accommodating about holding our luggage.   They also didn't mind when we needed to access it a few hours later to get our  rain gear.  The warm cookies were also a delicious bonus.  The breakfast was fresh and delicious - one of the best buffets we have had.  The staff was friendly and accommodating - we especially appreciated the bartender, Mark, who gave us lots of good tips.  Because of him, we always made sure to stop at the bar before and after each outing!",5,2014,07,14
237,Excellent Hip Hotel in Dublin,"This hotel was nice and modern, with some great touches to the room like pink lighting and a built in chaise lounge. It was very comfortable and the location right across the Liffy from Temple Bar was perfect.",5,2014,07,14
237,Excellent ,"One of the best hotels I've had to stay in and I travel a lot. Excellent service, very friendly, nothing too much trouble. Little touches like the cookie on check in are appreciated. Towels in the gents. Staff obliging. All very helpful. I'd stay again!  ",5,2014,07,13
237,"Morrison, Dublin... not quite there yet.","It is a beautiful hotel, in an up and coming location.  Just not quite there yet.  I stayed one night.  The room was well appointed, but the air conditioning didn't work, and they couldn't do anything about it since it was a Saturday evening.  I was told that an engineer had left for the weekend, and not available to fix it.  Also, they didn't have any other rooms available.  Just happened to be an uncharacteristically warm weekend in Dublin.  The concierge brought a standing fan up, but it was still warm.  The neighborhood felt a little rough around the edges, and I felt the need to guard my belongings closely when leaving the hotel.  Still, it was a beautiful hotel.",3,2014,07,12
237,Excellent hotel,"We had a weekend here whilst we visited Dublin for a music festival. Excellent service from the staff who held our bags as we were too early to check in and very helpful throughout. Best bit was that the band were staying there as well so got to see them in passing before the concerts!
Room was very well appointed and clean with free wifi and great tea and coffee facilities. Highly recommend the complimentary cookies too! ",5,2014,07,12
237,Morrison Hotel - PERFECTION,We recently spent 7nts at the Morrison June 23 to 30. What a fabulous experience. Firstly it is just a FABULOUS location - right across Liffey from Temple bar - a 100mtr walk but you escape the tourist area when you cross back at night to sleep. Morrison is almost new - room facilities are PERFECT for a 4* hotel. But the best part - the staff. What a SENSATIONAL group of staff at the Morrison. From staff at breakfast to housekeeping to front desk to bar and restaurant staff - SENSATIONAL. Always helpful - always smiling - absolutely faultless - I stay many nts in many hotels in many countries annually - seldom if ever do you come across a hotel which basically get EVERYTHING right - well dome Morrison Hotel - an absolute pleasure to have stayed with you. Oh and by the way - the omelettes at breakfast BEST omelettes I have EVER eaten!,5,2014,07,11
237,Great Location; Very Modern,"A very good location overlooking the river and within a 5 minute walk to the Temple Bar area.  An old building that has been refurbished and is VERY modern in the interior appearance.  Our room was very large and well appointed.  The breakfast was included for frequent Hilton guests and was very, very good.  Great quality choices.  The staff was helpful with directions, getting a cab, and offering to carry our bags.  A an easy to use and convenient boarding pass printer in the lobby.  Nice exercise room.",4,2014,07,11
237,Perfect location and service,"The location was perfect - right on the river, close to Temple Bar area, close to shopping.  Service was excellent.  Front desk clerk, Marion, was super friendly and helpful.  She was a perfect concierge and offered plenty of extra cookies to our kids!  They had a huge spread for breakfast.  This is the best hotel in Dublin!",5,2014,07,08
237,"Great location, friendly staff, stylish decor","We arrived early morning after a transatlantic flight.  Understandably a room wasn't available but they promised to call when it was ready and they did this as promised at around midday.

Our bags had already been taken up to our room and a welcome gift of some sweets was waiting.  The room was on the small side but very nicely decorated - modern and quite quirky but in a stylish way. Sound proofing was good.

The hotel itself is in an excellent central location and it was easy to walk to all major attractions we wanted to visit.  The front desk pro-actively offered a city map.

Breakfast was superb - a great spread and excellent Diamond member recognition in offering a la carte as well as buffet options.  The decor in the breakfast area was also very stylish.

At check-out they even offered an extra bottle of water.

Overall a really good stay with friendly and helpful staff, in a great location and with an excellent breakfast.",4,2014,07,08
237,Highly recommend,Amazing location. New Decor is gorgeous very relaxing. Very friendly helpful staff. Warm cookie at check in was to die for. Rooms spacious and very easy to relax in. The Morrison grill food was gorgeous and breakfast was definitely the best I've had in any hotel. Pleasant stay and will stay again.,5,2014,07,08
237,Another perfect DoubleTree,"Spent the last 2 nights at another perfect Double Tree, good size room has everything supplied even an umbrella, welcomed with a warm cookie, very modern decor, clean room, loved the side table lights , bed a dash firm but still okay.Close to shopping, bus transport, hop on and hop off bus and short walk to airport bus.",5,2014,07,08
237,City Centre Gem!!,"Absolutely adored this hotel.. From the moment you arrive the staff cannot do enough to ensure that your stay is as pleasant as possible. A stylish, hip haven in a bustling city that is close to the top Dublin sites, shopping areas and of course Temple Bar! What more could you ask for!!",5,2014,07,07
237,First class,"Had a recent overnight stay on July 4th, was super impressed with the new room decor, staff efficiency and food.. Loved the pink cubes in our room also the warm cookie on arrival is a cute touch.. Triple piggy bap was yum and the printed plates and glasses were fab.. Would recommend the french toast for breakfast as it was heaven.. Will be back for sure!",5,2014,07,07
237,"Fantastic modern trendy hotel, perfect location although a bit expensive...","Perfectly located with great access to Grafton street shopping. My stay was perfect, everything went like clockwork. A little pricey but I knew that when I booked it, only stayed for one night for a quick business trip. ",5,2014,07,06
237,Serenity in Busy City,"Nice modern touches with calming decor. Stress level lowers upon checking in at front desk and getting warm cookie. We arrived at 9am after all night flight and they were able to check us into one of our rooms out of 2 that was available. Able to walk to LUAS which is a tram that we took to the Irish Rail station. You can also take the LUAS to the Guiness factory and Museums. There is a  convenience store, bakery/coffee shop across the street. Across the footbridge is the renowned TEMPLE BAR PUB district. Renowned for what you ask? We were told repeatedly about the pickpockets and purse snatchers. While I was sitting on the square a women became hysterical screaming and running after a thief who just snatched her purse. The thieves also grab cellphones out of your hands while you are talking on them so DON'T BE A TARGET, and walk in a group.",5,2014,07,05
237,Nice makeover now a Hilton,"I stayed here first ten years ago. It was always nice but a bit confused and gloomy. A makeover and change to the Hilton brand has seen a lighter more open hotel and warm cookies on check in. They have greatly improved he bar area which is very pleasant for a hotel. The hotel is still a bit quirky with it's confusing levels but all the better for it. For me it's greatest benefit is that it does have nice quiet rooms. With Dublin nightlife there are not many hotels where you can get a good nights sleep. Morrison is just far enough away to be a bit quieter but still within walking distance of the action. I enjoyed my stay and look forward to going back. Staff were ale super nice on check in, our bags were still at Heathrow and they came out with complimentary toiletries and toothbrushes without prompting!",4,2014,07,04
237,Great location and service,This hotel is in a great location--just across the river from the Temple Bar area and walking distance to most of the downtown attractions and to the hop-on hop-off city tour bus.  The management and service were outstanding.  We were upgraded to a one-bedroom suite and it was very nice and comfortable.  The hotel is a nice size and is quiet.,5,2014,07,03
237,great hotel in a very good location,"This hotel is right across the river from Temple Bar so there is no shortage of restaurant and pub options within a short walk.  Also, the Jervis shopping mall is less than 2 blocks away and has a grocery store in the lower level.  The rooms are very modern, the beds are very comfortable, and the staff is cheerful and helpful.  The room had all the basics you would expect from a Hilton Doubletree such as air conditioning, coffee maker, refrigerator, and a safe.  We had a river view room and had no issues with street noise.   All in all, a very nice place to stay.",5,2014,07,02
237,Perfect for Dublin City Centre,"I have stayed before in this hotel and it a good quality place to stay for business or pleasure. A brilliant location and somewhere I would stay again.  Food is good, bar expensive, rooms comfortable and modenr the shower is great. Breakfast had a good choice.",4,2014,07,01
237,Great!,Just great! Very modern and comfortable rooms. Great location on the north bank and a 2 minute walk to temple bar district.  Friendly staff.  Great breakfast buffet.  Didn't eat at the Morrison grille restaurant for dinner so I can't comment on that. Will definitely stay here again.,5,2014,07,01
237,Dublin Gem,"Wonderful location close to major sites but quiet. We walked everywhere. Large rooms with modern look, comfortable bed, plenty of nice towels and toiletries. Robes in room.  All staff were very nice and front desk greeted us warmly when we arrived and gave good recommendation for lunch restaurant. Breakfast very good with lots of variety. We had choice of buffet or could order from menu. Nice hotel bar next to lobby.  It is just across the River Liffey from the Temple Bar area, but not noisy and crowded like Temple. Several good restaurants within walking distance.",4,2014,06,30
237,Great stay!,"My husband and I stayed at the Morrison for 8 nights on a recent trip to Dublin.  We had a wonderful stay.  Although it is part of the Doubletree chain, the hotel reminded me of a boutique hotel.  

Room:
The stylings were sleek and modern and the room was very clean.  The room was a nice size by European standards.  We had a king bed, which was very comfortable.  The shower was always hot.  The room had air-conditioning.  Ours did not work right one of the days, but it was promptly fixed after we brought it to the staff's attention.  We did not have any issues with noise and felt the room was fairly quiet.  

Location:
This is a perfect location for seeing the sights of Dublin.  It is directly across the river from the Temple bar area.  It is also an easy walk to the Jameson Distillery, St. Patricks's Cathedral, or Trinity college.   

Service:
Everyone we interacted with at the hotel was helpful and pleasant.  I was especially impressed that housekeeping cleaned our room every day, even when we were only gone a couple of hours in the afternoon.  We did not eat at the restaurant, but did have drinks in the bar.  The bartender was very friendly and even made me a special cocktail.  

We would definitely stay again at this hotel!

Tips:  the leprechaun museum is a block away but I would not recommend this for anyone other than families with younger children.  The hotel has 24 hr room service and the room has a mini bar.  If you are looking for a cheap late night snack, there is a papa john's right across the river in temple bar.",5,2014,06,30
237,Great location,"Upon arrival staff were very friendly & extremely helpful & informed us we had been upgraded to a deluxe room.  While appreciative of the ""upgrade"" I'm not quite sure what the difference could have been.  The view from room 212 is what looks like an abandoned building.  But we didn't book it for its views.  We stayed here 2 nights and the location was great but did get a little noisy when the bars emptied out.  The hotel has a boutique feel to it & is very clean.  I was very happy with the hotel, staff but the bed & pillows in my opinion were not very comfortable.  All in all great hotel.",3,2014,06,29
237,Superb hotel,"I stayed here recently during a business trip and wish I could have been here more that 1 night.

Everything about the hotel was fantastic. The room was of a good size, super clean and had a bed you never want to get out of. The room had a modern decor with clever little lighting tricks which added that extra bit of wow. As I mentioned before - I was only here for one night and was literally there from 10pm - 8am.....so can't really do a full review. BUT I can say that if you are considering staying here - then DO IT - you won't be disappointed.",5,2014,06,29
237,"Good location, good service and nice and clean","Stayed here for just one night upon our arrival into Dublin.  We didn't have much time to spend in the city, so we needed something convenient to be able to see as much as possible.  This hotel has just such a location.  Here's a tip, an easy walk to Temple Bar is good, but staying in Temple Bar can be very noisy.  This hotel is close, but still far away enough to be able to sleep at night.  Rooms are clean and modern.  Restaurant is actually quiet good and the breakfast buffet is very good.  The hotel is reasonably priced and the staff was very courteous and helpful.  One of the better hotels I have stayed at in Ireland.  Even though it is a Hilton Brand, it seems unique and like a boutique.  You get the comfort of the Hilton brand, but not the boxy Americanized feel you don't want.",4,2014,06,27
237,"Wow, is this a great hotel!!!","Stayed here for 5 nights as part of a reunion of friends and was really blown away. While the location is superb - right on the Quays just across from Temple Bar and next to the Millennium Bridge - what really impressed me was the service. No matter where you turned: the front desk, the Quay 14 bar, the breakfast room, the room staff, service was BEYOND friendly. Simply unbelieveable (and I've stayed in many great hotels). Kudos to the staff and to their management for reaching such an impeccable level. Rooms were nice. I did face the interior and not the river but was still very pleased. There is a car park nearby with a preferred hotel rate of 12 Euro/day. Room rates were not low but Dublin is an expensive city and so I guess you need to pay if you want to be in the very center. I've already mentioned proximity to Temple Bar but the hotel is also only a short walking distance from all the Dublin attractions: Trinity College, the Cathedral, Grafton Street, Parnell and Henry Streets (shopping), Dublin Castle, Jameson and more. Hope I get back to Dublin. I know where I'll stay. Oh - and the welcome cookie was GREAT!!!!!",5,2014,06,27
237,Location Location,"This hotel is about this best spot you will find to be close to everything for tourists or business. The rooms are large and clean. As noted from others, a warm cookie upon arrival :-) The Morrison is quite modern with light decor and room lighting in pink or purple. The beds are very comfortable and bathrooms are large with great linens. You will hear a bit of street noise, but it did not bother our sleep. Request a higher floor room, 3 or above. They have a nice breakfast buffet or continental menu, for dining. The walking bridge out front will take you right over to the Temple bar area for shopping, nightlife and tourist attractions. This is a nice hotel in a central location, near bus depot for tours as well. Very efficient and friendly staff.",5,2014,06,25
237,our stay at morrison,"I would say this hotel is fabulous, may not look impressive from outside but it surprised us when we step in to the hotel. there are poems on the room's wall as well. It is newly renovated. Mum loves it here and we stayed in the junior suite with the view of the river. Location wise it's in a strategic place, just one street away from jervis luas stop station, and henry street shopping area. Mum was so pleased as she didn't have to walk far and also it's just 10 mins walk to Grafton street. The service in the hotel was very good, the housekeeping staff was very good in their job, accidentally left some cash but they didn't take it. we are so grateful for that!",5,2014,06,25
237,"Great location, good rooms, poor customer service.","I expected more....was looking forward to staying at the Morrison, Dublin this past weekend (20th-22nd RM314). Had heard great things about it. Let me first start by saying this is a good hotel. It has the most amazing location in central Dublin within walking distance to all Dublin has to offer. So for tourists visiting who want to be in the thick of it, but in a pretty quiet location then this is the place.
The hotel has been newly refurbished (Feb 2013) and is modern in design and decor. I liked the design.
Breakfast is good. Especially the option to select from a menu also. Good selection. Nice room. But strangely laid out. TV not view-able from the bed.
Excellent Wi-Fi - very fast and easy to connect. Bathroom very large. No separate shower. Large bath/shower combo. 
The reason for my lower than usual rating has to do with room maintenance and more especially the response from the hotel on check-out. Balcony door which was a feature of the Delux room was locked and the balcony itself was not in great condition with lots of pebbles visibly around it. View was of a derelict building. However, the bigger issue was that the bed in the room was not suitable. The whole frame was creaking. One tiny move on the bed had it creaking and this was no small, quiet creak. It kept us awake. So a basic of any hotel is a good bed. Nothing else matters more. In this case the bed wasn’t good. I'm sure the beds are comfortable. Very large and very good bedding linens but the creaking made the bed feel like I was in one of those put-you-up beds.
I called down early on the first morning to let them know about the bed and ask for maintenance to check it out. Front desk said they would. When we came back the room had been serviced. No note or message left re the bed though. Checked the bed and it was still making noise. As we only had one night left and we were going out for something to eat, I decided not to say anything further about it. Then at checkout I expected something to be said to me about it but nothing. So after I paid my bill I mentioned it to the lady at check-out. I wished I hadn’t. I felt like a fool. She challenged me on it. Said the bed was fine and that they have the same beds in every room. She told me she had checked it herself with housekeeping and there was no issue.
I explained that it was creaking. It meant a bad night’s sleep. She repeated that could find nothing wrong with it and at this stage she was talking very loudly and had an arguing tone. I decided not to rise to it and just thanked her. I was fuming. Many of the people standing by head her as did my travel companion sitting in the seating area a bit away. It was just so unprofessional. I felt I was being told I was lying about the bed. Just not good enough and as a HiltonHonors member I felt even more annoyed about it. Left a bad impression on me which is a pity as I travel to Dublin regularly and would have liked to continue to use this hotel.",3,2014,06,25
237,Fabulous,Great location. Lovely hotel and certainly a homely feel with the staff so very friendly. Especially the Irish bar staff. The Morrison Grill had a great range of food and exceptional quality. I'll definitely be back. ,5,2014,06,23
237,Great reception and design,"The arrival experience at Morrison was above expactations, as we were greeted with hot homemade delicious chocolate brownies. When arriving to our room, we found ourselves in a Very spacious room with Great design. I Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,06,21
237,Excellent Staff,"We stayed 3 nights and were very pleased with the cleanliness and helpfulness of the staff! I would give the hotel 5 stars, except the beds were rather hard and there is no onsite parking. You have to use the public parking garage that is only across the street, but they are not open 24hrs. It is not a self-serve garage if you want to take advantage of the 12 Euro/24 hr parking. We had to leave for airport before they opened on Sunday at 9 am, so that meant we had to park on the street that evening. Wouldn't be any big deal, but street parking is very hard to find. We did find a spot after circling several times, about 2 blocks away. Hotel is very convenient to many good restaurants and the Temple Bar area. Our room was very quiet, had Air Con and very nice amenities.",4,2014,06,21
237,"The very best, loved this location","Would give this higher rating if it were possible. The hotel is in an ideal location for enjoying Dublin- easy walk to Temple Bar area, O'Connell street, Grafton street. The staff was friendly and helpful, the lobby and room were immaculate, the breakfast selection was beautiful.",5,2014,06,20
237,Good location for a hip hotel,"I was on a business trip last week in Dublin and I typically will stay at another hotel, but it was booked.  I tried the Morrison.  The Morrison seems to be geared towards the younger business traveler (my impression) based on the decorations and layouts in the rooms.  Nonetheless, it was still a nice hotel and has a great location.  It is located on the Liffy across from the Temple Bar area, and you are just blocks away from Henry Street with plenty of shopping.  The rooms are clean and modern, the staff is friendly and the food is good.  I will still go back to my old haunt for further business meetings, but would stay here if traveling for pleasure.",4,2014,06,20
237,Excellent customer service,"We had our post wedding abroad party at the Morrison and we would highly recommend them for many reasons. Firstly they were very professional and very reassuring throughout. The service we received from Paul Joy was excellent. They went out of their way to accomadate all our needs and added many extra treats, such as upgrading us to the penthouse suite, many food tasting opportunities and food delivered to our room on the day. The party itself was very well handled with lovely food and constant attention to detail. We really had such a relaxing experience at the Morrison and this was really down to the customer service. Highly recommend the Morrison whether it's for a party, food or jsut a lovely hotel to stay in.",5,2014,06,18
237,Fabulous!,"Would recommend anytime!  had fabulous time and hotel is clean, modern, staff very helpful. If you are looking for hotel neat Temple Bar area or hotel in the center, this is the one. It is easily accessible by shuttle bus from the airport. It takes 10 minutes from the bus stop, but it is a nice walk.",5,2014,06,17
237,Love this Place!,"Room, Service, Restaurants, Bar -- all excellent!   I was here for a conference, and pledge to come back with my family for pleasure.   Dublin is fun, and this hotel is just across the river from Temple Bar area.",5,2014,06,17
237,Awesome experience,"We arrived in Dublin at 7:30 am got to the Hotel about 9 am - we were  not due to check in until the afternoon.  The staff saved our luggage, let us eat breakfast and found a room for us to rest in - they went above and beyond what anyone expected.  It was a wonderful introduction to Ireland.  The staff at the front desk went out of their way to see that we had everything we wanted.  Can't wait for my return visit",5,2014,06,16
237,Great location,"My husband and I spent two nights at this hotel last month.  The location is perfect, especially for first time visitors.  We saw many of the sights by way of the ""hop on hop off"" bus, which has a stop very close to the hotel.  We really liked the modern décor and our room was nice sized and clean.  The staff at reception was polite but not everyone was particularly friendly or accommodating.  It varied.  Overall we had a good experience.  I would advise anyone taking a cab to the hotel to be sure and say they are going to The Morrison and give the address.  We made the mistake of saying we were going to The Morrison Double Tree and the cab driver took us to the Double Tree.",4,2014,06,13
237,Favored Location,"The staff made all the difference for this stay, particularly at the desk, they went above and beyond!  The rooms are a little quirky (i.e. lighting, furniture) but comfortable.  THe bathrooms are well equiped and the shower was exceptional.  Already looking forward to a return stay.
Close enough to all the action, without the noise -- I had colleagues that stayed in Temple Bar and complained every day about the noise at night -- not a problem just across the river.",4,2014,06,13
237,"Great location,  friendly staff","My husband and I recently stayed here for our second honeymoon.  We wanted to be able to see Dublin without having to drive,  so we chose this hotel conveniently located across the River Liffey from the famous Temple Bar district.  We enjoy a good walk, and ventured to the Dublin Zoo, Guinness Storehouse,  and every part of the National Museum of Ireland with no trouble.  Perfect location for anyone wanting to see Dublin!

The hotel itself is clean and well kept, with a modern look.  The bed was also quite comfortable, and the room featured a complimentary coffee and tea brewing system (an electric kettle with varieties of tea and coffee to choose) which was very handy for busy mornings.  

We had Afternoon Tea at the restaurant a couple times, and enjoyed it thoroughly.  Ebha, our server, was incredibly sweet and took great care of us.  If you need a light meal midday, this is perfect.  Fresh scones and jam, cucumber sandwiches, and coconut macaroons were our favorite parts.  

We also ate dinner at The Morrison Grill, and were very pleased.  The chateaubriand platter was delicious!  We also had dessert, and it was the perfect size to share after a large meal.  

The restaurant and bar, Quay 14, were almost always quiet and very relaxed.  It was a nice contrast to many of the pubs and restaurants across the river, where there wasn't even room to stand, let alone eat and drink.  It was a great atmosphere, and perfect for couples.   

Karl, presumably the lead bartender,  is astonishingly talented.  He asked me only what spirit I'd like in my drink, then proceeded to craft a meticulously muddled raspberry and cream delight that blew my mind.  It is the best AND most beautifully made cocktail I've ever had.  We found ourselves watching him work several times, because he put such attention into his drinks.  

Overall, a wonderful place with great service and an ideal city location.  Stay here, eat here, and drink here if you can!",5,2014,06,13
237,Super cool,"Cool hotel in the middle of temple bar. Spent a weekend here recently and loved it. It's my new favorite hotel in Dublin.

Rooms are small but great and our bathroom was large. No bath but that didn't bother us.

You can do the tourist trap stuff within seconds of the front door but the hotel bar is cool with a dj on the Saturday night we were there. 

Price was low for a hotel in this location of a big city. I can't fault it. ",5,2014,06,11
237,Great location - very uncomfortable beds,"The location of this hotel is great - you are within walking distance to everything. The beds and pillows felt like you were sleeping on sand bags. We requested the pillows to be switched out but they were no better (our ears actually fell asleep they were so hard) - in all fairness we requested no feathers because of allergies. They added an extra charge to our bill that was unexpected: a donation to a charity that ""they"" supported (but we were to pay for?). They removed the charge when I requested it to be taken off.",3,2014,06,11
237,Excellent hotel with perfect location!,"Can't say enough about this hotel!  Third time to Dublin and first time at The Morrison.  Would never stay anywhere else!  The staff was incredible , hotel was clean and centrally located to everything.  What made it even more special was that we got to stay in the Penthouse! Awesome stay.",5,2014,06,09
237,Superb,"I booked The Morrison Hotel as a surprise birthday present for my girlfriend for two nights. 

Before we even arrived, the staff were more than happy to help me with arranging to have a bottle of bubbly and chocolates delivered to the room as a surprise. All it took was a couple of emails, they originally offered to go to the shops and buy a box of chocolates, however, I opted to have the in-house kitchen provide a plate of chocolates, which turned out they gave them to us on the house!

The room was amazing. I comfortable king size bed, tv, safe, robes, slippers all the things you would expect from a hotel of such a standard. The bathroom was massive. I would say I have stayed in hotels where the whole room was smaller than the bathroom we had in The Morrison.

The only minor thing (and I say minor, its really just a spec of a thing) the TV was at a right angle to the bed, so watching the TV in bed at night wasn't all that comfortable and would be best suited in front of the bed. However, the room did have a massive panoramic window in front of the bed, so they would have had to bolt it to the ceiling at an angle. Like I said a minor thing but really isn't anything against the room or the hotel!

The staff, from the maids to the bar/restaurant staff to the front desk staff. All were a delight, friendly and always willing to go the extra mile to ensure you had a good stay. They booked our taxi's, recommended restaurants (we went to The Church - amazing), sights etc, you name it they helped!

I would highly recommend this hotel and if I head back to Dublin, will most definitely look at staying here again!",5,2014,06,09
237,Great hotel in a great location,"I'd echo all the other positive reviews - this is a great modern hotel in an excellent location with lovely and efficient staff. It's within easy walking distance of just about everything, but far enough away from Temple Bar (the main party area, if you haven't read your guide book yet) to let you get a good night's sleep. Breakfast was particularly good - buffet with just about everything Irish and also an a la carte menu. For business users there's free wifi in the rooms (serviceable although it's not superfast).
One more thing folks: Dublin is full of the global chains like Starbucks, McDonalds, etc, but just don't - go to Bewley's on Grafton Street for coffee (same price as Starbucks and with a gorgeous period feel) and just about any pub for a decent lunch. I'm missing Dublin already!",5,2014,06,09

237,Solid 4+ rating,"Clean, unique, modern, well maintained, courteous staff and primo location.  Judging by the other reviews, it also sounds consistent in its quality. Restaurant breakfast was surprisingly tasty for a hotel restaurant, with a focus on locally sourced ingredients and a large screen showing a cooking show (that's a first!). Great value for the price. What more could you want? ",4,2014,06,08
237,"Great Location, Great Room and Service","This was by far the best Doubletree Hotel I've ever stayed at.  We had a large king bedded room with a nice view of the Liffey River and the Temple Bar district.  Bedroom was large and very nicely decorated as was the bathroom and the entire hotel was very clean.  Also liked that the air conditioner in the room actually worked well and for people like me who like it cold at night, it was perfect (which sometimes is not the case in European hotels). Hotel is within 5-15 minute walk of most major attractions (Temple Bar District - 5 minutes; Dublin Castle - 10 minutes; St Patrick's cathedral - 15 minutes) so it is a great location for exploring Dublin.  Lots of restaurants and pubs within walking distance.  Front desk staff was very good and helpful and it appeared the maids were very friendly and efficient.  Only recommendation was that it needed a second chair in the room.",5,2014,06,08
237,"Great Location, a little ""Hipster""","I have to say that the location is pretty much perfect.  A 5 minute stroll to Temple Bar, and withing walking distance of Trinity College and the various other historic sites in the city centre.  It's also right across the river from Temple Bar so you can have a fun night out but then come back to the hotel and not have to hear the noise of the scene not that far away.

The hotel has a VERY modern feel - in some cases a wee bit too modern to the point of trying hard to be hip which I fear will impact the aging of this property (purple accents everywhere, odd glass bathroom doors, etc.

The room was large and comfortable (which I was pleasantly surprised by in such a central location).  The hotel has an ample Irish Breakfast (quite nice) and the workout room is also pretty large with relatively new equipment.

We had a small hiccup at the start.  We had actually booked the room on points, and they couldn't find the reservation (thankfully I had printed out everything - -though I was able to also show them being logged into the Hilton App and seeing the reservation there).  They got us checked in and told us not to worry about it while the worked it out with Hilton.  Happily it was resolved (as the alternative to pay the rack rate was not terribly appealing!).  The front desk handled it efficiently and professionally and that was very well appreciated.",4,2014,06,08
237,Perfect base for exploring central Dublin,"We stayed for 4 nights in May 2014. We were able to easily walk to most of the tourist attractions and areas to explore which were on our list. Additionally, there are a lot of great dining choices near the hotel, or right across the river in the touristy Temple Bar area.

Our room had a lovely river view, but because there is a busy road there we did experience some street noise. This may be better in a higher floor, but the view did make up for it. The in-room amenities were great, and the one issue I brought up with the front desk was fixed by the time we got back that day. My partner used the fitness facilities and he was happy with the available options.

We had breakfast at the hotel every day, and there was a good range of options, if you weren't interested in the ""traditional Irish breakfast"" choices.",5,2014,06,07
237,Ideal hotel,"Stayed in this hotel for one night only on business. 
However liked it so much I have booked another trip with my wife. 
Great location and the staff are very helpful.
Surprisingly the bar is actually cheaper than certain bars in Temple Bar. 
Breakfast has a great selection too.",5,2014,06,07
237,Great location!,"We stayed here for three nights in mid april. Location of the hotel is perfect both for shopping, and Temple Bar area just across the bridge. Shopping areas within a couple of minutes walk.

Great breakfast here, one of the best. You can choose both from buffeet and fixed menu. Also have freshly squeezed orange juice.

Would try also reccomend trying the in-house restaurant, the Morrison Grill. Excellent service and great food! We tried the duck one evening and burger and beef the other evening.

Reception staff is very serviceminded and welcoming.

The room was of good size and well equipped. Bathroom was also very nice.

Ask for a room away from the mainroad, then you won't notice any trafficnoise.",5,2014,06,05
237,Great location for exploring Dublin,"This hotel is in a great location for walking to everything in Dublin.  We arrived in the morning from our overnight flight from the US.  We knew we probably would not be able to check in, but we were able to drop our luggage.  We were offered a cup of coffee when we asked where the closest place was to get one.  It's right across the river from the Temple Bar area, close to catch the hop of/off bus, and the staff is very helpful.",5,2014,06,05
237,Nice Stay,"Staff was very courteous and helpful.  Location great, and an easy walk to Temple Bar area, which is why we selected this Hilton location. We don't care for contemporary styling, but all the other positive overcame this.  Would likely stay at this Hilton location again.",4,2014,06,04
237,Nice Hotel,"I stay at the Morrison for one night and it was great. The room are clean and comfortable. The staff is nice and Helpful and the restaurant situated in the lobby has great food.
The location is very convenient in the center of the city.
My only complain is that one more time, if you need to catch a plane early in the morning, you can not have breakfast., But seems that  to be very common all over the world.",4,2014,06,04
237,Different? Yes. Bad? No.,"If you read any of these reviews you'll see, stylistically, people seem to either love it or hate it. While the decor isn't my personal taste, I'd hardly knock the place for it. It's newly renovated, clean and if anything, minimalistic -- I'm okay with all of those things! 

A previous reviewer complained about the colored lights. I get what they were trying to achieve here and I'm sure it's not for everyone. If you're not feeling it… don't worry, you don't have to have them on. They're also not ""neon"" lights. It's a regular white light behind a frosted colored glass. 

Another knock was on the fact you had to have the keycard in a little slot by the door in order to keep the lights on, otherwise they shut off. Sure, I've never seen this in a hotel before and it was a little strange for me to get used to… but we did. And guess what? We ALWAYS knew where our keycard would be before we left the hotel room to sight-see. We didn't have to worry about where we set it down. That right there trumps any little inconvenience of having to ""plug it in.""

As for our personal experience with the rest of the hotel, we arrived around 8 am our first day. Our room was ready to go and we were able to go right upstairs and drop our bags. Since it's a DoubleTree hotel, we also were given two warm, gooey cookies which, breakfast worthy or not, hit the spot after a long red-eye flight.

Our room was a good size, quiet, clean and with a view of the river from the side street (you had to look diagonally). Really my only complaint about the room itself is that the window was on the small side. But, it's an old building and let's be real, did I really spend much time in my room looking out the window? No, I spent my time out exploring Dublin and having way too much fun! 

Just a quick list of perks for those who are skimming:
- Warm cookies!
- Free internet
- Great location
- Nice fitness room
- Clean & new
- Entrance is on the side of the building (not facing the river)",5,2014,06,03
237,Wonderful Hotel in Great Location,"My husband and I stayed at the Morrison for 3 nights and throughly enjoyed our stay.  We were upgraded to a Jr Suite due to being Hilton Honors members.  The room was large and bright, with an especially large bathroom.  The pink neon lights could be turned on or off, according to your preference.  All of the staff were extremely helpful and courteous. After checking out we left our bags all day to take a Northern Ireland excursion.  The staff quickly retrieved them upon our return. The breakfast buffet had many choices, with either a continental or hot buffet selection.  Everything was delicious. The location could not have been better.  It was a short walk to the hop on/hop off bus stop and just across the river to many sights, including Dublin Castle and Temple Bar area.  We had a restful, enjoyable stay at this clean, modern hotel.",5,2014,06,03
237,Morrison in Dublin,I stayed at the Morrison in Dublin Ireland for about a week on personal vacation.  It was a lovely hotel with excellent staff.  The rooms were clean and well equipped and roomy for a European hotel.  I will stay here again,4,2014,06,03
237,Great Glass of White Wine!,"Just wanted to review all of the great places I visted while in Dublin and although I only popped in to this hotel briefly, it was memorable. The chap who served me was very knowledgeable of the surrounding area and recommended some great spots to visit that evening. The main reason I'm writing this is due to the absolutely refreshing glass of white wine I had there (I didn't eat there) It was called Ten Pins and from New Zealand... So nice",5,2014,06,03
237,"Maybe I'm just not a fan of ""modern""....","I picked this hotel because I thought it would be an interesting experience as it is unlike most hotels given it's modern decor and approach to the hotel industry.  However; I was not impressed and would definitely stay somewhere else next time I'm in Dublin.

The location is good, 5 minutes from Temple Bar accross the River Liffey along Bachelor's Quay. However; when you approach on the Quay, the restaurant faces the street and the check in area is not well marked, which lead to a lot of confusion for us.  The entrance is down the side street at the end of the block, and there was no place to pull in and unload the luggage.  They do not have an attached car park or valet parking, rather; you park your car a block down from the hotel, where they offer a ""hotel rate"" of 12 euro (which I noted was the exact same price if you weren't staying at the hotel).  The lot is not 24 hours, however; and we had an early flight and needed to leave right as they were opening, at 7am.  If you need to get your car out ""after hours"" the fee was 37 euro!

We were on the mezzanine, which had ridiculously low ceilings in the hallways.  I am 6 feet tall, and I felt like I needed to duck while walking around.  Our room had higher ceilings, but the hallways were pretty cramped.  Our room itself was on the small side, but obviously pretty brand new (I think they said the hotel was renovated in 2013).  The beds were hard and on rollers, which kept moving around.  The room also had neon lights that light the headboards and other parts of the room (ours were pink). The room was on the dark side and the neon lights made it look like a cheap bar at times.  The light and fan circuitry was unnecessarily complicated, and you have to keep your room key in a slot near the lights/climate to keep them on, otherwise the room assumes you've left and shuts them down. 

Other than the location, our other favorite thing was breakfast, which was free due to my Hilton Gold status.  Besides a buffet, you could also order off of the menu.  The eggs Benedict was quite good, and they had pancakes and other egg dishes as well.  

It's funny, because my sister and I are late 20's, and you would think that this funky, fresh take on a hotel would be right up our alley - but I guess I've learned that I prefer my hotels to be traditional, with higher ceilings, more room, and better amenities.  Who knew?",3,2014,06,02
237,Wonderful Stay and Helpful Staff,"We recently stayed at The Morrison in mid-May for 4 nights and give it high marks.  The location is perfect for exploring the city center, most things are easily within walking distance and there is not much noise at night.  The breakfast was tasty and plentiful, fortifying us for a day of walking around.  The staff at the front desk were very helpful for recommending restaurants, directing us to the local Vodafone store and explaining how to catch the train to sights just outside of Dublin.  The room was a good size and well appointed.  Our only concern was how stuffy the room got when the window is closed, but then I noticed the stand alone fan.  The central system didn't seem to offer any real air circulation.  Only a minor issue.",5,2014,06,02
237,Stellar location and great staff,"This was our first visit to Ireland.  The Morrison, DoubleTree, hotel is a located in perfect location for touring central Dublin.  We were able to walk to every must see landmark in Dublin, everything that we wanted to see was within 45 min.  The staff was very helpful and friendly.  We are Hilton Honors members and received a very nice upgrade.
The breakfast is both buffet and an optional made to order.  The selection and food was very good.
We highly recommend this hotel for your central Dublin stay.",5,2014,06,02
237,First Class Modern Hotel in the Heart of Dublin,"The Morrison, the first DoubleTree hotel to open in Ireland, is a great hotel with a great location.  It may be a little hard to find (at first), simply because it fits in so well with it's surroundings ... there's no large ""DoubleTree"" sign ... but it's on the north side of the river Liffey, on Lower Ormond Quay (Street), directly across from the Temple Bar section (easily accessed by the Millennium pedestrian bridge).  (The street along the river seems to change names on each block, so a GPS navigation system helps a lot in finding the right building).

The reception area is low key and modern, with soothing piped-in music (just the right mood after a long flight from the US).  The rooms either face out onto the river and/or surrounding city, or into a nice interior courtyard.  Our room was fairly large, with a king-sized bed, flat screen TV, mini-bar, and modern bathroom (with large walk-in shower).  The bathroom amenities are the typical DoubleTree fare (Crabtree & Evelyn), with nice towels ... however they're a bit stingy with the towels (2 bath towels, 2 hand towels, and 1 face cloth) and the soap (only one bar of hand soap for a 3 day stay ... we asked for more, but didn't get it) ... but these are minor quibbles.

The room rate was high, but not unexpected for such a great location, but included the daily breakfast buffet (with the option of a hot breakfast cooked to order, since we're HHonors Gold members) ... one of the better hotel breakfasts I've had!  They also have an arrangement for a lower rate at a parking garage (""car park"") a block behind the hotel, which saves quite a bit.  (Don't park in the top floor ... the local birds seem to have an affinity for the roofs of parked cars).

The breakfast restaurant is large, bright, and airy (two levels, and two stories tall, with TV projected on one wall ... cooking shows during breakfast time was a welcome change from the typical morning news broadcast, since we were on vacation) ... the décor was a bit unique, with one very large, very strange, humanoid sculpture apparently ready to leap down to the lower level, over a small table (where one or two people were usually enjoying their breakfast) ... you have to see it, but it does work with the surroundings!

Dinner (not included in the rate) is served in the separate Morrison Grill restaurant, looking out on the street and river.  We ate there one night and I had the 9oz. filet (""fillet""), which can be had with your choice of Béarnaise, garlic butter, or peppercorn sauce ... pricy (€29), but excellent (they also have some more traditional choices on the menu ... i.e. Fish and Chips with minted peas ... at more affordable prices).  Try to save room for dessert ... they have some excellent choices on the menu ... the ""Apple Tarte Tatin"" is delicious.

A good way to see the city and get an overview of the history, is the ""HOHO"" (Hop On / Hop Off) buss, which goes by the hotel every 10 minutes or so (the nearest stop is just a block or two east).  You pay one fare for two days and can ride around the city, getting off and on at any of their many stops (if you want to go to the Guinness Storehouse ... which is great, but a very long walk ... this is a great way to get there).",5,2014,06,01
237,Excellent hotel close to Temple Bar,"This was a fantastic hotel located close to all amenities with good access to all tourist attractions.  The rooms (Junior Suite for our anniversary) were large, well equipped, modern and very clean.  All staff from reception to restaurant and bar were very helpful and polite and breakfast choices were amazing.  Only problem was noise from deliveries early morning, this was quickly solved by the staff and we were moved to another room. Would happily stay again.",5,2014,05,28
237,Great Location Great Hotel,"If you're visiting Dublin and want to be in the center of the action, The Morrison is the place to stay.  Funky rooms and funky decor and a great breakfast buffet.  I've stayed here several times over the last couple of years and it's been better each time.  The bar was the weak spot the first two times I was here.  My last visit changed my mind entirely on the bar.  The bartenders were great and the service was prompt.  If it gets better on my next visit, it'll be five stars.",4,2014,05,28

Most of my colleagues now book here as well.",5,2014,05,28
237,Enjoyable Stay,"I recently spent 9 nights at the hotel. Our overall experience was great. The location is close to restaurants, shops and museums. I could walk to many places easily and quickly.  The hotel staff was helpful and friendly. I couldn't ask for better treatment. My only caution is that there are some tech related gadgets (open/close curtains, shower) that took a bit to find/figure out. Once I learned everything was fine! I will certainly choose this hotel if I ever return to Dublin.",5,2014,05,27
237,Amazing!,"Stayed in The Morrison Hotel recently with my mum for one night and had a fabulous time. The hotel and rooms are beautiful, very modern and clean. We had steak for dinner and it was absolutely delicious and breakfast was the BEST we have ever had in any hotel. But above all every single member of staff was excellent, couldn't be more friendly or helpful. I cannot fault this hotel in any way. I have been lucky enough to stay in some very impressive hotels in Ireland and abroad but The Morrison is definitely one of the best if not the best!!! The location is also prefect for shopping, going out etc. Definitely worth a visit. Looking forward to staying again soon.",5,2014,05,26
237,Great hotel,Great hotel to stay at in Dublin!   Staff was very helpful and the location is superb for pub crawls or seeing the local sites!    If you need a change of venue for food the Italia Bar around the corner had great food and service.  Portions are a little too big,5,2014,05,23
237,"Nice hotel, great city centre location, but!!!!!","This has a superb location.
It is situated in the centre of Dublin on the banks of the Liffey, across the river from the lively Temple Bar area, and within easy walking distance of O' Connell street and city centre amenities and sights.
Rooms are comfortable and well appointed.
Overall our weekend stay was comfortable.
However, it was soured by an unfortunate experience on the Saturday afternoon.

Returning to the hotel at 16:00 from a day on foot sightseeing in central Dublin, my wife and I intended to have a relaxing drink in the ground floor open plan bar area.
Unfortunately half of the the bar was closed for a private function and the remaining part was totally full.
We decided to return to our room.
Our room had not been cleaned by Housekeeping.
There was no housekeeping staff available on our floor, so my wife went down to the hotel reception to ask when our room would be available.
The receptionist advised that if I had not specifically requested that my room be cleaned that it was unreasonable for me to expect that the room would be available at 16:00 in the afternoon.
She added that it was hotel policy to prepare rooms for arriving guests first and that the rooms of existing guests were always cleaned last.
The receptionist's attitude and tone was very aggressive.
My wife and I did not argue nor make any kind of formal complaint.
We merely asked that our room be cleaned.
The hotel bar was unavailable so we were obliged to leave the hotel for 90 minutes to allow time for room to be cleaned.
We were both upset by our experience.
Later that evening, we received a gift from the hotel duty manager with an written apology for what had happened to us earlier.
This was unsolicited, as we had not made a complaint, but it was appreciated.
I like this hotel and would recommend it, but the memory of our unfortunate experience lingers.",4,2014,05,23

The meeting room (boardroom) had natural light, the staff were friendly and courteous, introducing themselves with old fashioned manners, the food and drinks were on time and lunch was delectable. The accommodation was excellent value with funky, spacious rooms and a very comfortable bed. I travel a lot for work and could not fault The Morrison.",5,2014,05,21
237,Fantastic meal,"Decided to treat ourselves to a meal at this beautiful hotel and opted for the more casual seating in the morrison grill which is ajoined to the bar and looking out over river liffey we got ourselves a lovely comfortable seat and the waiting staff arrived with our menus what a hard decision to make as practically everything listed sounded delicious we decided on steaks  medium to well done and they arrived perfect accompanied by a very tasty rosttie and salad  with velvet gravey server from a cow jug and added a little quirkiness to the dish we both cleaned our plates once again  must give a mention to the house wine that is very very tasty  overall we had an absolute wonderful evening food second to none staff on hand constantly to help and so so friendly great buzz going on in the hotel as it seems most popular with  business people and tourist alike well worth a visit and hopefully be back very soon two happy customers x

Right across the bridge from Temple Bar, so you are close but don't get the noise of party central. You can walk to a lot of sights, great restaurants, and pubs. The staff were super friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean and well appointed. The hotel has a boutique-y upscale feel especially compared to other doubletree I've stayed in. Lots of outlets for your computers and PDAs. I enjoyed my nightly nightcaps in the hotel bar to unwind. I would book here again. ",5,2014,05,18

I am constantly on the road for business and this is the best Hilton Hotel I have ever stayed at for business or leisure.  Within walking distance of most major attractions (Tiinity, Temple Bar, River Liffey etc)",5,2014,05,18
237,A very nice place to go,"I spent 5 nights in this very nice hotel which is well located. Just in center city, a few meters from the shops, restaurant and bars. A lot of activities during the evening, however it is always quiet in the rooms.
The personal is very helpful and 200% customer oriented. This is probably the first hotel I've ever seen with such great customer service.",4,2014,05,17
237,Customer service was great,"From arriving at the hotel to leaving we cannot fault the customer service! Reception were friendly, warm cookie on arrival is a lovely touch. We choose to eat in the hotel as it was Good Friday and most restaurants and bars were shut. There was a hiccup with my order, which was fine, mistakes happen, BUT how the hotel, waiter staff and restaurant staff handled the error was impeccable, total credit to the team, they took a bad situation and turned it right. 

Everything about this hotel you would come to expect of a god five star hotel - but the customer service was excellent! 

Well done for getting it right when so many are getting it wrong. ",5,2014,05,15
237,Doubletree Morrison - steps up their game,"Thanks Morrison Doubletree.  A few small issues surfaced but you were kind to listen to my concerns and addressed them.  Special thanks to Night Mgr, PaPa, and Asst GM, Paul.    Great to see a hotel embrace the ""voice of the customer"".",4,2014,05,14
237,Quay 14,"We didn't actually stay in the hotel, this review is just for the bar downstairs Quay 14. As I had to organise a night out for a work group, the staff here were very accomodating and agreed to reserve a table for us, even though we weren't eating in the restaurant. We arrived at 8.30 and were taken to our table and provided with bar nibbles and cocktail menus. The staff really are great, especially when it comes to table service, so we rarely needed to go up to the bar. The cocktails were really outstanding. The Auld Triangle and Mr. Valentine were particularly good, and they even had a good choice of virgin cocktails for our non-drinker. One thing to note is they are quite pricey- we spent an absolute fortune as we were there for 5 hours! The hotel has been done up in the last few years and is much brighter and more inviting than the old Morrisson bar which was very dark and cave-like. Will definitely be back for a work night out!",4,2014,05,14
237,"What a Night at the Morrison - Dublin, Ireland","Overnighted in Dublin on trip back to US. Location is PERFECT, right across from Temple Bar area. Ambience of lower level wonderful, candles all over, purple and while color, staff great. THE PLACE TO STAY! Room/Bed/Bathroom just superior. Planning trip back and will stay here again! Breakfast fantastic! Kudos to Marion and high praise to Piotr who made sure our stay was fantastic!!!",5,2014,05,14
237,Good quality hotel on bank of the river,"Stayed here in April for my partner's birthday having stayed previously a few years ago, I thought I surprise her and go back;
The hotel is exactly as we remembered, in terms of excellent quality and service even down to the welcome cookie which was hot out of the oven when we arrived, great central location between the shops and the nightlife. ",5,2014,05,13
237,Great Hotel,"This hotel is centrally located, loved how easy it was to run right outside along the river.  Additionally, the rooms are clean, very nice and updated.  Very kind staff, and obviously loved the chocolate chip cookies that you come to expect at double tree.

Stay here if you can, it was great!",5,2014,05,12
237,"Super hotel, perfect location, comfortable modern rooms. A great choice","Super hotel. a great choice. Perfect location very quiet but a stones throw from all the action. Lovely comfortable modern rooms. a breath of fresh air. We didn't use room service or have breakfast so can't comment on those but staff friendly and pleasant We had breakfast at great little cafe round corner. 
.",5,2014,05,12
237,Best location for a hotel in Dublin,"Great hotel that has the best location for walking to close tourist attractions in Dublin. Staff couldn't have been more accomodating as we arrived so early from the States - 10:00 a.m. and obviously earlier than their rooms would be ready. They stored our bags, provided us with a complimentary, wonderful and plentiful breakfast buffet so we could recharge. Informed us that they would have our rooms ready by 1:00. However, when we finished with breakfast and were heading out the door to explore, the folks at the main desks called us back to inform us that they had gotten our room prepared and ready for us early. How wonderful was that? Room was clean smelling, fresh and crisp linens and towels and very spacious for European hotels. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,05,12
237,Great hotel by the river,I stayed here for a short trip to Dublin and the hotel was fantastic. The morrison has the feel of a boutique hotel with great service. As a Hilton Diamond member I got upgraded to a junior suite which had a lot of space and nice furnishings. The hotel is very modern with nice common spaces.  The location is great - a short walk to the Temple bar area and right by the the river.,5,2014,05,11
237,Dublin - The Best Location,"Arriving at The Morrison from an early morning flight, we were greeted with a 'Welcome, your room is ready and we have upgraded you'.  That was just the start of a perfect stay in Dublin.  All hotel staff we had contact with were pleasant and helpful.  The room we were upgraded to (2nd floor corner king suite) was beautiful.  Overlooking the Liffey River, the room was modern, clean, spacious, and perfect in every way.  We never had a problem with noise from the street.  The location couldn't have been better - we walked to St Michan's, Jameson Brewery, Christchurch Cathedral, Trinity College, and I could go on and on...  There were no issues with wifi connection.  We also had breakfast included in our room rate.  Cooked to order or from the buffet we tried both during our two night stay - both were great!  The staff in the restaurant were friendly and accommodating.  We are planning a return trip to Ireland and will DEFINITELY be staying at The Morrison.  Thank you to a great start of our vacation.",5,2014,05,11
237,At Home in Dublin at The Morrison Hotel,"From the moment we walked in, we felt welcomed and comfortable. Every person from Paul, Assistant Manager, Patrick, Manager, Adam & Jessica, wait staff and everyone we have encountered, have all made us feel welcomed and taken care of us. 

I travel constantly for work and this hotel is one of the best I have experienced.

Our room is amazing and I love the contemporary decor of the hotel. The food is divine. If we return to Dublin, The Morrison is the only hotel we would visit and I would recommend it for anyone visiting Dublin. What an amazing experience and a great location.",5,2014,05,11
237,"Great hotel, perfect location","We had the pleasure of staying here for two nights. We had a river view room which was lovely, a generous size with contemporary decor and furnishings. The beautiful bathroom was huge with a great tub, perfect for a long soak after walking the streets of Dublin. Breakfast was included and it was very good with the usual buffet selection that you would expect, and some dishes cooked to order. The bar has a nice atmosphere, we didn't have food but can definitely recommend the cocktails! Overall we found The Morrisson to be a fantastic hotel with great staff and the location couldn't be better.",5,2014,05,11
237,4 Night Stay in Dublin - Hilton Property,"Ireland is a fantastic place to see.  We chose Dublin as our home base to visit Ireland.  I am a frequent traveler so I chose a Hilton property to be safe.  The Morrison is a DoubleTree by Hilton.  It is centrally located and worked well fas our home base BUT we experienced so many issues with the hotel.  It was renovated a year ago which is difficult to believe.  Here are just a few of the issues:  1.  Free internet connection option required multiple calls to front desk.  They blamed me not understanding the system; however I travel 90% of the time (including international) and make internet connections from all over the world.  2.  The toilet didn't flush 50% of the time.  They had someone come up to work on it and he said it was working properly.  If you waited an hour, it would finally flush properly.  3.  The sink did not drain well.  It would take 15 minutes for the sink to drain after my husband shaved.  4.  They gave us one bar of soap upon arrival to the room to use for shower and sink.  Subsequent days they left another.  5.  The phone request for ice had to be transferred twice.  

I saved the worst one for last.  6.  I put the ""quiet - do not disturb"" sign on my door so that the staff would not enter my room while my electronics were out.  (iPad, iPhone, PC, Blackberry were all charging)   They entered the room to leave coffee I had requested early that morning.",2,2014,05,10
237,Morrison Dublin,An amazing experience in this newly refurbished hotel. Great central location. Staff very friendly and helpful without being overbearing. Steak in the restaurant is to die for. Wine list short but covered all the main options. Cocktails in the bar worth a look too! Room was first class,5,2014,05,07
237,Great Start!,"This is a wonderful hotel that is in the perfect location in Dublin. It is close enough to the city center that you can walk anywhere, but just far enough so that you do not get all of the noise. The staff was friendly and very helpful. We had to wait for our luggage since it did not make our flight and they were more than accommodating for the things that we needed. We would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in Dublin. It was the best hotel we stayed in our entire trip.",5,2014,05,07
237,Excellent Location Modern Hotel,"I used this hotel for a business trip and stayed at the Morrison for two nights.  The hotel was modern, fresh looking and clean.  The bedroom was a good size, comfortable and had all the amenities I would expect from a modern hotel.  The location was in the centre of town and close to restaurants and shops.  It was right by the river and I believe some rooms have a view of the river.  The room I had only had a view of the side street but that wasn't a problem as I was working all day.  

If I had to criticise anything the main problem I had was the room was too warm for me and the air conditioning didn't seem to make any difference to the room temperature.  To compensate I opened the window which worked although I was woken up a couple of time by noise in the street.    The other minor point was when we were waiting for a taxi to pick us up the front door by reception is where you wait but it is also the place where the smokers hang out.  They should move the bin for the cigarette stubs and encourage smokers from the doors to reception.

Whilst we stayed at the hotel we only ate the breakfast in the hotel but that meal was a good meal and a reasonable price.  They do still provide you with a double tree cookie when you arrive.",5,2014,05,06
237,Quick Stay,"Stayed on a Friday night and checked out Saturday Morning. Beautiful Hotel/excellent facilities/very friendly staff and excellent location. Would highly recommend a stay here as it's on the Liffey,  a few minutes walk to Temple bar/ Grafton Street and O'Connell Street...Brendan.",5,2014,05,06
237,Superb city-centre stay,"My girlfriend and I stayed at The Morrison for three nights and left wishing we could have stayed for longer. The location - overlooking the River Liffey - is very practical. Temple Bar is literally a stone's throw away and one of the city's main streets, O'Connell Street, is just around the corner. The hotel itself is sleek and modern. Rooms are spacious and have been thought through to the very finest detail. We were both welcomed by a man called Paul at reception - he was extremely helpful, outgoing and thorough in ensuring we were entirely satisfied with our stay. Will definitely return to this hotel when we visit Dublin in the future.",5,2014,05,05
237,Good hotel in dublin,"Good hotel in Dublin for familly stay, with connecting rooms. center location close to points of interest by walking. no parking at the hotel but public parking very close. nice breakfast in giant room",4,2014,05,05
237,Big birthday 70 bash,"For our big occasion (70th birthday party) we choose the Morrison. From when our party arrived, we received a warm, friendly welcome and from that moment, we felt like we never had to leave the hotel. The rooms were out of this world, our view from the penthouse suite over the river and Templebar were spectacular. We enjoyed a couple of glasses of champagne on the balcony, what an experience. I'd recommend this hotel to anybody.",5,2014,05,04
237,Best hotel in city centre,"Stayed in the Morrisson on a Sunday night and thought the atmosphere might not be great, I was wrong. The hotel is fabulous since it's renovations, modern, slick and stylish. The staff couldn't be more friendly, and nothing is too much hassle. The bar and restaurant were full with a great crowd but we could still get a table. Food was fab too. One of our party stayed in the penthouse, all I can say is ""oh my god"", it's bigger than our house! I love this hotel and have stayed a number of times but it's now better than ever. Without a doubt the best hotel in the city centre and I highly recommend it. Treat yourself, you won't be disappointed.",5,2014,05,04
237,Nice Hotel - right downtown,"The Morrison is a very nice hotel located right in the downtown area of Dublin, just across the river from the Temple Bar area where you can find anything you would like as a tourist to Dublin.  On my visit (4/27/14-4/28/14), the staff were great to deal with, and even accommodated my bags until the 29th, as I had an apartment booked somewhere else for leisure after working in Dublin.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to see some of the nightlife of Dublin.",4,2014,05,04
237,"Great stay, great service, great location.","I checked in here with my partner for a night and had a memorable experience. 

Check-in was painless and the lady (unfortunately can't remember her name but she had blonde hair) was very helpful.  I even signed up for the Hilton rewards program after her recommendation.  The chocolate cookie was also a nice treat.

The room, on the fourth floor, was spacious and recently re-furbed.  I really liked the decoration and colours.  Might not be to everyones taste though.  The bed was massive and extremely comfy.  

The bathroom was big and the shower was great.  Being on the fourth floor, there was no issues with pressure.

A flat screen TV was in the room with the most common channels, enough to keep you entertained when in the room.  We also had free wifi which was great.  A lot of 4* and 5* hotels tend to charge a small fortune for WiFi so this was very welcomed.

We did find the room a little hot and didn't find the air con (built into the wall) wasn't as efficient as it could be.  But hey, this is Ireland, you don't expect sunshine and warm weather all the time.

Location is great.  North side of the river, directly across from Temple bar (main tourist destination).  Not far to walk to O'Connell street either.

Check out was a little busy because a group of customers had began checking in.  We had to wait about 10 minutes to get seen, but that's understandable.

One issue I did have was my bill.  We checked out fine and paid without any issue.  However I've recently checked my credit card statement and noticed an additional payment.  I contacted the hotel and was told it was for mini bar items, of which we never used.  The hotel was apologetic and advised this would be refunded.  So it was fixed to my satisfaction.",4,2014,05,04
237,Really liked this place,"Enjoyed the room, the bar, and my time in this hotel.  Bathroom a little rusty so would have maintenance focus on that in the near future. Surprised because doubletree has such a wide variety of products.",5,2014,05,02
237,Dublin center of everything,"Recently started a trip to ireland with a few nights stay at the Morrison.  A location right on the Liffy leaves you with walking distance of pretty much everything. With instructions from the desk clerk we found our way on the tram to Kilmainham Gaol, very easily walked from there to Guinness storehouse. Temple bar, the spire, trinity college, st Stephen green all within blocks. The hotel room was very nice, clean, comfortable beds and nice bath. Had a little hiccup on check-in but that was resolved and we were given a room regardless. Would definitely stay here again.",4,2014,05,01
237,Nice stay in Dublin,"We recently stayed 2 nights at the Morrison Doubletree. It was very comfortable and roomy. Excellent location with parking close by. The room decor was a little too modern for me (definitely not the homey feeling we like), but staff and food at the Morrison Grill made up for it!",4,2014,05,01
237,Great location with modern rooms,"The location right on the river Liffey can't be beat.  Step out of the hotel, across the millenium bridge and you are right in the Temple Bar district.  The front of the hotel, however, is NOT on Lower Ormond Quay which is a little misleading.  The front of the hotel is on Jervis Street so watch for it.  If you miss it it's at least a 10 minute drive back around all the one way streets in Dublin.

The rooms are very hip and cool using infused lighting to give color to the white walls.  We enjoyed the view of the river.  As with most hotels in Ireland there isn't air conditioning so you have to open the window to cool off (which can be noisy depending on which way your room faces.  We found the prices for breakfast were steep but there are plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby to choose from.

Parking is less than one block north and one additional block north is the Jervis shopping center which has every shop you would need (Boots, M&S, etc).  I really can't say enough about how great this location is.  It's worth a little extra money.",4,2014,04,30
237,The Wedding Reception,"Along with other members of our family we stayed at this hotel to attend my daughters wedding reception which was also held at this hotel.  In total 9 rooms were booked my our family and 3 rooms by the grooms family.  All enjoyed the experience, with well appointed well furnished rooms, excellent service and very friendly staff.   The location of the hotel is ideally placed for transport to/from the airport with transfer times of 20 minutes, and a short walk of less than 5 minutes to cross the river and be in the heart of Dublin.  The main shopping area of Dublin is less than a 2 minute walk from the hotel. Regarding the reception, the food (and I recommend the slow cooked beef), service, room available was more than sufficient for the 130 attendee's.  The planning and detailed execution of the that plan by the staff was faultless.  Many thanks form the bride's parents.",5,2014,04,30
237,Great stay with river view,"As a HHonors Gold member I was delighted to learn we were eligible to a room upgrade with river view. So our experience was good from the moment of checking in. Other than that, the room is quite well sound-proof, considering it is located in the heart of the city. Very comfortable bed, the average toilet ammenities, very clean and very attentive and friendly staff. My single bad experience was with the internet connection, which needed re-connecting each time. All in all, a great place to stay in Dublin.",4,2014,04,29
237,enjoyable overnight stay,A modern clean hotel situated in the heart of Dublin. Close to all attractions and temple bar district.  Welcoming and friendly staff made our stay a pleasure .  Breakfast good but pricey  plenty of local cafes offering good Irish and continental breakfasts at 1/2 he cost,5,2014,04,29
237,"Great Location, Fab. Hotel","We had friends coming from England to meet us in Dublin for a long awaited catch up. Choosing a hotel to meet our requirement was easy as we have previously stayed at the Morrison before and knew its location.  This time our stay was even better. The staff were excellent, especially the young chap(in the restaurant) who remembered us from our previous stays. Check in was a breeze with nothing being a problem. To sum up this hotel-JUST GO-",5,2014,04,25
237,The Morrison in Dublin,"We recently stayed at the Morrison Hotel in Dublin.It is a fantastic,very cool and modern hotel with a very helpful and professional,friendly staff.We stayed there for three nights in a luxury twin room(upgrade from standard room) and liked it so much that we decided to cancel our room at the Radisson/Airport for the last night in Dublin after our trip to Galway and go back to the Morrison again instead. The hotel location is great,close Temple Bar, only a short walk from Grafton Street, Trinity College etc .Behind the hotel is a LUAS station(it's fun and quick  to use LUAS to get to the docklands, Jameson Destillery, Guiness Storehouse or both train stations,Conolly& Heuston.We once used it for a ride through the suburbs of Dublin.). A nice touch,especially appreciated by my son, is the warm chocolate cookie you receive upon check-in.",5,2014,04,25
237,Elegant,"I stayed there for 1 night. Loved the reception and lobby area. Small but artistic and refreshing. The room was nice and and elegant with minimalistic design. I hoped I could get a better view, of the river perhaps, but my window overlooked another building. Breakfast was good but the place kind of felt too compact and it wasn't as easy to move around. Tiny complaints but the service made up for it. ",4,2014,04,25
237,lovely hotel,"my husband and I stayed at the morrison for our wedding night.. it was closer to venue and really nice hotel with great review in city center... it was lovely, the hotel is really nice, the bar are great with really nice cocktails. how I live in dublin I also can say.. the hotel have perfect location, view, bar and hospitality. I would recommend ...",5,2014,04,24
237,Classy Hotel!,"Decided to spend a few Euro extra and booked the King One Suite overlooking the River Liffey with direct views across to The Temple Bar Area plus side views onto Swift Row and further down the Liffey.Arrived via the restaurant/bar entrance which is directly on the main street rather than the main entrance/reception which is just off the main road and twenty metres down Swift Row but wasn't a problem.Friendly reception staff who gave us two warm cookies on arrival.They asked was there anywhere I wanted to go in Dublin but as I've been twice before I was familiar with the city centre.Ground floor had a modern reception area with ample seating plus the restaurant/bar area which looked classy.
Our room on the 2nd floor was superb.As well as the River Liffey views from four separate windows the room was huge with a tasteful,modern and very comfortable bedroom,a huge modern bathroom with lovely shower,big bath,toilet and two washbasins plus separate living quarters with settee,dining table,large flat screen tv,coffee maker and safe.There was an additional flat screen tv in the bedroom too with ample storage space for clothes.The location was very good within walking distance to The Temple Bar area for the pubs and restaurants,Grafton Street for the shops and O'Connell Street where the historic Post Office is located.The room was more expensive than I would normally pay but I think it was worthwhile for the huge and comfortable room with terrific views across The River Liffey.Overall a most enjoyable stay.",4,2014,04,23
237,Lovely Hotel,"Staff were extremely helpful not only with our hotel queries, but advised us on places to eat/drink and marked locations on a map for us, to make navigating around the city much easier.  Great Service!",5,2014,04,22
237,Does not live up to the description,"When booking this hotel, we had high expectations, since the hotel seemed trendy and hip online. The lobby lived up to this expectation, but that was where it ended. The rooms are fine, but not as nice as they're made to appear online. There's also a reason they don't show images of the bathrooms. They don't appear to have been renovated. The staff were also fine; not overly helpful and friendly, but not rude either. The ""free"" wifi wasn't very good. Don't expect to be able to do more than check email or read a few news articles. Compared to other hotels in the area, this one was definitely a little more expensive and not worth it in the end.",3,2014,04,21
237,"Comfortable, relaxed, great location","The hotel was ideally located, far enough away from the centre that it was calm but still within comfortable walking distance. Staff were very helpful, gave you a nice welcome treat upon checkin. Case in point a friend dropped off a food treat for me and they diligently kept it in the fridge. Rooms were large and comfortable with good sized bathrooms. The rooms felt sleek and contemporary, purples, glass etc. I stayed here with a group for a special occasion and they did a great job, food was of a high standard at the restaurant.",4,2014,04,21
237,"Great location, very good hotel","I was in Ireland for work and since Easter was in the middle there was a long 4 day weekend so I decided to go to Dublin and I chose the Merrion hotel. It turned out to be a very good choice. It is just across the river from the Temple bar area (1 block equ.) most of the city's main attractions are within walkable distance and so are many transportation options (airport coaches, tours, other cities, etc). 
The rooms are nice good sized, comfortable, clean and very quiet. They told Mr there was going to be an event two floors down and that there might be noise so they offered to change the room, I could barely heart it.  The restaurant is OK and all the waiters are very attentive. The bar is excellent.  I will definitely stay there when in Dublin.",4,2014,04,21
237,Great Location!,"This Hilton property is perfectly situated in Town Centre with easy access to all of the main attractions.  My husband and I walked everywhere from Trinity College to the Gaol and all sites between.  The hotel is modern and clean.  Every staff member was professional and very helpful. I would recommend a room not over looking the main street as there is a lot activity during the night (sirens, people, etc.).  Skip the view for a quieter setting.  Loved our room even with the nightly noise!",5,2014,04,17
237,First Class Experience,"I had the distinct pleasure of spending 4 nights at the Morrison. It's location is near the Temple Bar, Trinity College and many other attractions.
The restaurant and bar are very nice and the breakfasts had everything you could ask for.
The staff went out of their way to make me feel at home!",5,2014,04,17
237,"lovely hotel, well situated","Hotel is situated by the side of the River Liffey and directly across from the Temple Bar. It is well maintained, very clean and for the most part has wonderfully courteous, helpful staff. Breakfast choices were very good (if somewhat pricey) but ensure you stick to either Irish breakfast or continental otherwise like me you may find yourself being 'told off'. With the exception of the one lady 'on guard' at breakfast my stay at this hotel was very pleasant. Attractions such as Jeanie Johnston Famine Ship & Jameson distillery are approximately 15 minutes walk away. Leprechaun museum was 5 minutes away on the next block. We took taxis to the Guiness Storehouse and Kilmainham Gaol.",5,2014,04,16
237,"nice hotel, watch out for the gestapo.","I went here on a quick trip with my parents for my mother's birthday and was pleasantly surprised by quite how well situated the hotel is. It's right on the quay by the river Liffey and close enough to the Temple Bar to be convenient without the usual noise of the place (though it's worth a visit if you head off to Dublin, just be wary of the prices!). My one and only problem was the woman at breakfast. When you go to breakfast in the restaurant, you tell them your room number and whether  you'll have an Irish (€18) or Continental (€12) breakfast. Though it was expensive, with being new to the area, it was easier getting breakfast here to begin with. The food was lovely and all of the staff were exceptionally nice other than the woman who took it upon herself to be the hotel's gestapo. On the first day at breakfast, we got breakfast. I had the continental breakfast while my parents both opted for an Irish breakfast. However, I had the audacity to sample something from my mother's plate... well, I might as well have kicked a puppy the reaction we got. This woman watched us the whole time we were at breakfast (in an extremely unnerving way, might I add) and the next day when we went, we were patronised and told that we would be charged extra if we ordered the continental breakfast but had anything from the Irish breakfast! Two things to point out: 1) I have NEVER known a single sausage to equate to an extra €6 on a tab and 2) the two different breakfasts ARE NOT SIGNPOSTED. There is no information as to what is and isn't included in either breakfast. Other people had sampled pieces of both, and I'd honestly love to know if anyone else was subject to this scrutiny. Overall, the hotel is lovely bar the experience in the restaurant which means any return trips to Dublin will not involve breakfasting at the hotel. With a reputation such as it has, I don't expect to be spoken down to over a single sausage. Then again, I suppose there's always one member of staff who fancies themselves as authoritarian.",4,2014,04,16
237,Luxury hotel in prime location,"I booked this hotel as an accident through a ""secret hotel"" link from a hotel search engine. 

Not knowing much about I was surprised to see it was so louxurious and in IMHO the best location in Dublin for everything. It was close to O'Connell St and Grafton St and just across the river Liffy from Temple bar where all the pubs are.

Rooms are ultra modern and has the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in.

Will definetly return!",5,2014,04,15
237,A Very Contemporary Hotel,"We spent two nights at the Morrison while we were vacationing in Ireland.  The lobby is very open and decorated in a very contemporary manner.  We found the hotel staff friendly and helpful and, a warm cookie at check-in is always a treat.  The front desk staff called a large taxi for the four of us when we departed for the train station.  

We found a couple of things rather tricky to get used to.  Not the hotel's fault at all, but our taxi driver left us off at the wrong entrance to the hotel, so we had to carry/drag our suitcases down a flight of stairs to get to the lobby.  So if you arrive by taxi, be sure you're dropped off at the Jervis Street entrance to the hotel.  In order to operate the elevators, you must use your room card.  I really appreciated this safety feature, but some times the card was a little bit tricky to use.  You also had to ""plug in"" your room card in the room in order for the room lights, etc. to work.  It was intriguing to try to discover which switches went with which lights.  I'm sure if we had stayed longer, we would have had it all soon  figured out.

Our modern, teal accented room was on the 4th floor and overlooked a small courtyard about three floors below us.  It was away from the elevators and very quiet and clean with a comfortable king sized bed.  If we were going to stay more than a couple of days, I would have liked a little more closet space.

The hotel has a good location.  It is located across the river from Temple Bar.  One morning we walked over the Ha'Penny Bridge to Trinity College.  It was an easy, interesting walk through Temple Bar.  The hop-on-hop-off bus stop and other public transportation are just a few blocks away.  There is a large shopping mall nearby as well as a variety of restaurants.

We appreciated the uniqueness of this hotel and would recommend it.",5,2014,04,12
237,Excellent experience at this hotel!,"We had an excellent experience at the Morrison, staying there for three nights in total.

It has a great location - right across the street from Temple Bar, and close to the other main shopping streets. There are some small cafes and restaurants really close by, so it's easy to grab something there if you run out of time.

The hotel was modern and we had absolutely no issues with our room. We had an upgrade, and it was very spacious. The beds were comfortable and there was a softer pillow in the closet when we asked for one. 

Our room was facing the street, so the traffic was a bit loud early in the morning and woke us up, actually - that was the one minor downside. 

The breakfast was good as well, though I could have sworn I saw on the website it cost 15 euros (actual cost was 18). 

Service was excellent - everyone was friendly and helpful. The reception staff helped us book a rental car, gave us a list of tourist attractions, etc.

Lastly - it had the most amazing (and almost soundproof) shower!",5,2014,04,10
237,Dublin Vacation,"The location of this hotel is excellent -- close enough to several great tourist attractions yet far enough away to be quiet.  The Morrison is within easy walking distance for the Temple Bar area (a must visit), bus stops for in-city and out-of-city tours, restaurants, and many great tourists attractions.  The staff was very helpful both with check-in/check-out as well as booking excursions.  The rooms were comfortable and quite clean.  I booked this hotel through my vacation points so can't really comment on the price of the rooms.  For the points that I had to use the value was well worth what I had to spend.  Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,04,09
237,Very poor quality for the price,"This hotel has been modernized to its peril.  The rooms have ultra modern furnishings and décor that have cheapened the experience.  There was a leak in the roof over my bath which left a dripping brown stain in the bath.  There was no separate shower which one would expect at a 4* hotel within this cost range.  The bathroom toiletries were cheap and the room/bathroom was small for a double room. The bar is disjointed, lacks character and comfort thought the food was quite good.  Overall, my stay at this hotel was a great disappointment and at the prices being charged I will not be staying there again.  There are far better hotels in Dublin within this price range that have much more to offer in comfort, facilities and overall experience.",3,2014,04,08
237,"A lovely Hotel, cannot fault.....","I stayed at the Morrison for four nights a couple of weeks ago, and I have to say that this Hotel is very impressive. I had an executive king room, which was very large, well equipped and extremely comfortable. I should also mention the quality bathroom, especially the shower which was one of the best I've been in! The power from such a small shower head was amazing! The breakfast is one of the best I've had with a comprehensive selection that includes pretty much everything, the quality is exceptional. The location of the Morrison is a big bonus too. Overall, this Hotel just smacks of quality and efficiency, so would get the nod from me as the best I've stayed in in Dublin so far.",5,2014,04,08
237,Gorgeous! But Noisy :(,"I came to Dublin for a long weekend with a friend. The hotel is around 25 minutes away from the airport and on the River Liffey (North Side). We checked in and the staff were helpful and gave us a map of the town, recommending places to go. We received our obligatory cookie :) which was lovely and warm. We were at the back of the hotel.

The pros...

The room/hotel was gorgeous! Nice big king bed, spacious bathroom, free bottles of water replaced daily. The location was spot on. A three minute (if that) walk to Temple Bar and about a 5/10 minute walk up to Trinity College, O'Connoll Street and Grafton Street and a 20 minute walk up to the Guniess Factory. Perfect location! Restaurants everywhere (spoilt for choice though which makes it difficult). We did not have breakfast nor dinner here as it was quite pricey (to be expected at this type of hotel) but there are plenty of places around. 

The cons...

Noisy! First night was crazy. I actually thought the windows were not double glazed or there was a hole in the sealing of the windows because you could hear EVERYTHING outside. We had a terrible night's sleep as a result. The next night was better but simply because I think we were exhausted from the night before. As the weekend approached you could hear more noise from the corridors. You could hear the doors closing (slamming) and conversations. There is a half cm gap between the floor and the door which I think was purely the reason for this. Seal this and it the noise would be reduced dramatically. 

Check out was simple and smooth. We had a late night flight and were able to leave our luggage at the hotel and continue with our day. We came back a bit early and sat in the lobby. The hotel gave us a wifi voucher as we waited and order a taxi for us.

I'd want to stay again but the noise really did put me off as I wanted a good sleep. Other than that, the staff were great as was location. We got a fantastic deal for the hotel we got.",4,2014,04,07
237,"Lovely hotel, good location, a few minor glitches which the reception staff tried to ignore","We had a few problems at first, the room heating didn't work also after asking the ambivalent reception staff for some herbal tea bags room service sent up a bowl of dried leaves, no tea pot or strainer. However these problems were quickly sorted out by the efficient manager who upgraded us to a full suite had room service bring a pot of herbal tea and paid for breakfast! 
The hotel is very comfortable with a nice lounge area, the rooms have pleasant modern decor. The breakfasts are the usual excellent Hilton standard, good selection, hot and cold buffet style, eat as much as you like. Included in the price is a separate special order menu for things like eggs benedict. The hotel is close to the centre of Dublin just a short walk over the river Liffey. To avoid expensive taxi fairs get the number 700 Aircoach service from the airport to O Connell street 12 euros return. O Connell street is a 10-15 min walk to the Hilton on Lower Ormond Quay.

237,Luxury at it's best!!,Myself and my girlfriend stayed here for 4 nights last week and have to say what an amazing hotel this is! From the minute we checked in right through to checking out the staff at the Morrison are fab. So friendly and nothing was ever any trouble.  The breakfast is the nicest we have had anywhere and really sets you up for the day. We ate in the bar one night and had fish & chips and it was so tasty. I love gin and tonic and the selection of gin here is unreal. The rooms are so bright and modern and so comfortable.  A special thanks to Patrick the General manager for making our few days memorable ones and to the young man and girl who served us in the dining room each morning at breakfast. We would highly recommend this hotel to everyone. Not a single bad thing to say about this place. ...all was excellent! ! We will definitely be back again (hopefully really soon) thanks again.  Vinny & Tracey,5,2014,04,04
237,Nice Hotel & Great Location,"The rooms are clean and modern.  The restaurant is very good, also nice bar for drinks later.  The staff is extremely helpful & courteous.  They will find restaurants for you, print out the menus, make the reservation, and get you a cab!  The location is perfect because you can cross the street and walk over the bridge to the Temple Bar district.  Also, behind the hotel a few blocks back, is The Church restaurant, which is awesome.  Great experience.",5,2014,04,03
237,Marvelous Morrison,"I had the pleasure of staying at The Morrison recently on a business trip to Dublin and although not directly responsible for making my travel arrangements - I am so pleased that they chose this Hotel!  Wow what a find!  This was a business trip and was ideally based for my meetings over the last three days in the city. 

The Morrison is actually part of the Hilton group which is not apparent on first glance not that causes any issues - if fact quite the opposite – it’s good to know there is a big brand behind this property.  If fact it becomes quite clear, quite quickly that the big brand / corporate style is not apparent and that this “home away from home” is a boutique, fresh modern Hotel with all the feeling of a local Dublin Hotel offering that warm customer service we come to expect from Ireland.  Paul on front desk was a shining example of this hospitality and certainly deserves a mention. 

Room - clean, light, airy, modern, big range on the toiletries that don't strip your skin off!  Had room service dinner all nights which on average delivered in 20 minutes - try the steak baguette its wonderful – all dishes of a good quality and hot (so often they arrive lukewarm after a 40 minute wait).

Not being a breakfast person I cannot comment but did use the gym each night – good range of CV equipment and weights if you like that sort of thing and certainly not a “gym” in some Hotels which is a broom cupboard they cannot do anything with – housing a single exercise bike. 

I will be back to this Hotel, if not booked via my company then certainly for pleasure.",5,2014,04,03
237,Morrison Hotel,"Excellent hotel,luxurious, clean , in the midst of the buzz that is Dublin, close to restaurants, shops, great value, staff very helpful, loved the idea of getting a delicious cookie at check in.Room very comfortable",5,2014,04,02
237,Beautifully Redone and Well Located,"We stayed at the Morrison for 1 night last month at the end of our short Spring Break vacation to Ireland.  Although we were not in Dublin or at the Morrison long, we especially enjoyed our visit, including the hotel.  The room was clean and well decorated with comfortable bedding and linen.  The room had a modern look and lighting.  Great TV too.  Bathroom was nice and comfortable.  We didn't do much else at the hotel and spend our time out on the town.  The hotel is right on the river about a block down from the Ha Penny Bridge.  Lots of shopping just north of the hotel and all of the downtown tourist sites in Dublin are very nearby.  This was a great hotel choice for us.  We really enjoyed it.  Thank you.",5,2014,04,01
237,"Great service, location, rooms","The Morrison is located very near the Temple Bar area and close to a hop on, hop off bus tour pick up and drop off site.  
The rooms are spacious, the bathrooms large, the amenities very nice. The bed linens were great, and the bath towels were large and soft. 
The staff were all very friendly. Breakfast was excellent.  
One complaint were the fire doors. They were closed at night and when anyone went through them, they banged shut quite loudly, so we heard that many times each night. Otherwise, there was no noise at all. 
Parking was tricky -- the lot next door didn't open before we had to leave for our flight, so we had to find a spot on the street to park the night before we left. 
I would stay here again.",4,2014,04,01
237,Morrison is a Doubletree-but don't be fooled.,"The Morrison in Dublin is now a Doubletree, but don't let this stop you from booking.  It's not a typical Doubletree as in the USA.  This property is nicely updated with efficient and friendly staff.  Breakfast was simple, but good and included some ala carte menu items.  The bar at night is a nice hang.",5,2014,04,01
237,"Clean, Pretty Hotel with an Attitude","This is a very nice hotel...but the customer service, for a very friendly Ireland, was a serious disappointment. I try not to complain about stuff like this because I don't like to effect jobs. However, every time you asked a question, staff would roll their eyes or sigh. It was really obnoxious. Although I liked the hotel cleanliness and the rooms, I don't know if I would come back because it was so rude. It was like we were annoying them- when we just needed to check in and get a little information. Staff in the early morning-totally fine- very sweet and helpful.",3,2014,04,01
237,Super Cool Hotel & Great Location,"Super cool hotel with up to the minute styling, really comfy beds, showers are really invigorating and bathrooms really clean. We stayed in the super huge suite on the top floor with dining room and sunken huge bath, great experience for us as couples and a chance to chill out after partying in Dublin. Service good, food good but for the same price you can eat in some amazing Dublin restaurants. Room service munchies are very good. Perfect location too.",5,2014,03,31
237,You pay for location (which is outstanding…),"We spent two nights at this hotel for the St. Patrick's Day Festival. The location simply couldn't have been better as you are in the heart of the city, across the street/river from Temple Bar, and within walking distance of so many attractions, shopping, and restaurants it is ridiculous! That being said, the hotel has a rather steep price tag. Parking was a bit tricky and not complimentary, although hotel guests do get a reduced rate. The front desk staff was helpful but not overly friendly. My favorite interaction with them was when we checked in and received our complimentary cookie (it was delicious). The room was modern and clean, but not striking. We were surprised to find that the bathtub/shower seemed to be the only part of the room that hadn't been renovated, and it was cracked and worn. The fitness area was nice to have, although it was a bit cramped and awkwardly placed (you can't use one of the machines properly because some railing is in the way). There was quite a bit of noise in the room which we expected due to the holiday and location, but it was still a bit frustrating. The biggest disappointment of all was the hotel breakfast. At 18 euro we expected more than a few hot items, bread, a small selection of yogurt and fruit. The selection was very limited and was not particularly tasty. This was very surprising given the incredible breakfasts we experienced at other hotels in Ireland. The second morning we were there we dined at a cafe across the street and were much happier. We didn't try the hotel restaurant for lunch or dinner and you probably don't need to because there are so many good quality places to eat within walking distance. We had a wonderful time in Dublin and celebrating St. Patrick's Day, but were not very impressed with The Morrison hotel. Although the rooms and grounds are modern and clean, we simply couldn't find anything about the hotel that justifies the price (save for the location).",3,2014,03,31
237,"Clean, central, walk to Temple Bar","Very centrally located on the river and walk to Temple Bar district and Dublin Castle. Stayed on St Patricks Day so quite crazy in the area but very upmarket and classy hotel and bar. Extremely friendly staff and very helpful and fun. Left some clothes there by accident and they held onto them for me for collection. A little pricey for the night I stayed but it was St Patricks Day so, so was everywhere. Secure parking behind hotel on the next block at a discounted rate of €10 a night. I'd definitely stay again just for location and cleanliness.",5,2014,03,30
237,Good location but noisy!,"Although the location of this hotel was very good, the staff was cool and indifferent and the noise level was ridiculous!  We expected street noise due to it's central location, but doors slamming all night long was beyond acceptable for the price of this property.  Guests in the hall might as well have been in our room....we could clearly hear their conversation.  Decor was tacky-contemporary.  ",2,2014,03,29
237,Grand Hotel in the heart of Dublin,"An awesome hotel right where you need it.  Located near great pubs, restaurants, and historical sites.  The hotel was recently refurbished, so it's clean and contemporary.  And, WIFI internet was free?  My only complaint was the ""rain drop"" shower heads were pretty weak on water pressure.  The hotel's restaurant and bar were outstanding as well.  The staff was very friendly and helpful with advice on local attractions and other things to do.  I will stay here next year when I come back for leisure.",5,2014,03,29
237,"St. Patrick's Weekend; Dublin, centre of the universe...","We decided to treat ourselves and overnight in The Morrison Hotel over the recent St. Patrick's Weekend and were overall very happy with our stay.

We checked in on Sunday (16 March 2014) for a one-night stay. Stephen checked us in and his welcome was warm but slightly robotic as if he was delivering a well rehearsed script. We arrived shortly before 3pm and told that our room would not be available until after 3pm ""in keeping with international norms"" but they would look after our bags if we wanted to go shopping (which we did). We were offered warm homemade cookies and when we arrived back to the hotel at about 5pm we were told that our bags had been taken to our room (which was a nice touch).

The style of the room was what I was describe as 'boutique' with a nice crisp masculine and modern feel. I was slightly disappointed that despite the fact that the hotel in on the quays that our room did not overlook the river. The room was fine but unfortunately it wasn't a 'room with a view'. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was large.

Our rate included breakfast so on Monday morning (St. Patrick's Day) we came down to a very warm welcome from the breakfast room manager. Unfortunately (despite the fact that the breakfast room wasn't busy all of the tables were full of clutter and we had to clear a table that we could use). we had to look around to see if we could find cutlery, milk jug, napkins etc. There was one young girl working the floor who looked completely out of her depth and was only able to clear from a table what she could carry in her hands (she clearly didn't have a tray and certainly didn't have a system). Another server appeared on the scene but his presence didn't improve the situation as I saw hotel guests arriving after us having to clear tables in order to have breakfast. We ordered Eggs Benedict and it was very tasty.

When we finished our breakfast the breakfast room manager suggested that we take some fresh fruit, coffee and cookies with us to use during the day - this was a VERY nice touch and VERY MUCH appreciated. Check out was uneventful. Overall our stay was enjoyable and because of the location of The Morrison Hotel in the heart of the city centre it was the perfect location for St. Patrick's Weekend - especially when Dublin becomes the centre of the universe...",4,2014,03,28
237,"lovely room, lovely atmosphere, but occasional lapses in service:","lovely room, lovely atmosphere, but occasional lapses in service:   we had to clean our table in the bar/cafe for example, and wait a long time for service. service was then friendly but inaccurate.  the heat in the room was not working when we arrived. It was quickly dealt with in a very pleasant manner, but it still cost us a bit of hassle in what was always a very short stay.  checkout was efficient.",4,2014,03,27
237,"Beautiful, modern hotel in excellent location","Spent 2 nights in this hotel - it's in an excellent central location, near shopping area and just over the river from Temple Bar. Modern, quirky decor, comfy bed, pillows not the best....

On the downside - difficult loo to flush, lacking hooks in bathroom",4,2014,03,26

237,Surprised in Ireland,"Upon arrival found out there is no FREE parking so we took the rental car back, area is not what I would call warm and fuzzy. Got to our room and there were purple lights highlighting the room. I thought we made a mistake and checked the bed to see if it was going to vibrate, it did not thank god. Only had one wash cloth to use and the air conditioner did not cool the room.",2,2014,03,25
237,Great Location,"We loved the location of this hotel, just across the river from Temple Bar and many other great places to visit.

237,Terrible Restaurant Service!!,"I arrived at the Morrison at 9.30pm after travelling for much of the early evening. I checked in and went straight to the bar/restaurant for some much needed refuelling. I sat at the bar and ordered food and drink but was instantly deterred by the draft from the main door that was only a few feet away, I moved but could still feel the draft and more off putting smell the stale smoke from outside. I ordered ribeye steak, medium rare, fries and 2x pepper sauce....after the third attempt this combination was eventually delivered correctly....I complained at each failed attempt and eventually received my bill with 50% of the food removed.... no apology was given by either the manager or the stern faced waitress....in fact she seemed more intent on setting the tables for the following morning!! All in all absolutley terrible service....I will not return!! In fact wish me luck because im going to complain about my bill!!",1,2014,03,18
237,Awesome Hotel...just bring ear plugs,The hotel is very modern with huge rooms that are very well appointed. Problem is the noise. I was on the 1st floor with a room that was facing the rear street. I could clearly hear all of the road noise from the street. ,3,2014,03,18

It's the perfect location in town close to the O2 and the luas was right behind the hotel for easy access.  We had drinks in the bar after and the service was excellent.  Breakfast was also excellent... We really like this hotel.",5,2014,03,18
237,Convenient location. Clean hotel!,"We stayed at The Morrison over St Paddy's day and have nothing but good things to say about the hotel. We arrived on an early flight and they allowed us to check in at 10am, which we hadn't asked for ahead of time. We were staying for 5 nights and the rooms were very clean and comfortable. The hotel is very contemporary/modern. 

Best part is the location. We walked several different directions and everything was very convenient. You can jump on the train or walk to most of the tourist attractions. It's also very close to the bars so its a close walk at the end of the night. 

Breakfast is included for Diamond members and they also dropped off welcome snacks with a welcome letter the first night. ",4,2014,03,17
237,Glad we stayed here!,"This is a lovely hotel (and not my wife's first stay in a Doubletree).  I upgraded our room to a suite as a special treat for us and was both surprised and pleased when we were given the Penthouse suite for our 4 day stay!  Negatives:  wifi in room and satellite feed to TV in lounge area was sporadic and finally stopped working on 3rd day - the manager did attend and whatever he did worked for a while but as we really weren't there to watch TV - we let it go and advised the lovely lady at reception on our departure. On our first night (7 March) we ate in the restaurant and at first the service was really good until what seemed like four 'VIP' diners arrived and staffed fussed around them forgetting that there were other diners - we had to wait ages for our bill and just as we were about to leave and go to reception one of the waitresses finally came over! As you choose where to sit for breakfast - if the waiting staff are not around, you may wait ages for your coffee/tea. That said there are many positives - the suite was a lovely surprise and a beautiful room! Very comfortable bed! Clean room and facilities (my wife is quite 'particular' and even she commented on how immaculate the hotel was) Hotel reception staff were brilliant and very knowledgeable - all their suggestions of what to do and where to go were spot on! Very good location and walking distance to most sightseeing venues! Hotel was really quiet - my wife is a light sleeper and said that it was ranked high in terms of some her best night's sleep. Nothing was too much trouble for the reception staff and when we asked for a late check-out - the request was easily granted. To summarise: breakfast service - bit patchy; restaurant service - ok but could do better; reception staff - brilliant and very friendly; hotel and cleanliness - brilliant! We were able to overlook the 'negatives' because the 'positives' outweighed them. Overall it was a very good stay! Will return if we get the chance.",4,2014,03,15

237,Lovely Overnight Stay,"Stayed for just one night in this wonderful hotel, it was just a pity we weren't staying for longer.  The hotel is spotless clean and the rooms are beautifully decorated.    Staff were very friendly, had a bit of a hic up as we asked on booking in if we needed to reserve a table for something to eat and we were told we didn't.  Came back from the Rugby match, showered and changed and two very hungry people were told we needed a reservation for dinner and they could not seat us.  My only conclusion is that maybe the receptionist may have taught I meant lunch.    Besides this small matter, I couldn't fault the hotel and am looking forward to going back.",5,2014,03,13
237,Great hotel !! ,"Me and my boyfriend stayed here on Saturday night. We were delighted with the hotel , on arrival we were welcomed with home made cookies and are bags were brought up to our bedroom. Thought the room was gorgeous and the bed was huge !! The location is excellent , def a major bonus as really close to Jervis :) my only point against it would be the price , thought it was pricey and what we paid didn't include breakfast so we had to pay extra . ",4,2014,03,12
237,Just a few finer points...and I would mark it excellent.,Heard this hotel had been modernised and had some money spent on it. That is very apparant in the rooms and public areas. Ate in therestaurant where the food was a bit average considering the charge. The service was however very good at dinner. My moan would be that the hotel bedroom doors do not have soft closers so everyone who arrives late or leaves early has there door banging. If you are a light sleeper it will wake you.,4,2014,03,11
237,7-9 March 2014,"Wonderful hotel in a superb location facing the river. The rooms are lovely and well designed - bed huge and very snug. Came equipped with huge tv and fee wifi. Very impressed by a member of staff called ""Kerry"" who went that extra mile to help us. She especially went home to get her hot water bottle for myself to borrow, as the hotel did not have any and then delivered to our room when I was unwell on the second night. Complimentary warm cookies on arrival very good . The bathroom water pressure was not great, though minor issue.

237,Service & Style with some street side noise,"We loved the location of this hotel, the staff and the modern style and furnishings.  The bar was nice and quiet compared to Temple Bar scene and though we didn't eat at the hotel the menu looked great.  Our only concern was the noise form the street during the early morning.  Our window faced the river - though we couldn't see it from our view - and the busy street noise worked its way into our room and woke us up earlier than we would have liked.  This is a small complaint - as there are rooms you can get on the opposite side of the hotel, which if we had gotten, would have made this a perfect stay.",4,2014,03,10

237,Excellent hotel,The front desk staff was very attentive and professional. The breakfast and lunch crew was outstanding very personable and welcoming. It was the best part of my experience there.  The hotel is very well located near all the activities in Dublin.,5,2014,03,10
237,Great location,"This hotel is in a GREAT location on the River Liffey just across from the Temple Bar area of Dublin, which is why we chose it (that, and it's a Hilton, so we could take advantage of our Hilton perks). We stayed for two nights and were glad to be within walking distance of pubs and other attractions. Service was really great. We had some trouble with the parking garage down the street (attendant was MIA), and the lady at reception went out of her way to help us...walked down to Jervis St. carpark and phoned the company to get the attendant there so we could get our car out for the day.

Breakfast buffet was a bit of a disappointment. It had the components of a Full Irish, which was nice, but the eggs weren't very good quality (food service tasting) and the black pudding had a really gamey taste to it (it was either overcooked and/or sitting around in a chafing dish too long). There were plenty of options, though, including the typical continental breakfast fare. LOTS of bread selections, which was nice. My husband ordered an omelette and also said the eggs were kind of food-service tasting.

Our room had a fantastic view out over the Liffey and the bed was comfortable (king). The room was smallish, which is typical for a city hotel. The shower, though, had very little water pressure and hardly ever got above ""warm."" I don't know if it was because we were on the 4th floor or because our first shower experience was in the afternoon, but it was a bit let down. After traveling for over 14 hours overseas (with a hefty layover in the 'pleasant' airport in Paris), we just wanted to relax with a nice HOT shower. Oh well. That was the biggest drawback to this otherwise nice (and posh) hotel.",4,2014,03,07
237,Fantastic Hotel,The last time I stayed at The Morrison was over 4 years ago. Stayed there recently and could not believe the difference. Really modern and funky decor and atmosphere and of course a superb location in the heart of Dublin. The rooms are really well designed with really comfortable beds and the breakfast was delicious. Would highly recommend and look forward to staying at The Morrison again.,5,2014,03,07
237,"Excellent Decor, comfortable bed","I thought overall the hotel was great. The service was a bit off. The restaurant was understaffed the 3 times I went to dinner there. The breakfast staff and food on the other hand was amazing.  I can't understand why there was not an electrical outlet in close vicinity of a mirror. The bathroom outlet was for razors only, this meant that I had to blindly blow dry my hair. That was a huge inconvenience for me.  The bed was very comfortable, a huge plus for a road warrior. The hotel was immaculate. I noticed that the staff was under pressure for the most part and it seemed like a staffing issue.",4,2014,03,06
237,Great location,"I love this hotel, my place to stay while in Dublin. Excellent location, and within a short distance to everything. It is about 15 minutes or so from the airport via taxi or about 25-30 minutes via Airbus 747 service. You wont go wrong here.",5,2014,03,06
237,double tree,"Maybe arrange a deal with nearby car park as it makes the stay expensive. The rooms and attention to detail is excellent, the bar area and food were top class, staff were very helpful and very friendly, the hotel is very stylish and modern",4,2014,03,05
237,Very well located,"The hotel is quite well located, walking distance from the Temple Bar, O'Conell st., it's shops, the mall, banks, etc. They also offer a quite good breakfast, and the staff is friendly and willing to help. The internet works fine and the warm cookies offered on your check in is a plus ❤️. The restaurant at the hotel is all right too...if you get a room in front of the river you will have a wonderful view. I would certainly stay there again.",5,2014,03,04
237,"Great hotel, fabulous location!","First of all, the reception staff were courteous and professional and treated us to warm cookies--definitely the way to my heart!  I love a good first impression.  My husband and I chose the hotel because of the location and it was so perfect...walking distance to all of the action.   The room was extremely comfortable and beautifully designed, very pleasing to the eyes.  We would stay at the Morrison again, for sure.",5,2014,02,28
237,Quick trip to Ireland,"We make long weekend trips to Dublin from time to time. This hotel in right in the middle of what you would want to see and do on a short trip like this. We walked everywhere, didn't need a car while here, made life simple.",5,2014,02,26
237,"Good value, excellent service","Check in really good, room was not ready as we were checking in early so they just upgraded us (possibly to do with HHonors Diamond) though to a Suite, which was nice and big, clean and with new features, like the fact they have plugs by the bedside for charging the phone overnight for example. Breakfast was really good indeed, staying here again since they changed it from a John Rocha styled hotel has in my opinion improved it as it is less ""dark"". Bedroom and bathroom all done nicely and the bed was nice and big and comfortable. 3 minute walk to Temple Bar, 10 minute walk to Grafton Street, 3 minute walk also to O'Connoll Street as well.",4,2014,02,26
237,excellent,"stayed here 22 feb 2014
upon arrival the staff were very pleasant and friendly, fresh warm cookies when checking in were just the ticket and the start of a totally great hotel stay. the whole place is very modern and contemporary  with song lyrics in the lift and on the wall in my room. comfy bed and pillows, mellow lighting, mini bar, complimentary bottled water, central location its all here. this hotel ticked all my boxes so much so i have signed up for the hilton honors loyalty scheme. i will definitely be returning to this hotel.",5,2014,02,23
237,Very impressed,"We stayed here for two nights and very much enjoyed the stay.  The warm cookies on arrival were a nice touch. The reception was very modern and our room was on the third floor overlooking a garden.  Even though it was close to the Temple Bar pubs, etc we weren't disturbed by noise. The room was very comfortable with purple lighting, a big bed and good facilities. I would definitely recommend this hotel and the restaurant - they do a delicious bloody mary!",5,2014,02,17
237,Amazing Experience x,"From start to fininsh I could not fault our stay. My finance got a nights stay as a surprise for us for valentines weekend. From when we entered  the hotel to when we left the staff were amazing. We were given a warm cookie on arrival (compliments of the hotel), complimentary bottles of water in the room. It's like they thought of everything...robes & slippers in the wardrobes. The staff at each stage were nothing but helpful. The breakfast the next morning....AMAZING. The choice was endless with omlettes, eggs benedict and pancakes (to mention just a few) all cooked fresh & made to order. There was something for everyone. Hotel very centrally located. Would highly recommend the hotel and will most definitely be back.",5,2014,02,17
237,Love at first bite!,".... First bite of our chocolate cookie! Staff were really helpful and friendly. The rooms are stunning modern, attractive, and have all the mod cons you require. Perfectly located for everything you'd need in Dublin including Temple Bar and the shopping district! Only downside is that the room faced onto a main road and it was a tad noisy but nothing too bad. Would stay again!
",5,2014,02,16
237,Looks are deceiving ,"When we arrived at the hotel we looked at the outside and thought oh dear! However as soon as we got inside we completely changed our opinions. Inside the hotel staff are very friendly and helpful, the reception and whole of the hotel are spotless. Most rooms have been recently renovated and are very modern.
Overall we were very impressed, don't let the outside appearance put you off ",4,2014,02,15
237,Great location for walking about,"This location is great.  Close to shopping, close to temple bar, a short walk to Guinness and janesons, the castle and the cathedral, can't beat it.  The staff is friendly and helpful, music in the bar on some nights.  The only drawback is the breakfast eggs either runny or overlooked omelette.  ",5,2014,02,15
237,"Great Location, Great Food, Lovely Staff","We booked the Morrison for the Ireland v Wales Rugby game. The rooms, food and staff were great - thoroughly recommend it. My only small quibble is the bed was a little hard for us but that may be a personal choice and wouldn't stop us staying there again. Thank you to the amazing bar staff who put up with us into the small wee hours of the morning and the chefs for the amazing buffet breakfast to keep us going throughout the day!",5,2014,02,13
237,Great hotel - even better after renovation,"Have stayed in this hotel several times over the past few years and it's back at its best again. The celtic tiger took its toll on the place and it was badly in need of a refresh - which it's had in spades. The rooms are back to a very high standard and the communal areas look inviting and classy again. 

The staff are welcoming and friendly and a special thanks to housekeeping who sent some clothes I  forgot over to London with no fuss whatsoever - many thanks! 

For those unsure about the location - it's in the best spot in Dublin. Try Capel St to get away from the usual tourist hangouts - the Japanese Musashi is very good value and the Black Sheep pub do some nice craft beers and ales as well as decent grub (5mins walk).",5,2014,02,11
237,Perfect base to explore the city,"This was the first time my Wife and I had visited Dublin. The hotel is located in an ideal place to visit the Temple Bar area in the vening but is far enough away not to feel that you are in a peaceful location. The quality of the room, staff and food was excellent. It was a great base to come back to after we had walked around the City. It is also right next to the River Liffey for a romantic stroll!",5,2014,02,10
237,Rugby weekend,"Probably the best hotel we have stayed in Dublin and we visit at least half a dozen times a year, the staff the service the standard of the rooms, easily the nicest in the city, the most modern
Breakfast which was of the highest quality, served until 12 means no stress in morning, just what is needed on a break. Location,car parking perfect
The hotel made for a great weekend",5,2014,02,09
237,Very well run hgotel,"The hotel was a gem, very charming on the outside and modern in the indside.  Restaurants and the breakfast bar was well worthed.  Very centraliy located and walking distance to many local shopping, bars and restaurants.  Exertemly friendly staff",5,2014,02,09
237,very good,"This is in an excellent location two minutes away from temple bar. Very clean and calm atmosphere. Rooms were well equipped and very comfortable. Car parking available on the same road. Staff were helpful and very pleasant. Only minus is that the dinner menu is , in my opinion, overpriced. there are however plenty of places to eat very nearby.",5,2014,02,07
237,Wife's Birthday,Took a 1 night trip to Dublin for my wife's birthday and booked ourselves to this hotel. Located 2 min walk over the bridge from Temple Bar. Friendly Staff and awesome room as we had booked the Junior Suit. We waited quite a long time for the room to get ready other than that the complimentary bottle by champagne was a nice gesture for the long wait.,5,2014,02,04
237,Nice hotel in great location,"Stayed here last week for 2 nights whilst on business. Decided that I wanted to stay close to the Temple Bar so this was in a perfect location, just across the bridges of the Liffey.
Staff we nice, rooms were nice and clean. Pillow was a little hard for my liking but I didn't phone up to change it, which I probably should have done.
Breakfast was perfect and quality of the food was to a high standard. Everything you could ever imagine was served for breakfast.
Had a couple of drinks in the evening, in the front bat and the atmosphere was nice and relaxed. Bar staff efficient and friendly.
Great business hotel and would stay here for a personal trip as well.",5,2014,02,03
237,Great location!,The location of the Morrison is perfect for sight seeing and visiting Temple Bar. The hotel is located next to the Liffey. A short walk over the bridge and you are at Temple Bar with numerous bars and dining options.,5,2014,02,03
237,Wonderful stay,"I was in Dublin for business and chose this hotel on a whim. Very glad I did. Was greeted with a  warm cookie on arrival which was a nice touch. Great room, wonderful service, fantastic restaurant, lovely atmosphere. All round a great hotel. Will certainly be back.",5,2014,01,31
237,"Modern furnishings, good restaurant, great location, helpful service","Pluses:
New, modern furnishings, clean lines
Good breakfast buffet, good steak dinner 
Well located downtown, a block from a major shopping mall, restaurants, etc.
Good size rooms
Quiet room was provided as requested

Minuses:
Nothing significant

237,Great stay in Dublin,"Just returned from our Ireland trip. We spent 7 nights at the Morrison. Two weekend nights were free from the Citi Hilton credit card and the other five nights I used as a points/award stay. Friendly staff whenever we encountered them or had questions, always smiling and willing to assist. I do not believe we were upgraded as far as room type for being gold members, but the free breakfast, wifi and welcome dessert trays were enough to keep us happy. The location is excellent not far at all from shopping areas (Jervis, Henry St, O'Connell st) walk across the bridge for Temple Bar, Close to many restaurants and pubs. Internet was fast and reliable, breakfast was enjoyable and had a nice selection (my wife loves the french toast with the tate and lyle syrup). Room service was decent and the staff excellent in helping us get the mini bar restocked or more necessities for coffee. The only drawback for my wife was that our room did not have a bathtub. After walking all over Dublin and doing multiple day tours she wanted to soak her feet. For the most part the room #307 was quiet and relaxing, Friday night got a little loud with people outside smoking from the lounge. Thankfully we were able to fall asleep as we had a Saturday departure.The chocolate cookie at check-in was divine. We would stay here again if we are fortunate enough to make a return trip.",5,2014,01,28
237,Cool funky boutique hotel,The rooms are amazing!  Not always practical but really funky and cool.  Staff are helpful.  In the heart of activity.  Near a lot of things to see and do.  The breakfasts in the morning exceeded expectation and the servers were just amazing.  I recommend this place if you are visiting and like eating at hotel restaurants and being near attractions.,4,2014,01,27
237,Excellent weekend stay!,"Myself and a friend had a girly weekend away, without the children, this was just a perfect hotel!  The hotel had a Great location just on the riverside, about 2-3 minutes walk from temple bar , the hotel had friendly staff, glorious food and lovely room. The bar had a live band playing in the evening who were fabulous! I would highly recommend this place. I'm definitely going to come back, this time with my family and for longer!  ",5,2014,01,26
237,New Hilton\Doubltree in Dublin 1,"I was looking for a good value near Temple Bar and for a Sunday night the Morrison was it.
Strange boutique decor and although my large Junior Suite was nice, the view of the neighbors backyards, sheds and smoking was not something I would pay a lot for.
If you don't look out the window, its a really nice room on second floor.
Staff was very helpful, let me check in early, upgraded me and answered a bunch of questions!
Location is great, Temple Bar right across the bridge
I will definetley stay there again, if I can get a good rate.",4,2014,01,26
237,Slightly disappointing,"Was really looking forward to this hotel. Unfortunately, due to the hotel's central location, my room was very noisy! 

Service was amazing and we were looked after.

Food was fantastic and loved the huge breakfast.",4,2014,01,24
237,Great hotel,"Complimentary warm cookies on arrival were amazing, reception staff were very polite and pleasant. Happy to help with anything my girlfriend and I needed, very clean and modern inside, our king junior suite was a perfect size, huge bed and very spacious with a beautiful river view. The location of the morrison was ideal for getting to nightlife, pubs, resteraunts, shops and only a short taxi ride to the zoo. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in dublin... And I will certainly be visiting dublin again and will be staying at the morrison. Thankyou ",5,2014,01,23
237,Very modern,"I didn't realize that there was a Doubletree in Dublin, so when I saw this, I decided to try it out. The location is really handy, just up the road from the ha'penny bridge.  As soon as you walk in you can see how modern and clean the hotel is.  My room was at the back of the hotel with not much of a view, but the room was stylish, with a nice sitting area and mood lighting.  The bathroom was stylish too.  The robe and slippers are always a nice touch.  I only stayed for one night and struggled with the room temperature, ending up opening the window.  I was surprised at the lack of road noise and managed to sleep OK, until the seagulls woke me.  The staff were also very helpful and polite. I will try the hotel again and hope that I don't have the same issues.",4,2014,01,22
237,3 things I like about the Morrison,"The location, the rooms, the service - sorry, 4 things - the food. Location couldn't be more central. Rooms (one bedroom suites) perfect when traveling with a kid, you still can have a bite and drink with friends in the room while the little one is asleep. The service is constantly good, but the real quality shows when something doesn't go to plan - the response to an issue I voiced was more than accommodating and a real effort was made to resolve it. Breakfast I dare say is among the best you can get and the restaurant food is excellent and some dishes surprising in the best sense.",5,2014,01,22
237,Excellent and friendly service topped by a great location,"My girlfriend and I stayed at The Morrison Hotel in mid-October 2013 for her birthday. I always do my research before I select a hotel. I found this hotel through Tripadvisor, as I always do. I was very pleased with the location and the atmosphere. Everything was very chic and clean. The reception desk was very welcoming and friendly. Before our trip, I had requested for balloons to be in the room and for one of them to say Happy 50th. I also asked for a restaurant recommendation. Each time I sent an email to the hotel with questions or requests, they promptly replied to me. One of the staff that specially stands out for me is Paul. He made sure that everything went perfect for our arrival. He even upgraded our room without me requesting it. Oh, the beds were VERY comfortable. They had hair blow dryers too, no need to pack yours.

The location - perfect! All we had to do was cross the bridge and we were at Temple Bar. We didn't have any problems with noice and I always felt safe. We were surrounded by plenty of restaurants and shopping. We walked everywhere. We never even took a Hop-on/Hop-off bus, no need in Dublin. Everything is pretty much walkable. Of course, not to the airport. That was only 15-20 minutes away by Taxi. 

I have to say, the Irish people are so friendly and easy going. Maybe because they don't have the crazy work hours that we have in the states. Something to be said for that. 

I highly recommend Dublin and the Morrison hotel. Don't forget to get the courage to rent a car and see the country. We did it for 2 days. We were a total of 5 days in Ireland, 3 in Dublin, the other 2 driving to see Blarney, Cobh, Kinsale, Cork and Kilkenny. We stayed the night in Cobh at a nice B&B called http://www.ardnalaoi.ie/. I highly recommend that too. I'll be reviewing it. The only disappointing stop was Cork - a bit down, economically, not good energy. Cobh and Kinsale were beautiful - near the ocean. Kilkenny is another great stop, quaint town.

Have fun in Ireland, we did! I'll have to go back and see the rest of it.",5,2014,01,22
237,Location..amenities...great staff,"Spent the weekend at The Morrison (Doubletree) and we were totally pleased with all aspects of this hotel (breakfast experience, location, fitness center, room, bar).  Unqualified recommendation on this one.  Well done.",5,2014,01,22
237,Wonderful Hotel in Dublin's Fair City,Wonderful hotel - the best I have stayed in for personal travel in the UK and Ireland. Warm and friendly service from genuinely happy staff.  AMAZING breakfast.  Brilliant location yet quiet rooms.  Stylish decor. Stayed here for a friend's 40th birthday and the hotel played a starring role in making the occasion memorably excellent.,5,2014,01,21
237,Very comfortable hotel that is within walking distance to everything in dublin!,We really enjoyed our stay at the Morrison.  Its a hotel that truly is within walking distance to everything you want to see in Dublin! Its a very comfortable hotel with the best hotel breakfast I ever had.  The breakfast room is interestingly decorated but the food was amazing!   The rooms are clean and good size and they offer King size beds!!!  This is a great place to stay Dublin.,4,2014,01,20
237,Really like this place!,"My husband and I have always stayed in another hotel when we visited Dublin.  We decided to try something different and I chose the Morrison because of its affiliation with Hilton. We were not disappointed. It's now our new favorite place to stay.

I can't really add anything new to what others have said but I will reiterate.  The hotel is fairly contemporary and modern in style.  We stayed in a junior suite on the fourth floor. It was spacious and the bathroom was very nice with a separate walk-in shower.  The bed and pillows were very comfortable.  We had no issues with noise.  The gym was not huge but well equipped.  

Finally the location is great and we will definitely stay here again!",5,2014,01,20
237,Really good hotel,"Travelled with my wife to Dublin in January and we stayed at the Morrison for 5 nights.

The location of the hotel is fantastic. Right across Temple Bar and there's a fantastic shopping district right behind the hotel. There's a mall a stone's throw away and plenty of restaurants across the bridge on the other side. The Luas (tram) is also right behind the hotel and within walking distance - it brings you to most of the main attractions in Dublin. There's really nothing you can fault with the location.

Rooms were decent and so was the bathroom. The bath does feel a little dated and but it's nothing serious. I like the colour combination within the room and they have this little quote on the wall which is a nice touch (though mine had a spelling mistake). The bed is comfortable, air conditioning really efficient and amenities in the bathroom good. One complain would be the lack of a shower head but rather, the bath is fixed with a ""rainforest shower"". House keeping was also very efficient with the cleaning and they did a good job.

Customer service in the hotel was also good. You'd always be greeted whenever you leave/enter the hotel. Staff will smile at you all the time and ask about your day. This really made the stay very comfortable and warm and we both enjoyed it a lot. The front desk staff did a good job at check-in and check-out, and were fairly knowledgeable in hotel vicinity as they knew where to eat and drink and shop. Kudos to them!

 I would return to this hotel. The warm service and fantastic location are too compelling to give it a miss. Recommended!",4,2014,01,17
237,Excellent !,"Stayed here on business last night and cannot fault the place. Rooms are spacious with free wifi and flat screen TV. Didn't eat here but had a few drinks in the bar which had a nice atmosphere and a good selection of drinks. The gym was standard size for a hotel but all top end equipment and as good as you will see in any hotel. 
Location wise was excellent near all attractions and temple bar area. Only slight negative would be it can be noisy late at night due to the central location and it is pricey but if you can afford it then go for it ! ",5,2014,01,16
237,Brilliant choice,"We stayed at this hotel as part of a BA deal, it was a great choice...superb position very short walk across a bridge to the Main Street shopping centre, with a short walk thro the temple bar area. Did not need a car at all, although the car park with preferential rates was just round the corner all that was needed was for the reception to stamp car park ticket. 
The hotel was very contemporary clean, and lively  it had live music on the Friday night.
Breakfast was superb,  everything looked and tasted homemade, the jam, bread, warm bacon and cheese muffins, wonderful!!! excellent selection of everything. can recommend the eggs Benedict which was at no extra cost the staff were very friendly and helpful, service was slick
One of the best hotels in the world we have stayed at, definitely recommend it  ",5,2014,01,16
237,Morrison Hotel,Nice hotel but recent money spent on it was not spent in the best way possible. The room with facilities for a disabled person could not be found by staff - tried 4 rooms before eventually getting the right one. The room for a disvbled person is not fitted out with any great thought of what a disbaled person really needs in their room. Many improvements could be made to the room. The wadrobe space is ridiculously small and one door of the wadrobe cannot be opened fully becuse it is too close to the main bedroom door.,3,2014,01,15
237,Brilliant birthday trip,We stayed here to celebrate my husband's 60th birthday with our daughters and partners.  We had a great time and found the hotel facilities and location were ideal for our stay.  We particularly liked that breakfast was available until 12 noon and also checkout was at midday.  Loved the cookies and the shower was possibly the best ever!,5,2014,01,14
237,Lovely Hotel in Dublin,Stayed over New Years on my first trip to Dublin. Lovely Hotel! Paid extra for a river view room which was very nice. It's just over the river from temple bar so not too noisy but still within walking distance to the many bars and restaurants. Breakfast was delicious and the staff were always friendly and keen to assist. Would definitely recommend it!,5,2014,01,14
237,Nice Surprise,"Had not been here in several years  - great refurb . staff are friendly and helpful . Check in efficient  - rooms are well decorated but not the biggest . Bar service was good , prices on the higher side . Good selection for breakfast .... nice touch having open until noon on the weekends for those who stay out a little late ! ... Great location within walking distance to temple bar, henry st, dame st and most city centre locations . Will be back ....",4,2014,01,12
237,Great Location,"My Wife and I recently stayed at the Morrison.  The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful.  The room was comfortable, small by American standards for a deluxe room, with a nice king size bed.  The big plus for the Morrison is its location.  It is walking distance from just about all of the main attractions in Dublin, but far enough from the Temple Bar area to avoid the noise of late night crowds.  Would definitely stay at the Morrison again.",4,2014,01,11
237,Fantastic Hotel +++++,We stayed at this hotel 30th Dec 13 / 1st Jan 14 must say what a fantastic hotel & location the rooms are very modern and spotlessly clean with all amenities the breakfast was the best I have had in ages ( Perfect ).We had friends with us they had another room and had the same experience as we did. The staff very helpful will definitely stay again.,5,2014,01,10
237,Great location,"This is the second time I stayed here and during booking I decided to upgrade to a deluxe room as it had a walk in shower.

Comfortable room and very spacious.

I had to seek a tailor and I rang the concierge and she provided me with a tailor nearby. She rand to find out if they were open and could see me.

Excellent customer service.",5,2014,01,10
237,Top hotel in Dublin,"Stayed for 2 nights over New Year at The Morrison and were not disappointed. The junior suite we booked was very spacious, facing the river. The reception and the whole staff at the hotel were very friendly and polite. Breakfast buffet was outstanding.
We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely come again soon!",5,2014,01,09
237,Nice but not what it used to be,"I really looked forward to staying here for a recent conference. I had stayed here before (before it was taken over by Hilton) and loved it's chic ambiance. I also lived in Dublin for a number of years and was a regular at the bar. Unfortunately, it's just a little, humph. It ok, perfectly reasonable, good service, nice facilities- it's just not what it used to be...",3,2014,01,09
237,Excellent experiance,"I live in Dublin and experienced this hotel during a wedding. Food was excellent, I fact we hung around he following day to have another meal there. Room was spacious clean and very modern. Car parking was accessible and the hotel in very centrally located within the city. My wife loved the hot cookies provided at checkin",5,2014,01,08
237,perfect location in a excellent place,"hotel location is excellent, staff very helpful in new places to go 'the queen of tarts"" for breakfast is a must , quirky and quaint Hotel Chef recommended the CLIFF TOWNHOUSE is a must as is Fade Street Social for the best TAPAS and Temple bar for smoking eating black pudding and oysters",4,2014,01,06
237,Fancy and stylish hotel,"The Morrison is a very modern, hip and fancy hotel. The interior is relaxing and there is a calm and easy music plaing in the lobby and the hallways. The rooms aren´t very big, but not too small either. The roomes are nice and freshly looking. Ask for a room with a view of the Liffey River - it´s a very nice view!
The hotel is located right by Liffey across from Temple bar and Ha´penny Bridge is about a 100 meters from the hotel. Everything is within walking distance from the hotel, for example Guinness Storehouse, Old Jameson Distillery, Dublin Castle, Dublin Zoo (about 30 minutes of walking and by far the farest away from the hotel) and the National Leprechaun Museeum which is located about 200 meters from the hotel.
The breakfast here is very expensive with prices from 12-18 € per person. There is a small café right outside the hotel serving breakfast and lunch for 3-10 € per person. It´s called the Mochaland Café and has great food and a friendly staff. 
The beds at the hotel are quite firm so if you´re a person who prefere very soft beds: probably not the best hotel for you.",4,2014,01,06
237,Best Yet,"Great stay in beautiful hotel. Staff were brilliant, couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. Nicest hotel that I've ever stayed in. Set in the heart of all the nightlife in Dublin with great views of Dublin and with plenty of nice restaurants around the area that's if you want to leave the hotel as the food is lovely and very reasonable. Would go back to this hotel over and over. ",5,2014,01,06
237,Very good hotel and great location,"Stayed here on 4 Jan 2014 on a brief stay to Dublin.  We choose the hotel due to good reviews and the great location.  We arrived into the hotel after 1030 am not expecting a room but were checked in without any delay or fuss.  We were also given as a welcoming gift two warm chocolate and walnut cookies. Delicious!  The décor itself in the hotel is quite modern and makes its guests feel welcomed and relaxed.  We were given a reasonably sized room with a comfortable bed and a large bathroom.  One negative point I would add, there were a few and only a few scuff marks on the walls in our room and outside probably due to suitcases being dragged about.  It's quite a minor point and one which doesn't take away from the design and feel of this modern hotel.  We didn't eat at the hotel and why should we given its excellent location on the quays and within walking distance of the Temple Bar area.

Finally upon checking out the staff kindly held onto our suitcase as we had a few hours of sightseeing to do before heading home.

Would stay here again.",5,2014,01,06
237,Excellent stay for New Year's,"We had a very pleasant stay for 4 nights here for the New Year. Very good positioning, just a 3 minutes walk from the Temple Bar, Dublin Castle and Trinity College. Very friendly anf helpfull staff. The room was very clean and quite large. At breakfast there was a large variety of choices, still I would have liked some vegetables. Thank you ""The Morrison""  :)",5,2014,01,06
237,"Great Hotel, Great Location","On a recent visit to Dublin we decided to stay at the Morrison. The visit started well when we were upgraded to a Junior Suite by the friendly staff on reception. The décor in the hotel is modern and the design gives it an airy feel. Very large room with a small balcony, very comfortable bed and a huge bathroom. Excellent breakfast with O'Neill's dry cured bacon and excellent eggs Florentine freshly prepared. The porridge was good and the fruit yoghurt excellent. Reasonably priced parking close by and a nice restaurant and bar (see separate review). Excellent location on the quays in the centre of Dublin within walking distance of all the major shops and a stones throw from Temple Bar.",4,2014,01,05
237,"Great service, rooms and staff","Stayed there while having wedding in central dublin locations.
The staff were very good, relaxed, friendly, willing to have a laugh, professional and very accommodating (considering we were asking them to store gifts, etc behind reception). As described in another review, 'sleek and stylish without being pretentious'.

Rooms very lovely and bright, spotlessly clean and great facilities. 

As our wedding, we also got the pleasant surprise of a free upgrade to the King One suite. Wow. Beautiful view over the Liffey, huge room with separate living room area, and always nice to find a signed message from the manager welcoming you. As mentioned, professional but not pretentious.
We also had multiple rooms booked - no issues with any of them.
If anything, only potential weakness is at breakfast where it can be very busy. The staff look like they're struggling to keep on top of it. Having said that, it all worked well and the range of food was excellent.
The bar was also lovely. Never too busy, the staff were again relaxed and were brilliant in serving the large group we brought in during the day.

We'll be back.",5,2014,01,05
237,Brilliant weekend had by my wife and I,"The hotel was excellent could not have asked for more helpful or polite staff, the roof was first class. The bar was brilliant getting to enjoy a few cocktails with my wife while listening to live music. We will definitely be staying there again",5,2014,01,04
237,"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!","Myself and my husband stayed here for 3 nights over the new year period and were extremely pleased with our choice. The hotel is not only perfectly positioned for exploring the heart of Dublin, it is also sleek and stylish without being pretentious. We found the reception staff to be warm ,friendly and attentive, nothing was too much trouble.
Our room was situated overlooking the courtyard (206), it was a good size, clean, comfortable and also quiet...the only slight niggle if I were to comment was the lack of a mirror near a plug in order to style hair...but that really is being picky! The shower was to die for, so powerful and plenty of hot water, good for waking me up in the mornings!
The food and drinks available in the bar were of a good variety and both equally tasty! Again, the staff were impeccable and ultra friendly.
If you want a hotel that is good value, in a perfect position with friendly staff, then we definitely recommend the Morrison. We hope to book there next time we visit Dublin.",5,2014,01,03
237,Dublin April 2013,"The Morrison was a comfortable accommodation in Dublin with a great location.  We had quick access to Temple Bar, the hop on hop off bus tour, Trinity College and the Ha'penny Bridge.  The room was nice but somewhat smaller than expected.  Breakfast was not included but was a nice spread with a lot of options.  I would have no problem returning to The Morrison.",4,2014,01,02
237,"Good location, Helpful Staff","Superb hotel. One of the few 5 star hotels that is actually a 5 star hotel. Staff all very helpful and professional. Room was perfect, slightly more road noise from the front elevation room we had than I would have liked, but did not detract from the overall experience. Breakfast was superb and all offerings were of the highest quality.
The evening meal we had within the restaurant was top class as well. 
Would highly recommend as a base when visiting Dublin as everything is a walk away including the popular Temple Bar area and shopping centres.
Did not make use of the gym or swimming pool so can't comment on as was too busy enjoying the sights and attractions of the City.",5,2014,01,02
237,Wonderful service,"stayed at the recently refurbished Morrison for four nights and found the staff to be helpful in every way.  They changed my room when I requested it because of noise, they gave directions repeatedly for shopping, sightseeing, using public transportation, etc.  They could not have been nicer.  The room was large and beautifully decorated, the public areas also great.  Breakfast buffet was extensive and had anything you might want. The location for tourists is superb.  Right on the river and within walking distance of all areas of the city.  If you want to use the LUAS, it is only a block from the hotel.",5,2013,12,31
237,"Great location, Friendly Staff","We were able to check in very early, about 10 am.  Breakfast was delicious.  Room has thoughtful touches, such as an umbrella, which came in very handy.  The location is great, you can walk to most of the attractions from the hotel.  The bed is VERY COMFY and the hotel and rooms are spotless.",4,2013,12,30
237,"Good location, room not setup properly","I liked the hotel, despite it being somewhat pricey for visiting during the off season. We were unhappy to find that our room was setup with two twin beds instead of the queen we requested.  We waited in the room for hotel staff to re-assemble the bed into a queen. The location made it very easy to get around Dublin.",4,2013,12,30
237,Hotel review of The Morrison in Dublin,Excellent location and very helpful staff. Arrived very early on check in day and staff worked hard to have one of our rooms ready by 10am. Easy access to hop on hop off bus and great restaurants like The Church. Bravo!!!,5,2013,12,29
237,Value for money and a lovely stay,"Welcomed from the moment we got there, reception staff efficient and a warm cookie topped it off. Found our room, clean and well stocked with hanging space, coat hangers and enough room for a comfortable weekend break. Good selection for breakfast, just make sure you are down before 12 as they are very efficient at clearing away. Great central location, noise levels fine in hotel even though we stayed during the office party season, right across from Temple Bar, we walked to the Guinness Factory and down to the Docklands too. Thoroughly enjoyable stay and would consider staying here again when in Dublin.  ",4,2013,12,27
237,"Great Location, Friendly Staff, Modern Rooms","Just returned from a 2 Night break in Dublin staying at the Morrison. 

Got checked in at 12.00 with a professional friendly welcome, effecient process and was offered a warm cookie. 

I reserved a King Room which was larger than expected, modern white clear decor and had all the amenities you would expect from this grade of Hotel.

Location of the hotel was just perfect for easy access to all of Dublin attractions; we visisted the Dublin Castle and went on a guided tour (which I recommend) as you would have lost the History detail in walking round on your own. Luckily there was just me and my partner on the tour which was even better so could ask lots of questions; 

Temple Bar is just across the bridge to which we ate in a couple of resteraunts the Copper Alley Bistro which was excellent food and very reasonable and then we ate at the PorterHouse the following night to which i would recommend the Wings (they come in a severity of Hotness).

The Christmas Market was a massive let down, it was empty of public, no atmoshpere some of the stall hadnt even opened and was mainly food stalls very little in craft.

To and From Dublin I would recommend the AirCoach great great service for the price 6 euro each way (if booked online) and so comfortable.

The prices in Dublin i found expensive (6 euros for a pint of coors light) but in the Hotel I didnt find them too out of the way at 5.50 for a pint of Guniess and 11 euros for a Cosmo.

All in all a great weekend and will be back. Enjoy",4,2013,12,23
237,Fine Hotel close to central,"We have stayed many times in Central Dublin and this hotel is a fine example of good, clean service  with modernly furnished rooms.  The location is quite central to O'Connell street, with much less noise than hotels in the IFSC area.  We had a little early morning noise from flats across the street, but generally very good.  We enjoyed a short walk of 10-15 min to the Customs house and  had many choices of good restaurants near O'Connell street and across the Liffey to Temple bar.  Grafton street is probably 15-20 minute walk, so most of the downtown area is very accessible from here.",5,2013,12,23
237,"Great hotel, excelent location","The hotel is in a premium location, right in central Dublin across from temple bar and it features a wonderful grill restaurant that I recommend. The food is well worth it and the drinks at the bar are very good as well. The whole space has a very good atmosphere and I will definitely be coming back!",4,2013,12,22
237,nice hotel in dublin,the morisson is a great and cosy place to stay. Closed to the center it is really nice to stay for a business or leisure trip. Clean bathroom and nice food served at the restaurant! nice! nice! and the cookie at the arrival is a great present!,4,2013,12,18
237,Nice but expensive! ,"My husband and I stayed in the Morrison for two nights 13 & 14 Dec. 

The hotel is very modern. However the rooms were a little less deluxe than we expected, given the price that we paid. 
Our room was nothing fancy, contemporary, Impeccably clean but we felt that  it did not reflect it's price tag and The minibar prices were extortionate!
The room we were in (128) is a side room and the street noise could be heard clearly all night, not a room for light sleepers! 
Breakfast was good. Lots of variety and cooked very well. Staff were also friendly. 

The hotel would benefit from better signs indicating the entrance/reception to the hotel as from the front it just looks like a bar/restaurant.  

Overall not a bad experience just a little on the expensive side!",3,2013,12,16
237,A very good hotel,"Stayed for 1 night in a Friday. Got room 330 which is a 1 bed corner suite, 5 windows, huge bath, dining table sofa and 2 LCD TVs. Comp prosecco on arrival was lovely and jumped straight into the tub for two. Nice Crabtree and Evelyn bath products. Also a rainfall shower. I loved the purple cubes and the feel of the place. Watching the sun come up over the liffy wasn't bad either.
Will definitely make this the only place I'll stay on my return trips to dublin. Excellent location, really superbly placed. Busy road in front so u need to be on the 3rd floor or back/side if hotel to keep noise down, not a problem for us.",4,2013,12,14
237,Morrison Hotel-Dublin in November,We stayed at the Morrison Hotel for 5 nights in November-December.  The location near the Millennium Bridge just across from the Temple Bar was great.  It was easy walking distance to just about everything in Dublin.  Hotel and restaurant staff was very friendly and helpful with our travel questions.  We arrived at 7:30 AM after an all night flight from the U.S.  I am a Diamond Member and they provided us free access to the breakfast buffet.   The Morrison has an ideal location just across the River Liffey.  I would not recommend getting a river view room due to the traffic and noise on that side of the hotel.  Our room looked out onto a courtyard which made it very quiet and comfortable.  The heating/cooling controls and light switches were a bit confusing.  No temperature reading on the heating/cooling system and took a while to figure out the what switch controlled what.  But we did figure it out.  Strongly recommend the hotel and hope we can stay there again soon.,5,2013,12,14
237,Great location,"This is my first stay here and it is a good hotel in an excellent location. This was a business trip for one night.

Staff are friendly and the rooms are of good size. Wifi is free in the rooms which is great.

The bathroom needed a touch up as sink kept blocking and rust in the bath tub.

Would stay here again.",4,2013,12,09
237,"Great hotel, great location","This hotel is located in a very nice central location, a short walk across the river liffey from the Temple bar area and its excellent nightlife. The hotel is very welcoming and staff are very helpful. The rooms are superb. Very bright and warm with nice decor. All expected amenities are in the room. Breakfast buffet was very good with plenty of choice. Free breakfast and internet is offered to hilton gold and diamond members, which is a bonus.",5,2013,12,09
237,Christmas party,"Had our Christmas party there this year. Well impressed. Music on entry, plenty of food. And to the chef that invented the Christmas pudding ice cream - hats off. Only thing that was slightly annoying, at 1:30 on the dot the music stopped and the bar closed...bit early!!!",5,2013,12,08
237,Excellent Hotel - Fantastic Location,"Recently stayed four nights at The Morrison in late November/early December 2013.  I must admit that my expectations were exceeded by this hotel.  The greatest strength of this hotel is the location.  It is located along the River Liffey across from Temple Bar.  There are many different restaurants and pubs all within a five minute walk.  Transit is also easily accessible with the Luas stop just a minute away.  Along with the location the accommodations were terrific.  We stayed in a Jr. Suite with a King Bed.  The design of the room was incredibly unique and comfortable.  We were on the first floor and didn't hear any noise from the street level.  We were in the back of the property along a non-busy street.  If you can request this location, I would certainly recommend it.  Finally, every staff member we encountered was incredibly friendly, efficient and welcoming.  Every request from arrangement of a taxi to entering a wake-up call was met with a smile and no fuss.  Each time.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin whether it be for business or pleasure.",5,2013,12,06
237,Excellent Stay,"The Morrison, which went through a massive renovation that concluded in early 2013, is an excellent hotel.  We stayed at this hotel in late November and early December 2013.  It is ideally located for persons interested in seeing the major sites of Dublin, most of which are within easy walking distance.  The hotel is clean, the rooms are spacious, and the service is friendly and accommodating.  This hotel has an excellent bar and serves a great breakfast buffet in its restaurant.  We would certainly consider returning to The Morrison the next time we visit Dublin.",5,2013,12,05
237,Fantastic,"I initially booked to stay in the summer at a web special rate but had to pull out at the last minute - I tried to cancel but was told that I couldn't, which was disappointing - although I understand the deal, I think that you should only retain my payment if you cannot re-sell the room, or the difference in value if you have to discount it (just some feedback, you can choose to ignore of course!) After that my experience was fantastic, you emailed me reminding me that I had the money on account with you and I rebooked a trip with my partner, my greatest surprise was that since your room rate on the date I booked was lower than my original booking you gave me the balance in room credit (although wouldnt refund the difference...) On check out, I realised that I was 1 Euro short of the set cab fare to the airport and the young guy on reception (didn't catch his name but it was circa 9am on Sunday 1st December) gave me the euro! I am the General Manager of a Porsche dealership and am constantly going on at my team about the massive difference the small things make, this is a perfect example and one I will be using at my next team briefing! This lad should be recognised for going the extra mile!",5,2013,12,04
237,Great location,Great central location in a groovy part of town.  Ideal  place to relax and meet up with friends and see all the sites. Met up with fmaily and friends here as part of our rugby adventures at Aviva Stadium.  Easy walking distance and a great place for post game celebrations.,5,2013,12,02
237,Great value and location,"THis is a great hotel, great staff and great location.  highly recommended- they always give you a warm cookie on your available and the staff its always nice and helpfull. location its awesome, just by the leffey, next to Temple Bar and shopping area. Great location.  Decoration is very nice-- modern. Food is also nice. Bar is also very nice.",5,2013,12,02
237,"Close to Temple Bar, but Quiet!","Sadly we only spent one night at The Morrison before our flight back to the US, but no doubt we will be back. We arrived very early after a somewhat adventurous taxi trip from the train station. We had an elderly driver who had no idea where the hotel was. The Morrison does not have any signage outside, so it's a good idea to be somewhat familiar with the address and location if you are taking a taxi. Anyhow, our room was not ready when we arrived, but our bags had been taken up to our room when we returned later in the afternoon.  The rooms are recently renovated and very trendy. How nice to have adequate lighting in a room for a change! The bed was comfortable. The room was quiet even though we slept with the windows open. Terrific shower,and a big screen HD a TV with loads of channels. My only complaint is that there are no outlets near a mirror, so when I blow-dried my hair, I couldn't see what I was doing! You might want to avoid the hotel restaurant - there are tons of better, less expensive choices in Dublin.",5,2013,12,01
237,Great hotel!,"This hotel is the ideal location for Dublin city centre,you could not get better!
The hotel itself is just fab!!modern,clean and relaxing,
I loved the bar and restaurant area,it was comfy and warm with a great atmosphere.
A brilliant touch was the warm cookies given on arrival,so tasty!!
Would stay in this hotel everyte I would come back to Dublin!",5,2013,12,01
237,A cool hotel,"I stayed at the Morrison for two nights and was very impressed with this hotel.  The location is perfect as it is very central.  The room was nicely decorated with funky lights and quirky decor.  The fire alarm going off at 6a.m. was quite annoying as we did not get the leisurely sleep-in we had anticipated.  We ate in the hotel restaurant and while the food was nice, I didn't think it was anything special.  I would recommend this hotel because of its location and modern decor.",4,2013,11,27
237,Great city break hotel,"Stayed at the Morrison for the first time this weekend - absolutely loved it!!! The hotel was absolutly beautiful, the food outstanding and please please please you have to try the New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc in the hotel bar - amazing!!!  We would generally not spend so much time in a hotel on a city break but the hotel was very inviting and comfortable that we just didnt want to leave. The location is excellent with just a 3 minute stroll to Henry St shopping and 5 minutes to Grafton St. so great for shopping, or eateries or theatres!!!Absolutely excellent location - close to everything!!  The staff were lovely and very helpful, there was always someone there to ask a question to.  The breakfast is the best we have had in all our hotel stays, the variety of breads and meats was exceptional aswell as the comfort of the dining room. Very different hotel breakfast experience! The breakfast staff were so lovely and accomodating to greet tired guests aswell - I like that very much.  The room was so fantastic aswell lovely decor and the music notes were a lovely touch! I cannot wait to stay here again!!",5,2013,11,27
237,Excellent hotel,We really enjoyed our trip (a birthday weekend away.) The staff were very friendly pointing out all of the good places to go and the cookie was a nice touch! I have since recommended this hotel to family and friends as the location and the rooms are perfect.  Thanks for a great weekend!,5,2013,11,24
237,Business Travellers to Dublin,"The Hilton DoubleTree in Dublin is perfectly located alongside the river.  The hotel is modern, clean and efficient.    I took an evening meal in the restaurant and was delighted with the range and quality of the food on offer; my choice of steak was perfectly cooked, superbly presented and the service was brilliant!!  Staff are attentive, helpful and polite.",5,2013,11,23
237,No room at the inn.,"Arrive for prebooked room, late on a cold evening. Greeted by flustered staff who informwed me that there my room was not available. Offered transfer to another hotel, taxi arrived and there was confusion as to which hotel i was going to. Eventually arrived at alternative hotel. It was in a different part of the city and a considerably lower standard.",2,2013,11,23
237,Solid Choice; Good Location; Large Rooms,"Overall, The Morrison is a solid choice for Dublin.  Many things are within walking distance.

Lobby - the lobby is nice.  Check-in was fairly easy...they had 2 staff checking people in...they were able to hold bags in case you checked in early.

Rooms - based on some of the room I have seen in the EU...these rooms are quite large...or at least, the rooms with the king size beds in them.  In addition, the bathroom was a good size.  Interestingly enough...it took some effort to figure out the correct light switch to turn off the colored cubes in the room.  I stayed in a room facing a side street...which minimized the noise.  A room facing the river may be more noisey.  I could hear some neighbors, which suggests that the walls are a little thin.  Closing of doors in rooms nearby were very audible.

Breakfast - the halo room where breakfast is served is nice and spacious.  The actual breakfast has a good selection between hot and cold foods.  Service was solid.

Location - I thought that the location was good.  That is, I was able to walk to the convention center, through Trinity, to St Patricks, to the Temple Bar area without a problem.

Again...good choice for Dublin...may be a little pricey depending on your rate...definitely a more 'modern' designed hotel.",4,2013,11,20
237,Could not it fault - Excellent,"I stayed at this hotel recently with my partner and we had the most fabulous stay from the moment we checked in. The hotel upgraded us to the most wonderful room, The Hotel is beautifully designed, the staff are so friendly I honestly could not fault this hotel and would recommend it to anyone.",5,2013,11,19
237,Good Choice!,"Very good hotel in the middle of the center of Dublin. Staff was helpfull. I will came back! I missed a sauna, ut the fitness was very well. The rooms are well furnished and new! I will recomment this hotel.",4,2013,11,18
237,Above and Beyond any Doubletree Worldwide,"I stayed here for five nights this week.  Everything about this hotel is right -- the place is fresh looking, the rooms are spacious, the locations is central, the food is wonderful and the service is superb.  I was told by a cabdriver that the place went through a refurbish and was closed for months.  The attention to detail shows and the staff continued to keep the place fresh throughout my stay -- from cleaning everything from baseboards to carpets to painting.  I stay at Hilton brands much of the year and this Doubletree stands above and beyond any Doubletree I have stayed.  Loved it.",5,2013,11,16
237,Great hotel,Lovely clean hotel and great staff.  Made us very welcome.  Has a good feel about it.  In a great spot and was not loud at night.  We did not eat there but the food looked lovely and there were plenty of people eating there which is a good sign.   We were given a lovely big warm cookie when we arrived and it was to die for.  Lovely tea and coffee in the room as well.,5,2013,11,15
237,Fine hotel fantastic staff. Perfect location,"I stayed for 6 days during October 2013 . The welcome and courtesy by reception staff was fantastic. Particular thanks to Paul for attention to our needs and comfort at every opportunity. Breakfast was delicious and again the staff were warm welcoming and very professional
 The location was perfect for access to both sides of the city",5,2013,11,14
237,The Morrison listens!,"Myself and my husband stayed in The Morrison Hotel in June,and mainly due to allocation of rooms (the dreaded room 136!)we really did not enjoy our stay and would not have returned. I posted my honest opinion on this site as always and hoped to be heard but expected nothing.. I was wrong, we were contacted by email and then phone by Patrick the Manager who listened to my woes with such sincerity inviting us back any time that suited us to allow them to make amends so last weekend we were attending The National Concert Hall and took him up on his sincere offer and spent a night at The Morrison.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay,room 214 is spacious and lovely it does not have a river view but as it is at the side of the hotel is really quiet,it has a balcony and everything one would want for their stay, prosecco and strawberries were delivered to our room and the late breakfast was served by possibly the most pleasant waitress ever observed (Polina) all in all we checked out on Sunday afternoon thoroughly rested and happy with a very different experience at the Morrison and look forward to our next stay...Thankyou Patrick for caring and for your genuine concern for guests staying at your hotel, this is exactly what makes Ireland special and with people like you long may it continue.",5,2013,11,14
237,Best in Dublin!,"We stayed at The Morrison for a short honeymoon and it must be the best situated hotel in Dublin and is lovely inside. We had lunch one day in the grill room and that was superb. Staff were great, the bar area is very relaxing and prices were reasonable. Walking around the city we always felt that we have chosen the best hotel.",5,2013,11,13
237,The Morrison Hotel Dublin,"Great location on the river Liffey running through Dublin.  Only one complaint here - the music in the bar/adjacent dining room - you couldn't here yourself think let alone speak for the techno beat.  At first we thought it was recorded music that we were about to ask to have turned down.  But then we saw it was orchestrated by a DJ!
This was on a Friday night and don't know if this sound only happens on this night.  Other than this complaint, I would have no hesitation recommending this hotel.",5,2013,11,13
237,Fantastic stylish hotel,"This was my second stay, the staff were welcoming as always and had remembered me from before. Rooms are clean, convenient location close to temple bar and a short walk to grafton street. Had a river view..... nice scenery.",5,2013,11,12
237,"Great hotel, great location","2 Great night at the Morrison. On check in you are given the nicest cookie ever (good touch). We managed to check in 2 hours early which was a bonus.
The room was lovely and clean and bright and extremely clean. It had tea/coffee making facilities as well as an iron and board and hair dryer. 
We used the bar both nights for a couple of drinks and although a bit more expensive than local pubs it had a lovely ambiance.
You are literally just over the bridge from Temple Bar and all the fun and around the corner from the shops. 
Use the Hop on Hop off bus, it cost 18 Euros and lasts 2 days.
A must is the Guiness factory having never tasted the black stuff i am now hooked.
The prison (Gaol) was also extremely interesting and the guided tour and talk.
Will definately return.
TIP-Keep purses/phones etc safe as there are some dodgy groups of people in the town.",5,2013,11,11
237,Handy location and great staff but had better for same price,Lovely staff who can't do enough for you but wasn't overly keen on the hotel design. Rooms are small but this is expected when in city centre however I found the bed very hard. Breakfast was lovely and bar service was good. Make sure you get a room at the back of the hotel as front very noisy. Overall good and handy location but not the nicest location. ,4,2013,11,10
237,Modern and inviting,"We had a wonderful experiencing at the Morrison...we were given a generous upgrade due to this being our honeymoon trip.  The staff was extremely helpful with any questions we had.  We were concerned that the decor may be too modern, but it was surprisingly warm and comfortable.  Breakfast had two options, continental or continental+menu ordering, which was a refreshing change for us for our stay in Ireland.  (At all the other hotels we stayed in, there was only the continental+menu ordering, which was more food than we needed for breakfast. )  The location was excellent, just north of the river and easy access to many attractions, though parking was a separate cost, there was no valet available and the entrance difficult to find.  Those issues aside, we had a great experience.",5,2013,11,08
237,Morrison Hotel - Double Tree by Hilton,"The hotel was centrally located within easy walking distance of all the major attractions, but far enough away from the noise and hubbub of the Temple Bar area. The staff were friendly, helpful & efficient.  The accommodations were clean and well appointed.  We celebrated our 35th wedding anniversary on our first night in Dublin and the staff's recommendation of dining at the ""Church"" was excellent!  I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying in Dublin.",5,2013,11,06
237,Only good thing was convience,"From the very beginning the hotel staff were not at all friendly. We were treated as a bother. The restaurant was so loud, because it shares space with the bar, that you couldn't have a conversation. When we originally called for directions to the hotel we were not given the right cross street and the hotel has no number for the street. Then we were not given our cookie or asked if we needed any help. Any questions we had about hilton points were ignored and we were told we should take it up with hilton. It is a great place to walk from as there are many things close to this hotel. That was the only good thing I can say about it.",2,2013,11,04
237,A most pleasant and flavoursome little lunch venue,"Visited, business lunch July 2013. Tasty well priced lunch menu. Prompt attentive service. Bright.... much brighter than its previous manifestation... and a nice place to chat. I will return. Well worth a try.",4,2013,11,03
237,Great location and friendly people,"Just a quick note on The Morrison.  The location is great, as it is across the Liffey away from the Temple Bar noise, but an easy walk.  The lobby is nice and the breakfast is very very complete.  It is also an easy walk from the Airlink shuttle from the airport.",5,2013,11,03
237,Welcome to Ireland,"Booked this hotel based on other reviews from TripAdvisor.  We were not disappointed and even though it is ultra modern, it was ultra comfortable.  The staff were welcoming and gracious and we had no complaints. Beds were fine and we were not bothered by the street noise from our river facing room. Breakfast was plentiful and since were not down before 9 AM we had no problems with a queue. Stayed for 2 nights before moving on with the rest of our trip.  Great way to start a visit to Ireland.",4,2013,11,02
237,Great location great service average room,"Fantastic breakfast ruined by horrendous piped ""music"" and huge screen showing food channel (with sound turned down) Why? Please get rid of the music - seriously not needed over breakfast. Service and good were amazing. 
Room disappointing - double room with 1 glass and 2 bottles of water, one dressing gown and one pair of slippers? ",4,2013,11,02
237,Jim The Real Deal Says Upgrade is Neccesary,"The review I am writing is about the upgraded room to a junior suite.  The regular room was small.  I have lived and worked in London and New York and this room was up there with the usual I only sleep in the room or European rooms are all small category.  It was just uncomfortable.and the junior suite was excellent.  A word of caution the River rooms/suite faces the main road and at times at night in the morning it has heavy traffic so noice can be an issue.  We had one off the back OK view but silent as a mouse.The hotel staff is as good as everyone says.  This is a function though of great service all over Ireland.  The people are either locals with a slower pace and attention to listening and foreigners there to learn English and a desire to interact.  You will find this same great service in every restaurant and pub.  The hotel is at the edge of the poor part of town.  Dublin is still a function of 150 years of the haves and the havenots and it continues today.  The ""other side"" of the river has the Universities, the upscale restaurants the nice parks and most of the theaters.  The nice location of the hotel is that it is 50 meters across the bridge to the other side of town and some more reasonable places to eat when dining casually.  Also all of the historic sites which are mostly depressing episodes in Irish history or run down and falling apart.are on this side of the river.  If you have a chance to travel get on a train and go somewhere even if for an hour.  The city dissapears in about 20 miles so the Irish countryside is everywhere and worth going to a small town and enjoying.",4,2013,10,31
237,Not for early birds and not for later ones...,"I stayed in the Morrison Hotel during a business trip.

The room I stayed was nice and functional. All fine.
The setting of the hotel is good too, modern style with a nice bar and a restaurant. All fine.

The friendliness of the staff is okay, not great. That is based on the interaction across all experiences during the week. Nothing exceptional, quite okay.

There are two points which will make me not book and use the hotel anymore.

Breakfast is only served after 7 am. This is too late, if you need to grab a bite or even want to take a proper breakfast and then have a business meeting early.
Even worse. On a couple of days I went down at 720 or 730 and then there was a long wait in the queue in order to get a table. The breakfast area is simply too small and restricting the start time does not help.

The second disappointment  was the gym. The treadmills are fairly old and the room is too low which makes you feel that you are going to hit your head anytime. And one is placed in a way that the ceiling almost comes down to your shoulder. Okay I am not exactly small with 6""4...

If you don't eat breakfast and don't use the gym, it's a good hotel. But there are better ones in Dublin.",3,2013,10,31
237,Modern and classy!,"Fantastic hotel, centrally located in the city, just across from the buzzing temple bar. Food, cocktails and breakfast were too class. Only negative would be that the beds were v hard, but that's a personal opinion! ",4,2013,10,30
237,Honeymoon,"My husband and I stayed at The Morrison in September for our honeymoon and we loved it! The location was excellent, right across the bridge from temple bar. We found many great bars and restaurants near by. The  staff was very friendly and helpful. ",4,2013,10,30
237,new and modern hotel,"It is a nice, new and modern hotel, with very friendly service. In the middle of the city, close to the temple bar. Little pricey! The hotel is also recommended for Meetings and congresses, but also for private visit of the city.",4,2013,10,29
237,Lovely hotel in a fabulous location!,"Having visited Dublin for business twice over the course of the last 18 months, I had stayed at The Morrison twice previously before my most recent stay. Being back for a more social visit, I got to appreciate just how good the hotel really is. 

We received the warmest of welcomes on arrival with the friendly receptionist recognising me from a previous stay over six months ago. The complementary chocolate chip cookie was a really nice touch! Given that we weren't due to check in until later on in the day, the hotel were more than happy to keep our luggage whilst we explored the city. On returning to the hotel, our luggage had already been delivered to our room which just added to the fine nature of the service that we received thoroughout our stay.

The hotel is in a fabulous location - near to local transport links, local sights and highlights as well as to a plethora of eating establishments. The room was incredibly comfortable and the bathroom had a good, strong shower as well as sizable bath. There is a good, strong wi-fi signal (each room as it's own dedicated hub) and the 40"" flatscreen TV affords the opportunity to enjoy some in-room entertainment. We enjoyed breakfast on both mornings that we stayed at the hotel, and given that service goes on until 12 noon at weekends, there was no need to rush. There is plenty of choice of things to eat and drink - even for the most fussy of eaters! 

I would have no hesitation in staying at The Morrison Hotel again, either for business or pleasure. In fact, we're already planning our next trip to Dublin and intend to stay there again.",5,2013,10,28
237,"Location, Location",Hotel was ideally located and was walking distance to The Temple Bar area and shopping.  The rooms were on the small side but this is common in Europe.  The breakfast was very well laid out and exceeded our expectations with the variety and quality of the food. We had dinner the one evening in the restaurant and it too was quite good and was reasonably priced for a hotel restaurant.,4,2013,10,28
237,Excellent,"Good location, recently (mostly) refurbished. The finish is a bit plastic in style, but good size rooms, friendly staff. Some rooms don't have baths. Only issue is that rooms are expensive by Dublin standards.",5,2013,10,27
237,A nice place to stay,"We stayed here at the end of October for two nights.  This is a very nice hotel located across the river from the Temple Bar area, a 20 euro trip from the airport.  It is very close to the main shopping streets where the large department stores are located, and has easy access to the red line tram (best way to the Guinness  Brewery)  and other bus lines.  It is an easy walk to the popular tourist areas across the river.  There is a nice local restaurant a few blocks away, in an old church (called The Church) that has live music and Irish dancing.
Rooms were clean and modern.  Breakfast was great, with lots of options, including many custom made options to supplement the buffet (at no extra cost).   Staff were friendly and helpful,  Overall it was a good experience and would stay there again.",4,2013,10,25
237,Wonderful Oasis in Dublin,"My wife and I recently spent the last evening of our Ireland trip at The Morrison, and what a pleasure. Professional, crisp service, modern room with more than the normal amenities, and great view even if our room was on the second floor overlooking the river and the front street (and extremely noisy so be sure to ask for a room on Jervis St. in the rear. The hotel restaurant was a pleasure with good service again, and above average food. Be prepared that hamburgers in Ireland are not the same as in the US. A different cut of beef, and simply not as good. The buffet breakfast was one of the best in all of Ireland. Oh, did I forget to tell you about the two large LG flat screen tv's in the room? Caution thought, because you will be paying a premium for the location, but to be honest with you, well worth it for the last night splurge. It was indeed a wonderful respite in the center of Dublin!",4,2013,10,25
237,"Modern, but comfortable and cosy","I stayed in this hotel for am business trip and had a very good expertience; its a nice hotel, right in the city centre, the design is modern, but still comfortable and cosy due to the different levels in the restaurant; extremely nice staff, and delicious breakfast!",4,2013,10,24
237,cool chic city centre hotel,"stayed at the morrison hotel in dublin. lovely room overlooking the river liffey, within walking distance of  lots of things to do and see in the city centre   the staff at reception, morrison grill and the breakfast area were friendly, attentative and went that extra mile to make our stay memorable. dinner in the Morrison Grill was superb and breakast was outstanding-absolutely spoilt for choice",5,2013,10,23
237,"Nice hotel, extremely poor service, pay attention if you have an early flight out!","I recently stayed at the Morrison and had a couple of unfortunate incidents. Below I've copy/pasted the letter I sent to the hotel manager upon my return to San Diego. It has since been 2 weeks since I sent the e-mail and I've received no response or communication whatsoever. This is more of a public service announcement for any of you that might have early flights out of Dublin and choose to stay at the Morrison.

Hello,

My name is Brad S. I had a group of 5 people that stayed at The Morrison hotel Sept 30-Oct 2.(we had 3 rooms and spent quite a bit of money in the hotel on rooms, dinner, drinks etc) For the most part we enjoyed the hotel but we had a major issue upon check out that I want to tell you about. When we arrived at the hotel one of the front desk staff came out and walked all the way up to the parking garage to show us where ""our hotel parking lot"" is located.. he said to bring the parking ticket to the front desk and they would validate it so we could get the hotel rate of 12 euro per day which we did. 

We had a 7:30AM flight on Oct 2 over to London so we came down stairs around 6AM with our bags to check out and were then told that the parking garage doesn't open until 7 but for 50 euro they could ""make a call and try to get somebody to come open it early"" 50 euro? are you kidding me? I was livid..I had to walk 20 minutes in the pouring rain at 6AM to find an ATM machine because it was a ""cash only"" policy. We were never told anything about the parking garage having set hours? If you're telling people that garage is for hotel parking then when they bring their parking ticket to be validated at the front desk you should have a one sheet handout to give them explaining the parking garage's hours of operation, policies, charges etc..the front desk people should be asking people when they bring their ticket in if they have early flights when they leave and make them aware of that issue of the garage not opening until 7. I asked the young man who came down to open the garage if this was something that happened often and he replied ""yes, all the time, that's why I live so close by"" what I scam I thought, I felt extremely violated and taken advantage of and it left a very bad taste in my mouth regarding our stay at your hotel.. I'm an avid user on Trip Advisor and I post reviews of all restaurants, B&B's and hotels we visit on vacation.

We had one other issue I wanted to bring to your attention. We were trying to check in for our flights for the following morning on the computer in the lobby and to print our boarding passes out as well..we were told the printer wasn't working, was out of ink etc so if we wanted our passes printed we would have to save them to the computer then e-mail them to the front desk and have them print them out for us..with 5 of us checking in it turned into over a 90 minute process because the e-mails were taking 20 minutes apiece to show up in the front desks inbox to print. we lost almost 2 hours of sight seeing time on our last afternoon in Dublin..printers/ink cartridges are VERY cheap and that's a luxury that people staying in a hotel such as yours should be afforded..even if they have to pay to use your ""business center""

I am not a hard person to please at all and I rarely complain or send e-mails like this and I'm not even so much concerned about the printer situation but I'm still extremely upset about the money I had to pay to get our car out of the parking garage that your staff instructed us to park in. I look forward to hearing back from you in regard to this issue and I thank you for your time.

Brad S

I hope this review will help others avoid what happened to us..all I can say is if you have early flights out do not park in the hotel parking structure!",2,2013,10,22
237,Location Location,Here is a pleasant hotel with nice river view rooms and literally seconds from the Luas and shopping streets and centres all within 5 minutes walking. The grill is also pleasant and reasonably priced and the breakfast buffet has an enormous selection.,4,2013,10,22
237,Great Hotel Staff,This is a great hotel for business or vacation.  Staff is great and the breakfast is super.   Perfect location to tour the city.  This is the hotel you should pick if you are visiting Dublin.  I am a Diamond frequent traveler so I stay in many hotels.  This is the one you should pick for Dublin.  We stayed in the airport Hilton also on this trip and the Doubletree is so much better.,5,2013,10,22
237,Pleasant Stay in a Convenient Location,"While not inexpensive, The Morrisson provides excellent accommodations for a visitor to Dublin. The staff is extremely personable. There is some inconvenience in getting about the hotel, as the bar and restaurant area can be reached only by a flight of stairs. Food service options are sparse for a hotel of this quality, although good restaurants outside the hotel abound. Room service is efficient. We will stay at the Morrisson on future visits to Dublin",4,2013,10,21
237,Great location and comfortable hotel,"This hotel is located conveniently between Temple Bar and a large shopping area.  I had a room with a nice view of the river.  I did hear a bit of late-night noise, but it didn't bother me too much.  The room was spotless, never a wait for the elevator and lunch in the hotel was really good.  One interesting thing is that when you turn the TV on, it is personalized with the guest's name.  Oddly, mine had some man's name-- which was kind of weird!  I wondered if my name was showing up on somebody else's TV!   I have to admit I found the light system all a little complicated-- though I've noticed more and more hotels are installing these.  

The on/off bus stop is just a few blocks away, and the airport bus is probably a 10-12 minute walk away.  It runs frequently and is much less expensive than a taxi.

Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.",4,2013,10,14
237,"Clean, comfortable and classy","Stayed at The Morrison recently for 4 nights. This was the first time we had been back since the renovation. What brings us back to The Morrison is the location -central yet quiet; the ambiance - relaxed, very friendly yet private and intimate. Bit of a character change from the renovation and comes across more like the Hilton Chain than a private hotel as it seemed previously. In some ways I preferred it in its previous guise but there is no doubt that the renovation has created a more modern,cleaner, more sophisticated setting. We had a great stay and will return again. The staff are lovely and this is a great, relaxed place to stay. Request a room with a river view if you want to spend time relaxing in your room. Only criticism is that the modern seating in the reception area is prettier than it is functional!",5,2013,10,13
237,Only thing not perfect was the view,"Opened the door and my wife was stunned.  We had stayed in a five-star in London that was not this nice.  The decor was great, the room spotless, and, like most people have already said, location was great, across from the Temple Bar area, but not so close you had a lot of noise.  We got upgraded from a river view room to a deluxe, but we lost the view.  Not that we were in the room gazing out the window a lot, so doesn't affect the overall.  Walked to most of the venues, friendly taxi service or horse-drawn carriage to the rest.  Would love to stay there again.",5,2013,10,12
237,central location,"the hotel is like a business hotel...it was kind of them to upgrade us ...the location was excellent central to city attractions and all the party places, also several intimate and gourmet restaurants around.",4,2013,10,12
237,The Southern Traveler,"This is review is comparable to the others.  This hotel was in a great location, and all the amenities needed were in place and the bed was comfortable.  There was a delicious warm cookie served while we waited for our room, which was a short wait and it was also an early checkin.  The reception desk took care of our taxi for us for departure to the airport and it worked out perfectly.  

No complaints here whatsoever.",4,2013,10,12
237,Great location!,"The Morrison is in a great location in Dublin. We took the bus from the Dublin Airport and you get dropped off maybe 5 blocks from the hotel using the bus. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.  My wife and I walked everywhere from the hotel. Michael Collins barracks/Guiness factory were the furthest walk and took us less than a half hour to reach both. Temple Bar district is a quick walk over a bridge across the street from the hotel. The hotel knew we were on our honeymoon and left us chocolates in the room. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant but had drinks there. The bartender was very friendly. We wanted some pizza after drinks and since she was getting off work walked us to the pizza place nearby!

If the street noise (our room was facing the street) was less we would rate this as a 5. However, even with the low street noise we would stay here again!",4,2013,10,11
237,Beautiful Location,"Another very good Doubletree experience. Stayed here 2 nights in early October/13 at the end of a 21 day journey. The warm cookie was a nice reception along with very helpful staff at check-in.
Hotel is very conveniently located near city center. The room was very clean, nice large towels and a very comfortable bed. The staff was really friendly during our stay which added a great  memory to finish our trip.",4,2013,10,10
237,"Great hotel, Excellent location","This hotel was prefect.  The location was excellent, right across the river from Temple Bar, a ten minute walk to the airport bus on O'Connor and a two minute walk to the hop on hop off bus.  The room was very spacious and comfortable.  A warm cookie at check-in was a bonus.  The only thing I found odd was the shower head in the room.  It had this large rainfall shower head but it was so close to the wall you had to tilt it at an angle to get away from the wall behind you and even then it was still too close.  The tub was huge and you were stuck in this 1/4 of it because of the shower head.  The water pressure was fine and you got a decent shower it's just the setup was really odd.",4,2013,10,09
237,Loved it Paul Donnelly Made it Special,Stayed here.  Paul Donnelly the front desk manager made our stay very special.  He took personal our requests for assistance in making a restaurant reservation or where to see something interesting. Great place....You will not be disappointed.,5,2013,10,09
237,"Great Hotel, Fantastic Location",Extremely well presented hotel in a very central part of the city with walking distance to all the major tourist areas and shopping facilities. Staff and food where tops!! A little over budget in price but worth it in the end as the Hotel was lovely to stay in.,5,2013,10,08
237,weekend stopover,"Excellent location, close to temple bar without the noisy and congestion, contemporary hotel.
Quay 14 bar staff very friendly. ~Restaurant menu uninspiring.  Rooms fresh and modern.
Pity there were no place to hang your towels after use.",4,2013,10,07
237,Wonderful experience,"We had our wedding reception on 21/09/13 in this beautiful hotel. From the moment we met the event manager, (James) we knew we had made the right decision. He put us at ease and was always available to answer questions and offer advice. The wedding fair we attended earlier in the year was very helpful as we were able to view the venue as it would look on our day and we also got to sample food and wines. 
This hotel décor is modern and yet very comfortable. It suited our taste. The rooms were fabulous and luxurious.
The food served at our reception was incredible and everybody commented on how good it was.
What stood out for us and our guests though was the staff. The staff at reception right through to the waiters during our meal were so professional and friendly. They were so attentive throughout the day and indeed into the early hours of the morning. All our guest commented on how friendly and efficient the staff were. 
The breakfast the next morning was wonderful. A fantastic choice of hot and cold foods. We lingered for quite a while getting more coffee and snacking as guests arrived at different times for breakfast and again the staff made sure we had all we needed.
I would say to anyone thinking of booking this hotel to just do it. It is in a great location and central to all the sites in Dublin. For anyone thinking of having their wedding reception here, ring James and you won't regret it.",5,2013,10,07
237,Amazing  wedding venue,"We had our wedding here and were delighted with the hotel and everything that they did on the day.

The food was amazing - even when serving 150 people at the same time. The staff were great to deal with and accommodated any requests from us or our guests.

The rooms were stylish and very comfortable and the breakfast the next morning provided anything you could want for breakfast.

A number of our wedding guests complimented us on the quality of the hotel and the food as well during our wedding.

Overall a fantastic hotel to stay in and we will definitely go back again.",5,2013,10,06
237,Picture Perfect!,"My family checked in on October 3rd, 2013 early after an overnight flight from Chicago.  With my Hilton status, we were upgraded to the Penthouse Suite.  The views over the River Liffey and the Temple Bar area were beautiful.  A nice balcony wrapped around the floor to ceiling windows.  The staff at the hotel were remarkable.  They all interacted very kindly with my six year old son, making him feel very welcome.  The included breakfast was delicious, from the buffet to the custom You absolutely won't find a better hotel in terms of location, hospitality or accommodations.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2013,10,04
237,"Central, modern comfortable  hotel","We stayed at the Morrison for 3 nights and an additional one night  earlier this month. Our King room overlooking the liffey river provided a nice view, was very quiet, sleek, free wifi, internet at reception, modern bathroom with a deep/steep bath/shower, ac which was somewhat noiser than  it should i be, a safe, and very comfortable but hard bed.  Luas ltram on Jervis is a short block away and the aircoach stop is a 10 minute walk to the near top of OConnell Street. Hotel has a very nice early l bird dinner special with excellent quality.  Otherwide, you may want to eat at Elephant & Castle in Temple Bar.  All this cones of course at a price.",5,2013,10,03
237,Great craic!,"Great location right beside the River Liffey and 2 minutes walk to Temple Bar where there are lots of great pubs full of character and welcoming locals. Be careful what bars you go to near the needle, things can be a bit rougher at that end of town. 

The hotel has recently been refurbished.  Bedroom very nice but funny bathroom layout with insufficient space for towels!

Perhaps it was down to newness of staff following the re-opening but breakfast was chaotic due to coping with a big party of conference goers. 

Food and service in the restaurant was excellent. Reception staff were very attentive and supplied the standard Doubletree warm cookie on arrival",4,2013,09,25
237,"Wonderful room, perfect location",The room as modern but comfortable and very clean.  Bed was most comfy and the room was quiet.  We had breakfast/brunch included and it was wonderful.  The desk staff was most helpful in pointing me in the direction of a nice department store to replace the lipsticks and lotions I had lost on the trip over.  Really enjoyed our stay.,5,2013,09,25
237,Morrison Dublin,"Bad experience.  Was given a room without an outside window.  No fresh air, no natural light.  Only window looked into a kitchen/dining area that was very noisy at all hours.  Horrible treatment considering price paid.",2,2013,09,25
237,fantastic hotel,went to dublin with family for all ireland final we had a great time hotel was lovely staff very helpful the rooms   and bathroom spotless. breakfast excllent the bar staff very friendly we had fingerfood fantastic.could not fault this hotel.,5,2013,09,25
237,"Ideal location, trendy hotel","Stayed here for 3 nights during our month long vacation in August. Hotel was really classy, room was magnificent, ours was at the back of the hotel on 2nd floor with no view at all but it was really really quiet. Beds were comfortable, shower wonderful, fluffy snuggly towels and robes. The warm chocolate cookie on check-in was a pleasant and oh-so-delicious treat. It's located on the Liffey River, just a stone's throw from Temple Bar which we thought might be noisy, but our back room proved to be ideal. Just a short walk to pubs, restaurants, the shopping mall and main streets, with buses very close by. Funky cocktail bar and restaurant, although food and service weren't fantastic in the restaurant. Apart from that, we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again",5,2013,09,25
237,Smart and Central,"Don't come here if you are looking for true Dublin character but if you want a really good, well placed hotel with clean lines, smart decor and good staff then this is a great hotel. Everywhere has that 'designed' feel, muted shades of grey, with shots of vivid pink and trendy cube like lighting in the bedrooms. Rooms were of a good size with lovely large and comfortable beds. Just across the river from Temple bar area, so if you want all the nightlife it's only a short stroll away but then it's lovely to come back (on a weekday anyway) to the calm cool vibe of the hotel bar. Would definitely like to return here. ",5,2013,09,25
237,Trendy and in a great location,"We stayed at this hotel 6 years ago when it was Morrison Hotel and again in August 2013. We were pleased to find that everything that we had expected to experience again was still there. The location is great with just a short walk to the main shopping area and Temple Bar.  Also the hop on hop off stops just up the road.  The breakfast was good and so was our meal at the restaurant and staff at both locations were very helpful.  Our only complaint was that the air conditioner was not adjustable to our needs and there was a minor glitch with the computerised tv controls. Other than that, a great place to stay.",5,2013,09,25
237,Great Experience and Great Location,We stayed in this hotel in the past July and we loved it a lot. The hotel rooms were very lovely furnished and clean. We enjoyed our stay especially the brunch/breakfast. The selection and the setup was very nice. The staff was also very friendly especially Maria who took care of us a couple of times. Very sweet and helpful girl. Gave us a few good tips on places around Dublin. Would definitely go back next time we are in Dublin.,5,2013,09,24
237,"Great stay, great location","Arrived at the Morrison on Saturday following a long, overseas flight. My wife and I were greeted with a warm cookie at check in and there was a personalized greeting to us on our TV when we turned it on. Nice touch. The room was very clean with an fantastic view of the river and city. Mini-bar was well-stocked. The room had all the amenities you would expect -- robes, hair dryer, coffee maker, etc. Another nice touch was an umbrella in the closet, which we used a lot given the erratic weather of Dublin.
Breakfast buffet was extensive and delicious. The wait staff were extremely attentive. In fact, all the staff of the hotel were nice and worked to make sure our stay was perfect.
The bar was well-stocked and made for a nice stop after a night in the city. The also offers some finger foods of which we tried the sliders and they were great.
Location is perfect for seeing the city. Just across the river from Temple Bar and is surrounded by many restaurtants and stores. There is a huge mall a few blocks away.
Overall, it was great hotel.",5,2013,09,24
237,Dublin Delight,"I have been to Dublin on numerous occasions and stayed in all manner of Business level hotels....but The Morrison has that little something special that makes your trip far more memorable. It's rooms are large and well appointed and the common areas are bright and modern with a twist of chic.The hotel bar is uber cool and a great place to start for a drink before going out for the evening. 

It's location is ideal with many restaurants and pubs on your doorstep.- or just a stroll across the walk bridge to Temple Bar and only 10 minutes to Grafton Street for shopping etc.

Fabulous hotel in ideal central location and Dublin is a delight. Can't recommend enough!",5,2013,09,24
237,"Excellent location, service, accommodation","My wife and I stayed at the Morrison as a long weekend break. We're occasional visitors to Dublin and so weren't necessarily in need of masses of tourist help or advice, but on checking in the staff were quick to point out potential traffic and crowd delays with some major events going on, which was extremely helpful. Staff were also very helpful when we asked to change rooms to a higher floor - Ormond Quay is a busy road and traffic noise is uncomfortable at times on the first floor.
The rooms are very tidy, well-appointed and comfortable: beds may be a bit too hard for some. The designers have had some fun by using song lyrics as a motif in the lift and bedrooms, yet the overall impression is one of peace. A nice oasis amid the hurly-burly outside.
The hotel's bar/grill is excellent, and the two-course lunch special for 20 euros is recommended. Wines are well-chosen, though prices may be a bit of a surprise.
The location can't be faulted: Ormond Quay is directly across the river from Temple Bar, Dublin Castle and a short step from O'Connell Street. If you're in town for a concert, it's a direct, if bracing, 30-minute walk to the O2.
All in all, a great choice for a stay in Dublin. Its high rating here is amply justified.
",5,2013,09,23
237,Chic but not without difficulties,"Agree with the excellent location and this is an upscale hotel, especially for a DoubleTree.  I didn't find the check-in staff to be especially helpful other than saying you can't check-in until 3:00pm.  Phone lines were out the whole morning and was unable to call and ask if they were available - this was met with a curt ""we are working on it"" when I informed them the lines were out.  Room was interesting and sometimes the design becomes cumbersome - who puts a toilet in front of the bathroom counter space and hides the flush button on the wall?  It was comfortable and quiet otherwise.  Breakfast was good and offered a separate menu.  Diamond amenity was 2 bottles of water which were not replaced on day 2 .

Given the high rates (both cash or points), I'd opt for another location.",3,2013,09,23
237,Excellent Service,"Staff was exceptional, from housekeeping right up to management. All requests and services were provided promptly, efficiently and with a smile. Trendy decor throughout, clean and comfy rooms. Excellent location across the river from Temple Bar, with nice restaurants, shops and retail stores minutes from the front door on this side of the River Liffey. Would recommend to others and should I return to Dublin would happily book here again.",5,2013,09,22
237,Wonderful Breakfasts,Recently spent a couple of nights midweek in this hotel.The welcome was warm & efficient & the room excellent. We were booked in for 'English breakfast' which meant we could have the buffet & or anything on the menu or whatever else we requested. I tried the delicious pancakes with maple syrup & crispy bacon the first morning & French toast & berries the second. Everything was cooked to perfection & the portions were ample. My husband had various other combinations ( smoked salmon & scrambled eggs etc) which were followed by great wheaten bread or croissants & lashings of tea & coffee. It was such a change from the Ulster sorry Irish fry-up which was also available.We did not avail of any other meals in the hotel as we were elsewhere in Dublin but I'm sure the quality was excellent. Definitely treat yourself to this smashing hotel .,5,2013,09,22
237,"Great Hotel, avoid the linen closet","We stayed 3 nights and enjoyed the hotel for its location and friendly/ helpful staff.  One thing to check on if you plan to sleep past 7:30am is that you are not across the hall from the linen closet.  We only had one morning to sleep late, and waking to the constant slamming of the linen closet door directly across the hall was not a great way to wake up.  On the other hand though, it gave us more time to explore the city.",4,2013,09,22
237,"overall, an excellent experience in Dublin","The staff at this well located hotel are very professional and go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable. The breakfast is excellent. The design of the guest rooms are attractive, yet are not always functional.  For instance, there were no dressers in our room, just shelves in the closets. If you are sensitive to noise while sleeping, you might want to avoid rooms with river views. The rooms are not well sound proofed despite extensive and recent renovations. We stayed for a full week and highly recommend the property.",4,2013,09,22
237,Perfect,Everything about my stay at The Morrison was wonderful! The desk staff friendly and helpful. Room was clean and comfortable. The restaurant trendy (but not too much) and the breakfast was fantastic. Could not have a better location in Dublin.,5,2013,09,21
237,first class stay,"this hotel met all expectations , great room, staff and location just a short walk over the river to temple bar, hotel extremely quiet considering close proximity to temple bar, staff so helpful as we arrived early and left our cases as room wasnt prepared, on our return staff instantly recognised us and cases where immediately at hand, thanks for a graet stay",5,2013,09,20
237,Good location but hate the modern decor,"OK, let me just start off by saying I am not a fan of modern, plastic looking decor and that it is quickly dated, which describes the room I stayed in.  I liked the hotel and the bar and the breakfast, but just couldn't hang with the modern, uncomfortable decor.  The bed was nice and comfy, the room furniture wasn't.  Just isn't my style.  The room was roomy as was the bathroom.  Clean.  Staff was very professional and helpful.  Hotel is in a great location.  It g=has many pluses but as I said, I just don't dig the modern furnshings.",3,2013,09,20
237,"Good location, great hotel","I thought this hotel was great. They upgraded me to a suite which was modern, spacious and fantastic. The hotel is located in a great part of Dublin but it was just a quick walk away from the bars which meant it was quiet at night. The service was great and the amenities were typical medium to high quality expected of Hilton.",4,2013,09,19
237,Highly recommended,"I have stayed at this hotel several times prior to its reopening and I have to say it is as good as it was previously. Service, food, rooms and bar excellent  - staff very helpful when needed and no issues during stay - highly recommended.",5,2013,09,19
237,Excellent Hotel,"My husband and I stayed for 3 nights at this hotel in Dublin and we were extremely happy. The staff were really friendly and helpful and our room was very comfortable and had all the amenities that you would need.  Very comfortable bed, great shower and beautiful big fluffy towels.  Perfect.  Would highly recommend it to anyone. Location was perfect.",5,2013,09,19
237,Dublin,"Excellent location close to the city center, Temple bar & reasonable to St. Stephen's area. Efficient & professional staff; very helpful & attentive. Close in parking. Room overlooking the river was very comfortable.   Tough to beat the Dublin pubs but the bar & restaurant were very good.",5,2013,09,19
237,Good choice in Dublin,"Location is perfect .. so near (to many attractions) and yet so far (from all the hustle and bustle of the city) .. the hotel is walking distance to many attractions in Dublin such as Temple Bar, Hard Rock Cafe, Trinity College, Grafton Street, St Stephens Green and yet when we get back to the hotel .. we are far enough from those noisy surroundings .. 

Muslim travelers .. kindly take note that halal food restaurants are not that far off too from Morrison .. quite easy to find halal restaurants in the vicinity of Temple Bar .. 

So, location wise it is in good area

Hotel wise .. room is clean and off reasonable size .. same goes to the bathroom .. service is good too .. free wi-fi works well .. so all in all no complaint :)",4,2013,09,17
237,Excellent Wedding! Amazing Hotel!,"I had my wedding here recently and I cant say enough about how amazing the whole experience was in The Morrison. All of the staff from the day we began planning the wedding until the the day we checked out were absolutely excellent. They were all friendly and professional and nothing was too much trouble (Thanks James and Susan!). 
The hotel itself was stunning, the spaces available for our civil ceremony, dinner and party were all beautiful and all of my guests have been raving about how gorgeous it was. The dinner was excellent and the party food was also fabulous, this was absolutely not the usual wedding fare, it was restaurant quality all the way. 
We were so suprised and delighted on the day of the wedding when we were upgraded to the Penthouse Suite which was just fabulous - it was really the icing on the cake for us. Many of our guests also had their rooms upgraded too. 
On what could have been a stressful day for me, i had absolutely NO worries at all, everything ran so smoothly and professionally i didnt have to worry about a thing and I really just relaxed and enjoyed the whole day. 
Honestly, I could go on and on about how brilliant the hotel is - suffice to say, if you are considering having a Dublin city wedding then do not hesitate to choose The Morrison as your venue - you WONT regret it, not only is it in a great setting in the heart of Dublin, it is a really really gorgeous hotel and the staff are AMAZING, they really know how to look after their guests. Just book it!",5,2013,09,17
237,Review of Morrison,"This hotel is perfect in terms of location. Across from Temple Bar, walking distance to Jameson, St Patrick's, St Stephen's Green, Grafton Street. The hotel itself was clean, felt safe, the rooms were quiet, though a bit small.",4,2013,09,16

237,great stay,"One think I like about Europe you can often find these old but updated to modern hotels that are now in the Hilton chain. Like The Trafalger in London this hotel does not have a big Hilton sign on the front. In fact from afar it does not even pear to be a hotel. It blends in with the city. Makes it feel more like a home type setting for those of us that spend a lot of time in chain hotels it is a nice break. 

This hotel has a great location. You can walk to all of the tourist spots or the hop on hop off bus is just a 5 min walk to nearest stop. 

Breakfast is good. Had many items off the menu all very good. The buffet is as you would expect. 

The room was nice  We had a suite facing the Liffy which was very nice. Big bathroom. Water pressure in shower was poor as other reviewers have mentioned. I was still able to have enough pressure to wash my hair in shower (this was not the case in Dublin in the 90's), large tub was nice. 
Nice firm bed, nice firm pillows. Lots of spot in the room to spread out bags in the room. 

A/C works great. I noticed a prior review regarding this previous. Ours worked great we had it blasting in the evening and it kept us cool.
Very little road noise could be heard. Check windows are both closed and locked when you arrive. The A/C fan helps block the noise. 

Found that restaurants on hotel side of the river where quieter (much less crowds) and good. Went to The Church for fish and chips, sushi just a few places down on left as you exit front of hotel, and a good soup place short walk to right. (see my reviews on these).

Hotel Staff was all friendly. Overall a great place. Glad it is part of the Hilton Brand. We would stay here again.",5,2013,09,15
237,Luxurious and central,"This hotel is luxurious, elegant, modern and slick! Paul and his staff welcomed us after a long journey with fresh baked cookies and got us into the clean, well appointed room ahead of the check in time; little touches of luxury with individual bath robes, hot water kettle, coffee and tea. The rooms were cleaned perfectly; the room was on the side street, and did get a little noisy on the night of the big Ireland-Sweden soccer game. Wake up calls for our early morning day tours were punctual. The Temple Bar area is across the river, a few minutes walk; Hop-on Hop-off bus stop is a little over a block away. Adam at The Morrison Grill was a great conversationalist; he recommended the awesomely delicious cocktails at the Quay 14 Bar. A full Irish breakfast buffet is available every day (some rooms have this included in the price). Would highly recommend this hotel for any one visiting Dublin.",5,2013,09,14
237,Beautifully Designed,Great place to stay. Very convenient location - just off O'Connell Street so a short walk if you're getting the airlink bus from the airport. The hotel is stylistically beautiful... they have succeeded in making a very beautiful 'space'. Service is very good!,5,2013,09,14
237,Great location in Dublin near Temple Bar,"The location is great for those who want a quiet place.  It is directly across the river from the Temple Bar district with a pedestrian bridge diagonally across the street from the hotel.  The soundproofing in the river view King is excellent in spite of the street being directly below.  Styling is modern and contemporary though not very functional.  A very minor point, but as an example, the spacious bathroom has only one small towel bar which is at the sink.  There are no other bars to hang your bath towels in spite of ample clear wall space (design feature?).  Towels must be stacked on the sink counter.  The only other option is to hang the towels on two small hooks on the back side of the door.  If you wish to be environmentally conscious and re-use towels (as the Hotel recommends), this does not leave much opportunity for the towels to dry.  Another minor point is that the closet is very shallow in depth and clothing must be racked against each other, not leaving much room to air.

For those light sleepers, the windows on this side are not operable and the a.c. is quite loud.  It may be a concern during warmer periods.  Otherwise, excellent.  Good security, wonderful staff, and very clean.",5,2013,09,11
237,Not your usual Doubletree...,"This hotel is an elegant luxury hotel, not just a ""nice"" Doubletree.  The rooms are decorated in sleek, modern, style, with purple accents & fun, funky lighting.  The staff is very helpful, and the location is excellent.  Even the exercise room has a fun layout and view.  Choose this hotel if it's in the running--you'll enjoy it.",5,2013,09,11
237,Great place for first-time visitors to Dublin,"Everything people said here about the Morrison was true: the location is great, very central and easy to walk to most places of interest (as a first time visitor to the city, that is always a major concern). The staff were also very friendly and helpful. And my room on the fourth floor, in one corner of the building with sweeping views, was very well-appointed. The airport bus stops are about a ten minute walk away as is Trinity College and the Post Office where the uprising took place. Cross the bridge in front of the hotel and you are right in the lively Temple Bar area. Walk a few more blocks and you can catch the tour buses at St Andrews Street. (I did the 14 hour day trip to Belfast and the Northern Irish coast, which was spectacular). Despite its convenient location, the hotel is also far enough away from the hurley-burley of the Dublin bar scene so that you can enjoy both without either interfering with the other. I'd definitely return here.",5,2013,09,10
237,Excellent stay overall,"The check-in process was smooth and efficient. Room was comfortable and spacious for European standards.  Amenities were wonderful and wi-fi was free and plenty fast...was even able to livestream college football from the US.  The breakfast was included in my rate and was excellent every day. Service was spot-on and food was cooked to perfection.  Bar is very nice and quiet (except for the weekend when they have a DJ come in) and offered very nice drink selection and food selection from their Morrison Grill.  I must say, the food I ate at the bar was some of the best I ate during my one week stay in Dublin.  Overall, I would not hesitate to stay here again.  

If I have one complaint, noise from the DJ nights was bothersome, but I could mask most of the thumping of the bass by cranking up the AC in the room.",5,2013,09,09
237,great hotel and not far from the park,"I stayed at this place for about one week for a conference event, great comfort in a great hotel and excellent sleep quality. Very good food at breakfast, quite area.

The beautiful park is at about 15-20min walk and the city centre not far away right off the other side of the park.

Very convenient service with the shuttle bus from the airport stopping at all major hotels.

Definitely recommended!!!!",5,2013,09,09
237,Loved this hotel!,"This hotel is a great find!  It is in a very central location and yet quiet.  The rooms are very well appointed, right down to a hair dryer that directs the air right where you want it. The bathroom had enough space for all the things that need to be near the sink. The staff was very friendly and helpful.  There was one young woman at the reception who was a great help to us, from IT issues to directions to extra cookies at departure.  Her last name is Johnson, but I didn't get her first name.  Thanks!  The breakfast was served in a very pleasant and light room and featured an extremely wide selection.  We stayed four nights and hated to leave!",5,2013,09,05
237,Very Nice Hotel,"This was one of the nicest hotels we stayed in on our entire journey through The UK and Europe.
The room was clean and well kept. We had a beautiful view of the river from our window. The hotel bar was a really nice place to relax and have a snack after a long day of sightseeing in Dublin. If we ever get back to Dublin, we would definitely stay there again. I highly recommend it.",5,2013,09,05
237,Great Location,"The two most important things for us are location and cleanliness.  From this hotel, you can walk to all the attractions that are on the route of the hop on hop off bus.  In addition the hotel is located between the two train stations that are within the Dublin area; the Heuston and the Connolly and both stations are within walking distance of the hotel. This is very convenient if you want to take a day trip to other parts of Ireland. The housekeeping staff was excellent.  Our room was huge, smelled great and was very clean.  The only thing I would say is the duvet cover is very heavy so ask for a top sheet if you don't like to wake up hot.  As with any hotel located in the city you will get street noise and Dublin is no different. In addition, the Morrison has a busy restaurant/bar and the sound does permeate the room.  Just bring ear plugs and you will be fine.  We would definitely stay there again.",5,2013,09,04
237,The best experience ever at a hotel!,"If your going to Dublin, Ireland I highly recommend this hotel.  I took my family (wife and two teenage sons) of four to Dublin.  We went out on an early flight.  We arrived at the Morrison at 5:00 am.  Our reservations were for 3:00 pm.  No problem at this hotel.  They provided my family with a room so that we could sleep and relax for the day.  The hotel staff provided my family with excellent service, delicious breakfast, and with printing itineraries of train schedules and sightseeing routes.  The rooms were modern and were meticulously clean.  The best experience my family has had at a hotel ever!  I highly recommend that you stay at this hotel it is centrally located to everything in Dublin but most of all it had spectacular service and people who care!  A rare find these days.",5,2013,09,04
237,Modern hotel in great location,"Just stayed at The Morrison for four nights. It is a contemporary/modern hotel. Nice touch with the colored lighting on the bedside tables. Lots of storage space. Bathroom was clean and well stocked with amenities. Hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Hotel is located within walking distance to many attractions.  A room overlooking the Liffey is great. However be warned that there is traffic noise throughout the day and night. Also it's right across from Temple Bar so you get a lot of ""happy"" people outside most nights. If you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs. Despite the noise it  was nice to to have a room that faced the Liffey. 

There were chocolates and a hand written note from the manager waiting in my room when I check in. 

I requested a wake up call which I got on time. Then a while latter got a call from the front desk to confirm that I got the wake up call. That was kind of them to follow up.

There are numerous restaurants near by. Many of the Temple Bar pubs have live music.",4,2013,09,03
237,Supreb Hotel in central Dublin,"tayed for 5 nights on July 2013. I had great experience. The location couldn't be more central, just 2 minutes walk from Temple Bar and 5 minutes from Dublin Castle. The rooms are very large and very well equipped and the bed extremely comfortable. The facilities are very modern but the interior designing is pleasant and warm. Breakfast contains wide selection of fresh products. The staff was friendly, outreaching and very efficient. They provided a lot of accurate information about the city. Overall, great experience.
On the negative side - one minor thing: their wake-up system isn't accurate. If you have a flight to catch the next morning I'd use a backup. But this didn't spoil the overall good experience.",5,2013,09,03
237,Great boutique hotel in the heart of Dublin,"My husband and I stayed here for two nights as the start of our visit to Ireland.  It is a very nice hotel in the heart of Dublin an easy walk to Temple Bar District, Trinity College, and major sites in Dublin.  The breakfast was great at the hotel and we even got a nice upgrade on our room.",5,2013,09,02
237,The Best in Dublin!!!,"If your dream trip to Ireland includes Dublin, you must stay at The Morrison Hotel on Ormond Quay. Location, Convenience, Service, Amenities, Location, and WIFI makes this unbeatable. We checked into the Hotel at about 7:30am, after being up for about 20 hours. The staff wisked away our luggage and excorted us to the breakfast room where there was an abundant buffet as well as menu service. Our plan was to power through the tour at the Guinness Storehouse and the Jameson Distillery (for which we had 1pm reservations) before returning to the hotel for a nap. These two destinations are a long walk away, but very doable. We officially checked into our room around 3pm and were totally impressed with the comfort, decor and amenities. The best part was that it had modern HVAC and air conditioning!! Of course, we did not know how much we would appreciate this until our two week tour of Ireland was over. We never had AC outside of Dublin and it was never really ""hot"", but VERY muggy (we traveled August 9-19th, 2013). When looking for rooms in Dublin, I would consider AC a key factor because all of the city streets are noisy and pub lined (a good thing), so you will sleep better with adequate air flow in a closed room.  The included WIFI worked flawlessly at The Morrison, too. The entire staff at The Morrison were outstanding as well. One of the cool things about Ireland is that thier version of a ""buffet breakfast"" is not like anything here in the US. There is no plastic utensils, plates, cups or bowls. Most of them, incuding The Morrison, had standard serve yourself hot/cold choices as well as cooked to order. It's not just one or two people trying to keep up with demand in a crowded little room. It's a dining room with plenty of staff and food is readily replenished, clear up until serving time is done. The staff checks on you and brings your beverage choices right to your table. The Morrison had one of the best of the 12 different places we stayed. If you are really picky, you might get bored (kind of like how the buffet on a Cruise Ship gets boring) but you can always just have coffee and a snack and save your appetite for other things later on in the day. Driving in Ireland and parking in Dublin were my two biggest pre trip concerns. Both of these went well for me because of how, specifically, The Morrison is situated. We did miss it, even tho I drove right to it, because the front of the hotel is a bar/cafe and the name was up high on the building. When we finally saw it, an easy left onto Jervais and the hotel had a large pull in area so you can unload and get parking info without blocking the street or worrying about a ticket. We noticed alot of places to stay in Dublin were not car friendly at all. If you have a car, be careful about where you stay for this reason!! The garage the Morrison uses has a special rate (I think 12 euros a day, with validation) and it is just 1/2 a block up on the left. It is covered and secure. The Morrison is just across the River Liffey from Temple Bar. We walked EVERYWHERE. However, we also took advantage of the 2day hop on/ hop off bus that had a stop near the Morrison as well. Tip--- there are 2 different hopon/off tours, which we did not realize until we were there. One is red and one is green. We picked red and I observed that the green busses were not as crowded and seemed to run a bit more often. They are the same price and go to the same places. I would look at both companies/routes on line before you go. We spent our first three nights in Ireland at the Morrison and it was fabulous. We walked into Temple Bar every night, and we walked (or rode the hop on) to all the cool places during the day- Christ Church, O'Connell Street, Trinity, Steven Square, etc. Temple Bar has spots open very late so I would not recommend staying inside this area if you do  not plan to close em up every night! We loved the walk back across the bridge to The Morrison to collapse on our comfy bed in our comfy, dark, quiet room!!",5,2013,08,31
237,Nice Hotel in Dublin,"LOCATION: Perfect location on the river. Everything is a short walk away.

ROOM: The room was clean and provided enough space. The style was clean and not too busy. Noise could be an issue. We stayed in April, so maybe it gets noisier in the summer months.

STAFF: Like most Irish people, the staff was very polite and friendly. They helped us with a car rental reservation.

RESTAURANTS: We didn't have breakfast included in the rate. We opted to have breakfast at a restaurant called Lemon Jelly just two blocks away. Great prices and the breakfast was excellent!

CITY: Depending on your agenda, Dublin can be explored rather quickly. Since we had three days we decided to rent a car and drive across Ireland on a day trip. We got to the west coast and drove the Ring of Kerry.

We reserved our car from the airport because the rate was drastically cheaper than picking up a car in the city. We took the bus, about 30 minutes, to the airport to pick up the car. We parked the car overnight on the sidestreet by the the hotel for free until about 7am or 8am. Then returned it to the airport and continued on to our next flight.

We would definitely consider staying here again.

237,Newly Remolded,"This property was remolded earlier in the year and looks great.  It is very modern with large suite rooms.  However, the a/c doesn't work well.  Stayed 2 nights in 2 different  rooms in July, and neither room cooled down below 85 degrees.  I know, who needs a/c in Ireland, but this past July, there was a heat wave and no rain for 2 weeks in Dublin.  Also, the bed was hard as a rock.  I kept waking up because the mattress was so hard it was hurting my shoulder and hip bone on 1 side and I needed to roll on my back or the other side.  On the positive side, the staff was very friendly and helpful and the bar was very nice.",3,2013,08,28
237,More style than substance,"+ nice design
+ friendly, attentive, competent staff at check-in and breakfast
+ location: fronts onto the river, across from Temple Bar bar district
+ TV simple

- poor (ineffective?) temperature controls. If you're going to have thick bedding I need to be able to cool the room. Sorry, temperature controls for room are high on my list.
- shower pressure poor (big shower head though); NOTE: colleagues reported no problems here
- mediocre-standard pillows
- location (sketchy neighbourhood on north side; noise from street/partiers returning home)

(stayed 2 nights on business)

Overall it seemed that they put more effort into modern design (table-tops that light in purple!) but forgot some fundamentals.",3,2013,08,28
237,The Reviews are Correct!,"The reviews of this hotel are spot on!  The employees were terrific and the location terrific (across the bridges from the Temple Bar area)...maybe a bit noise from the street but, hey, this is a city.  The restaurants in the hotel were decent and the facilities were too.  The bar was better than most of the other ones in Dubin....and we did visit quite a few.  Arrived quite early in the morning and requested to check in early....and they were most accommodating.  Even the few requests from our room were attended to in a efficient and timely manner.  As far as the room was concerned....it was quite good, too.  We booked a suite and we were pleased.  The size,decor and amenities were great.....2 tvs, nespresso machine, mini bar (with room for your own goodies), the bathroom and toiletries, writing desk, etc.  
We also enjoyed the location on this side of the Liffey as much as the Temple Bar area and sightseeing locations on the other side of the Liffey.  We would most likely concider this hotel for a future stay in Dubin!!",4,2013,08,28
237,different,"used to stay here quite a bit as Morrisson - nice John Rocha Design, now its quirky, pink and not as personal as it used to be. cocktails were not great, did not stay for food. rooms are nice, but not as nice as they used to be. also a lot more expensve that the e100 a night it used to be",3,2013,08,28
237,A Night of Style in the City Centre,Beautiful hotel in the heart of Dublin City.  Perfect location for the nightlife of Temple Bar and the Shopping of Jervis Street. The staff were lovely and the service equally as good. We stayed in the Penthouse which was spacious but homely with all the technology you would expect.,5,2013,08,28
237,Classy hotel in the city centre,We stayed in a lovely room overlooking the liffy. The room was in very good condition and excellent decor. The standard throughout th rest of the hotel was also very high. The location is great to visit Dublin as everywhere is walking distance. There is also a car park nearby.,5,2013,08,27
237,Too expensive for that,"I know a few hotels in Dublin and if you compare this one with similar hotels there is no color. The price is too much, the room is enough but you don´t need to pay that prices for a normal room, the bath is like in one of this hotels... IBIS, no more that 2 stars and in the shower there is no power",2,2013,08,27
237,Great hotel stay in the middle of Dublin,"The hotel is in a great location, near all the shops on Henry St and a short walk over to Grafton Street. Room was newly decorated, clean, fresh and modern with plenty of fluffly towels and Crabtree and Evelyn amenities - breakfast was a standard buffet with a menu for extra options, always a nice touch. We ate in the 'Morrison Grill' in the evening - great meal and pleasant atmosphere - most impressive part of our stay was the great service we received here, the server was brilliant at her job...attentive, efficient and more importantly in a Dublin restaurant,,,non-intrusive! The steaks were perfectly cooked to order from their 'Josper oven'. Wouldn't hesitate in recommending this property as a choice for a 4 star city center location and will definitely be back to the restaurant. Thanks for a great stay!",5,2013,08,26
237,Quality Hotel,"Just returned from a 2 night stay in Dublin (our first in Dublin) and stayed at The Morrison.  We had an early flight and arrived at the hotel at about 10am. We did not expect our room to be ready but was very pleasantly surprised to find it was. The cookies we were given were a lovely touch. The weekend was a birthday treat for my husbands birthday, I had asked for an upper room overlooking the river and this is exactly what we were given. The air conditioning was excellent, the bed comfortable and the room had plenty of storage. The hotel was spotlessly clean, all the staff were courteous at all times. I would not hesitate in staying at The Morrison again.",5,2013,08,26
237,Modern 5 star hotel.,"It's a Hilton, similar to most others. It's close to the Temple bar area, and the river. Many good pubs are nearby. Very Modern. Rooms were quiet. Elevators worked well. Staff were efficient. No overcrowding.",5,2013,08,25
237,Loved our stay!!!,"We arrived in Dublin early and the staff did everything they could to get us into our rooms early.  Rooms were beautifully designed and immaculate.  Beds were GREAT!  Wi-fi was fast and dependable.  In-room coffe/tea service was great with really good Hot Chocolate.  Notwithstanding how beautiful the room was, the front desk staff was amazing.  Whenever we had a question, somebody would whip around the desk with a map and show us exactly where we wanted to go.  They booked our day trips and helped us get one at the very last second.  Location, of course, is great; right on the Iffey River and an easy walk to Temple Bar and Grafton (DON'T try walking to the Guiness Storehouse tour -- it's farther than it looks!).",5,2013,08,25
237,A great place to stay in Dubin,"We spent 4 nights at The Morrison in July during our first visit to Ireland.  The location is perfect - walking distance to almost everything.  The Temple Bar area is just across the river and the Italian Quarter restaurant district is right next door,

The modern hotel and functioning air conditioning was a relief as we spent many a hot night in the other area of Ireland we visited (with no a/c).

The staff was very helpful and friendly, especially the servers at breakfast each morning.

I highly recommend the Morrison.",5,2013,08,25
237,A cool place to be...,"This is a stylish, glamorous, modern hotel.
You will not find a more enjoyable buffet breakfast anywhere else. It contains an amazing choice, to include the Irish staples of porridge, and black-and white pudding.  There is even a small a la carte menu for anyone who misses their eggs Benedict, and other delicacies.  And here's a tip: have breakfast, skip lunch, and prepare for another Dublin delight: Afternoon Tea!
Easy to see why  that it is the preferred place of the younger-set, because they 'get it'.  Easy also  for older, experienced travellers to enjoy this makeover, since it may be the shape of hotels in the future. The intelligence behind the scenes, is well hidden.
The smiles at the Front Desk are as welcoming as can be.  And the same smiles, guard your departure.  To quote Arnie: ""I'll be back!""",5,2013,08,25
237,"Beautiful Hotel, Great Location",We loved our stay at the Morrison.  After many days spent in B&Bs it was lovely to stay in a hotel with all of the creature comforts one sometimes misses in a B&B.  The hotel is perfectly located; we were able to walk everywhere but just outside of the fray of Temple Bar.  The staff was absolutely wonderful.  I would highly recommend a stay here!,5,2013,08,25
237,enjoyable stay at Morrision Hotel dublin,"We really enjoyed our stay, breakfast with delicious pancakes was a particular highlight and overall, the  hotel was an excellent base for our Dublin trip. The Hotel is a stones throw from the city centre. The Hotel staff were very friendly and efficient, the Hotel was very clean and had great security. We hope to stay there again.",5,2013,08,24
237,Perfect Location!!,"Great location if you're looking to explore Dublin on your stay.  Close to everything!!  Large, clean rooms and friendly staff!!  Close to the Temple Bar area so you will not have to walk far after a night of Pubs.",5,2013,08,23
237,Exceptional Service In A Great Location!,This is a wonderful hotel in a great location in Central Dublin.  Decor is quite modern!  Our room looked out upon the water and the busy night life.  What was particularly pleasant was the great service from all the staff!  They were professional and very helpful with specific requests.  I highly recommend this hotel and its restaurant.,5,2013,08,21
237,Been Billed for something we didn't have and been made out to liar!!,"We stayed in this hotel on the 9th and 10 August 2013, I have just come off the phone from them as they have charged us over £60 for items from the mini bar which we did not use.....there was no bill on checkout and the only proof they have is the word of house keeping!!!! I was asked if I was calling the staff liars!!!! I assume they believe that there customers lie!!!!!!! Not happy and will be taking further.",1,2013,08,20
237,Good location,"Stayed for one night, for business. The location is great with access to the main areas of Dublin, the bars and the airport. Check-in was smooth, with a cookie that was welcome after a long day travelling and working. The reception staff were very helpful, organising cabs to the airport and wake up calls. The hotel looks great, and the rooms are very well designed... however I felt it was a bit style over substance. The bed was extremely hard and the shower looked fantastic but you had to stand so close to the wall to get under it, it lacked the luxury feel it could have had. Finally, I ordered a wake up call at the horrible time of 5.20am on a Sunday morning, unfortunately the wake up call was given at 4.50am and then again at 5.20am. Not ideal when every precious minute of sleep counts! If I returned to Dublin for leisure I probably wouldn't stay here, it looks fantastic but for the money I think you can get a bit more comfort elsewhere.",3,2013,08,20
237,Great Stay!,"Enough cannot be said of the Breakfast buffet. Very first class and impressive.
The rooms have a very modern decor, very clean and fresh. Our twin room was quite comfortable.  There are only a handful of rooms with a water view so do all you can to make sure they know of your request to ensure the best success of getting a river view, such as booking it and including it in the remarks and then calling as well.   We had requested one in our remarks, but did not receive. Do not worry that the hotel is across the river, it really won't matter as everyone just walks over the bridge and we were quickly at the temple bar area and Trinity college within 15 minutes. There is a restaurant and bar in the hotel. Parking is self parking in a garage nearby.  Excellent free wifi for guests.  We were provided warm cookies on check-in.  Also I so appreciate the complimentary water and the packet of Bewley's drinking chocolate in the room. I was able to make my own chocolate in the room and my friend made tea.  Happiness. Lastly, a safe area. Would stay again.",5,2013,08,19
237,Good Location,"we just returned from a trip to Ireland and spent two nights at the Morrison. The rooms were clean and small although decent by European standards. real fast was not included with the rooms and the breakfast buffet was pricey for the selection. The best part about this hotel is it is within walking distance to Temple Bar area, and numerous family owned restaurants. We crossed the bridge each morning so that we could eat less expensively which worked out great. Plumbing was a bit of an issue with the toilet breaking down but it was manageable. Go here if you want to be able to walk to attractions and restaurants.",4,2013,08,19
237,Amazing,"Just come back from a three day stay at this hotel. It was the most amazing hotel. From the moment we walked in. We were given a gorgeous choc cookie on arrival which was warm so chocolate was melting. Service was great. Got to our room and it was fantastic, massive room with French windows and balcony. Can't fault a thing. Tea and coffee, slippers dressing gown umbrella. Bed was amazing, plenty of pillows. We had been in room 5 mins and were greeted by chocolates as a happy anniversary from manager which was a really lovely idea. Breakfast was outstanding, sausages and potatoes the best. Staff were polite and so helpful throughout our stay. The location was prime, 5 min walk over bridge and we were at temple bar. We asked to have our room cleaned which was done and even had a lady come in to make sure it had been cleaned correctly. Suburb hotel. Could not fault one thing with it. Perfect for couples. Very plush and worth every penny. Would defo return here in future. Big thank you to all staff who made our weekend :)",5,2013,08,19
237,A stylish hotel,"This hotel is just across the river Liffey, opposite the Temple Bar area that you can reach in 3 minutes by foot.  Quite anonymous from the outside once you enter the building you will notice that design is a big part of the hotel phylosophy. The staff during my entire stay was corteous, professional and always had a smile on his/her face.  Even though on arrival my room was not ready, I was able to check-in, drop my bags and get directions for a walk around. The room was very nice decorated but I am afraid the designer hadn’t kept in mind that storage space is also important for the guests. As much as everything fits in place with a very nice touch, like colour lighting or a little message on the wall, there is very little space to store your personall stuff. I think people staying for a week will have problem. A big flat TV, mini-bar, iron & ironing-board and a good and stable free Wi-Fi where the in room amenities. My room had a river view which was just nice: too bad the window was a dash too small. 
This property offers you a  nice bar and a couple of restaurants: the breakfast was served in the Halo restaurant. Very modern and stylish, the breakfast is set in the common buffet formula: plenty of fresh cold and hot food, nice way of presenting yogurt. Everything you can possibly ask for a breakfast is there. The breakfast stuff looked kind of short though as waiting time for hot drinks was a bit long and on a specific day dirty tables were just 70% of the total but no one seems to bother. Maybe a bad day? I also remember them wanting to charge me for the breakfast that was already included in the room price...
Oh! And they even forgot to make my room one day despite having the card „please clean“ on the door from 10 a.m.
On the 3rd floor there is also a little gym nicely equiped.
No problem with street noise as isolation is well done and you can sleep very well; the beds are also comfy.
From this base you can be in minutes wherever you  like: from the pedestrian street and shopping area on the back to the pubs and entertainment Temple Bar area in the front. A couple of good restaurants are to be found at walking distance.
And as the rest of Dublin this isn’t a cheap destination!",4,2013,08,17
237,Excellent,"Just returned from a three night stay at the Morrison. It's hard to add anything further to the great feedback this Hilton has rightly received. The Staff are really nice from the reception to the bar and restaurant. A special mention to the lovely Russian girl serving in the bar area ( Sorry, I have forgot her name ) whom was really sweet and helpful.A credit to the Hotel. The location is excellent near to shops and local attractions. Breakfast and snacks in bar really enjoyable. It was our 30th wedding anniversary, so asked for a nice room and this was gladly granted. I am  diamond honors member and stayed in suite Room 333 over- looking the river. Large clean beautiful room.
When back in Dublin we will book into this Hotel with out any hesitation. Well done Hilton and thanks.",5,2013,08,15
237,Excellent Hotel in heart of Dublin!,"Stayed only one night in this gem, would have loved to stay longer.  Staff was so friendly and helpful, the design of the public rooms and the guest rooms is fantastic.  Great thought to very detail. Clean and beautiful. Loved the warm cookie upon arrival.  Loved the statue in the breakfast room, enjoyed the gym, just perfect from arrival to departure.  Great location, easy to get anywhere as it's in the very center of Dublin.  Hope to come back one day!",5,2013,08,10
237,The staff over performed,"Paul Donnelly, Marion O'Connor and Papa should be commended for going out of their way to help us retrieve our bags which Aer Lingus decided to hold in Edinburgh because the plane was determined to be overweight. Thanks to The Morrison staff, our Ireland visit was salvaged. When we arrived in Dublin with no bags we were told that it could be up to 72 hours before the bags could be delivered to The Morrison. With plans to train to Galway the next day, 72 hours was going to muck things up royally. In the 24 hours we spent at The Morrison, first Paul, then Marion, then Papa and finally Paul the following morning badgered Aer Lingus into ""rushing"" our bags. Paul must have spent a good hour on the phone trying to crack the secret entry to speak with a live person at Aer Lingus. Marion wrote a precise email to A.L. customer service and Papa also did a follow-up. Paul compted a room service breakfast since we only had carry-on essentials and were a bit tattered. The room was excellent with a view of the River Liffey and the location to central Dublin is spot on. The Morrison deserves your patronage.

237,Expectations met? Yes and yes,"We stayed twice in this remarkable hotel with its enthusiastic staff and caring manager. First time (3 nights) we had a junior suite with a balcony going to the street behind the hotel. Second time (2 nights) we were graciously upgraded to the penthouse suite. This hotel has character. 
I would reflect all previous reviewers with regard to location, design etc. The hotel has re-opened not long ago and not all things were going on smoothly yet. However staff (and managers) are on their way. And all did their best to ensure us a great stay.  We had some encounters with staff and all were doing a very great job. My only negative so far: I found sound isolation from the hallway a bit week so that I could hear talking guests walking by our room.
Notwithstanding I felt right at home here and I would happily return when coming back to Dublin.",4,2013,08,10
237,Fantastic,"Room was huge. The funky decor was enlighteninf. The cookies at check-in was a novelty. Customer service was really friendly. Restaurant was really good as well. Location wise, couldnt have been better, everything was within a radius of 5-10mins walk.",5,2013,08,09
237,Great hotel!,"We had a great three night stay at the Morrison. 
The location was perfect, just across the Liffey from Temple Bar - easy access without the noise! Also easy to get to all the main tourist attractions from here, the hop on hop off bus stops nearby as well.
The hotel has been recently renovated and is all very fresh and modern. 
The first night we were given a disability room but when a change was requested we were given a lovely fourth floor corner room with windows looking out over the city - loved it.
We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel but happily enjoyed eating in little cafes nearby. We did have drinks in the hotel and a meal in The Morrison Grill which was really nice - excellent steak and fish.
The service throughout our stay was exemplary, all the staff were helpful and friendly.
Can highly recommend this inner city hotel as a base for a Dublin stay.",5,2013,08,08
237,Wonderful!,"Our first stop into Dublin- arrived at 5:00am!  The staff was extremely accomodating and friendly.  We asked if we were able to check in early just to get some sleep and although they were fully booked, they provided us with breakfast and told us to come back at 9:00am and we could check in (check in is 3:00pm).  The dinner that evening in the restaurant was superb, all the staff throughout the hotel were very professional, friendly and exceedingly helpful!
The room was great, huge and comfy bed, all was very clean.  Location is ideal for walking and touring Dublin.",5,2013,08,07
237,"Location, location, location!","Great hotel, just over the river from Temple Bar. Nice breakfast - buffet with plenty of choice and an additional menu with things such as pancakes which were very good. Parking was very near to the hotel and if you get your ticket stamped at the hotel you get a discounted price. Be careful with the opening hours if you're leaving early in the morning but you can park outside the hotel in the evening for free.",5,2013,08,06
237,Very nice but a few quirks,"This is a potentially superb hotel in the perfect location opposite the Temple Bar central area on the Liffy.  Recently refurbished, the breakfast area has an arresting statue as the centrepiece and the breakfasts are very good. The rooms are stylish and the beds comfy.  However the hotel has a few quirks which I had a discussion with the manager about.  I will post these here as advice to other travellers.
The signs on the hotel are not obvious, due to planning restraints, so look out for it carefully or you will sail past. The car park is just round the corner
One one towel set is put out in the bathroom, the other is wrapped up in the wardrobe to avoid 'cluttering' the bathroom. 
The switch for the light over the fridge is one of the switches on the far side of the bed. It took us 10 mins to find it.
The is no toaster in the breakfast area. The staff will make toast for you, but you do have to ask",4,2013,08,05
237,Beautiful stay.!,"Just got back from a wedding at the Morrison. Two night stay was bliss... Beds were enormous and comfy.! Breakfast was perfect, full English/irish breakfast if desired or fresh fruit porridge or even smoked salmon. Catered for everyone.! Drinks are pricey but its Dublin after all. City center is pricey everywhere. I'd love a stay here again and would definitely recommend it.! Nice atmosphere all around the hotel especially the bar area.! ",5,2013,08,05
237,Staff that's caring and responsive,"We arrived at the Morrison at 8:30 am on a Saturday.  Our rooms weren't available, but the staff realizing that we'd been up all night on the plane, gave us directions to the nearest Starbucks and agreed to text us as soon as a room was free.  And that they did by noon.  The 3 year old got the first room, but by the time we'd toured Trinity College - a great tour by the way - the rest of the rooms were ready and we got to rest before dinner.  We were a group of 13 taking up 6 rooms and meeting up in the lobby quite often.  The manager Patrick Joyce was present in the lobby and available to solve problems.  We did have a problem in that the true ""handicapped"" room was adjacent to the ballroom and the insulation between the walls was not good.  But when this was brought to the staff's attention, they found us a different, quieter room.  I believe that a good hotel is not a place without problems, but a place where the staff gracefully acknowledges the issues and quickly moves to find a solution!",5,2013,08,04
237,"Fantastic location, modernist interiors, fab room!","First piece of advice - the is absolutely NO SIGNAGE at the hotel nothing at all to indicAte it is a hotel so if like us you are driving and following sat nav... You will be lucky to find it!  We drove past it and it took us 30 mins through the one way system and Dublin's traffic to get back to it. What you should look for is a restaurant called the Morrison Grill - that IS the Hilton hotel!!!
Strangely you get given a hot cookie at check in ....slightly bizarre but welcome!  When we saw our room- it was a wow!  Room 234... Huge modern room. White gloss furniture, massive bed , hidden bright pink lighting and a fabulous bathroom. Felt v comfortable plus we had a view over the Liffey. position can't be beaten - you can walk everywhere from here and the tram is about 30 seconds away.  only reason I didn't give it 5 star was I expected breakfast as had paid €200 a night . I booked the room over the phone but was not told that breakfast wasn't included . Was very surprised to find it wasn't and they wanted €18 each .... A the end of our trip and budget so couldn't stretch to this.  Had I known I would have booked via a hotel site and prob got breakfast for the same price rather than booking direct. Even as hilton honours member there was no upgrade or leeway here..disappointing. 
Would  definitely come again but reading other reviews am not sure if all rooms are this nice?",4,2013,08,03
237,Perfect,"The Morrison is perfectly located literally a two minute walk across the bridge to Temple Bar. Also, there is a LUAS tram red line stop about 200 yards behind the hotel which goes up to Kilmainham. The rooms are bright and modern with free WiFi and all the hotel staff were absolutely spot on. We were also allowed to check in early around 1300. Would definitely pick the Morrison again when visiting Dublin",5,2013,08,03
237,Love it,"I love it! Not so expensive, great location, and you get a warm welcoming with a nice and warm cookie!
Staff it's very friendly. Despite the Pink-purple decor, I like the modern look and feels confirm able. Nice breakfast, cool bar and nice dinner as well. Totally recommend it!",4,2013,07,31
237,Beautiful hotel,"The Morrison is a beautiful hotel within walking distance of most sights in Dublin.  It is immaculately clean with designer rooms, I love the LED lighting. The only downside for me was that the windows don't open but there is air conditioning in the bedrooms.  Lovely big public spaces to relax in.  The room has a good size fridge and hot drink facilities.  I usually find fault with most hotels but not with this one.  My husband found the room on the small side but it was fine by me.  I hope the hotel manage to keep the hotel well maintained instead of the usual scuffed walls and stained carpets that happen.  Would definitely stay again, staff really friendly and helpful.  Beautiful garden area aswell",5,2013,07,31
237,"Lovely room, walking distance to most of Dublin's Major Sights","Beautiful hotel right on the Ha'penny bridge over the Liffey.  Rooms are recently remodeled with good climate control!  Much appreciated during Ireland's recent heat wave.  Staff at the front desk were helpful and always ready with a smile.  They volunteered to arrange an early taxi for me to get to a 6 am flight to London when I asked how long I should allow for the trip to the airport.  The taxi was waiting at the door when I came down to check out. Rooms were clean, comfortable and fully equiped down to an umbrella in case of rain.  A short walk across the river takes you to Temple Bar, Grafton Street, Dublin Castle, and Guiness.  The exercise room was well equiped and maintained with modern equipment, not the cast offs you sometimes see in hotels.  All in all a great place in a vibrant city.",5,2013,07,30
237,Didn't disappoint,"We arrived in Dublin in the morning are were already advised that check in could not be accommodated until at least 3 pm. I've never experienced such a hard and fast condition before, even in larger Hotels. Anyway we ventured out into town for breakies/brunch and checked in around 3 to superior twin. As we had booked a superior double, this was very quickly rectified when pointed out. Very nice and tidy room indeed. My only crit would be that they missed an opportunity to maximise the ample space in the bathroom, i.e. a walk in wet area and bath could have been achieved IMO. The room was very quiet indeed, but I'll come back to that.

We didn't eat in the Hotel , through choice, as Dublin is about more than eating in Hotels. We did, however have some drinks in the very comfortable lounge/bar area which, while being customarily expensive, the ambience more than made up for it with some great staff to look after us.

We had a great late night in Dublin, but having had a great nights sleep we were awoken at 08:30 by some rather boisterous cleaning staff when the sign on the door clearly said ""QUIET"". We checked in at 3 pm, so the least you could do was afford us the luxury of something akin to a 24 hour stay ? A little more in house training required I think.",4,2013,07,30
237,"Great location, wonderful room","This hotel very near the Ha'penny Bridge provides comfort and cleanliness along with stylish decor and luxurious bathrooms. Towels are thick, an umbrella is in the closet and the Bewley's beverages are just perfect. Staff were efficient and welcoming, always ready with a smile. I especially appreciated the latte offered when I was up very early in the lounge",5,2013,07,30
237,So close to everything,"This is a lovely boutique hotel right at the Ha'Penny Bridge over the Liffey in Dublin.  It is modern and comfortable.  The rooms have all the amenities you'd expect and the beds were super comfortable.  We especially enjoyed the full Irish breakfast included in our rate.  It takes you all the way to dinner.  The best thing is that we were able to walk out the door and jump on a ""Hop on/Hop off"" bus to go anywhere in the city.  The staff were always friendly and helpful as well.  Very nice choice for your visit to Dublin.",5,2013,07,30
237,Just perfect,"This hotel had everything we needed: a welcoming staff, air-conditioning (it was hot in Dublin!), great beds, clean room, and a wonderful breakfast!  It was an easy walk to Temple Bar and many other sights. We were so happy with these accommodations, and realized how pampered we'd been after experiencing a few other hotels.",5,2013,07,29
237,the location couldn't have been better,"this hotel did the trick for our stay in dublin.  the beds were comfortable, the room was clean, large enough for the two of us and the bathroom albeit a bit awkwardly laid out it definitely worked just fine.  the staff was very attentive and helpful.  we had an issue with the a/c unit upon check in and it was quickly fixed without issue.  as stated the location of this hotel could not have been better and it is true.  you are just across the river liffey from temple bar (i would recommend a visit the porterhouse for a pint of their plain porter, it is better than guinness).  it is also conveniently located to trinity college, the guinness storehouse and many other sites worth visiting while in dublin.  i would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,07,29
237,Wonderful experience - location and people!,"We just returned from our European travels, with our last stop being Dublin, and felt compelled to add our thoughts to tripadvisor because of the wonderful experience we had at The Morrison.  First and foremost, every staff member we encountered was genuinely pleasant and personable - every single staff member!  Our room was great - had everything a traveler would need including a bathrobe and slippers!  The breakfast (served from 7:00-10:30) was a buffet with many options but there were some cook-to-order menu items available, as well.  The central location gave us easy access (by walking) to most of the sites in Dublin.  We would definitely stay here again!!",5,2013,07,29
237,Super Hotel!!,"We stayed in this wonderful hotel for two nights last week. Check in was fast, professional and very friendly. Irish hospitality!! Our junior suite was large with a huge bathroom. I mean HUGE with a bath tub and a great rainfall shower enclosure. The toiletries are nice brand names and there were several towels and wash clothes wrapped together by  nice ribbons. Well done!
The room has modern furniture all in white decorated with lights in fuchsia. There were two throw pillows in the same color. Over the top!! My wife called it bordello pink(as if she has ever been in one. ""Movies,"" she says.) 
The two bottles of water were replenished every day and the tea and coffee set up is super with high grade teas and coffees as well as with a kettle and coffee mugs (no foam cups here).
Free internet/wi fi access is another super feature of this wonderful hotel. If we ever come back to Dublin guess where would like to stay.",5,2013,07,29
237,Perfect Location and Amenities,This is a gorgeous hotel right in the heart of Dublin. We could walk everywhere. Very close to the temple bar area but on the other side of the water - so no noise from it. The hotel rooms are very current and nicely outfitted - very new. Really felt up-scale.,5,2013,07,28
237,wedding,"my son had his reception here on saturday 27th july 2013, he married his partner and didnt want the traditional style dinner so went for a bbq, the food was excellent good choice and the staff could not have done anymore to make the day go better, it was great from start to finish. The room was really airey and bright with a courtyard, I would highly recommend the hotel, the rooms are stunning and they think of everything, so if you are looking for something a bit different i would recomend the bbq",5,2013,07,28
237,Great location!,"We stayed at the Morrison for 3 nights. The location is excellent right by the Liffey. Cross a bridge and you are in the Temple Bar area. Walking distance to several attractions like Trinity College, and Jameson distillery. Quick check in and out. Helpful staff, and excellent breakfast with a la carte menu included. The room was clean and comfortable, but the bathroom needs a little updating. Cab ride from the airport is about 25 euros. Would likely stay here again.",4,2013,07,28
237,"Very Nice Property In Dublin, Well Maintained, and Competitive","Stumbled across this property on a side trip to Dublin; what a pleasant surprise. Professionally run, good food, pleasant, attentive but unobtrusive staff. And much more competitively priced, paid around 135/night; Centrally located right of the Quay on the river Liffey.
I would stay there again in a heartbeat. Great irish breakfast in the am too; it comes as an optional add on to the room rate.
Very smart environmental design; these folks run the entire room circuit when you place your swipe card into a card reader inside the room.
No burning the lights, or heat when no one is there. About time someone thought of this.
They have a basic internet option for no extra charge; it was more than adequte for checking email, etc. We didn't have a western europe plug adapter, so they provided us one; so long as you return it, they won't charge for it. For once, a hotel that doesn't gouge you every which way with forced upcharges for internet service, or basic comfort items. They will get my business again, and that of my friends.",5,2013,07,27
237,"Good location, upscale rooms.","The rooms were modern, clean and well furnished. The staff were pleasant.  The best part was the location, close to tourist areas and with many options for good nearby (try the little coffee shop on the corner for cheap and excellent eats!). The hotel bar/breakfast were really expensive. ",5,2013,07,27
237,Wonderful hotel in perfect location,"My partner & I stayed for one night thurs-fri. The entrance is a little bit confusing to find. The female staff member who checked us in was lovely & we chatted with a male staff member also (possibly the manager). A warm Irish welcome was received along with a fresh warm cookie - nice touch as it was possibly the best I've ever tasted! Stayed in room 118. Spotlessly clean & comfortable. It had a small balcony overlooking a side street - not perfect but hey we wasn't planning on sitting in the room. The weather was glorious which I must say is unheard of in Ireland ha. A quick walk over the bridge and you come to temple bar. If you was to leave the hotel and turn left you'd be on o'connell street. We walked over to the Guinness storehouse tour in 15 mins. Brilliant central location. Everything within a few minutes walk but quiet enough to enjoy a good nights kip. 

The breakfast was fab! Lots of fresh fruit salad, yogurts & granola, cereals, dried fruit, breads, cheese, smoked salmon, porridge, scrambled eggs (delicious), sausage, bacon, mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, black & white pudding, potatoes...plus you can order anything off the menu - eggs benedict, omelette etc, Danish pastries & muffins were also available plus every kind of jam/ conserve. Fruit juices, tea, coffees, herbal teas. Cannot go wrong ! The staff were really nice. The only downside was we don't eat pork and there were no veggie sausages but with a selection like that we had plenty to choose from and left very satisfied :) 

Lovely lady checked us out swiftly & the hotel stored our bags until we were ready to catch our 7pm flight. Can't wait to come back :) 

",5,2013,07,27
237,Wonderful Welcom,"A pleasure to stay at such a wonderful hotel in Dublin.  We arrived early, and they stored our luggage while we explored the surrounding area.  It was nice to have air condition during the ""Irish heatwave.""  But, the best part was the blueberry muffin at breakfast--moist, blueberry and not too sweet.  The rooms were clean and inviting as well as slippers, bathrobes and toiletries.  I would certainly return the next time I am in Dublin.",5,2013,07,26
237,Afternoon Tea Delight,"I've been away travelling for 1 year and when I arrived home,as you can imagine I had alot of friends to catch up with. What better way to do it than over Afternoon Tea. 

With it's central location and excellent reputation,we chose The Morrison. Upon checking up their menu online,I couldn't believe my eyes...€18 for Afternoon Tea-BARGAIN! Most of their 4/5 Star competitors charging €25+

Staff were attentive & friendly without being over bearing. Our waitress explained our courses & their selection in great detail. 

The food was delicious-lots of choices & all so tasty. We all came away full which in Afternoon Tea standards is very unusual. 

I would highly reccomend The Morrison Hotel for Afternoon Tea or even just a spot of lunch/casual drink...a gem in the city! ",5,2013,07,25
237,Great location,Hotel is in a great location and the staff was amazing.  Internet was difficult to get into on one of our phones.  The warm cookie was a nice welcome after a long trip. The rooms were very clean and quiet.  Had a great sleep after visiting all the local spots.,5,2013,07,25
237,"Clean, quiet, upscale facility",Stayed here 2 nights before a group tour.  Excellent location across the river from Temple Bar area. Seems like recently renovated.  Highly recommend staying here.  New furnishings thru entire hotel. Staff very helpful.,5,2013,07,24
237,Extremely Accomodating,"Honestly, you should probably just stop reading this review, and book this hotel if you are thinking about staying here.

We arrived via an overnight flight, and got to the hotel at 6am.  I was very doubtful we would be able to check in, and sure enough, all their rooms were full.  We left our bags, got breakfast, and came back and were waiting in the lobby, when one of the managers working the front desk must have took pity on our poor tired selves.  They had a single room they said we could use while our room was being prepared.  This was such a welcome surprise, as we were dead tired.  I cannot thank them enough.  Later we changed rooms once our king room was ready.  We were extremely happy with our time at the Morrison.

The rooms were a good size. Staff was very friendly.  Location is ideal.  I cannot imagine a better spot in Dublin.",5,2013,07,24
237,Lovely hotel in an unbeatable location!,"Only stayed one night on the journey back to the States, but a great night it was. The hotel just re-opened in February under the Doubletree flag (Hilton Gold here), and I booked two rooms with points (one for me, the other for my parents). From the very first moment I knew we were in for a lovely stay. We arrived around 11 am, and were fully prepared to drop our luggage, go to lunch and return at check in time. Not only were two rooms ready but the super friendly front desk arranged it so that the rooms were close to each other on the same floor. The rooms are quite big by European standards and very well appointed with A/C, which was welcomed as Ireland was in the midst of a freaky heat wave. Oh and the water pressure in the shower was awesome. The location is great in that it's tucked down a side street (read: quiet) however in walking distance to both Temple Bar (head right out of the hotel and take the Ha'penny Bridge across the Liffey) and Henry Street if you head left. My parents had never been to the Temple Bar area, so we strolled around and had a nice lunch (see my review of Luigi Malones). We did have the opportunity that night to have some food in the hotel (see my review of Quay 14) and it was very good. Our room included breakfast, and boy oh boy what a breakfast. Full Irish of course but also cereal, pastries, meats and cheese, yogurt, fruit, even porridge. You can get eggs cooked to order and omlettes too. If you go hungry at this breakfast, it's your own fault!! Will definitely stay again when I return to Dublin!",4,2013,07,24
237,Excellent Location and Helpful Staff,"We stayed 3 nights in Dublin and The Morrison was a perfect hotel for our needs. 

The location can't be beat. It's right in the middle of everything you want to cover in Dublin. We walked everywhere and loved the idea of being across the river from Temple Bar without the noise. When I say across the river - it's a small bridge and a 5-10 walk to Temple Bar.
 
It's not the traditional large scale chain hotel. It's a small to average lobby and has 5 to 6 floors. The staff was always helpful and our room was fabulous! It's modern in theme (neither boutique nor B&B themed) so don’t be expecting quilts or traditional wood furnishings.  I loved it and again the location is perfect. 

I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Dublin. Great choice!",5,2013,07,23
237,Great Location,"Stayed recently to attend a concert in the O2 and as I know from past experience it is a superb location for the hotel, close to Temple Bar, Grafton Street and Henry Street and very close to the LUAS line. The hotel recently underwent a makeover and the renovators have done a great job on the rooms and the public areas.

I also like the friendliness of the staff and especially the bar staff, great welcome and a nice chatty style.

The downsides for me were the poor air condition system in the rooms, it really did not bring the temperature down enough for my liking. The other little niggle was the pillows, I found they were too high for my liking but that is my personal preference. And finally a room for the night is not cheap but I suppose you are paying for the location.",4,2013,07,23
237,Double Tree experience,"Excellent facility but welcome staff need some more training to appreciate how valuable paying guests are. Cleaning and dining staff are excellent, the position of the hotel is excellent for all of the Dublin attractions.",4,2013,07,23
237,"Great hotel, excellent location","Stayed two nights at the Morrison.  The hotel was recently updated, very clean, and run by a very friendly and helpful staff.  The bed was a bit firm, but acceptable.  Free wifi and great A/C were a plus. 

The location was excellent.  The walk to Temple Bar was about one minute over the river.  A 15 minute walk east will get you to the Tara St. DART station, which can take you out to the coast. 

Overall, great hotel.  I would definitely stay again in the future. 
",5,2013,07,22
237,Nice Stopover Hotel,"I was going to be in Dublin for what amounted to be 10 hours, so I chose The Morrison as my hotel.  I was getting into the city that evening and flying out early the next morning, so I had considered staying at an airport hotel.  I'm so happy that I stayed at The Morrison instead.

If you only have a few hours to enjoy the city, this is a great place to be.  We were greeted with great service and warm cookies.  Check-in took maybe 5 minutes, and that included setting up a wake-up call and booking a cab to the airport for the next morning.  We dumped our bags in our room (which was very nice - clean, etc.) and headed across the Ha'Penny Bridge to enjoy a pint and live music at a nearby pub.  The location really let us experience the essence of Dublin in a short amount of time, and the hotel was a very pleasant place to stay.

For anyone who might be deterred by the pink/purple/blue color themes... don't be.  All of the lights turn off with the click of a switch.",4,2013,07,22
237,"Great place, safe, easy acess to Dublin","This place is just across the river walking bridge to Temple Bar area in London. Behind the hotel is the mall and shopping district. It's a great location, easy walking access to everything, and just really, really nice. It's worth the price.",5,2013,07,22
237,The room with no view!,"We spent a night here at the beginning of June, I was really looking forward to a night away, just the two of us and was really looking forward our first  night at The Morrison.....I couldn't wait to leave....We stay in the city a lot and love to try different hotels...this was my worst hotel room ever...in any city..................

We were checked in by Paul, one got the impression he' d rather be somewhere else but put on the receptionists face because he had to..not my cup of tea...and although it was late when we checked in and was one of the hottest evenings/nights of the year he thoughtlessly sent us to a room I can only advise should be turned into a storage room immediately...I will never forget it... ROOM 136.......It had a window....with opaque glass,you couldnt open(surely a fire hazard) and hideous glass bedside lockers..and it was tiny...I literally couldn't breath..however we needed to eat and didn't bother saying anything as we were tired and felt it was only for one night so it literally wasn't worth getting agitated about and by the time we got back to it it might be better/cooler....IT WASN'T....I woke at 6 am and counted the hours to get out of it and wondered how anyone in reservations on a really hot night in the Capital would dream of using this room...it definately would not have appeared to be down to full capacity as the bar was lifeless with no atmosphere whatsoever and the hotel just felt like it was trying too hard....and losing....AWFUL....

On the plus side it is in a fairly good location beside Dublins ""Italian Quarter"" and I'm sure some of the rooms facing onto the Liffey(I wouldn't know..)might be airier..with windows with glass..that open.....the breakfast room was airy/modern and breakfast is served til 12 midday and the staff there seemed pleasant.. 

We will not be returning or recommending it to anyone....book with caution and make sure the room allocated is not on this corridor! There's far better hotels in Dublin in the same price range... we stayed in The Fitzwilliam the following night and it was a totally different experience from start to finish.....",2,2013,07,21
237,"Great location, fun decor","Perfect location across the Liffey from Temple Bar, Grafton St shopping and Trinity College campus. Far enough away from the action to be quiet in the evening. Recently remodeled in a fun, hipster decor. Great beds, shower, and breakfast!",5,2013,07,21
237,Located in the heart of Dublin,"The hotel is located on the banks of the River Liffey and only a few steps across from the quarter of Temple Bar.
Recently refurbished rooms offer a very comfortable staying a very stylish place with a discerning atmosphere. 
Breakfest is served in the Halo room complete with it’s eye-catching Birdman sculpture and high ceilings that rise to the second floor.",5,2013,07,21
237,Morrison Hotel,The hotel once again didn't disappoint. Following it's take-over by Hilton the customer service and chilled relaxed atmosphere is still second to none. The bar area now has a resident DJ playing chilled out Ibiza type vibe. A relaxed haven in the middle of a bustling Dublin!,5,2013,07,19
237,Excellent siteseeing location,"Although somewhat difficult to locate, this hotel is a good location for any visit to Dublin. The rooms are lovely, fully appointed and very comfortable. The staff were helpful and friendly. In particular, the breakfast dining room and the bar staff were extremely engaging and helpful. Highly recommended.",5,2013,07,19
237,"Nice Hotel, difficult to find...","We stayed at the DoubleTree two nights while in Dublin. The hotel was very difficult to find. It's right near the city center on the water, but it isn't marked from the main street.   The rooms were nice (we weren't upgraded) and clear. The beds are firm, but nice. I didn't care for the linens on the bed though.   We chose the breakfast buffet and it was delicious!   Overall, we stayed on points so I can't complain, but this hotel was lacking - not what I expect from a DoubleTree.",3,2013,07,18
237,Perfect location for sightseeing!,"A great experience overall- every staff member we encountered, from the concierge to the waitstaff at breakfast, was incredibly friendly and helpful. The location is ideal for those interested in exploring the city- it's a stones throw from temple bar, yet completely quiet at night. Would absolutely stay here again during future trips to Dublin. ",5,2013,07,16
237,Close but not too close,"Just checked out of The Morrison and we were pleasently surprised. The room was excellently decorated and well stocked with all you'd need for a couple nights in Dublin. 

The location was the best, a few blocks from all the happening places in Dublin, but far enough that it was quiet at night. 

Thanks for the upgraded room!  We enjoyed every minute of our stay here ... Can't wait to return. ",5,2013,07,15
237,First Class Hotel,"Want to stay in a first class hotel that's right where the action can be found? This is it. Beautifully decorated, friendly staff and spotless hotel is right on the River Liffey and across from the Temple Bar area. It was an easy walk to many Dublin sights too. We enjoyed the food, especially the breakfasts and afternoon teas. All in all, this is one of the best places we have ever booked.",5,2013,07,14
237,Mostly great!,"We loved:

*the location
*the top notch air conditioning during a very warm period
*the customer service
*the fun decor
*the meal we had in the bar

We wished:

*that it was quieter---seagulls, people yelling in the alley, drunken girls returning from the pub!  
*that there was a little more storage space in the rooms

Overall we liked it and we would stay here again.",4,2013,07,13
237,Central Dublin Location & First Class,"Stayed here two nights using HHonors points (a lot of 'em!).  To begin with, we were very pleased with the location.  It's on the north bank of the Liffey River (Ormand Quay) at Jervis Street... just cross the bridge to enter the Temple Bar area, walk a little farther to Trinity College, the greens, etc.  It's also only a 10-minute walk (or less) over to O'Connell Street.  If you do the on/off-bus thing, you can pick up your tickets and start your tour there.  If you've got a car, there's parking at 12 Euro/night (not bad for central Dublin) just a block from there hotel too, but given the traffic and crazy driving in central Dublin, I wouldn't take it out of the lot unless you must!  The hotel itself is very nice - much better than the standard Doubletree in the U.S.  The rooms are ""European-smallish"" but quite nicely renovated/decorated.  I was a little disappointed that, despite my gold HHonors status and the 100,000 points I was using, we didn't get an upgrade to a room with any sort of view (we looked into a wall and a dingy alleyway); fortunately, we weren't spending much time in the hotel anyway.  Nice shower, comfortable bed, reasonably quiet, very clean, good breakfast, reasonably efficient/knowledgeable staff at the reception desk.  Oh, and the bar/restaurant area looked comfortable and nice, too, though we never spent any time there.  All in all, a very nice hotel in a great location for walking the city.",5,2013,07,08
237,Great location -- very nice hotel!,"We spent 2 evenings at the Morrison going to/from London during a recent vacation.  The staff was extremely courteous, the breakfast was outstanding, and our rooms were very nice.  We arrived at 10am for our second stay and the desk staff worked to find us a room -- which turned out to be a larger room to go along with the very early check-in.  The hotel is in a great location -- just across the river from the Temple Bar area and walking distance to St. Patrick's, Trinity College, etc.",5,2013,07,08
237,Fantastic hotel,"Absolutely brilliant hotel,cannot recommend enough.Situated on the River Liffey with shopping area to the rear of the hotel and just across the half penny bridge is Grafton Street and Temple Bar.
The rooms are gorgeous and the staff so friendly,our hot chocolate cookie at check in was much appreciated.
Wea te in the restaurant on our last night and the meal and service was excellent and very good value.
On any return trip to Dublin this will be the only hotel we will be booking.
Well done Morrison.",5,2013,07,08
237,Nice reliable hotel,"We chose to stay here because we could get a free night in Dublin.  It was a nice hotel with great accomodations.  I appreciated the helpfullness of the staff recommending food options and they were spot on. My only complaint was that the walls/windows were so thin, we could hear the partying going on at the apartment complex across the street.  It wasn't bad enough to deter a future stay or impact our current stay.  The hotel is right in the heart of the city making it easy to get to any tourist attraction, food, shopping, and temple bar area.  I would not hesitate to stay there in the future.",5,2013,07,08
237,Avoid this Hotel,"We stayed in this Hotel in June 2013, the front office were the worst we have seen in 8 weeks of travel. The morning of our departure was very stressful with poor car parking and hotel staff other than Papa who was fantastic and eventually sorted out the issues caused by the front office team. This hotel was the worst we have stayed in during our holiday",2,2013,07,07
237,Outstanding,"I recently stayed at this hotel and was overwhelmed by the incredible staff. I had injured myself in Dublin, and the hotel staff went out of their way to make me comfortable. The restaurant is topshelf-very gourmet for today's foodies. The beds are scrumptious, the rain head shower, the top-notch location  and the magnificent orchids all blend together to make a lovely hotel.",5,2013,07,06
237,"Modern, Clean, Very Convenient","I stayed at the Morrison for 6 nights at the end of June and very much enjoyed every night!

A very convenient location for exploring Dublin and to get to from both the train stations as well as the airport.  Just two blocks via a pedestrian shopping alley from the Jervis Luas tram stop and Jervis Shopping Ctr.  There is a handy M&S food mart in that center as well as a SPAR convenience store right at the tram stop to pick up some sodas to keep in the minibar fridge in the room.

I was able to walk everywhere - the HOHO bus stop, the pick up point for my day tours out to Blarney/Cork and a Celtic History tour, Trinity College, National Library and Museums, and O'Connell and Grafton streets.

The hotel is new and modern.  I got a purple room overlooking the Liffey.  While the river tended to be at low tide most of the time I was looking at it, it was nice to be able to open the window for the sights and sounds along the riverbanks.

Just be aware as you're trying to get in, the entrance on Lower Ormond Quay is actually for the Grill - while you can get in through there, it feels a bit strange.  The hotel entrance is on the side road just before the next cross street.",5,2013,07,06
237,Excellent hotel in Dublin,"Excellent hotel - very well loctaed in Central Dublin. Just across the river from Temple Bar area - 5 minuted walk. a minute walk from the shopping area.
Very modern.
Great spacious room, very clean and quiet! lovely breakfast and friendly, efficient staff",5,2013,07,05
237,Close to Everything,"This hotel is in such a great location to experience all of Dublin's sights. 2 minute walk to the Templar Bar district, well known for it's pubs & cafe's. After 33 hours of travelling we arrived at the hotel but because we were too early to check in they offered to take all our baggage and gave us hot chocolate cookies, very delicious and kept us going for the afternoon.
The decore is very purple and pink but the room was very clean and 'white'. We were on the top floor and had amazing river views. There was also a movie being filmed on our floor called 'Love, Rosie' - which wasn't disruptive at all.",4,2013,07,05
237,"Great Location, Rooms and Staff!","We stayed at the Morrison during a recent visit to Dublin, with friends. Check in was a great experience;we were greeted by a helpful, friendly, and welcoming staff. We met Kerrie Johnson at the desk at this time,and throughout our stay, she went out of her way to make our stay wonderful.Every member of the staff we encountered here was friendly,spoke with us, and were truly interested in our experience at this property.
The rooms are good sized and colorful; there is ample room to move around, the bed is comfortable, and the bathroom is large and well appointed. Housekeeping kept our room clean,and were glad to bring us extra pillows.
If you are a light sleeper, be sure to request a room on the inner courtyard, when you book with the hotel. If a little bit of noise at night doesn't bother you, you will sleep well (as my husband did). Our second night, Kerrie was able to find us a room on the courtyard, and it was peaceful, which made for a good night's rest.
The bar area,and its' staff, is lively and fun.The bar seating is relaxing, and lends itself to conversation. We sat at the bar one rainy afternoon and had a great time talking with the engaging bartenders, who also made sure our drinks were perfect, and the service was top notch.
Our first morning, our friend misunderstood that breakfast was not included in our room price. He assured us it was, and we ordered coffee, to look at the menu. We asked again about the inclusion of breakfast, and found it was not included for us, but they graciously comped our coffee, with a smile.
The hotel location is prime. A quick walk across the bridge to Temple Bar,and block from a lot of shopping and restaurants, on the hotel side of the bridge, too. There is a large indoor shopping mall area only a block away, as well as a train stop, and a quick mart only a block and a half away,too.
If you're looking for comfort, excellent customer service, and a perfect location, book The Morrison today!",5,2013,07,04
237,Aspiring to be Something It's Not,"We stayed at the Morrison for the weekend - its trying to be a trendy upmarket hotel. It has the interiors, well designed and pretty chic BUT unfortunately it doesn't have the staff to match.

Pros

Location - 5 minute walk to Temple Bar and 10 minutes to Grafton Street

Rooms - great size and very comfortable

Bar - good bar, good cocktails and wine list, busy in evenings with music

Cons

Service - understaffed. Room was never cleaned, bed not made and towels not changed the whole weekend.

Noise - impossible to sleep with shouting and noise outside till 3am

Don't take a riverfront room!!

To be fair to management I did complain (which I never do) and had my bar bill knocked off!",2,2013,07,04
237,Great hotel experience,"The hotel is in a brilliant location, within walking distance for many of the main tourist attractions. The cookies offered at reception when checking in are really tasty and welcoming after walking to the hotel from the bus stop in the pouring rain. The hotel room was very spacious and fairly quiet to say it is in the centre of the city. Breakfast also very nice with plenty of selection. Overall a pleasant trip and would definitely go again. ",5,2013,07,04
237,Tasty Cookie,"Good hotel, clean, comfortable, friendly staff, good location, would stay again.  Breakfast is very nice with healthy options as well as the usual fare of full irish breakfast.  The staff are very friendly.",4,2013,07,04
237,Worth its 5-star rating,Everything one can expect from an inner-city five-star hotel plus unlimited chocolate-chip cookies! The included breakfast included every possibility—the most impressive breakfast buffet I've ever experienced in a non-resort hotel. ,5,2013,07,01
237,Chic and hip; steps from Ha'penny Bridge,"If you want a central Dublin hotel that is decently priced, very clean and modern, the Morrison is the place.  I only stayed here one night and wish it had been longer.  The rooms are very large and the bar is very hip and modern, which was a nice contrast to the tradition Irish pub--don't worry, they have Guinness on tap!  The staff are wonderful and the housekeeping excellent.",4,2013,06,30
237,OK,Ok for location. Check in guy had a bit of an attitude which after a delay I could have done without. Also had to get maintainance out due to blown fuse in bathroom. I think there is better value around.,3,2013,06,30
237,The Penthouse Suite,"Double tree has surpassed it's standards. This is a truly remarkable experience, chilling with the bose surround sound playing softly in each room of your choice. Soaking in a bath that can fit three while enjoying a good glass of the fine stuff and then as the day turns into night walking out on to the balcony and seeing Dublin lit up with the river down below. 

Quality in every part of the suite and attention to detail in a way that just cries out excellence, nothing has been left unnoticed, no dust or dirt anywhere. Just one very well choreographed suite that is kept to the highest standards with a cheeky Nespresso machine to give it the finishing touch. 

The staff surpass themselves, again nothing is too much effort and they pride themselves in the knowledge of the town and where to go as well as the hotel and all of the facilities including the interaction of the smart screen TV's, blu ray and Bose. 

Looking forward to our next stay in a truly remarkable place.",5,2013,06,28
237,"Great Stay, Great Location","As a first-timer to Dublin, not much more could have been better about our stay at the Morrison. The location is absolutely ideal. It's in walking distance to every major site, but just far enough away to pass on the bustle of over-touristy streets (i.e. Temple Bar). Customer service was great, the rooms large and very well kept, and the cookies at the front desk were delicious! Great stay!",5,2013,06,28
237,WOW!,"It's the first time for me that the hotel adv. pictures looks less good then the actual.
Special place, good service which includes all the little things which make your stay special - The welcome cookies, the water at the room, the smart TV and more.",5,2013,06,27
237,Excellent experience,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Morrison, and couldnt recommend it highly enough.
The staff we all lovely and friendly and made our stay seemless with their proficient service. the welcome cookie is a nice touch too!
The location is great, right on the river in the middle of town, so everything is within walking distance.
The Quay 14 bar is very good, offering a wide selection of drinks and a very impressive cocktail menu. the food is good too.
The room was excellent, large with a huge bed to crash out on!",5,2013,06,25
237,We expected more.,"We stayed at the Morrison for seven nights, based mostly on the stellar reviews on Trip Advisor.  To say we were disappointed would be an understatement.  Paul checked us in - and being Hilton Gold, we expected and deserved an available upgrade.  (According to HHonor's policy.) Paul stated that ""executive rooms are for the guests who PAY for that upgrade - and they are reserved for business customers.""  Sorry, Paul, but that is NOT Hilton Honors policy.  When we told him that we were willing to change rooms if a better room became available over the length of our stay, he later that day suggested a room change - to a SMALLER room!  Unbelievable! Our stay went down from there.  
This remodel, which has been touted as making the hotel so much better than it was, is a case of FORM over function.  This is a pretentious mess of a hotel.  Examples?  I have MANY.  The lobby LOOKED fairly inviting, until you realized there is really no comfortable place to sit.  The business center, which is standard these days in Hilton properties, is ONE computer and ONE printer on a book shelf in the lobby - at which you must STAND - in the open lobby - BY THE FRONT DOOR - to access and use.  No, I'm not kidding.   If there is another business center for their ""business guests"" - we certainly were not made aware of it. The room we were in, room 229, had a LONG worthless hallway IN THE ROOM, and a HUGE bathroom which was almost useless, not to mention very, very dangerous!  Why?  Glad you asked.  The floors of the bathroom are ceramic 12-inch tiles which, even when dry, were slippery ALL THE TIME!  In your bare or ""sock feet"" - they were an ice skating rink.  When wet, they were even worse.  The sink was huge - with a tiny faucet which leaked non-stop - and when you tried to rinse your hands, the water just rushed up onto the counter because of the faucet's position on the sink.  The bathroom also had one of those DEEP tubs that are scary to try to get in and out of!  There was very little water pressure, which was made even worse because of the ""rain shower"" NON-adjustable shower head.  There was no ""American-style"" plug-in receptacle in the whole room, which is unusual for a recently updated hotel.  There were only two places to plug in a hairdryer or places to style your hair, which were outside of the bathroom of course.  But there were NO MIRRORS by the plug-ins. Instead, they had a pretentious ""saying"" on the wall.  Form over function. GIVE ME A MIRROR SO I CAN STYLE MY HAIR, please and forget the prose!  There were ""trendy"" little uncomfortable chairs instead of a couch in the room, and no bureau drawers for your clothes. This room had a closet and a lame little pull out drawer from the desk that was - no exaggeration, less than two inches deep.  Again - not kidding.  There was water damage to an entire piece of floor molding which gave the room a run-down look.  Another example of ""form over function""??  They tie a ribbon around ONE bath towel, ONE hand towel, and have ONE wash towel in the bathroom - for TWO people.  They have another ""ribbon tied"" set above the closet outside the bathroom.  Really?  Forget the ribbon and simply GIVE me enough towels!  In the BATHROOM!  There was no ice maker on ANY floor.  You had to order ice to be sent to your room, which we TRIED to do at 6:00 p.m. the first night we were there.  It never came.  Now, you may be wondering if we made the hotel staff aware of our displeasure.  We did within 30 minutes of arriving.  When we went downstairs to start sightseeing, Paul asked us how we liked our room.  I asked him if he REALLY wanted to know.  He said he did.  He took notes on everything I mentioned in this review, and then changed nothing.  He said he would ""pass along"" the concerns to the hotel manager. The manager didn't contact us.
Now - there were some good things about the hotel.  Location was great.  Beds were fine - but with small, bad pillows.  The housekeeping staff did a good job. The breakfast was fantastic - and we received friendly and efficient service from Valeria every morning.  She deserves a raise!  Daniel at the front desk was friendly and helpful during our stay.  Our check out was easy.  
I guess we expected too much - like an upgrade for Gold HHonors and a ""livable"" room that did more than simply LOOK good.  Think twice before you stay here.  You will be treated better - for far less - at Bewleys.",3,2013,06,23
237,This is a true 4-star hotel - even by American standards,"We stayed here 3 nights and could easily walk everywhere - great location!  I would stay here again and recommend this hotel to friends and family.  Something to be aware of is that the standard twin room is small; but, luckily, we were upgraded to a larger twin room tucked away so we didn't get much noise from the hallway but there was some street noise.  The breakfast was very good - the best we had in four 4 or 5 star hotels all over Ireland.  The staff were very good at addressing quickly to any issues we had.  Overall, a great 4-star hotel especially since other 4 star hotels we stayed at were at best comparable to a 3-star hotel by American standards.  The hotel decor reminded me of the W Hotels.",5,2013,06,22
237,Fantastic location,"This hotel was excellent and well appointed.  However, a couple of things let it down such as poor water pressure in the shower head (water only came out of half of it and at a trickle), the AC did not function properly and the TV seemed to have interference from the wi-fi it emitted for your hand held devices. 

It was very well located with the Jervis Shopping Centre only a few minutes away and other shops such as Arnotts and Debenhams. Our room overlooked the Liffey River and also you could see over to the Temple Bar area which was only 5 minutes walk over several handy foot bridges.

Breakfast was lavish with the ability to order from a menu, however the service was slow due to them being busy, but the buffet was sufficient. All in all a great hotel but not 5 star due to some issues.",4,2013,06,22
237,A five star stay!,I spent a week vacationing at this hotel with my mom and we loved it!  The room was spacious and modern with fantastic amenities.  The location was perfectly located for touring Dublin and the staff were very friendly.  We ate breakfast in the hotel most morning which was delicious and we had dinner in the restaurant one evening with my mom stating it was the best steak she has eaten.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who asked.  ,5,2013,06,22
237,EVERYTHING TOP CLASS,"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights for my 30th birthday. The hotel was fantastic. The staff couldn't be nicer or more helpful! We got upgraded to a beautiful suite room as it was my birthday, and even had a plate with little cakes as a birthday treat. Any questions and they were happy to help out with information on places to go, bus routes etc. The hotel was very clean, and fantastic location for walking into temple bar. Would defiantly recommend this hotel to friends and family.",5,2013,06,20
237,Top Spot,If you are going to Dublin this is a great place to stay and its only a short walk to the Porterhouse Brewery!  The Hilton team really looked after my party (5) and we all thoroughly enjoyed our stay  Would return if I got the chance and stay same place as first choice,5,2013,06,19
237,"Great Hotel, Perfect Location","We stayed at the Morrison for a 4-day stop in Dublin recently and were nothing but pleased with our hotel choice.  The hotel is very conveniently located for walking/access to everywhere in Dublin and yet it is situated in a relatively quiet spot.  Our room was large, quiet, we could manage the temperature easily, the King bed was a true King and very comfortable, and the bathroom was large and functioned and everything was very clean, all around.  The staff - particularly check in/concierge was particularly helpful and friendly.  Will recommend to friends/family traveling to Dublin, and would stay there again.",5,2013,06,19
237,Perfection in this hotel!,"Location, service, friendliness, room, breakfast. . .I can think of nothing that needs to be improved.  Keep up the good work setting the standard and never get complacent!  Our room was quiet and dark even on the Liffey in summer.",5,2013,06,18
237,Really lovely experience,"We stayed at the Morrison for a weekend break,  Loved the wall art poetry, the bed was enormous, staff were friendly, breakfast was awesome.  If I had to really look for something negative, the toilet was very low and I could see someone older having difficulties but apart from that it was perfect.",5,2013,06,17
237,Very pleasant stay,Stayed here for two nights on a business trip. The hotel is very conveniently located to access the city centre. Impeccable and very friendly service and I loved their freshly baked bread and pastries.,5,2013,06,17
237,Doubletree in Dublin was great,"great location, great staff, good room with an excellent view over the water - and we got an early check-in too! everything worked, and we were on the fourth (top) floor - ripper!! room was quiet, while being in the centre of all the action",4,2013,06,16
237,Good location,"This hotal has very good location at Dublin. Can easy to the downtown by foot.  Also It have clean environment incloud lobby and room. But , there have a noise of the garbage truck every morning. I hope can stay here when I come back to Dublin.",4,2013,06,16
237,Great experience.,We had our gathering in limerick and dublin.   What a great way to end it in the morrison hotel.  Could not fault anything very comfortable. Great food.  Excellent location.   Staff really friendly. Thanks we had a great craic. ,5,2013,06,14
237,Perfect setting in a ever so nice city,"Wht a great hotel: off course nice beds and bathroom, which you would expect in any 5*hotel, but what made this hotel great is the furnishing of the hotel.
The nicest poems everywhere, the colors white-grey-purple-green, the furniture itself.

I'm planning of redecorating my house myself and in The Morrison I found the style I want.

Also, great food in the hotel restaurant, and excellent service.

We got a fresh baked cookie when arriving, and even that was great. I will definitly go back!",5,2013,06,13
237,A pleasant stay,"We went for a few days to Dublin and stayed here. Very spacious ,very friendly staff. Easy walking distance from the centre and several attractions. Excellent breakfast and cocktail menu. Our room overlooked the side street and was pleasantly quiet at night.",4,2013,06,13
237,Wonderful Experience,"Stayed at The Morrison for 3 nights and it was a wonderful experience. We arrived before 9 a.m. and checked our bags with the front desk. The staff was helpful and friendly from the minute we arrived until we checked out. In the middle of night I awoke and realized I was having an allergic reaction to something and needed ice to put on the swelling. Karvig was very helpful when my husband asked for assistance and inquired how I was doing the next morning. The room was incredible, the location fantastic. I cannot say enough about how great this hotel is and hope to return to Dublin in a year or two. I will definitely stay here again!!!!",5,2013,06,11
237,"Zero Complaints, Awesome Hotel.","I really loved this hotel. The decor, utilities, and amenities are all very modern and sleek. The beds were incredibly comfortable. It's located right next to Temple Bar and very close to Grafton Street and O'Connell. Bachelor's walk is a beautiful area with rooms overlooking the Quay. The hotel staff was excellent. Everyone was very knowledgeable. I would absolutely stay here again!",5,2013,06,09
237,Good location,The hotel is located in the quays - easy walking distance to most central locations. Staff are friendly. There used to be more life/action in the hotel prior to renovation. When checking-in ask for a room with view onto the river.,4,2013,06,09
237,"Perfect Location, Great Service","Very nice and professional personnel, perfect location for enjoying the City. I very much liked the style of our room. The Bar is nice to relax and have a good drink. Will stay there again for sure when I go back to Dublin!",5,2013,06,09
237,"Fun, funky hotel, great staff!","I will stay at The Morrison every time I need to go to Dublin - if you get lucky enough to get upgraded to their penthouse suite, it's amazing!!  You have your own living room, dining room, fireplace, lovely balcony overlooking the river, a lovely and large bathroom, plush pillows, and inviting window seats around the whole suite, breakfast made to order, wonderful attentive, helpful staff.",5,2013,06,08
237,"Modern, newly renovated","This hotel was a very pleasant surprise.  We did not know it had been recently renovated and it was an almost brand new facility.  Location wise, we were right across the river from the Temple Bar area.  Perfect.  The lobby area was very modern, bright and clean and the guest room was similar.  Very comfortable.   The room was adequate size with very modern facilities.  In fact the lighting was so modern that it was difficult to figure out how to turn some of the lights on and off.  Wi-fi was free and worked perfectly.  We ate a the restaurant for dinner and the food was delicious. Front desk staff was very helpful with all our questions especially with finding some of the tourist sites.  Overall, we would stay here again.",4,2013,06,07
237,Favourite Hotel in Dublin,"This is absolutely my number one hotel in Dublin. The rooms are beautiful, well worth the money. Close to Temple Bar and most of venues worth visiting in Dublin. Despite being in the centre, the Hotel is very quiet. Staff is very friendly and flexible and the food is amazing too. Highly recommend.",5,2013,06,07
237,Wonderful Hotel in the Center of Town,"What's not to like about the Morrison? The newly remodeled hotel is centrally located, walking distance to both work and tourist destinations, access to great restaurants and most importantly, they have fantastic staff.

What I like:
The remodel is fantastic.
The breakfast is one of the best Hilton/Doubletree breakfasts I've ever had
The gym, while sparse, is really quite nice.
The staff
Access to local pubs and restaurants
The famous doubetree cookie!

What I didn't like:
Not much really. You can find pretty much anything you want nearby. I suppose if I was to complain, it would be being seated at the table with the statue over top of you (you'll see it) as you're essentially right under the guys junk. Not a big deal, unless of course you want to look at a bronze member while you eat breakfast. I did laugh every time someone sat at that table, the reactions were priceless!

Note, there is no pool even though I clicked it (on accident)",5,2013,06,07
237,Worth the Money,"We spent 4 nights in a King Guest room in mid-May.  Plenty of room and the bed was comfortable and roomy (for some people maybe a little too firm).  The bathroom was spacious with fantastic 
water pressure in the shower.  The room temperature controls had an unusual 5-position color-coded switch - colder, a little colder, just right, a little warmer, and warmer.  The location is perfect for sightseeing, most of the well known sights are minutes away and just six minutes walk to the Hop-On/Hop-Off bus for further-out sights.  The buffet breakfast was very good, but the optional menu was excellent.  I had Eggs Benedict (in addition to the buffet) two mornings and waddled away wishing I had more self control. 
We arrived on an early morning flight and the hotel tagged and locked our luggage away in a secure room until our rooms were ready.  All in all a high recommendation.",5,2013,06,05
237,Beautiful Hotel in a Wonderful City,"Although a little on the pricey side, the hotel and rooms are stylish, contemporary and spotless. Staff were very friendly, even checking if things were ok for you when walking past in a corridor. Beds and pillows are the best I've had in a hotel, great views over the river and great food. Good location opposite Temple Bar. Reasonable car park a short walk away with a discounted rate for hotel guests. Free wifi has great coverage too.

I have stayed in this hotel on one occasion before and would certainly consider it again if I could afford it.",5,2013,06,03
237,Perfect location in Dublin!,"For a tourist or business traveller, The Morrison is perfectly located with easy access to all great parts of the city. Situated in a quiet area yet a few feet away from Temple Bar area where all the fun is at night and of course walking distance from many great restaurants including the one at The Morrison. If you get the right room with view to the river it's THAT much better! Luckily I was checked in by Maite who did an amazing job in accommodating my needs the first and second time I stayed here... Both times have been great and in part thanks to having someone pay attention to what I expect from a hotel and making sure I was completely satisfied. The decor is very modern. Overall, the perfect hotel choice for any traveller that has high expectations and wants to enjoy a place with great location, comfort and has the ""cool factor.""",5,2013,06,01
237,Great location in downtown Dublin,First time at this hotel and actually stayed the first night and last night while in Dublin. Centrally located right on the river Lifey. Across the river from the lively tourist area which was nice. Once could easily walk over and enjoy the sights yet retreat from the noise when returning to the hotel. Very nice rooms with exceptional bathrooms. All the amenities needed including a nice bar and restaurant. Would definitely stay again.,5,2013,05,31
237,Trip to Dublin to meet friends from America,"Hotel is more than great. Location is sp good, beside the Liffey. Just across a bridge from the Tempe Bar area. Rooms were lovely. Breakfast was really good -pancakes with berry compote - what could be better. Staff very friendly and helpful.",5,2013,05,28
237,Memories of Morrison,"Morrison is a unique hotel, very modern and chic, very romantic.  I like the wordings on the walls, I especially love the tint of purple pillow which adds a dash of color to the white bedspread.  Super lovely comfortable bed!  When I first read the review, and I saw the picture on the website, I told myself I had to stay in this hotel to experience it.  It did not disappoint me and it was exactly what I had imagine it to be.    The overall service was good, and they give me a early check in after a long tiring flight.  The service at Morrison Grill wasn't that efficient though, as it was really crowded on a Saturday nite, perhaps due to the Heineken rugby match.  It was a bit of a let up, since I paid 299 euro for that nite stay.  Overall, Room 210 was a special room, full of memories for me.... It was so beautiful and romantic...my partner and I enjoyed it!  Thank you Morrison, It will always stay on with me.. for that very special moment will linger on forever",4,2013,05,27
237,Fabulous hotel in fabulous city,"Stayed here for a weekend to go to Heineken Cup Final. 

Beautiful hotel that is so stylish and the staff are really friendly and can't do enough for you. 

Would love to return again and use as a base. Fabulous breakfast from a massive choice on buffet and great orange juice. 

Stylish bar and restaurant for the hip and trendy to hang out in - overlooking the River Liffey and right opposite Temple Bar. 

Location is fabulous. 

There really I",5,2013,05,24
237,Great Location,"Spend 3 nights here as a Hilton Diamond member.  We were given a junior suite.  It was a really nice big room.  Pretty psychedelic as the room was neon pink.  The suite was really nice - sofa area with a large flat screen tv.  The location cannot be beat.  You walk across the bridge and there is the Temple Bar area.  You are close to Grafton and O'Connell Streets.  If you want a well located hotel, don't look anywhere else.

Breakfast was complimentary for Diamond members at the restaurant.  Breakfast starts at 7 am.  There are buffet items - eggs, pastries, bacon, etc.  In addition, you can order eggs or pancakes from a short menu.  All complimentary with our status.

There is an in room safe and wifi is complimentary and fast.  Staff is relatively friendly but it seems there should be more people at the front desk to avoid people waiting in line.

Overall, I would stay here again but did not give them an excellent review because housekeeping did not do as good of a job as I would have liked.  It is a very good choice when visiting Dublin.",4,2013,05,23
237,"Modern, swanky and clean","I recently stayed at the Morrison (Double Tree) hotel in London for a business trip.

The hotel was in a great location (easily found), the staff were pleasant and courteous. The room was excellent, very modern and clean and plenty of room.

The finishing touches were great and the overall found the room to be very comfortable and classy.

The grill next door served great food and drink and again the staff were very professional and friendly.

I'd definitely recommend staying in this hotel for business or pleasure.",5,2013,05,19
237,Perfect location!,"Stayed her three nights this month. Had a riverfront room. Great view, but you do her the traffic. Not a bother to us. Central to everything you want to o and see in Dublin. Staff very helpful at reception and in bar area. Rooms are clean and modern. Great shower! ",5,2013,05,17
237,You won't go wrong here...,"I only had stayed at the Morrison for a few hours before departing to another location but I was very impressed with how swanky it was! It really reminded me of a W Hotel - very modern, great interior design. The rooms are a little on the smaller side but not too much of an issue if you have a room with a king-sized bed anyway. The bathroom was also kept very modern, granite countertops. The location is also great for tourists. All in all, the ambience of the hotel is right where I like it for any hotel stay.

Why I give it a 4-star versus 5-star was that I had called 2 hours after the reservation cancellation time and asked for forgiveness to cancel past the policy time. I had hoped for a little consideration but none could be given which disappointed me. I know that they have to follow policy but when I've done something similar at another brand hotel, I've been given it as a one time. It would have been appreciated to have it, but I understand, and it got me to stay there and experience it. Plus, I did really like it, much to my surprise!

I would definitely stay again though. The price point is also tons better than others in the same area so would recommend. Enjoy your stay there!",4,2013,05,17
237,The place to be in Dublin,"This became our home while in Dublin for two days on the front end of our 360 degree journey of Ireland.  Our room was one of the better designed rooms we've stayed at in recent memory.  The hotel and it's rooms are ultra modern with mood lighting throughout the common spaces and guest rooms.  We were lucky enough to have a balcony although it didn't overlook anything but an alley it was a blessing.  Mind you all the rooms are large even though we did have a larger suite style room.  Both nights we slept with the sliding glass door open and listened to the city sounds, passing storms and allowed the cool breeze to flow through.  The bathtub is enormous where anyone who is 6ft can fit comfortably and relax.  Beds are comfortable but the pillows are not very supporting.  Our room was furnished with a wonderful sitting area with an ottoman and all to relax prior to leaving for the day or when you return.  Parking is 12 euro and is not attached to the hotel but within a couple hundred feet from the entrance.

The breakfast buffet is outstanding as is the staff.  If you don't see it on the spread just ask and it will appear.  Fresh breads in a basket for you to hand cut, jams and jellies as fresh as can be.  Mind you the bacon is outright unbelievable, it's as if you were getting a full on 1/4 lb piece of ham with every slice.

The Morrison's location is right on the banks of the Liffey river.  There is a pedestrian bridge 100ft to the left of the hotel which allows you access right into the heart of the Temple Bar area.  The Guinness factory is a short 15-20 minute walk away as is Trinity College.  Make sure to try out Gallagher's Boxty House in the Temple Bar area for a nice meal and great service.  Kudos to the front desk for this recommendation.

Hope this helps.",5,2013,05,17
237,Excellent hotel,"Myself and my now husband got married here in April and we couldn't speak more highly of the hotel.the staff were excellent, friendly and extremely helpful. We got to stay in d penthouse which was above and beyond our expectations!our guests are still talking about the fabulous rooms and the friendly staff. Would Defo recommend this hotel and we will Defo be eatin in the restaurant again.",5,2013,05,17
237,Brilliant stay!,Arrived in Dublin 3 hours before check in. Although I did not expect my room to be ready the staff were happy to check. As my room was not ready yet the staff kindly took our bags with no fuss. We were also told we could go through for breakfast if we wanted even though we'd only half checked in. When checking in later we were offered our complimentary cookies. The our room was over looking the river and was really clean. The size of the bed was amazing and the sheets were crisp and clean. The bathroom had a good size and also very clean. The flush button for the toilet was in an awkward place but this did not bother us. The large window let lots of light in and the mood lighting was calming. Decor of room was very modern and there was a good selection of tea/coffees. Although we were near the temple bar area the room was very quiet. We had a slight problem logging onto the room's individual WIFI but after ringing to reception someone arrived promptly to help. Although we did not use all the facilities of the hotel the guest/public areas looked well maintained. I would defiantly recommend this hotel for anyone looking to stay in Dublin for a city break.,5,2013,05,15
237,The Marvellous Morrisson,"Wow. What a fantastic hotel. Very modern with friendly and professional staff. We were given a baked cookie each upon check in and were very pleased with our clean and comfortable modern room. With the exception of The Morrison not featuring an indoor swimming pool, my wife and I both agreed that The Morrisson is our ideal hotel. 

The staff at this hotel are amazing and cannot do enough to help. They also have a great sense of humour and are always smiling as we found to be the case with most people in the lovely city of Dublin. We dined at the hotel's restaurant The Morrisson Grill and the food was delicious. I tasted better food in there than in some Michelin Star restaurants. The bar is a great place to relax after dinner and again, the staff offer service with a smile and will prepare the cocktails of your choice.

I cannot praise this hotel highly enough and would recommend the lovely city of Dublin for a city break. If you are looking for places to visit during your stay try The National Botanic Gardens and Dublin Zoo, both easily reached by bus. The City SightSeeing Dublin Bus Tour is well worth the money if you buy a 2 day pass and covers has stops outside, The Guiness Factory, Trinity College, The Jail, Dublin Zoo, Merrion Square (for Oscar Wilde fans) and Dublin Castle to name but a few.

We can't wait to return to Dublin and will be staying at The Morrisson again. Our only regret is that it took us so long to think of Dublin as a mini break location. A one hour flight away, convenient, friendly and full of fun.",5,2013,05,14
237,Great hotel!,"I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this hotel. Newly renovated, modern, very clean and the location close to the centre and Temple Bar was perfect. The staff were extremly friendly too. Definately a hotel i would recommend to anyone!",5,2013,05,13
237,A nice hotel,"I really believe it was a great value for money. The breakfast is good, the rooms nice, the decoration is very trendy, the staff friendly. We had a dinner and the food was also great. The location is great, in the city center.",5,2013,05,12
237,Really friendly Staff!,"Hi guys, John here. My wife and I recently stayed in the Morrison in April.

The hotel is in a perfect location for anyone looking to enjoy Dublin City Centre. It is one of the most modernised hotels we have ever stayed in. 

In particular, my wife and I found the staff to be so welcoming and very friendly. Two of the staff members, Marco and Michele were fantastic. They really helped us enjoy our stay with their friendliness, good humour and banter at breakfast. We hope to meet them again the next time we visit. 

I would recommend the hotel for anyone looking to stay in Dublin for long or short periods.",5,2013,05,11
237,Great location and good modern hotel,"On the north bank of the River Liffey in the heart of Dublin, The Morrison Hotel is modern, smart and well equipped.  It is only 5 minutes from the Temple Bar district, with its pubs, clubs and restaurants and the hop-on, hop-off tour bus passes the front door. In the other direction it is an equally short walk to King Street, the main shopping street leading to O'Connell Street.
Inside, the room decor is minimalist and very modern, though the somewhat garish pink concealed lighting may not be to everyone's taste.  Nevertheless, the bed was very comfortable, and the linen and towels spotless.  One slight niggle is that although two small bottles of water were placed in the room on arrival, they will not re-stock these on a daily basis. We shall definitely consider The Morrison on our next visit to Dublin.",4,2013,05,10
237,Perfect stopover,"The Morrison proved to be the perfect place for a city stopover on our way through Dublin. The hotel is well designed and manages to feel stylish yet incredibly comfortable. Check in was delightful with the incredibly courteous staff and we were despatched to our hotel room with the tastiest cookie ever... yes, a week on, I still remember the cookie! 

The room we stayed in was very comfortable and incredibly quiet - although I now know to ask for a room with a riverside view and a bath. 
 
Having arrived rather late in the evening, we opted for supper in the hotel. The steak is definitely a speciality and mine was very tasty but some of the other meals didn't go down as well. Breakfast however was a delight and set us up for the long drive the next day. I would definitely stay here again for some city centre exploring.",4,2013,05,10
237,Great location good renovation,"I stayed for 3 nights and was very satisfied.  Wonderful location on Liffey.  Could walk anywhere.  Rooms are newly renovated, smallish but nicely appointed.  Large bathroom with deep tub.  Street view with lots of light, though quiet-I was on the top floor.  Small health club. Service adequate, though room did not get cleaned on last day due to my returning early afternoon and mediocre communication by housekeeping.  However room was ready when I arrived from airport at 10:30. That was lovely.  

First visit to Dublin-great city to sightsee, eat, hear music, shop.  Took DART to Houth, half an hour away, lovely sea town. Pantibar, fun pub around corner.",4,2013,05,09
237,Good Hotel Near The Temple Bar Area,"Stayed here on my last trip through Ireland.  The hotel is located just across the river from the Temple Bar area and well within walking distance to just about everything.  The hotel staff are quick and attentive with getting everyone checked in and checked out.  The rooms are decorated in a modern style with bright clean colors and sharp lines.  As for the beds, they were a bit too hard for my liking, but it wasn't so hard that it prevented me from sleeping. All and all a very good hotel.",4,2013,05,09
237,Heart of Dublin,"Right in the midst of everything. Beautiful location in near Center and across the River from the Temple Bar Area. Plenty of double decker buses and cabs will take u a bit further. Staff very attentive, breakfast and bar both good and everything is brand new. 

I will be back. ",5,2013,05,08
237,Excellent Hotel in a great location,"I booked this hotel based on its location and previous reviews I had read.  I agree with everything I read, from the moment we arrived the staff were fantastic and really look after you.  The hotel is spotless and you could not fault it. We only had one issue where the A/C did not work but the management rectified this straight away and gave us complimentary breakfasts and drinks as a gesture for the inconvenience whilst this was fixed. I would go back there and recommend this to those wanting a lovely hotel in a great location",5,2013,05,08
237,Very comfortable and good location.,"I arrived by plane and took the bus in to Dublin. It stops quite close to the Morrison so it was a short walk by the river and I was there. Speedy check in staff saw me on my way to my room with a delicious cookie in no time.
My room was spacious and well lit. Dont you hate dingy hotel rooms?
Bed was great and the internet code you get serves you for multiple devices.
If you are in Dublin for leisure you are now on the doorstep of fun. A 2 minute walk to Temple Bar, 2 minutes to the shops. Its tough to beat.",5,2013,05,08
237,Modern and comfy in the heart of Dublin,"This recently renovated (re-opened in Feb. 2013) modern hotel is in a great location for walking all over Dublin. Just a stones throw from the Millennium bridge and the Temple Bar area, it is well equipped and well run. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I arrived early in the a.m. and they were able to give me my room by 9:30 am.  The king bed was covered with a white cotton duvet (which doubled as the top sheet), so there was no need to touch a comforter used by others. They have all the amenities you need, including a hair dryer and converter plugs, should you forget yours! The bathroom was huge, especially for Europe, and had a rain shower. There was a small fridge/mini-bar in the room-with room for your stuff as well. I had their Continental breakfast (12 Euros), while I waited for my room, it was delicious and plentiful. However, if you want a quick and inexpensive breakfast, you can step out the door and there are two places just across the lane...both completely acceptable.
Did not use the gym, it was small but sufficient. We did have a drink at the bar late on Saturday night...pleasant atmosphere....comfy chairs and a bar area.  Windows overlooked the river. FYI, we used our Hilton Honors points for the room...there was little mention of Hilton anywhere...they and the locals,  refer to it as ""The Morrison"". I would stay there again.",5,2013,05,07
237,Gem of a hotel on the Emerald Isle,"A very handy place for a visit to Centre City Dublin. A short hop across the River Liffey,it is clean, modern, and you will have easy walking access to Temple Bar (without having to stay within the madness), and the major downtown attractions such as Trinity College, Dublin Castle, and the Guinness Storeroom. The hotel utilizes controlled access cards to rooms/floors and staff keeps a close watch over the grounds, so it seems pretty secure, as Centre City Dublin can be a bit sketchy. The only problem I encountered was initially being put into one of the rooms facing inward into the courtyard, those of which can get noisy during events, but staff moved me to an exterior room easily and I enjoyed our 4-night stay very much. Also, and my traveling companions agreed on this separately, for some reason the pillows are freakishly firm, but that's just nitpicking, I would for sure stay there again if in Dublin.",4,2013,05,07
237,Uber Modern on the Liffey,"This very modern hotel recently acquired by Hilton is VERY handy to the Temple Bar area without being in the middle of the chaos.  The rooms were uber modern, though some functionality was lacking (no outlet anywhere near a mirror so hair drying was guesswork), and the housekeeping was sporadic (probably still working out the kinks).  The breakfast buffet was the best we encountered in Ireland and the staff in all areas were incredibly friendly and helpful.  Love it.",4,2013,05,05
237,Excellent,"Rooms are very comfortable, very close to Temple Bar and the staff were absolutely amazing! I recommend 100% for anyone visiting Dublin, whether for business or pleasure. Many thanks to the whole staff.",5,2013,05,04
237,2 nights business stay,"Well decorated, modern but still relaxing.  Helpfull and friendly staff. Jill the unit superviser was exceptionally helfull.  Good location, close to the center, bars, restaurants. Variety of food could be improved at breakfast but still good.",5,2013,05,03
237,"Great location, spacious rooms","Stayed here for 5 nights and enjoyed the spacious rooms, walk in showers and real king sized bed - such a rarity in Europe.  The location is great close to all the activity yet just enough removed to ensure a quiet night sleep.  I only wish they had a bigger gym with more cardio equipment.",5,2013,05,02
237,Great location and staff efficient and friendly,"Couldn't be better located, easy reach of Temple Bar and Grafton Street. Friendly and efficient staff plus tasty cookie provided upon check in. The rooms are clean and they have everything you could need although my wife complained that there wasn't a good mirror for applying her make up which obviously wasn't a problem for me!! Would happily stay here again",4,2013,05,02
237,Quick bar food,"I was invited to The Morrison for a quick snack before a visit to the Cinema - very nice welcome in the bar with menu presented very promptly - two Caesar salads chosen very tasty. Yes, will come again when not in such a rush.",5,2013,05,01
237,Dulin - great location,"This location is wonderful for seeing much of Dublin on foot.  The staff here is very eager to please.  The breakfasts are wonderfu, fresh, full Irish breakfast and lots of extras.  Fantastic strong coffee!",4,2013,05,01
237,Awesome location,"We stayed here for just one night before flying out of Dublin the next morning but I wish I could have stayed longer. The location is the real selling point of this place as it is located right across the river from Temple Bar so it is close to all the activity on the south side of the river but just far enough to keep the noise away. 
The whole hotel has a hip vibe and the rooms were wired with the latest technology. We didn't spend nearly enough time to try out all the facilities in the hotel but the staff were very welcoming. We were even given a cookie at the time of check-in which was such a nice surprise.",4,2013,04,30
237,Very nice hotel in a perfect location,I really enjoyed my stay at The Morrison which is a newly renovated doubletree property (warm cookie on arrival yum). The location is great. Very central and across the river from temple bar area. This means much less noise than in temple bar area. Rooms were very clean and good sized. Shower had excellent water pressure. The beds were a bit hard for my taste but linens were good. I was told on arrival that breakfast was included and that I could even eat something that morning too. On check out I found out that was not the case and breakfast was not included. I usually don't eat breakfast and only did because it was included. The wonderful man at reception took the charge off of my bill because of what I was told upon check in. I will definitely return in the future.,5,2013,04,30
237,t'anks a million! great stay!,"The Morrison, by Doubletree, is a very sleek hotel fronting onto the famous River Liffey in Dublin’s city centre.
The entrance is a little confusing, as you can enter, upon arrival, through the main bar area from the front of the building or from the side or the building, directly into the reception area.
The reception staff are very warm and welcoming and extremely professional – including the, now customary warm cookie upon arrival!
Rooms are very spacious and fully air-conditioned. There is also an iron and ironing board in the room. From my perspective, two important elements to have for the short stop-over business traveller to ensure a comfortable night’s sleep and a smart appearance the next day when flying in with a bag full of creased clothing inside carry on hand luggage.
The rooms have, by the looks of things, be very recently refurbished, and to a very high and professional standard. There is a very good quality rain shower in the tub with good power. Very nice, indeed. Two king sized beds in the room that were very comfortable. Blackout curtains to block out the light and very effective double glazing to block out street noise. 
The “free” in-room entertainment was of a high standard, too. IPod docking station, on-demand music selection direct from the TV along with YouTube, and some internet connection via the TV and a broad selection of TV channels.
Downstairs, the bar served a very comprehensive selection of beverages including the obligatory draught Guinness (when in Rome!?) and as a brewer, it was of a very good quality. Even if it was the competitor’s.
The food was of exceptional quality and presentation as well. I had a bar meal and breakfast on two occasions. The even meal was fantastic. And breakfast on both mornings was very good, however the breakfast staff did require the occasion “poke” to gain their attention.
Upon check-out I was pleasantly surprised to have a perfectly efficient checkout with my invoice 100% accurate. Now this may sound a very strange statement to make, however, as a business traveller, you’d be surprised how many hotels simply cannot get a business (rather than personal) invoice correct, so that you can submit it accurately for business expenses. So the check-out procedure becomes a painful and long drawn out ordeal. So well done and thank you!
I pleasure staying at the hotel and I will be back and recommending you!",5,2013,04,29
237,"Nicely refurbished, much brighter - but how do you turn off the lamp?","The hotel was recently refurbished so that whilst it looks the same, it is now much brighter.  Staff are friendly, though perhaps more accents were Russian/central European than Irish.  Rooms are large, and if you request when booking, a number overlook the river.  Only annoyance was a blue glass shelf that was lit - I could not for the life of me work out how to turn it off.  Room cost just €135 and dinner for four (mains only, no alcohol) just €126.",4,2013,04,29
237,Amazing Treat,"We were welcomed by the friendly and efficient Daniel who handed us our room keys along with warm chocolate cookies - yum!  The newly refurbished boutique hotel is even more stylish and elegant without being stuffy, loads of comfy sofas to lounge in, delicious food and a team of staff who are pleasant and so helpful. We were fortunate enough to stay in the fabulous penthouse suite with stunning view across the city, every conceivable luxury and a rainfall shower you won't want to get out of!  The hotel is perfectly located with all the major shops and many tourist attractions on your doorstep - a fantastic base from which to explore the city or do as we did and just watch the world go by ....looking forward to returning very shortly.",5,2013,04,28
237,Fantastic Location - So Central!,"Only there for one weekend but was very impressed, particularly with the breakfast! The hotel is modern but with a nice friendly atmosphere - It felt safe also as lifts can only be used when you have a key card.",4,2013,04,28
237,City Center Dublin visit,"The hotel is a great location, beautiful view of Libbey River though the windows were dirty.  Quiet hotel, though the room was a bit warm and the AC didn't seem to be turned on regardless of what you set the thermostat to.",5,2013,04,28
237,Perfect stay in Dublins friendliest Hotel,"I am not one fro writing reviews but having stayed at this Hotel a good few times over the years, I felt that it warranted a mention and a recognition of how lovely the place is. From the moment I book the Reservations Manager and the team are always proactive to get you booked in and work hard to get your confirmation and itinerary correct. They like all the Check In Staff, the Bar Staff and the Cleaners are always so attentive and there must be something in the water there as every last one of them are always smiling and super happy and they never seem to be able to do enough. From check in to check out it really is a wonderful experience. The Hotel could not be located any better and its perfect for all aspects of any city break, It is a stones throw from the wonderful shops and a quick walk over the bridge to all the busy Bars and Restaurants and wonderful tourist attractions. The Bedrooms are always so perfectly clean and the Beds are just the most snuggliest ever.
The Hotel Bar oozes class and it has a wonderful ambience. It is never rowdy or never has gangs or too noisy and the food that they serve up is delicious, Weather that be afternoon snacks or wonderful evening dinners in the Restaurant and scrumptious Irish Breakfast ( you must try the sausages )
I love the place and all the people and the only complaint is that we don't get to stay long enough.
A pure wonderful experience, not just a one off but every one of the 20 odd times we have been there.",5,2013,04,26
237,Just lovely,"My boyfriend and I spent 3 nights in The Morrison Hotel in April. Although the hotel was on the higher end of our budget we had read such good reviews we wanted to try for ourselves, we were right to do so! If you can afford to I would highly recommend a stay here, minutes away from temple bar, walking distance to shops restaurants and the central area of Dublin. Staff were friendly and couldn't do enough and the rooms were clean and contemporary. The hotel is modern and has a relaxed feel, breakfast was very good and the waiting on staff were efficient and helpful. We had a meal in the Morrison hotel restaurant, quay 14 and it was superb, the prices werent cheap, but you get what you pay for! Overall a fantastic stay here and we would most definitely return! ",5,2013,04,23
237,Amazing service,"My fiancé and I stayed for two nights then returned for a final night.  The reason for our return was our experience with Paul Donnelly at the front desk. He made the whole trip wonderful. He not only helped with our rooms but also gave great advice on places to go and helped us book rail passes for other parts of out trip I would
recommend this hotel to all. If you do make a trip to the Morrison please tell Paul hello from us!  We would definitely stay there again. The location was perfect. The service was exceptional. The rooms were great. 
Sincerely,

Sara and Dan",5,2013,04,23
237,Modern and stylish,"Stayed here a couple of years ago and couldn't believe how great it now looks, when I returned last month. The makeover has made a massive improvement and it really is a modern, stylish hotel on a par with anything else in Dublin. Will be returning soon!",5,2013,04,23
237,Dublin  Business Programme,Good hotel - ideal location - recently renovated. Good walking area close to Temple Bar. Easy for taxis and access to and from the airport. As we have office nearby it will be even  better. Choose a room at the back it can get quite rowdy in Dublin close to the weekends,4,2013,04,23
237,Great Location  and Modern Rooms,The location of this hotel is perfect for touring Dublin.  It is situated right on the River and is just a walk-across-the-bridge away from all the toursit venues on the other side.  The rooms have a modern decor and seem extremely clean with comfortable beds and elegant bathrooms.  The hotel also has great WiFi service.  The red line for the tram is also conveniently located about 2 blocks distance.,4,2013,04,21
237,"Modern rooms, great location and good service!","We spend 2 nights at this hotel. The service and quick, professional and friendly. I mentioned on our reservation that we were spending our 10th wedding anniversary and they provided us with complimentary Champagne and strawberries. Very thoughtful!

The rooms are recently refurbished and look very classy and modern. The location is just perfect and a 5 minute walk from Temple Bar or the shopping district. Really great! 

We've heard good things about the breakfast but decided to try some of the restaurants just outside the hotel. All good, however I am sure that the hotel breakfast would've been great as well.

Internet access if free, so that's a good perk.",4,2013,04,19
237,The place to be!,"Stayed here for one night on business - room cost 215 Euros ouch! But actually very worth it. The bar is very nice and a good size and the whole hotel is done out in that very contemporary but classy and modern way as most of the DoubleTrees are. Still my favourite chain!
Location is the best - directly across the Millennium Bridge from Temple Bar.
Room was large with a lovely bathroom, and the first hotel I've stayed at with contact-less keys. Nice touch!
If this fits in your budget I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2013,04,17
237,Beautiful Stay,"Beautiful hotel, our room was very clean, tidy and modern, overall decor in the hotel is beautiful. Easy access to Dublin City just a short walk to all shops and bars. We parked in the car park just behind the hotel very easy to access it and only €12 euro for overnight stay so very good value, I Would stay here again as it was so great to be so near the city, and have such a comfortable room to return to after a busy day shopping.",5,2013,04,17
237,Excellent hotel in an excellent location...,Fantastic place to stay which is right along the River Liffy and just 200 yards from the famous Ha'Penny Bridge. Fantastic bar area with excellent staff to cater for all your requirements... Highly recommended..,5,2013,04,17
237,"Excellent staff, need better support","We stayed as part of a large group attending a meeting. Parking is just beyond the main entrance to the hotel and the hotel itself is very central. Reception staff were efficient and welcoming and quite competently stored luggage for the group after check-out. 
The bedroom is of good size but decor is very bright and stark.  TV doesn't have text. The bathroom is also spacious with a good shower head. The bed is comfortable BUT the 4 pillows were all the same & as hard as a rock, impossible to sleep on, others in the group commented similarly.  We don't like sleeping with the a/c turned on and the room was very difficult to cool, even with the window open, which brought some street noise.  
The group had a set dinner, of average quality with a pleasant starter, a very standard main course and a very poor dessert.  The staff were most helpful, especially a very friendly Gavin, but management need to be more involved and give guidance to staff who are trying their best.  Breakfast was good but not outstanding.  The bacon, in particular, was poor, as was the toast.
The hotel is overpriced compared to many around the country but for its city centre location you probably have to pay a premium.",3,2013,04,15
237,Perfect Location & Great Service:  We'll Be Back!,"We just returned from 8 nights at the Morrison, and can report that it was a great experience in every way.  There were so many things to like, but I'll try and hit just the most important ones here.  Most importantly, the location is directly across the river Liffey from the Temple Bar area, which meant that we were close enough to the Pub action and shopping in both Grafton and Henry Street areas, but far enough away to have a completely quiet sleeping experience.  We had rooms that faced the courtyard, and would guess that rooms on the Quay side would pretty quiet also. The hotel is new and bright after a major refurb:  the rooms were a good size by European standards (which translates to what you'd get in a standard American hotel FYI), shower pressure was great, the bathroom sink is large and there is plenty of counter space for two people, the towels were fluffy and breakfast was good with lots of choices.  There is a kettle in-room for boiling hot water, and a selection of various teas, cream/sugar, and real cups/spoons vs. paper cups/sticks. The in-room safe is large enough to hold two iPads, an SLR camera, keys, iPods, etc., and would easily hold a laptop.  Two elevators responded quickly and were good sized by European standards.

Service was excellent everywhere at the Morrison.  At the front desk, for example--I realized at 6:00 a.m. (just before we were leaving for a day-trip to Belfast) that we would not be back in time to make our dinner reservation. No problem, said the lovely young woman at the desk: she'd take care of it (which she did) AND she managed to get us booked for the next evening.   Service was also really good in the restaurants and in the bar: smiling servers in the restaurant kept coffee/tea refreshed each morning, and the bartenders were engaging and fun to talk with (one even made us a couple of cocktails to try--we were drinking pints at the time--and the cocktails were on the house!)  When leaving Temple Bar area you simply cross the Millennium Bridge, turn left after crossing at the traffic light and the hotel is only a few steps away.  I'd definitely pick the Morrison for another Dublin visit.",5,2013,04,14
237,1 night stay at the morrison hotel,"We have just spent 1 night at the morrison hotel. From the friendly, and professional lady we met on arrival, to the bar staff, and the dining room staff,  they were all exemplary and  excellent in their own area.
 We stayed in a room with king bed,  room 133 , the bed and the pillows were divine. The bathroom is big, with a wonderful shower and lovely toiletries.Lovely view of the Liffey, and not noisy.

All in all the only thing I am sorry about, is that we only had one night, the next time it will be longer.

Thank you for a lovely stay.

Fiona.",5,2013,04,13
237,A native's view!,"I am originally from Dublin, but am currently living in Finland. My wife and I recently spent a week in the newly refurbished Morrison. We had thought about staying there before, but had been put off by poor reviews and tales of a hotel that was in bad need of a refurb. So, we were interested to hear that the hotel had received a much needed face-lift and decided to give it a try.
Here's a few of our thoughts:
The Morrison's location is close to being perfect, whether it's the night-life or the restaurants, cafes and shopping, the best that Dublin has to offer is only a short walk away. We asked for a quiet room, away from the quays, and were never disturbed.
The new decor might not be to everyone's taste, but the rooms are clean, bright and the bed's were very comfortable.
The breakfast is really really good, but we preferred to take a stroll across the river to the Queen of Tart cafe on Cow's Lane. 
It is nice to know where we will be staying on our next visit to Dublin",5,2013,04,13
237,Great location,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights while on a business/pleasure trip and we were very impressed. The hotel is spotless, in a very convenient location on the river with parking facilities close by and easy walking distance to most of the attractions and amenities. The rooms are modern, spacious and clearly everything is new so you won't find chipped paint anywhere! The breakfast room is something else and made the wonderful breakfast an even greater pleasure....if that was at all possible. The staff are very helpful and friendly and I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to friends or colleagues and will be booking again when I return to Dublin.",5,2013,04,12
237,Yes - this is where you want to stay,"So you're an American and you're visiting Dublin and trying to decide where to stay. Stay here.

This is a new property for Doubletree. It was an independent hotel called The Morrison last month. They are still transitioning to the Doubletree way of doing things - but I saw no real issues.

The hotel is half a block from the Liffey - that's the big river that runs through Dublin on Google Maps :-). You are a block from O'Connell Street - that's one of the main tourist drags. You are a ten minute walk from Grafton Street - that's the other big tourist street. There are hundreds of food choices within walking distance. The bus stops are nearby - the big red tour bus folks are a block away - the main bus station is walking distance - the train station is about a mile away. There are pubs and music spots everywhere. If you are a tourist - this is where you stay.

The Morrison - as it was formerly known - was named for Jim Morrison of The Doors. Throughout the hotel there are song lyrics painted on the walls. The concert venues are nearby and often the musicians stay at this hotel. 

The rooms are nice and because the hotel is a block away from the O'Connell the area is quiet. I found the rooms very comfortable - much larger than a standard European room. The bathroom was awesome.

The breakfast was excellent - very nice selections. Best of all - breakfast is served until noon so late sleepers will not miss out.

Taxi to the airport ran 25 euro.

Overall - it's a winner.",5,2013,04,11
237,Awesome stay,"We spent a week in Dublin at this fantastic hotel, with a great location, and with the exceptional, wonderfully friendly staff. So many things well within walking distance. The breakfast was well worth eating. The restaurant at noon and in the evening, ever so tasty, the best steak we have ever had (and we come from beef country). We are planning our next visit later in the year, can't wait to return. We will stay at no other hotel.",5,2013,04,10
237,good location,"Stayed 2 nights on business trip but location great for tourist being across river from Temple Bar and close to all the main shops. Recently refurbished and seems to be the current  ""in-place"" with lots of events going on (a charity auction the day we arrived) and a bar dining area which is very busy in the evening. Staff all friendly. The rooms are large and comfortable and minimalist in style and no complaints. The breakfast area is a bit strange being on two levels and the hot buffet quite disappointing (especially the bacon which was over cooked and hard) though it was possible to order items from the waitress. Overall  nice but over expensive for what it offers.",4,2013,04,09
237,A wonderful experience,"We've been to Dublin a few times and without doubt this was the best Hotel experience that we have ever had.
The refurbished hotel is smart and welcoming without being clinical.  Its location on the banks of the river is perfect for Temple Bar and Grafton Street and also O'Connell Street - if you're looking for a central location this is it.

The staff are exceedingly helpful with nothing too much trouble - when asked about breakfast they even offered to cook baked beans to turn a full Irish into a full English for my husband.  The breakfasts will soon become legendary as the food just kept coming which is the only way to prepare for a day on the Black Stuff.

We will certainly be back again to this hotel as is absolutely brilliant and next time we'll be bringing our two hungry sons for a bit of craic.",5,2013,04,09
237,Very comfortable stay,"Perfect location, a small but perfectly formed Hotel overlooking the River.
on arrival  (quite late at night ) I detected that it was possibly a popular 'party venue'
with a lot of noise coming from the bar/restaurant area. Hopefully this wouldnt affect my stay as I was very tired but later on, it did - as  the party revellers decided to make the most unacceptable racket out in the coridoor.The desk staff sorted it quickly which I was pleased about.
My standard  room was lovely and the bed very comfortable I couldnt fault it. 
( except the view wasnt great )
Breakfast was a delight and the staff very helpful.
I would definately stay here again.",4,2013,04,09
237,Lovely stay,"Spend two nights here early March. To start with: the location is superb, basically in the middle of the city close to many interesting places to go. The hotel is neverthess quiet (or at least, my room was), good size rooms, lovely beds, nice bathroom and accompanying services. From what I read in other reviews, it can make quite a difference which room you have in terms of noise (my views were not very impressive, looking out on some interrior roofs, but the upside of that is that it was very quiet).To find your way around can be a bit of a search due to a sometimes unusual layout of the hotel. But then again, that has its charm too. As a continental European I really cannot get used to hotel bars closing around 11-ish, in particular as this was a business meeting organized at the hotel (networking !!!), but that is not something the hotel can be blamed for. The one thing is that in terms of price/quality you probably can find something similar a bit cheaper, as it is not the cheapest of hotels.",4,2013,04,09
237,Wonderful Location with Great Service,"   I arrived into Dublin via the Dublin-Heuston Train Station and took a tram to the Jarvis stop.  From there, the hotel is very close.  However, when I tried to find the hotel, i was walking along the river and could not readily locate the hotel because of a lack of signs.  There were awnings with around the bottom floor restaurant reading, ""Morrison"".  There was not a Double Tree sign or anything else to let us know we had arrived at the hotel until we rounded the corner and reached the glass sliding door entrance.  If one is walking from the Jarvis stop toward the river, the Double Tree sign at the entrance is small but visible.

   I am a HHonors Gold Member and was automatically upgraded to a King Junior Suite on the top floor (4th Floor).  It was a beautiful and open room with plenty of space.  The bed was perfectly soft and comfortable and the bathroom featured both a walk-in shower and the largest bathtub I have ever seen in a hotel room.  It was very impressive.  I believe my room was next to a water pump, because there would be a loud jackhammer vibrating sound that would sound just outside my room throughout my stay.  I also noticed it would start up after the sink was used or the toilet flushed.  It was not too annoying, but on my last night it kept occurring and made it difficult to sleep.  I am not sure if this happens all the time or is only happening due to the water issues in Dublin right now.  If you stay there, you may want to avoid Room 435 if this pump continues.  However, besides this pump, everything was very nice.  One other thing that I would like to staff to fix would be the caulking around the bathtub, which was peeling away in the corner, but most people would not notice.  I was overall very well pleased with my room.

   The breakfast in the morning was wonderful.  The staff was extremely kind and calm with all of the guests, even a very demanding guest that was having breakfast next to us.  However, they immediately responded to any requests.  They also feature a menu of breakfast items that can be ordered for no extra charge.  I had a wonderful omelet cooked to order and enjoyed everything else from the buffet.  

   While the room was great, the service was superb, and the breakfast was delicious, the thing that really convinced me that I enjoyed the The Morrison Double Tree was the small touches that make the entire experience so wonderful.  For example, in the evening they light tea candles all over the lobby and even up the stairway.  It created a wonderful ambiance and it made me really happy to be a guest of this hotel.  Next time I come to Dublin, I have no doubt that I will be patronizing this luxury hotel!",5,2013,04,05
237,A Gem of a Hotel in the Center of Dublin,"This sleek, contemporary, totally refurbished hotel is unlike any Doubletree you've ever stayed in! From the subtle lighting to the sculptural murals on the walls, the design is unique yet restful. The rooms are lovely, with that same private, peaceful feel. Very modern bathroom, with deluge shower, and key-operated lights (saves electricity by shutting off when you leave). The location is also fantastic -- right near O'Connell, easy walking distance from James Joyce Center and Trinity College. Right across the river from Temple Bar, but completely insulated (I stayed on a Saturday night) from the noise of the festivities there. The staff is attentive and helpful -- they even loaned me an adapter plug when mine turned out to be the wrong kind. I can't say enough good things about this hotel -- I was sorry to check out!

PS The Mochaland cafe right across the street on Lower Ormond Quay is a wonderful, local coffee shop with terrific cappucino and inexpensive breakfast.",5,2013,04,04
237,Trying hard but noisy rooms,"Recent refurb has given a trendy vibe to this place with several nice touches around the hotel. Rooms are bright and minimalist with a fresh feel, beds comfortable although pillows synthetic. Big downside however was the noise - 4th floor room at the back of the hotel still suffered from unacceptable street noise, both vehicles and people, plus the odd contribution from the seagulls. Our request to move was handled very graciously and overall no complaints about the service. New room on 2nd floor faced indoor courtyard and very quiet, although this would not be the case in the event of a function when apparently this space would be used as a smoking area. Bar and restaurant fine (although branded separately they are really the same space). Location handy for Temple Bar.",3,2013,04,04
237,Gem of a hotel! Superb location,"We thoroughly enjoyed this visit to Dublin. The hotel is 3 minutes from Temple Bar, super modern and very friendly to visit. The rooms in particular are totally modern of the highest quality. We thought the total package there was excellent.",5,2013,04,04
237,Morrison Hotel,"This hotel was a pleasure to stay in due to the fact that the staff and Manager (Rene) made us feel very welcome and attended to every detail. We were  made feel we were the only ones staying in the Hotel whcih left us with a feeling of wanting to stay again. We have and would highly recommend this hotel to our friends/family. I feel the Manager Rene has done very well to create this homely yet professional stay.  the rooms were very much to my taste also, a very modern city vibe. 5/5 from me. Georgina Mundy-Dublin",5,2013,04,04
237,Recently refurbished - don't be put off by the Double Tree Hilton connection,"The Morrison is well know in Dublin especially for bands to stay in (The Saturday's were there the night we were) and has recently reopened after a major refurb by it's new Russian owner. Light, bright and funky but fine for everyone - I mean young and old. Lovely rooms with great technology including very good and free wifi every where. Bar is nice with cosy corners and restaurant with really good local produce being used - primarily grilled but some usually stuff too. I had pig's cheeks (um) and a steak cooked at 500 degrees (but not for long!). If you can afford one of suites there's big and lovely bathrooms - but the standard and execs are good too. Position for Temple Bar and lots of sites is very good.",5,2013,04,03
237,Nice modern hotel,Had a lovely stay at this hotel. Brilliant location and spacious room. Shame the residents bar is not open after midnight on Sundays. Cocktail list is great though.Get a room with a view of the Liffey if staying here.,4,2013,04,02
237,Heaven in a hotel,"My friend and I stayed here after a three-day tour of south-west Ireland and, compared to a grubby hostel, this place was heaven. On arrival we were greeted by a smiley receptionist and given delicious warm cookies, and our room was lovely, with soft sheets and plumped-up pillows, an excellent shower and cool furnishings. If you want to feel a bit pampered without shelling out a billion euros, I can't recommend this place enough. It's in a fantastic location too – in just a two-minute walk you can be gulping down a Guinness in Temple Bar.",5,2013,04,01
237,"Excellent location, nicely designed new rooms","Enjoyed our stay at the Morrison.  Great to earn some HHonors points at a hotel just across the bridge from Temple Bar.  Our floor was clearly newly appointed, with trendy decor, excellent lighting, flat screen TVs and free wifi throughout the hotel.  Would stay here again in Dublin.",5,2013,03,27
237,"Unbeatable location, fantastic staff.","I stayed here over the St Patrick's festival with my partner and we thouroughly enjoyed our stay. We found the location to be perfect; just across the water away from all the drunken tourists at the pubs but still within an easy walk from all the main attractions (minus the gaol- but it was still walkable)

We had to change rooms at about midnight as our thermostat broke; the staff were extremely apologetic and helpful and gave us a new room only a few doors down straight away.

Also, the war cookie upon check in is a delicious touch and we LOVED being able to use the internet and youtube on the big LCD TV. I'd recommed this hotel to anyone with a fairly limited aount of time in Dublin who wants to stay right near all the attractions without compromising on quality.",4,2013,03,22
237,Excellent Hotel,"This is an excellent hotel in the Dublin area, with modern look and feel.  It's a bit hard to find from the road with no obvious signs (like typical American hotels), you might not know that you're there until you are right up next to the building, especially if you're not entirely sure of where you are going.  The rooms were nice and the windows in the room opened, so I loved that you can smell the fresh air and hear the street noise a little if you wanted to.  The hotel also has a nice little bar, that had ""chunky fries"" that were my favorite thing ever!  They are like really big and flavorful steak fries - I could eat just those and Guinness for every meal if I had to... :)",5,2013,03,22
237,"Modern hotel, very friendly staff","Great modern hotel with a very friendly staff (particularly the guys at the hotel bar were awesome)
we stayed at the Morrison for St. Patricks day - the hotel was clean & modern - also the room:
new LCD TV, some nice looking LED lights, big bathroom. Perfect!

2 things could be improved: the shower was very ""slow"" - pls put more water trough! and the flush of the toilette isnt very userfriendly - but that are details :)",5,2013,03,20
237,"Excellent hotel, very stylish","I stayed here for one night and used the restaurant for dinner. Very impressed with everything, although the caveat is that I have a Hitlon frequent stay card which gets me a room upgrade, free breakfast and wi-fi, so I was a little spoilt. However, I liked pretty much everything about this hotel. The room was lovely, modern and spotless (felt brand new), bed and shower were great, no noise, great bar and very good restaurant (and breakfast). Staff very helpful and efficient. On the whole highly recommended.",5,2013,03,19
237,What a Pleasure to Stay Here,"Pros: location location location
customer service of team working there (especially Paul)
breakfast
what a very cool and trendy look and feel
large like 42"" tv's in room

reasonably priced
was just remodeled 

Cons: I really don't have any, especially since I purchased on hotels.com

PS - As you will see on my reviews, I am a tough critic too as I travel a lot",5,2013,03,16
237,Great staff and location,"This hotel is in perfect walking distance to Temple Bar and other key locations in Dublin.  The hotel has recently been redone and the rooms are large and comfortable. The lobby area,restaurant and bar area were also impressive but I really didn't stay there. 
I have to say Daniel O'Connor may be the best hotel staff member I have met in years.  He went above and beyond for us (I'm a Diamond member) in every way giving me and upgrade and my associate a new room after his had power troubles.  He gave us great recommendations and even greeted us with coffee in the lobby one morning.  Outstanding work!

The only negative on the hotel is that the gym is a joke.  Almost no equipment, screens didn't work, etc.  Fix this and you get a 5 from me!",4,2013,03,16
237,Wow!,"Stayed four nights.  Wonderful hotel.  Great Location.  Outstanding staffing throughout.   Cannot wait to visit again.  Staff truly cares for the guests and go way out of their way.  Our scheduled (not though hotel) cab did not show up for an early picked up on a very cold morning.   The desk agent walk to the main street to hail a cab....then stayed to assist with luggage......going way above and beyond.   Staff answered questions with a smile and ""you are most welcome"" attitude that was REAL.

We have stayed at two other fine hotel in Dublin and while they were very nice......the DoubleTree will be our choice next time.",5,2013,03,15
237,Great hotel,"Stayed in the hotel for two nights after reopening from renovations and the rooms looked fantastic and was good value for money.
Great location, everything is in walking distance.
Staff were also very friendly.
Would definitely stay here again",5,2013,03,14
237,"Very, very good","I stay in Dublin every week for work at the moment and thought it was about time I gave this new renovated hotel a chance. I stayed here pre-renovation and thought it was rather average so I was looking forward to assessing the new version.

I have to say that I am incredibly impressed with the changes. The rooms have been kitted out beautifully, with great furnishings and incredible televisions. Fantastic personal free wi-fi service and some really nice little touches. I also really like the bathrooms which feel large and clean.

Some colleagues ate in the attached grill restaurant a couple of nights ago and remarked that it was the best steak they'd had in Dublin.

Overall I'm very impressed - clean, comfortable, quiet and a good location. What more could you ask for?",5,2013,03,13
237,"Unfortunately very, very tacky",The Morrison has been a highlight in Dublin for years.  The perfect comfortable and stylish destination.  I returned post 'renovation'.  The rooms have been done up in the worst way imaginable (unless you are a 5 year old girl).  Rather than holding on to the previous design whoever they've brought in to do it got carried away - it's cheap and tacky.  Comfortable sofa's replaced by plastic 'pleather' silver sofas; the rooms lit by neon boxes.  It's trying to be something it's not.  Beyond disappointing.   Not at all geared towards business users.  Ideal for a cheap 'hen do'.,1,2013,03,10
237,food problems,"In the hotel bar at 11.15pm we asked to order food and were presented with a menu with no vegetarian options so chose fish and chips. The waitress took our order then returned to tell us that food was only available as room service, and an even more limited selection at that. We said fine to put it on our rooms but we'd like to eat in the bar. They said no - their concern seemed to be that other people in the bar would then want to order food. But if they were hotel residents then why would it matter where they ate their food? And if they weren't residents, surely they could be told food was for residents only? 

Also, the patisserie at breakfast were, if not exactly stale in the sense of being hard, then certainly not fresh. And the apples in the fruit salad had turned to mush from having been in there much too long. 

Everything in the room was good though and the wi-fi was excellent.",3,2013,03,10
237,"Great location, great staff, what you expect from Hilton","We recently stayed for 4 nights at The Morrison during the first week of March. Hotel is located on the Liffey River and short walk to Temple Bar area. Hotel has had a complete renovation and is beautifully decorated. We had a king room and it was very spacious and comfortable. All of the staff members were great, so friendly and helpful. Kerry and Rob at the front desk really went out of their way to help us. Dinner at the Morrison Grill was great and breakfast was equally good.  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,03,10
237,Best Breakfast in Dublin,"I have stayed at the Morrison several times for business and have always enjoyed their breakfasts. The breakfast is made to order and have never tasted eggs so good! The selection of fruit and other breakfast items are very good as well. The rooms are modern and very clean. Parking is in a car park to the rear (special overnight rate of €12.00 euros). Location is fantastic, right in the city centre, walking to just about anything. The staff were extremely pleasant and professional. If it's within your budget, I would recommend it.",5,2013,03,04
237,Stylish hotel in great location!,Great hotel for girly weekend in dublin. Thin walls so the girl crying and screaming at 2.30am till 3.30 am woke me up and then impossible to get back to sleep until the tantrum was over. Thought about ringing down to reception but didnt want to wake my sleeping friend! Didnt really want to knock on the doir either as you never know what you will encounter! Great cocktails made by skilled bar staff. lovely rooms with lots of stylish touches. Breakfast service could be improved. Overall a good trip and would use the hotel again maybe if there was an offer on. ,5,2013,03,03
237,5 stars all round !!,"Had the pleasure of staying in the newly refurbished Morrison last weekend. We arrived early and Daniel the manager on duty organised a drink while we waited for our rooms to be ready. Well worth the wait :-) we were upgraded to a beautiful junior suite. The room was spotless, decor very trendy and we even had a balcony. We went for lunch, try the club sambo and sumo fries and of course a champagne cocktail or 2. The staff were excellent, very friendly and attentive and made great suggestions for cocktails. This hotel can give any 5 star in Dublin a run for its money!",5,2013,02,28
237,Superb hotel,Fantastic stay here really clean modern comfortable hotel. Bar and resturant staff excellent... Location is great also plenty to do and see within a short distance.No complaints at all.!!!!!!! We will definitely be back soon....,5,2013,02,25
237,"A very comfortable, stylish property in a very crowded market.","Stayed at the newly refurbished Morrison whilst watching the Six Nations and had a thoroughly enjoyable stay.  The refurbishment has dealt with many of the gripes listed in the past and has also added a new level of service in line with the standards of the Doubleetree format from Hilton.  The rooms are very stylish and contempary, how they will look in a few year's time is debatable but right now they are perfect.
The hotel is ideally placed for the main city centre attractions without being surrounded by noise and mayhem!",4,2013,02,25
237,Raising the bar on Dublin Hotel standards,"Stayed here for one night last weekend.  Expectations were high as they recently finished a 7million Euro revamp of the hotel and we were not dissapointed, it was very impressive from arrival to departure.

Smartly dressed receptionists on arrival were pleasant, friendly and informative.

The room was modern, roomy, some great funky pink lighting, beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was of a high standard with ranfall type shower which was nice and powerful.

Nice modern large screen lcd tv with several channels, I did not check the wi-fi but we were told a login code is available through the tv system.

A nice touch was every bedroom has a unique quote, painted onto the bedroom wall from an Irish poet or singer/band, making each room slightly different. 

Thankfully, there was a an absence of street noise, as it's not in the very noisy Temple Bar area but across the river from it. We had a very peaceful night sleep. It's still excellently located and near everything. The Luas stop is a 2 minute walk from the hotel, as is the Jervis Street Shopping Centre. There are also some local pubs if you want a change.

Another great touch was the reading lights which are fixed in place, but allow one to direct the light without disturbing your partner, if they are sleeping. There is also an inroom fridge with mini bar items, but also room to leave your own drinks if you need to. Nice selection of inroom teas and coffees also. If you need to iron something there is a nifty pull out mini board which does the trick.

Breakfast was really delicious, great selection of breads, yoghurts, juices, or full Irish,we ordered frsh pancakes and these were really good. Excellent service by the waiters and waitresses. The breakfast area is beautifully designed on two different levels.

We did not have dinner in the hotel, but the menu looked very appealing.

It was a very positive experience from start to finish. A return visit will be inevitable !",5,2013,02,25
237,You get what you pay,"Venue/Area: close to Temple bar but not too noisy
Room: stayed in an executive, and it is fairly small for an European 4 starred hotel but ok level as all you expect is to have a decent sleep after pubbing. There is virtually no difference in terms of size to the rooms between Standard and Executive (I mean there is, but not that huge difference so I would recommend to stay in the standard)
Amenity: OK
Cleanliness: Good
Bathroom: small but cozy, no bath tub (some of them have, according to my friend who stayed in the standard), Shower pressure is very high and that was pretty amazing.
Price: ummm i think it's a bit high for its quality. But again, newly refurbished and all clean so can't make much fuss.
Staffs: nice, they tried to book us a table at some restaurants, although we failed as it was a busy Sat. eve, but I actually felt that they wanted to help us.

The only thing that brought my review down was the music of the night bar downstairs which was so loudly played even after midnight, I could not sleep until they closed down.
THIS IS RIDICULOUS and the management should do something about this immediately.",3,2013,02,24
237,"Location, location, location. And service.","Spent a long weekend at The Morrison in the first few weeks after their re-opening. The hotel is between the Ha'penny and Grafton bridges, just across from Temple Bar, so you are within walking distance of many of Dublin's sights but far enough away to miss the late night noise. Public transportation is all around, as are lots of good restaurants and shops. Morrison Management was still putting the finishing touches on some of the common areas. We were impressed with the look - cool, sleek and modern - but more so with the service. The staff were pleasant, helpful and very, very responsive. From check in through check out, they made us feel special. Would definitely return.",5,2013,02,19
237,Wonderful!,"Me and my boyfriend stayed at this hotel from 16th-18th Feb. We arrived early at 10.00am but we checked straight away. The staff on reception were very nice and we were given a warm chocolate cookie on arrival which was beautiful. 

The room was immaculate. I loved the modern decor and the bathroom was a good size. I also enjoyed the big towels and the dressing gown in the room. The shampoo etc smelled really nice too. 

We went on the tour bus which dropped off near the hotel and we walked to grafton street for the shops. It is in a great place for everything. 

Overall, this was a nice hotel and it was in a perfect location. ",5,2013,02,19
237,Perfect Location,"Fab newly refurbished Morrison is just great. Stayed for two nights and we really enjoyed our stay. On check in we were given two hot cookies really nice touch!!  Location is fantastic within walking distance of Henry Street, Temple Bar and Grafton Street. Stayed in a Junior Suite which was very spacious with a great bathroom.  Breakfast was ok, fruit and yogurt was great, but the hot breakfast was disappointing. Staff pleasant and very helpful.  Hotel is beautiful and all the finishing touches really added to the luxury of  stay.  Cant wait to go back!",4,2013,02,19
237,As the Irish say.... Grand...,"My partner and i decided to book a last minute trip to Dublin through British Airways and we booked this hotel as part of the deal. Our first impression of the place was that it was really finished off nicely. We checked in and the staff were extremely pleasant and gave us a piping hot cookie to welcome us (lovely touch). We were on the 4th floor and it was gorgeous, just newly decorated. I loved the finishing touches like ribbon round the towels and lovely crabtree and Evelyn toiletries. You come out the hotel and head right across the bridge to the lively Temple Bar area. We had dinner in Gallaghers Boxty House, Michael serving us was lovely. Amazing food!!! Would recommend you book in advance though as really busy. Overall fantastic trip, stay and food...",5,2013,02,18
237,Amazing service in brand new premises,"The staff at the refurbished Morrison are just out of this world. Nothing is too much and they will think constantly in serving solutions and making your stay as pleasant and as comfortable as possible. Nothing goes unnoticed and the main aim is to please the hotel guest to the absolute maximum. The hotel is completely refurbished and looks the part. The gym is small and functional and offers plenty of machines to work out on. The bar is very cosy and also the staff there are very helpful and welcoming. The room I stayed in was beautiful in design, had gorgeous views over the Liffey river and has the most up to date TV technology I have ever seen. Also the bed was just perfect. I am looking forward to my next stay at the Morrison in Dublin.",5,2013,02,17
237,Great hotel in fab location,"Super hotel. Great if you love the mod cons- this hotel is full of them. Really cosy and modern. Great bar too. The staff were fab and v helpful. 
In a fab location. Stayed here twice and if we went back to Dublin I'd definately stay here again.
Would absolutely recommend. Great hotel",4,2013,02,17
237,Back At The Newly Refurbished Morrison,"Stayed here when taking in a show early Feb 2013. Hotel's looking good. Brighter decor, not that the old / darker decor bothered us. Reception staff friendly, service swift. It was the weekend Ireland played England in Rugby and yet despite the hotel being heavily booked the atmosphere was its customary relaxed. You don't feel as though there's a bustling city right outside when you stay here. Room wasn't huge but was adequate and nicely appointed, looking out over Swift Row. Toilet flushed a bit stiff but could probably be fixed with little effort. From the 3rd floor we were vaguely aware of the traffic, which might be a problem for very light sleepers but not for us. Would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to combine a chilled out stay with shopping and good night life - location is perfect, a comfortable distance from Temple Bar which is a five minute stroll.",4,2013,02,16
237,Lovely...!,"Amazing hotel, Great location, Extremely helpful staff!!

We stayed at the Morrison for a long weekend following its recent refurbishment. The hotel is of the highest standard and looks absolutely lovely. The staff made us feel very welcome (especially the reception manager) and went out of their way to make our stay perfect! Also there was always someone on hand for anything we required, such as room service & directions to local attractions. 

The hotel is in a perfect location for almost all tourist attractions, if not then it was a quick 5 minute taxi ride to where you needed to be.

The rooms were wonderful, spacious & modern. The rooms were cleaned daily (or as you required - if you didn't want to be disturbed; the do not disturb door hanger could be hooked onto the door handle). We stayed in a one bedroomed suite which had a dining area, lounge area, bedroom and large bathroom (having both a bath area and shower) and looked over the river.

Overall I couldn't have asked for a better trip away, the hotel and staff made my weekend! 

Thankyou to everyone at the Morrison!!",5,2013,02,12
237,Award Stay after reopening from refurbishment,"Stayed the first Tuesday (5 Feb) after opening weekend for a one night award stay.  Arrived at 2pm and room was not ready yet (before standard check in time so no issue). Held my luggage as I went for some lunch in town.  Arrived back at 3pm.  Room was ready and luggage was already there. 

Rm 420: Back corner facing side street (slight river and Jervis Center views).  Modern white room nicely appointed. King bed which was comfy with extra large pillows.  TV didn't work so staff came up and fixed pretty quickly.  Very nice fruit platter and two large sparkling/still water bottles for having Hilton status. The bathroom was average size.  Countertop did not seem to be redone though.  But still fine.  Wi-fi was fast and free (possibly just for HHonors).  

Lobby/front desk: Nicely done up.  Staff was were extremely helpful but could tell still learning system.  Ask for info on theatre/music that evening but although she tried had difficulty finding anything (no concierge on duty).  Have a computer/printer in lobby.  I wanted to check-in for flight but neither worked.  They were able to get the computer going but not the printer so was able to choose my seats and send BP to my phone.  Also found some good plays/music for the evening.  Asst GM was most accomodating and promised me a meal in the restaurant for my issues.  Staff also gave me the wrong directions to the nearest ATM ( in the Spar convienience store a block west of hotel vice east) 

Bar/Restaurant:  They was still some work being done (an artist had painted some pictures that he was installing and varnishing over on the columns) so had the paint smell.  I had a nice chat with him.  Carl behind the bar and the waitress from Lithuania were very courteous and attentive.  Well stocked with several Irish Craft brews (8 degrees and Dungarvan I believe).  Ate at the bar.  Ordered the John Dory catch of the day.  Was not to my personal liking but might have been just me.  Offered to pay for the beers but the bartender stated not to worry that it was covered by the A GM.

Checkout:  Had to wake up early to catch a flight.  The included breakfast didn't start to 7:30 so missed out on that.  Front desk provided directions to the Air Coach (since I was paying E7) a few blocks east and up O'Connell).  Bill included the cost of the meal and drinks.  Front desk said she would work out with the GM.  Have not seen a final bill yet so hopefully will work out.

All and all a very good stay.  Great location on the North bank with in the walking distance of everything.  Once they get opening weekend kinks out it will be a great place to stay.",4,2013,02,12
237,OMG- what a difference:),"I stayed for one night only last week:) on business 
What a difference since they have had a refit!!

The hotel looks beautiful - the bar area is really cosy with nice little areas for drinks,the food menu is complety different .
You can order from the bar and sit anywhere but also a dinning area.

Once you arrive you have a hot chocolate  cookie ,
The hall way heading up to the rooms are much better very beautiful - rooms have had a total overall , I stayed in the suite with beautiful decorated rooms,that were really calm with lovely blue touches and a little seating area next to the desk.

It was a total WOW for me.
You have to visit- it was fab even to just have a drink in the bar!!",5,2013,02,10
237,Great location,"We stayed in the morrison on its first weekend of opening following refurbishment. We were 2 couples. When we arrived at 4pm our rooms weren't ready. So we decided to go to the bar but that also wasn't ready for opening which was annoying. We got our rooms after about 30 mins and they were very nice. My husband and i were sent champagne to our room as a goodwill gesture which was a lovely touch. However, a few things weren't quite right. The light over the mini bar in our room wouldnt switch off and i had to call a member of staff at 2am to help me turn it off because i couldnt sleep with it on. We couldnt switch it off! The sockets in the other couples room located on the table werent working. The breakfast was amazing and the staff were extremely friendly and attentive. The location was fantastic. The bar was ok, fairly soulless. There was no bulmers/magners on draught and only long necks which are ridiculously expensive. Overall it was a positive experience and i would stay there again. The staff are super!",4,2013,02,09
237,Great location but room was poor,"The best things about this hotel were its location and breakfast.  Our room was disappointing, the window overlooked the restaurant so was frosted, limiting the light making it seem dull and drab. After a look at breakfast there will be approx 6 rooms like this so make sure you know what you are getting!",4,2013,02,08
237,Stunning renovation of classic dublin hotel,Having just checked in to the Morrison - Double Tree by Hilton I felt compelled to review it. I had stayed in the old Morrison and was not too impressed but this hotel is simply stunning and Double Tree would be very proud. Okay parking isn't on site but its not too far away either. The rooms are modern clean homely and beautifully decorated and they've managed to make traditionally smaller rooms really spacious and homely. The staff are superb and when you are so close to the city centre shopping district and temple bar you couldn't ask for a better location. Would highly recommend it.,5,2013,02,08
237,First Class !,"Although the hotel is not quite ready as it had been closed due to refurbishment, which was explained to my partner & I as we entered to enquire if we could have a lunchtime meal; we were treated with personal attention by the staff, and, advised we could look around, after our meal if we wanted to.  The ambience & decor were to my liking, and once the meal was presented - this too was delicious !  The Waitress was a credit to her trade !  Cheerful; helpful & conscientious.  The toilets (Rest rooms) were the best I have ever visited !  Well done to all staff !",5,2013,02,05
237,Excellent hotel for weekend break,"This hotel was absolutley brilliant, me and my partner stayed here for a long weekend late 2012, we arrived at the hotel late at night and there was a lot of staff around that greeted us warmly showed us around the facilities, the room was easy to find and to be honest was simple but luxurious too! Spotlessly clean, very big, not a great view from the window but as the nights were closing in early you rarely looked out, this was great value for money found on a website that was not the hotels direct one, there was everything in the room you would have needed, the bathroom was lovely and big, we spent one night out and another night we spent in the hotel bar, it was not particulary busy, mainly because this is literally opposite the Temple part of the city, but it had a lovely relaxed atmosphere and once we had ordered one drink we did not have to get up again as a member of the bar staff would regulary come over and ask if we wanted another, any snacks etc, we were very well taken care of on this break and when returning to Dublin in the near future i expect i would not hesistate to book this hotel again! Perfect weekend!!!",5,2013,02,05
237,It's not the first and it won't be the last,"This is not the first time and will not be the last time I stay at this beautiful hotel. With a fantastic location a stone's throw from Temple Bar (just cross the river) the hotel is a real gem. Well cared for in both common areas and rooms. Mine, on the second floor, included a large bathroom with wall shower and bathtub, a large bed, a desk and a sofa (as a psychoanalyst). Everything works perfectly. If I have to find a defect it is the air conditioning system that at night, even if switched off, makes noise and I had to sleep with earplugs because it bothers me. But now it's becoming the norm in all hotels...",5,2024,10,04

Tra l'altro noto solo ora che quando c'ero stato in precedenza era sotto il brand DoubleTree ed ora invece è Curio. Capisco benissimo il perché visto che è un hotel decisamente di alta gamma. 
L'hotel è molto bello, con una sala colazione scenica, un bar ristorante che dà sul Liffey e una posizione ottima per muoversi a piedi. La camera che mi hanno dato al secondo piano era moderna e funzionale, con luci fucsia e rosse a dare un tocco di stile. Ampio bagno con vasca e doccia. Ho dormito benissimo, nel buio e nel silenzio totale. La colazione ottima. Oltre ad una scelta di muffin ho provato anche i pancake fatti sul momento. 
Degno di nota soprattutto l'efficienza del personale. Mi hanno organizzato taxi e sveglie alla perfezione. Come dice il titolo, semplicemente perfetto.",5,2023,03,05

237,Un DoubleTree con stile,"Sono stato in questo bel hotel soltanto una notte ma l'ho apprezzato non poco. Innanzitutto la posizione è fantastica, in pieno centro, basta attraversare il fiume per essere a Temple bar.
La camera è decisamente curata e con uno stile un po' posh, diverso dai soliti DoubleTree che di solito sono più business, quasi anonimi direi, mentre questo è decisamente più un hotel alla moda.
Dai comodini che fanno la luce viola, al busto porta vestiti, sono i dettagli a fare la differenza. Come camera mi hanno dato una junior suite al terzo piano che si raggiunge dopo aver fatto qualche gradino dal corridoio.
La stanza, molto grande, presenta, oltre al letto, più di un divano, un tavolino, la scrivania e un sacco di amenità come macchinetta del caffè e tanti piccole utilità. Il bagno, anche questo enorme, presenta due lavelli, doccia e vasca grande. 
La vista dà sul fiume e nonostante sia al terzo piano ed abbia i tripli vetri, comunque il rumore dalla strada si sente e questo è l'unico difetto che le ho trovato. Se amate il silenzio assoluto, meglio chiedere una stanza che dà sull'interno.
Ottimo il bar, sia per i cocktails che per la colazione mattutina. Una esperienza perfetta.",5,2022,03,12

237,3 stelle italiano. ,"La mia recensione si basa su una junior suite con vista. Con vista sul muro del rudere a lato. Mi aspettavo almeno il fiume. Invece vista su un cantiere abbastanza rumoroso. Fortunatamente noi in camera ci stiamo solo la notte. La notte silenziosa. Ma non abbastanza perché i vetri non isolano così come le pareti, quindi oltre a sentire auto e festini privati dei vicini si sentivano anche alcuni rumori dalle altre camere. Il letto era comodo, la stanza pulita (per gli standard locali) e il bagno molto bello. Ottima la tv e la Nespresso. Attenzione ai ragni perché ogni tanto si nascono nei tappetini della doccia o nell’aria condizionata. La colazione era sufficiente. L’accoglienza del personale discreta. Diciamo che per un Hilton 4 stelle mi sarei aspettato di più. ",3,2021,09,11

237,Ottima esperienza!,"Il marchio Hilton è già una promessa di elevata qualità, ma con il Morrison si sono superati. L'arredamento e il design degli interni sono favolosi e il personale efficiente e attento. 
La colazione a buffet o à la carte. Meravigliosa!",5,2019,10,03
237,Nur zu empfehlen!,"Top Hotel. Super freundliche Mitarbeiter. Zimmer super und astrein sauber. Weil wir etwas zu früh zum Check-In da waren und ( aus eigenem Verschulden) 15 Minuten warten mussten, bis wir auf unser Zimmer konnte, haben wir an der Bar kostenfreie Getränke bekommen. Die Rezeptionsmitarbeiterin kam dann mit der Schlüsselkarte, nachdem Sie in der Zwischenzeit schon unser Gepäck auf das Zimmer gebracht hat. Würde jederzeit wieder dort einchecken.",5,2019,08,26

Buena calidad en los platos ofertados de su carta con una muy buena presentación. Buen servicio del
personal a su cargo. Y unos precios ajustados al
producto y servicio ofrecido.
A nosotros nos encantó la ensalada y la carne de ternera asada.",5,2019,07,08
237,Interesante opción céntrica.,"El hotel se encuentra en pleno centro, apenas cruzando el río se encuentra la zona de Temple Bar, además de tener muchas zonas comerciales cerca, al igual que cerca pasan muchos medios de transporte.
La habitación amplia y cómoda,  incluso te dan agua embotellada de cortesía. El proceso de recepción fue veloz y cordial, incluso nos dieron una galleta de bienvenida. La habitación no estaba lista así que cuidaron nuestro equipaje y luego al regresar ya nos esperaba en la habitación.
El desayuno bastante completo y los empleados super atentos. 
A mejorar sería el servicio de wifi  que hemos tenido varios problemas pero se pudieron solucionar rápidamente en recepción.",5,2019,06,11
237,Todo excelente ,"Excelente ubicación, perfecta habitación en tamaño y equipamiento, súper limpia y por sobre todo el personal es de lo mejor. Tuvimos un inconveniente en el dispositivo de wifi que habíamos encargado para nuestros viaje y ellos nos ayudaron a hacer todas las llamadas para solucionar el inconveniente. 
Cuando llegas te reciben con incas galletas calentitas y deliciosas y siempre hay manzanas de cortesía. 
La ubicación es excelente, tan solo cruzar el rio y estas en la zona del Templebar. ",5,2019,05,23
237,Excelente hotel y ubicación,"Hotel muy bien decorado, buena comodidad y excelente ubicación, prácticamente frente a la zona de Temple Bar (atravesando el puente a pie). El hotel cuenta con un restaurante muy bueno. Desayuno muy completo. Si viajamos nuevamente a Dublin, nos quedaríamos sin dudarlo en el mismo hotel.",5,2019,05,20
237,Personal,"sehr zentral, sehr nettes Personal, Willkommenskekse bei der Ankunft, sehr gutes Frühstück, der Mann an der Rezeption sagte uns einen Parkplatz gleich um die Ecke, wo wir von Sonntag auf Montag gratis stehen konnten - sehr bemüht!",5,2019,05,02
237,Hotel Feedback,"Gerne wieder! Personal, Hotel, Lage einfach top. Preis OK.

237,Fantástico ,"Excelente hotel por su localización, a 3 minutos del Temple bar andando; además excelente la atención de todo el personal, unas instalaciones súper bonitas y muy modernas, junto con un toque de elegancia. También un sobresaliente en limpieza y el desayuno. Si vuelvo a Dublin repetiré el hotel.",5,2019,04,06
237,Breve viaggio di lavoro a Dublino,"Ho soggiornato presso The Morrison nella settimana che precede la festa di San Patrizio, nonostante l'elevato numero di persone presenti il servizio dell'hotel è stato sempre all'altezza della situazione.",5,2019,03,19

237,Excelente !!!! GRACIAS ,"Excelente hotel, ubicación muy buena aunque cuesta un poco encontrarlo ya que no está bien señalizado. 
El check in y el check out fueron increíble. La chica que nos atendió (perdona, no recuerdo su nombre!) fue muy agradable. Confirmo nuestra reserva, nos explico nuestras ventajas como miembro HHonors y sobre horarios de bar y restaurante. La habitación es muy nueva y funcional. Nos  gustó mucho el encontrarnos con el menú  del restaurante y más vouchers a la llegada. También  agradecer la atención de  bienvenida y la carta! Que  detalle! Tomamos un par de cocteles  en el bar y son increíbles! El restaurante para cenar está bien. Calidad precio este es de los mejores hoteles. Cuidan al cliente y la atención a los detalles, WoW!!! Gracias! Lo recomendaremos.",5,2018,12,12
237,EXCELENTE UBICACIÓN,"Excelente ubicación, a escasos metros del Temple Bar pero libre del ruido de esa zona. Ambos centros comerciales están a pocos minutos. Personal altamente capacitado. Todo lo inherente a la gastronomía es perfecto. ",5,2018,11,20
237,Ragguardevole - centrale e funzionale,"A soli cinque minuti a piedi da Temple Bar, è in zona centrale e tranquilla. Tutti i punti d'interesse della città sono raggiungibili con facilità. Camera di bel design, spaziosa e ottimamente insonorizzata. Il servizio é certamente all'altezza. Se si vuole essere pignoli, l'unico appunto é da fare al locale bagno, peraltro sempre tenuto pulito e ordinato, dove per la doccia non vi é un box, ma - ancora ! - la famigerata e fastidiosa tendina che, in ogni parte del mondo, svolazza e ti si appiccica fastidiosamente al corpo. Il prezzo é sicuramente adeguato.
Ottima struttura, senz'altro da consigliare.",5,2018,10,28
237,Una notte stellare,"Soggiorno di una notte nella camera King con vista sul fiume.Posizione centralissima, pulizia e qualità del servizio eccellente, simpatica l'idea del cookie di benvenuto. Servizio accogliente ed efficiente, prezzo al di sopra della media.",5,2018,10,22
237,Excelente ubicación.,"Esta ubicado al cruzar el rio que divide el hotel y la zona del temple bar (la mejor zona nocturna, con bares y música en vivo) 
Es una ubicación perfecta por qué a la noche es silenciosa y puedes descansar tranquilo. Llegas a todos los lugares turísticos solo caminando. A tan solo 20 minutos. No hace falta tomar el bus turístico. 
La comida es muy rica
El desayuno está perfecto, es variado y delicioso.
La atención es amable.
La cama súper cómoda.
La limpieza es perfecta.",5,2018,09,09
237,Excelente ubicación,"Hotel muy bien situado, cerca de todo. Ideal para no coger transporte público. Atención del personal excelente. Instalaciones muy nuevas. Muy tranquilo y camas muy cómodas. Precio acorde a la calidad aunque conviene mirar a menudo el precio porque varía sensiblemente, incluso en cuestión de horas.",5,2018,09,06
237,Excelente hotell,"Hotel de buen nivel, muy bien situado a pocos pasos del centro.
Habitaciones correctas y un buen desayuno buffet.
A destacar la gran calidad del restaurante, con platos bien trabajados y una calidad excelente.",5,2018,08,23
237,Buono ma non perfetto ,"Posizione perfetta per “godere” la città. Hotel pulito, personale cortese, camera spaziosa, con qualche piccola imperfezione. Nella mia camera non era possibile asciugarsi i capelli in bagno per mancanza di presa elettrica, tornati stanchi alle 16,30 la camera non era ancora stata sistemata ... piccole cose ...",4,2018,08,21
237,Viaggio di lavoro estivo,Albergo situato nel centro di Dublino vicino alla zona Temple Bar è direttamente sul fiume lively. Meglio farsi dare le camere che danno sullinterno così non si è disturbati dalla strada. Un po’ caro ma ottime camere e servizi.,4,2018,08,12
237,Cerca de todo,"Hotel hiper céntrico....... pero lejos del bullicio.  Al lado del río, a 200 metros del barrio Templeton bar.  La recepción es buena y rápida.  Las habitaciones, son bastante cómodas así como la cama.  Aunque el baño está mal diseñado con zonas muertas.  El desayuno es poco variado para su categoría aunque tienen una lista de platos que puedes pedir sin cargo.  Su restaurante si que es bueno.  Bueno, con bastantes platos a escoger y personal atentos y amables.",4,2018,08,07
237,Sehr angenehmes Hotel in Bestlage - hat allerdings seinen Preis,"Das Hotel ist sehr gut. Es hat eine warme, herzliche Atmosphäre, ist sehr neu, stylisch und sauber. Das Personal ist extrem freundlich, die Lage in Dublin ist wohl kaum zu toppen. Zu Fuß alles wichtige zu erreichen. 

Warum es trotzdem nur 4 Sterne gibt: Der Preis ist extrem hoch. 350 € für eine Nacht für unser Zimmer, welches nicht besonders groß war, im Zwischengeschoss mit kleinem Fenster und Blick auf ein Vordach hatte, ist schon sehr hochpreisig. Es war sogar eine bessere Zimmerkategorie, und dafür war das Zimmer doch ""nichts besonderes"".

Aber das sind Luxusprobleme, muss jeder selber wissen ob er einen solchen Preis dafür bezahlen will. Ansonsten war ja (fast) alles top.

Folgende ""Kleinigkeiten"" sind doch zu bemängeln gewesen:

Duschtür schließt nicht richtig, Bad viel zu dunkel, zu kleines Fenster und der Frühstücksraum war viel zu klein für all die Gäste. So wurden wir in die Bar nebenan verfrachtet, die auch zum Hotel gehört. Das ist halt einfach nicht schön, denn in einem Barsessel mit einem 30cm hohen Tisch frühstückt es sich einfach nicht so schön. Das war schade.",4,2018,08,04
237,Super Hotel an toller lage,"Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral und man kann die Umgebung ohne Probleme zu Fuss erkunden. Es sind nur wenige Meter zum Ausgangsviertel mit all seinen Pup's und Bar's. Das Personal war sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Das Zimmer mit Flussblick war sehr geräumig und sauber. Kleiner Nachteil, die Fenster lassen sich nur einen Spalt öffnen. Internet funktionierte einwandfrei. Frühstück haben wir nicht genutzt. Alles in allem ein etwas teureres Hotel, aber es ist seinen Preis wert.",5,2018,07,06
237,Ottimo per la posizione ,"Dublino si scopre una città che si visita a piedi, ma la posizione di questo hotel è perfetta, centralissima. A 200mt da The temple bar, quindi nella zona dei locali e dei pub. L’hotel è bello, pulito, il personale molto cordiale. Il cibo forse un po’ troppo ricercato, ma la colazione al mattino è molto varia. Unica nota negativa, il costo elevato. Ma Dublino è una città non proprio economica e considerando la qualità e la posizione dell’hotel, di certo ne vale la pena.",4,2018,06,23
237,Design Hotel mitten in Dublin,"Zentraler geht es nicht, direkt am Liffy. Ein Hotel mit internationalen Gästen und tollen Design Elementen. Das Frühstück lässt keine Wünsche übrig- die Auswahl ist echt gut. Die Zimmer sind modern eingerichtet- aber trotzdem gemütlich.
Mit der hinter dem Haus haltenden Luas ist man schnell überall in Dublin, die Innenstadt kann man bequem zu Fuß erkunden.
Am besten hier die Irland Rundreise starten, und den Mietwagen in Dublin übernehmen",5,2018,06,06
237,"Top Lage, tolles Hotel","Freundliches Personal, voellig problemlos, im Gegenteil, ganz tolle Lage direkt am Liffey. Und wer typishes Irish breakfast mag ist hier genau richtig. Saubere Zimmer, voellig ruhig und die Abholung per Taxi nachts klappt ebenfalls. Sehr zu empfehlen, zumal auch das Preis-Leistungsverhaeltnis fuer Dublin sehr gut ist.",4,2018,05,28
237,Tolles Hotel in Top Lage,"Nicht gerade billig, aber ein Spitzenhotel in bester Lage. Direkt am Liffey und nur 5 Gehminuten zur Temple Bar. Freundliches Personal und exklusive Ausstattung. Sehr ruhige und große Zimmer. Restaurant und Barpreise im Rahmen.",5,2018,05,12
237,Impecable hotel,"Excelente ubicación, a pasos de los pubs... El hotel excelente, moderno, con desayuno increíble. La atención no se queda atrás, comenzando con la tradicional cookie en la recepción con la que la cadena Double Tree recibe a los huéspedes en sus hoteles.",5,2018,04,07
237,FANTÁSTICO,"Nos alojamos recientemente en The Morrison durante cuatro noches y podemos decir que absolutamente todo es una maravilla. 
El hotel tiene un diseño espectacular, moderno y cool en la mejor ubicación para alojarse en Dublín unos días. El trato del staff, que destaca por su disponibilidad y amabilidad, es cercana, sencilla y atenta.
La comodidad de la habitación es excelente, silenciosa, amplia, cómoda además de preciosa.
Cada mañana se sirve un desayuno buffet excelente que además puedes completar con una carta de platos que se preparan al momento. El salón donde se sirve el desayuno es genial, igual que el restaurante. La fitness room también es digna de mención. Tiene todo lo necesario para hacer un poco de ejercicio antes de un buen desayuno o antes de salir a dar un paseo por la animada noche de Dublín. 
Sin duda, el mejor hotel para alojarse en Dublín.",5,2018,04,05
237,Fantastico,"Inmejorable ubicación cerca de todo (walking distance) ,habitaciones cómodas y muy bien distribuidas, solo algo raro la ubicación del sanitario. El desayuno es abundante y variado. Opcion muy recomendable para unos días en Dublín.",4,2018,03,18
237,Settimana di lavoro,"Ho pernottato per una settimana al Morrison ottimo hotel in zona centrale di Dublino vicino alla zona turistica del Temple Bar ed anche vicino all’ufficio dove dovevo andare x lavoro.

Camera spaziosa e pulita, riscaldamento e condizionamento un po’ rumoroso, meglio spegnere tutto di notte, come pure le luci viola dei finti comodini e ripiano con il set colazione la cui luce incredibilmente si spegne dal lato sinistro del letto !! 

Unico neo il bagno, mancanza del bidet anche se purtroppo comune fuori Italia ed il lavabo troppo piccolo, non si riesce neppure a sciacquarsi le braccia, buono solo x viso, mani e denti, si è obbligati a farsi sempre la doccia.

Colazione un po’ cara ma abbondante, a scelta tra buffet o continentale mi ha colpito la disponibilità del miele che cola in una ciotola direttamente dal telaio di un arnia.

Personale gentile e puntuale, sempre disponibile.",4,2018,02,10
237,Honeymoon,"Hotel meraviglioso. Personale affabile, gentile e cordiale, camera spaziosa e fornita di tutti i servizi e comfort. Bagno completamente in marmo con una bella doccia grande. Letto molto comodo e acqua gratuita ripristinata quotidianamente.
Dublino era parte del nostro viaggio di nozze e lo staff è stato così carino da farci trovare una sorpresa in stanza ❤️
Colazione super, davvero varia e di qualità. Provate il pudding perché è davvero buono!!",5,2018,01,10
237,Enttäuschung!,"Wir hatten dieses Hotel anlässlich unseres Citytrips in Dublin gebucht!
Es hatte hier bei TripAdvisor und anderen Foren sehr gute Bewertungen , zudem ist die Lage ausgezeichnet! Man ist nahe allen Sehenswürdigkeiten und in 3 Minuten auf der Temple Bar ! Ohne dabei störenden Lärm dulden zu müssen ! Das gebotene WLAN funktioniert einwandfrei! Das war leider auch schon das positive!
Der Empfang an der Rezeption war kühl und herzlos! Als wir hier abgefertigt waren durften wir dann auf unser Zimmer ! Es spickte nicht vor Dreck, man kann durchaus hier schlafen ! Aber wenn man weiße Möbel hat muss man nun auch mal öfter Staub putzen! Fingerabdrücke auf allen Spiegeln und keine Klobürste im Bad ! In einem Hotel erwarte ich einfach Sauberkeit!
Das schlimmste aber war das Frühstück! 15€ für das wenig aufgewärmte Fast Food ist frech ! Es braucht kein Riesen Buffet aber wenigstens etwas Frische ! Selbst die Obstschale war Fast Food !
Klimatisch fühlt man sich in Sibirien! Alle Gäste saßen mit dicken Pullovern und Schal am Tisch ! Sollte das die Frische an das Essen bringen?
Tipp: Geld sparen und gegenüber im kleinen gemütlichen Café für 7€ das Frühstück genießen!
Auch hier wieder der unterkühlte Service ! Wobei manch Mitarbeiter dann doch mal ein nettes Lächeln über hatte!
Vielleicht haben einfach nur die stressigen Sylvester Tage bemerkt bzw. Es kann ja nicht allen recht gemacht werden aber so war nun mal unsere Erfahrung!
Schade !",2,2017,12,31
237,Muy bien situado,"Situado en el centro pero sin los agobios de la gente saliendo de los pubs a altas horas haciendo jaleo.
Habitación muy cómoda, aunque la temperatura de la calefacción demasiado baja.
Desayuno completo y con opción de carta caliente.
Personal muy amable y dispuesto a ayudar en todo.",4,2017,12,27
237,Das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis ist für Dublin gut,"Schönes Hotel, saubere moderne Zimmer, gute Organisation.
Das Personal hinter dem Empfang könnte ein wenig fröhlicher sein (oder wenigstens so tun) und vielleicht ab und zu mal lächeln. Sonst alles in Ordnung.",4,2017,12,24
237,Weihnachtsurlaub ,"Ein sehr schönes, modernes Hotel. Bei unserer Ankunft haben wir als erstes einen leckeren Keks bekommen. Das Personal war freundlich und sehr bemüht, das Frühstück war lecker und insgesamt war das Hotel super sauber. Es war natürlich nicht günstig. Deshalb 4 Punkte",4,2017,12,21
237,"DORMIRE SI MA CON OCCHIO APERTO, PERCHE' FIDARSI E' BENE MA NON FIDARSI E' MEGLIO","abbiamo pernottato 4 notti in questo hotel eravamo i 4 ""due coppie""
la prima notte la mia camera non era riscaldata perche' l'impianto non funzionava, il giorno dopo fu riparato. Credevo che aspettando degli ospiti si dovesse verificare prima se tutto è ok. 
il personale addetto non collaborativo.
biancheria (lenzuola - teli da bagno) non sostituiti se non richiesto, la gestione dei pigiami personali lasciati in terra da chi rifaceva le camere.
camere silenziose, ma bagno con un solo lavabo, senza bidet, e vasca con tendina.
fatto increscioso dove la struttura ha poi dimostrato di non avere rispetto della clientela: abbiamo chiesto di farci una prenotazione per la cena per 4 al ristorante stellato più importante di Dublino ""volevo farci una recensione"" 
siamo arrivati al ristorante e la prenotazione non c'era e quindi non abbiamo potuto cenare.
questo può accadere ma sentirsi dire che il problema non il loro ma il nostro non è tollerabile.
nessuna scusa ne formale ne informale abbiamo ricevuto da nessun addetto all'hotel.
avendoci anche il ristorante interno non abbiamo ricevuto nemmeno un accomodatevi da noi cercheremo di accontentarvi.
in altre location ""dove l'ospite e' sacro"" avrebbero fatto di tutto per scusarsi.
l'unica figura eccellente, e quindi veramente fuori luogo in un marasma tale, è il dipendente WILLIAM PEART che sono felice di aver conosciuto, tutti gli altri potrebbero anche fare altro nella vita.",3,2017,12,06
237,"Toplage, ausgezeichneter Service, nettes Personal",Das Hotel ist sehr zentral gelegen und trotzdem sehr ruhig in den Zimmern. Der Service ist perfekt und das Personal sehr zuvorkommend. Ein- und Auschecken äusserst unkompliziert. Sehr gutes Frühstück. Immer gerne wieder.,5,2017,11,27
237,Hervorragendes Hotel in perfekter Lage,"Erst einmal: die Lage gegenüber dem Temple-Bar District ist perfekt. Es ist alles fußläufig erreichbar, auch Guiness oder Jameson. Das Hotel selbst hat moderne Zimmern, großen Fernseher, ist sauber und ruhig. Rezeption freundlich und hilfsbereit. Wir haben einmal Frühstück nachgebucht für 16,50 pro Person - es war seit langem das beste Frühstück in einem Hotel (sehr viel inbegriffen, auch was man anderswo extra bezahlen muss (wie z.B. perfekten French Toast)). Dublin selbst muss man nicht länger als drei Tage bsuchen - aber wenn es noch einmal sein soll -> dann dieses Hotel!",4,2017,11,03
237,Die Erwartungen wurden nicht erfüllt!,"Wir hatten dieses Hotel für einen Städteurlaub in Dublin gewählt. Die Lage des Hotels war perfekt. Der Service war für ein Hotel dieser Kategorie mäßig (Zimmerservice um 19.00 Uhr, fehlende Handtücher, Kleidung wahllos in die Ecke gelegt). Die Betten waren von schlechter Qualität. Am letzten Morgen nutzten wir das Früchstücksbuffet im Hotel, welches von herausragender Qualität war, allerdings nicht im Preis eingeschlossen war. Insgesamt ein ordentliches Hotel in guter Lage mit einem schlechten Preis- Leistungsverhältnis",3,2017,11,01
237,Nettes zentral gelegenes Hotel! ,"Das Hotel wurde für einen Wochenendtrip in Dublin besucht. Das Zimmer war etwas zu klein und zu laut. Allerdings befindet sich das Hotel auch direkt in der Innenstadt und wir hatten ein Zimmer zur Seitenstraße hin bezogen. Bei geschlossenen Fenstern war der Strassenlärm hörbar. Diesen hat uns aber nicht sonderlich gestört. Das Bett war sehr gemütlich und mit einem härteren und einem weicheren Kissen ausgestattet. 
Das Bad ausreichend geräumig und sauber. Es gab eine Minibar, die Möglichkeit Kaffee, Tee und heiße Schokolade zuzubereiten, ein Bügelbrett/-eisen, einen Föhn, Bademantel und Badelatschen. Das Frühstück war in Ordnung und der Service stets freundlich und zuvorkommend. All in all hatten wir einen tollen und sehr angenehmen Aufenthalt. Für Businessbesucher als auch Wochenendtrip in Dublin kann ich dieses Hotel absolut empfehlen! ",4,2017,09,27

237,OTTIMA IMPRESSIONE,"Purtroppo ho soggiornato in questo hotel soltanto per qualche ora in serata e nottata poiché per emergenza familiare sono dovuta tornare in Italia il giorno in cui ho fatto il check-in all'hotel. Sarei dovuta restare due giorni ma mi ha fatto da subito un'ottima impressione..  innanzitutto sono stati gentilissimi riguardo il rimborso e il pagamento, appena arrivati ci hanno offerto un cookie grande e caldo BUONISSIMO, cosa mai vista in alcun hotel in cui sia mai stata. Camere belle, struttura bellissima e in ottima posizione, unico difetto forse è tutto un po' troppo viola e rosa ahahah ",4,2017,08,26
237,"Sehr schönes, modernes und sauberes Hotel!","Wir haben drei Nächte im Morrison Doubletree in Dublin verbracht und hatten dort einen sehr schönen Aufenthalt. Das Personal war sehr freundlich, die Zimmer sehr modern, gross und sauber und trotz der Nähe zum Temple-Bar Ausgehviertel war es sehr ruhig (wir hatten Zimmer 203 und 105) und man konnte sehr gut schlafen. Das Frühstück (Continental Breakfast) war gut, mit EUR 15.- pro Person vielleicht aber etwas teuer. Dennoch kann ich nichts am Morrison kritisieren, alles war sehr gut, auch das Restaurant ist für Fleischliebhaber absolut empfehlenswert. Die Lage ist perfekt: alles in Gehdistanz, auch zum sehenswerten EPIC Museum sind es nur ca. 20 Minuten zu Fuss. Wir würden auf jeden Fall wieder hier übernachten und können dieses Hotel ohne Vorbehalt empfehlen.",5,2017,08,06
237,Todo a la altura,"Me alojé en el Morrison durante cuatro días en julio. Al llegar había ya realizado el check in digital. Aun cuando era antes del horario, la habitación ya estaba disponible. Era muy cómoda, las camas excelentes, con acceso a internet, y los accesorios de cortesía. 
El personal fue muy atento a nuestras necesidades.
La ubicación es perfecta, muy a mano de todo . A dos cuadras del Temple Bar, a una del centro comercial Jervis,
Todo eso sumó a una estadía perfectz.",5,2017,07,25

237,"Excelente ubicación, muy buen hotel","El hotel tiene una excelente ubicación, esta a dos manzanas de Temple Bar. El desayuno fue bastante bueno, muy recomendados los huevos benedictinos, de igual manera el restaurante ""Morrison Grill"" la comida fue MUY buena.
La habitación era pequeña pero acogedora y muy limpia. Mi unica mala experiencia fue con un empleado del hotel que no tuvo muy buena actitud para ayudarme a resolver un tema con el televisor, despues de el, llego otra persona muy amable y me ayudaron sin problema.
Totalmente recomendable.",5,2017,06,06
237,Wunderbarer Aufenthalt,"Bei unserer Ankunft wurden wir sehr herzlich mit 2 leckeren Cookies begrüßt. Schon die Lobby ist hell und einladend. Unser Zimmer war geräumig, die Einrichtung angenehm modern, das Bett groß und bequem. Es gab eine Minibar, die Möglichkeit Kaffee, Tee und heiße Schokolade zuzubereiten, ein Bügelbrett/-eisen, einen Föhn, Bademantel und Badepantoffel. Im TV waren 5 deutsche Sender zu empfangen. Wir hatten ein Zimmer mit Blick auf die Liffey gebucht. Die Aussicht war zwar wunderbar, der Verkehrslärm jedoch hoch. Auch bei geschlossenen Fenstern – sie sind leider nicht richtig dicht – hört man den Verkehr. Uns hat es nicht gestört, aber Lärmempfindliche könnten hiermit Probleme haben. Das Bad war schön und bot genügend Platz. Was wir uns hier wünschen würden, wäre eine Duschtrennwand auf der Badewanne statt eines Vorhangs (aus hygienischen Gründen), eine Vorrichtung für die Badetücher und eine WC-Bürste. Leider wurde das Zimmer oft spät gemacht. Einmal haben wir das Zimmermädchen kurz nach 16 Uhr um Reinigung gebeten. Das ist ungünstig wenn man vom Sightseeing zurückkommt und vor dem Abendessen noch etwas entspannen möchte. Das Frühstück war sehr gut – mit vielen frischen Zutaten. Das Brot hat uns prima geschmeckt und den leckeren Smoothie vermissen wir sehr. Das Personal im gesamten Hotel war jederzeit freundlich und hilfsbereit. WLAN hat leider zwischendurch versagt. Wir können das Morrison zu 100 % weiterempfehlen und werden, wenn wir wieder nach Dublin kommen, auf jeden Fall dort übernachten. Allein schon die Lage direkt im Zentrum ist unschlagbar. Zu empfehlen ist auch das Grill-Restaurant, das sich im Erdgeschoß befindet.",5,2017,05,24
237,Una muy buena opción en el corazón de Dublin,"El hotel está en el corazón de Dublin a 3 minutos a pie de temple Bar y cerca de las principales atracciones San Patricio, Dublin castle, Guinnes store House etc. 
Habitaciones amplias y limpias muy buen internet y personal muy amable. 
El desayuno si es un poco caro y no tan variado pero cerca del hotel hay muy buenos lugares para comer. 
En general una muy buena experiencia",4,2017,04,22
237,Caro pero recomendable,"El hotel está en una ubicación inmejorable si se está buscando algo cercano a Temple Bar en San Patricio. El personal atento, las habitaciones cómodas y el ambiente muy tranquilo. Es caro, aunque no más que otros hoteles de la cadena, pero merece la pena.",5,2017,03,27

237,da ripetere,"Bell'hotel in ottima posizione, stanze ampie, moderne e dotate di ogni comfort. A piedi si possono raggiungere tutte le principali attrazioni di Dublino. Wifi gratuito e computer a disposizione nella lobby. La colazione si svolge in una sala non molto grande ma veramente particolare ed è abbondante anche se non ampia come in altri Hilton, comunque oltre che servirsi al buffet freddo e caldo (cornetti, muffin, pane, muesli e cereali vari, porridge, yogurt, succhi, frutta, uova, bacon, pomodori, funghi, donuts...) si possono ordinare da un menù che consegnano all'arrivo cose come french toast (ottimi), pancakes, eggs benedict, salmone... Affianco alla sala colazioni c'è anche il bar-ristorante.
Plauso particolare va al night manager Papa che ci ha incluso la colazione nella tariffa in men che non si dica (il ragazzo che ci aveva fatto il checkin aveva detto che non lo era e ci sembrava strano, ma eravamo appena arrivati e troppo stanchi per metterci a litigare, abbiamo preferito chiedere nuovamente la sera, di ritorno da un bel giro a Temple Bar :p, e abbiamo fatto bene) e concesso un check out gratuito alle 14:00 il giorno della nostra partenza!

237,"Gute Lage, guter Service - Suite teilweise suboptimal","Die Lage direkt am Liffey und im lebhaftesten Teil Dublins ist nicht zu übertreffen. Alleine deshalb ist dieses Hotel für eine Stadtreise nach Dublin unbedingt zu empfehlen. Parken zu einem vergünstigten Tarif ist in einem Parkhaus ungefähr hundert Meter entfernt möglich.

Die Suite war in einigen Details nicht ganz den Erwartungen entsprechend. Insgesamt aber OK. Irgendwie quietschte die Bettkonstruktion so, als ob der Schreiner sich da nicht selber reingelegt hat. Das Bad war auch nicht ganz dem aktuellen Stand entsprechend.

Dennoch nochmal: Die Lage entschädigt für kleinere Suboptimalitäten, die Mitarbeiter waren freundlich, das Frühstück auch in Ordnung.",4,2016,11,20
237,Buena noche,"He estado con mi pareja una noche. Una habitación superior bastante amplia y acogedora. Buenas instalaciones y muy cerca de la zona de temple bar. Check in rápido pero sin mucha información. Cerca de muchas tiendas y los principales focos de gente. Muy recomendable
",5,2016,10,31
237,"Tolles Hotel, perfekte Lage!","Tolles Hotel, perfekte Lage! Zimmer sehr schön, Service perfekt! Auch im Restaurant sehr nett und freundlich. Der Unterschied zwischen den Zimmern in M und 3 ist uns im Vergleich nicht ganz erschienen beide schön, beide eigentlich gleich groß, aber anderer Preis! Trotzdem als Fazit: Jederzeit wieder!",5,2016,10,30
237,Uno de los mejores hoteles que conocí en mi vida!,"Este hotel es moderno, pero muy personal y con una decoración creativa y delicada, que hace mucho honor a Dublin. Hermosa la cita del poema de un autor irlandés que estaba pintada en una de las paredes de nuestra habitación. Nuestra habitación, además de hermosa, era super cómoda. Nunca olvidaré la gigantesca y confortable cama! El desayuno, inmejorable! Variado, exquisito y con un horario muy amplio. El personal, inolvidable! Destaco la amabilidad de Sarah, del sector del desayuno, y de Darren, de la recepción, que se ocupó con suma dedicación para que tuviéramos garantizado nuestro taxi hacia el aeropuerto. :-)",5,2016,10,27
237,Modernidad y calidad en pleno centro de Dublin,"Nos alojamos un fin de semana y nada más llegar nuestra habitación estaba lista con antelación. Se agradece! Cuando el check-in se inicia a las 15:00 ya pudimos hacer uso de la habitación desde las 14:00, me resultó muy considerado.
Y de regalo, con el mapa de la ciudad, las  tradicionales Cookies Irlandesas.
El personal muy profesional y muy agradable, en el trato, las indicaciones, el servicio y la limpieza. Todo esto en un entorno moderno, nuevo, decorado de manera minimalista y con gusto. 
La habitación muy limpia, amenities en el lavabo, agua mineral y todo lo necesario para preparar  Té o café, e incluso mesa de planchado. Al igual que el funcionamiento del Wi-Fi, todo muy correcto.
Solo una pequeña detracción, en cuanto a la calefacción. Sugerimos que estaría bien tener un regulador de temperatura. Igualmente al llamar y solicitar más calor, desde recepción lo solventaron. Por lo demás, todo muy satisfactorio.
En el desayuno, al contratarlo completo, teníamos incluido en el omelettes, tortitas o waffles hechos a tu gusto. Aparte de ello tienes zumos, bollería, mermeladas caseras, surtidos de panificados, lácteos, cereales, frutas y buffet caliente variado.Solo echamos en falta embutidos y quesos, pero estaba muy rico todo!
Un pequeño apunte sería mejorar el café, que está muy fuerte y no hay manera de endulzarlo, pero si pides un té, son los mejores! Otro gran punto a favor es que tienen un amable personal hostelero de habla hispana y la Maître irlandesa es muy simpática. 
Recomendable, sin duda alguna!",4,2016,10,04
237,Genial,"Es un hotel excepcional, por si situación, al otro lado del río justo enfrente del Temple Bar, y un servicio perfecto. 
Tienen una solución para todo, compra de billetes bus turístico, recomendaciones de pubs... Cualquier sugerencia.
Desayuno muy bueno y los fines de semana horario muy amplio. Muy recomendable.",5,2016,09,27
237,Hotel der gehobenen Klasse / Ideal gelegen für Stadtbesuch,"Das Hotel ""The Morrison"" ist ein Hotel der gehobenen Klasse. Das Hotel ist direkt am Fluss gelegen in der Nähe der Halfpenny Bridge und dem Jervis Shopping Centre. Das Personal ist überaus freundlich und gibt viele hilfreiche Tipps. Die Hotelzimmer sind geräumig, das Badezimmer ist gross und es ist sauber. Die Betten sind gut. Wir hatten ein Zimmer ohne Frühstück. Es gibt diverse gute Cafés in der Nähe. Die Hotelbar im Restaurant macht sehr gute Cocktals. Unbedingt den Transmetropolitan versuchen. Es ist ein Cosmopolitan mit einem Spritzer Irish Single Malt. Der Barkeeper ist sehr aufmerksam, erkennt einem am 2. Abend wieder. Super Live Musik am Freitagabend.
Wir waren das 2. Mal in Dublin und würden sicherlich wieder dieses Hotel wählen. Es ist zusätzlich sehr ideal gelegen für Erkundungstouren in der Stadt.",5,2016,09,07
237,Ideal für den Stadtbesuch,"Zentral gelegen, sauber, sehr freundliches Personal, reichhaltiges Buffet, Restaurant und Fitness vorhanden. 
Sie finden hier alles für Ihren nächsten Stadtbesuch. Ganz in der Nähe von Shopping Streets, Templebar District kann alles zu Fuss einfach erreichbar ",4,2016,08,28
237,Besser geht nicht,"Sehr schönes Hotel und optimal für einen Städtetrip geeignet. Personal sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. das Frühstück ist sehr zu empfehlen. Haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Werden es beim nächsten Aufenthalt bestimmt wieder buchen. Die Lage ist optimal für einen Städtetrip. Airlink-Haltestelle,  Hop on Hop of Bushaltestelle etc. alles in der Nähe. Kurz über die Brücke und schon ist man im Geschehen.",5,2016,08,23
237,Maravilloso hotel ,"Un hotel perfecto para conocer Dublin. Esta muy céntrico, el restaurante es muy bueno y el desayuno extraordinario. 
Tuvimos un problema de limpieza, pero la respuesta del hotel fue muy rápida. Personal muy atento y en especial Diana.

",4,2016,08,21
237,"Il centro del....""mondo""....","L'ubicazione di questo hotel è eccezionale. Puoi raggiungere, volendo, tutto quello che è fondamentale a Dublino a piedi. Non ha la maestosità alla quale ci abitua la catena Hilton, ma nel complesso ne mantiene il servizio e la professionalità. Abbiamo soggiornato in una junior suite con vista fiume molto comoda e spaziosa; unica grossa pecca: il materasso rigido ed i cuscini non esattamente comodi. La colazione è qualitativamente ottima, forse maggiore varietà nell'offerta del salato e del dolce, non guasterebbe.",4,2016,08,18
237,Muy lindo y muy buena ubicacion,"Muy bonito hotel, moderno, limpio y con habitaciones amplias y con mucho confort la atención del personal es muy cordial y siempre predispuestos a ayudar. La ubicación es excelente cerca de todas las atracciones. Sin dudas es para recomendar",4,2016,07,17
237,Sehr Gute Lage,"Direkt am Fluss gegenüber der Temple Bar und nahe der Halfpenny Bridge. Exzellentes Frühstück und merci für den Upgrade in eine Suite.
Das Zimmer war geräumig, modern und sehr sauber. Minibar, Nespresso Maschine und Wasserkocher machen den Aufenthalt sehr angenehm.",5,2016,05,31
237,Gutes Hotel mit wenig Flair und dazu recht teuer,"In Dublin haben wir schon einige Hotels getestet -das The Morrison ist eines der besseren ,vor allem wegen der super Lage direkt am Fluss und ggü. Temple Bar District sowie direkt an der  Henry Street etc. Leider kein Schwimmbad,was die wenigsten Hotels in Dublin auszeichnet.Zimmer sauber und leise ,aber teilweise alles in die Jahre gekommen .Alles in allem hatten wir vergleichsweise ähnliche Hotels,die deutlich billiger waren. Und nur fünf oder 10 Minuten weiter liegen...Wlan war kostenlos (allerdings bin ich bei HH Honors,weiß nicht ob es für alle Gäste kostenlos ist)",4,2016,05,29
237,Perfekter Ausganspunkt für Sightseeing in der City,"Das Hotel liegt direkt am Fluss gegenüber dem Stadtzentrum (Temple Bar). Alle Sehenswürdigkeiten sind leicht zu Fuss erreichbar. Das Personal ist ausserordentlich freundlich. Mein Zimmer war eher klein, und rund um das Bett bleibt nicht mehr viel Platz.
Der Kaffee in der Hotelbar ist hervorragend und kommt mit mehreren Friandises.

Das WLAN ist eine Zumutung; es ist langsam, und zur Registrierung muss man sein Alter, Geschlecht und eine Email-Adresse angeben, ausserdem muss man zustimmen, dass diese Adresse für Werbezwecke missbraucht wird.",4,2016,05,24
237,SERVICIO EXCELENTE,"Es un hotel de diseño, las habitaciones tienen todos los accesorios incluso paraguas y secador de mano , es gentileza del hotel . Y este hotel está cercano a Temple Bar ( zona de ocio ) y de los monumentos a visitar más emblemáticos de Dublín.",5,2016,05,19
237,Gutes zentral gelegenes Hotel,Das Hotel liegt an sehr guter Lage nahe der vielen irischen Pubs. Sowohl Zimmer als auch Infrastruktur entsprechen einem guten Stadthotel. Die Eingangshallen ist sehr hell und der Empfang freundlich. Leider läuft während des Frùhstücks auf einer Grossleinwand die News-Sendungen des TV. Das wäre nicht gerade nötig.,4,2016,05,05
237,Buena ubicación y comodidad,"Se trata de un hotel con una ubicación bastante buena, frente a Temple Bar, la zona con más marcha de la ciudad. Las habitaciones son amplias y la cama muy cómoda. Desayuno muy completo y de calidad. Por sacar algún ""pero"" en el baño, la ducha es fija. La atención de todos los empleados estupenda.",4,2016,04,14
237,problemas de aislamiento,"Un hotel de diseño, habitaciones pequeñas pero muy cómodas, excelente situación en el centro de Dublín pero en una zona bastante tranquila, personal muy atento y uno de los mejores desayunos de hotel que hayamos tenido el placer de disfrutar...
¿Por qué sólo 3 estrellas? Porque en nuestra opinión a un hotel que podría ser perfecto le falta lo más importante. Garantizar una buena calidad de sueño. En nuestra opinión tienen un claro problema de aislamiento por lo que, a pesar de estar en una zona tranquila, en nuestra habitación de la primera planta se oían tanto vehículos como conversaciones como si estuviésemos en plena calle.",3,2016,03,31
237,Tolle Lage,"Das Hotel bietet eine zentrale Lage. Vom Hotel aus ist man schnell in der Altstadt. Das Zimmer ist nicht besonders gross,dennoch sehr schön.
Der Empfang könnte etwas freundlicher ausfallen,ist aber oke. Wir würden das Hotel bei einem nächsten Besuch wieder wählen.",4,2016,03,28
237,Una atención exquisita en pleno centro de Dublín,"Desde que entras en recepción hasta que sales el último día recibes una atención excelente. La habitación con una cama muy cómoda y un baño perfecto. Muy buenos desayunos, con parte de Buffet ya preparado o recién hecho, tú eliges. Y, como guinda del pastel, al lado de todo, ayuntamiento, Temple bar, calles emblemáticas... Una estancia para repetir",5,2016,03,20
237,Tolles Designhotel in bester Lage,"Das Morrison macht seiner 4****+ Klassifizierung alle Ehre. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich, die Zimmer sind super sauber, schick, modern und richtig schön eingerichtet. 

Das Hotel verfügt über einen recht gut ausgestatteten Fitnessraum mit freien Gewichten und anderen Kraftgeräten.

Die Lage ist exzellent, es liegt direkt am Fluss und man ist innerhalb von wenigen Minuten zu Fuß in der Temple Bar Area und anderen wichtigen Punkten. 

Ich kann es definitiv weiter empfehlen.",5,2016,03,19
237,Tre giorni da gran signora,"Sono stata in questo hotel per tre giorni per un meeting di lavoro. Mi sono trovata benissimo. Staff competente e gentilissimo. Pulito. Camere grandi e moderne. Colazione abbondante e ristorante ottimo. Piatti buonissimi. Sale riunioni accoglienti.
Prezzo altino ma il servizio è la qualità è alta. E' in centro a due passi da TempleBar
Tutto al Top...
Il biscottone di cioccolato di benvenuto era meraviglioso...grazie ai ragazzi della Reception!!!
Free wi-fi.",5,2016,03,03
237,hotel inmejorable,"personal de recepción amabilísimo. todo perfecto. nos encantó el hotel, su ubicación, el personal superatento, incluido el personal del servicio de restaurante.limpieza impecable. volveriamos sin lugar a dudas.",5,2016,02,24
237,"Sehr schönes, zentral gelegenes Hotel","Ein sehr schönes, stylisches Hotel. Wir wurden sehr freundlich begrüßt und über alles notwendige aufgeklärt. Das Zimmer war sehr geräumig und gemütlich eingerichtet. Nicht zuletzt auch wegen der angenehmen Farbgebung. Die Farben halten sich in Violett-,Weiß- und Beigetönen. Das Badezimmer war geräumig und verfügte über ein Badewanne. Das Service- sowie das Reinigungspersonal war sehr zuvorkommend. 
Die Lage ist hervorragend! Alles ist zu Fuß gut zu erreichen. So auch der Bustransfer zum Flughafen.",4,2016,02,05
237,sfarzo a caro prezzo,"location perfetta: dato che è sul lato opposto del fiume fronte temple bar e quindi nonostante la vicinanza alla movida, di notte cè una certa tranquillità. l'hotel è caro, molto caro a mio dire ma purtroppo essendo in pieno centro se si vuole una camera con letto king(il ns matrimoniale), stando in pieno centro, con una buona pulizia delle stanze ed i comfort di un 4 stelle.... rassegnatevi, dovrete spendere 200 euro a notte. 
Evitate la colazione: fuori dall'hotel costa meno.",3,2015,11,28
237,Buen hotel,"Es un buen hotel, bien ubicado, cercano al centro histórico, las habitaciones son bastante cómodas y limpias, el personal es muy amable, el desayuno es muy rico y variado, todo funciona como debe funcionar en este hotel, sin duda volvería a hospedarme!!",5,2015,11,28
237,Excelente ubicación con inmejorable trato,"La mejor ubicación para conocer Dublin,  todo está andando muy cerca. Es nuevo y todo esta muy limpio. El personal es muy agradable y simpático, sobre todo en el desayuno, gracias Michelle, nos alegrabas cada mañana.",5,2015,11,14
237,Ottimo business hotel ma non solo,"Accogliente, moderno e molto confortevole. La stanza grande, ben accessoriata, con letto comodo e lenzuola top. Colazione, a parte (12/15 euro) varia e assortita. Posizione centrale e personale molto gentile. What else per un business trip? Ma anche per una minivacanza. Ci tornero'!",5,2015,10,07
237,Eine der besten Adressen in Dublin,"Wirklich ein gutes Hotel für Dublin. Zwar ist keine exorbitante Bar vorhanden, aber wer sucht das schon 5 Minuten von der Temple Bar entfernt? Zimmer sind sauber und schön.Das Frühstück ist wirklich super!",4,2015,09,13
237,sconsigliato,"inizio con il dire che ho pagato per 2 notti 400€,
quindi mi aspetto il massimo che Dublino possa offrirmi,,, errore
vista palazzo osceno,
stanza piccolissima,
buia e con una buona pulizia.
il bagno un vero schifo... solo nei peggiori ostelli ho trovato la tendina per la doccia, oltretutto con lo scarico della vasca otturato e lo sciacquone del gabinetto difettoso, un incubo un odore fortissimo nel corridoio da mal di testa.
la prima colazione abbondante ma non superlativa.
io lo sconsiglio",2,2015,08,25
237,Non vale il prezzo che costa,"Purtroppo le aspettative sono andate deluse. 
Per 350 euro a notte, la junior suite non é assolutamente all'altezza della spesa. 
A questo sommate il fatto che ci hanno messi al piano M, ovvero l'ammezzato, che é quindi tra il piano 0 e l'1, e che allo 0 c'era una festa con musica dal vivo per un matrimonio che non ci ha fatto chiudere occhio fino a tarda notte ...
Abbiamo prenotato cinque mesi in anticipo e quindi al piano ammezzato ci potevano mettere gli ospiti della festa, che di sicuro non sarebbero andati a letto presto, e noi metterci nei piani più alti, lontani dal rumore.
Ciliegina sulla torta, la cena al morrison grill, con l'irish coffee con panna rancida che abbiamo rispedito al mittente: ci hanno chiesto scusa, ma da un bar di questo livello non sono errori che si possono compiere.
Per un hotel di questa categoria sono tutte cose inaccettabili!
Poi la posizione é senza dubbio buona e il personale della reception è stato cordiale, ma questo, secondo la mia personale opinione, non basta.",2,2015,08,09
237,Dublino in 4 giorni!,"L'hotel è in posizione centrale praticamente affacciato sul fiume Liffey. Siamo a pochi passi da Temple Bar e da O'Connel Street, anche se siamo riusciti a girare comodamente a piedi per visitare tutto il centro e i dintorni della città.
L'hotel è della catena Hilton, ha comunque un taglio molto moderno: la reception ha comodi salotti ed è arredata con gusto, noi ci siamo stati in novembre, ed era già arredata con gli addobbi natalizi creando una bellissima atmosfera.
Le camere dispongono di ogni comfort, letto molto comodo, televisori al plasma, luci soffuse, arredamento moderno, frigo bar, connessione Wi-Fi, accappatoi e ciabatte, ottimi anche i prodotti da bagno.
La colazione è decisamente eccezionale, da la possibilità di scegliere anche piatti caldi dal menù, oltre al buffet; ci sono infinite varianti di croissant, pane, marmellate, dolci e piatti salati. Ricchissima!
Bellissimo ambiente da tutti i punti di vista.",4,2015,08,04
237,Muy buen hotel,Hotel en pleno centro de la ciudad que permite recorrer a pie los principales sitios turísticos. A pocos minutos de parada de autobuses directos al aeropuerto. Trato sumamente cordial de los empleados. Habitaciones amplias con camas confortables y buena limpieza. Una buena opción para visitar Dublin.,5,2015,07,29
237,Durchgehend ein sehr gutes Erlebnis,"Am spaeten Nachmittag angereist, sind unsere Koffer leider in Amsterdam liegen geblieben. Schon gleich beim Check-In bekamen wir die Serviceorientierung zu spueren: Empfehlungen wo notwendige Kleidung zu bekommen waren und natuerlich die notwendige Zahnbuerste waren sofort zur Hand. Auch am naechsten Tag setzte sich das Servicerlebnis fort: immer freundlich, z.B.: beim Fruehstueck freundliche Hilfestellung und Erlaeuterungen der Fruehstuecksoptionen, dabei kein Verkaufsdruck sondern Transparenz, bei Tipps fuer die Stadt: was lohnt und was nicht sowie welche Besichtigungen Vorbestellen und welche nicht. Fuer das Personal und die Serviceorientierung gilt: so soll es sein.

Das Zimmer war dann auch angemessen gross und modern eingerichtet, allerdings noch angenehm modern, nicht sinnlos verkuensteltes Design, dass unpraktisch ist. Das Zimmer zum Hof war angenehm ruhig und luftig. Alles sehr sauber und gepflegt. Mein Lieblingsplatz ist die kleine Leseecke geworden, in die man sich prima nach einem langen Tag hineinsetzen kann.

Die Lage ist das auch absolut topp: wenige Minuten ins Shopping Zentrum sowie Templebar. Auch alle anderen touristisch interessanten Destinationen lassen sich problemlos zu Fuss erreichen. Wir sind prima ohne irgendwelche öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel ausgekommen.

Naechstes Mal Dublin, sehr gern wieder hier.",5,2015,07,13
237,Muy buena opción para Dublín,"Un hotel fantástico. Habitaciones de gran confort, camas muy cómodas, buena insonorización. Desayuno muy completo. Situado en zona céntrica que permite un fácil acceso a todos los sitios turísticos. Si bien, quizá un poco subido de precio. Sin duda alguna muy recomendable para alojarse.",4,2015,07,08
237,sofort wieder ,"Wir waren drei Nächte im Hotel. Überaus freundliches Personal, modern eingerichtetes Hotel mit schönen Zimmer. Feine Frühstücksbuffets mit einem Continental und einem Full Irish Breakfast-Teil.
Optimale Lage um die Stadt zu erkunden. Nahe an der Shoppingmeile und im Ausgangviertel.",4,2015,07,05
237,Una Pasqua Bellissima,siamo stati qui con il mio fidanzato e ci hanno accolto con un cookie al cioccolato ancora caldo..la permanenza è stata fantastica e il personale gentilissimo oltre ad essere bellissima la struttura! da provare il ristorante,5,2015,06,16
237,excelente ubicación,"El hotel cumple con lo que yo buscaba. Excelente ubicación (muy cerca de Temple Bar). La relación calidad precio para su rango de estrellas es óptima. Es un hotel confortable, buena disposición de los recepcionistas, etc. No tengo ninguna queja, al contrario, quedé muy contento en todos los aspectos",5,2015,04,10
237,Comodissimo,"Arrivando dall'aereoporto prendendo il bus 747 air link (10 euro andata e ritorno) in 30 minuti arrivate a o'connell Street, raggiungete l'albergo in 10 minuti comodi a piedi, dove venite accolti con al check in con un bel cookie caldo alle noci e cioccolato, e potrete salire in camera alle 15. 
La posizione e' veramente ottima potrete andare a piedi ovunque, temple bar e' di fronte dall'altra parte del fiume, inoltre le camere spaziose con letto matrimoniale big size sono tranquillissime anche quelle con finestra sulla strada. Troverete anche un ristorante (non provato) la colazione essendo piuttosto cara (18 euro a testa al giorno) l'abbiamo fatta nei bar che nella zona troverete in gran quantita' (uno piccolino proprio sulla strada fa dei muffin caldi a diversi gusti e un buon cappuccino).
Albergo quindi da consigliare.",4,2015,04,04
237,Buena ubicación en el medio de la ciudad !,"Muy buen hotel en el centro de la ciudad cerca de todos los puntos turísticos. El desayuno es completo y la atención es buena. He estado en otro hotel Fitz Williams, todavía prefiero el otro pero este es muy recomendable. Las habitaciones son muy cómodas.",4,2015,03,17
237,Perfetto,"Hotel di altissimo livello, perfetto per disponiblità del personale, servizi, pulizia e comfort delle camere, qualità del ristorante e delle colazioni. Anche la posizione è praticamente perfetta, a pochi passi dal cuore della città.",5,2015,01,19
237,Diseño en un hotel diferenet,"Hotel caro pero lo vale por las instalaciones, el diseño, el servicio y la ubicación
Al lado del centro de Dublin
La decoración es excepcional
Fue un viaje especial y por eso nos alojamos en este hotel, aunque en otros viajes buscamos hoteles con un perfil ""menos caro"" ;)",5,2015,01,07
237,Ottimo per la posizione e altre comodità,"Ho trascorso due notte in questo hotel con la colazione inclusa. Si trova vicino alla fermata di O'Connel street per usufruire del servizio airlink che collega il centro città (e non solo) all'aeroporto e viceversa.
Le camere sono confortevoli e il personale cordiale. Lo standard è in linea con gli altri hotel 4 stelle europei. La colazione è abbastanza varia potendo anche ordinare alcune pietanze dal menù! 
Il terzo giorno della mia permanenza non risultava inclusa la colazione per la mia camera,malgrado fosse compresa in modo esplicito dalla mia prenotazione effettuata su internet (consiglio di mantenere la e-mail della prenotazione quantomeno sullo smartphone). Il disguido è stato comunque risolto grazie alla presenza di una ragazza Italiana che lavora nell'hotel.
Ci ritornerei.",4,2014,12,03
237,En el corazón de la ciudad,"Hotel muy céntrico, justo al lado del río que divide Dublín. Permite acceder a pie a prácticamente todas las visitas con un esfuerzo muy pequeño. A dos minutos tiene toda la zona de Temple Bar por lo que comer o ir de copas es también comodísimo.

Es muy moderno, con una decoración elegante y alegre y habitaciones acogedoras.

El servicio es muy amable aunque exige un dominio al menos medio del inglés salvo que haya suerte con una recepcionista concreta.

Los desayunos son estupendos y permiten pedir platos hechos al momento que hacen de muy buena gana, con un precio menor al equivalente en España.

El precio es razonable para lo recibido, pues no hay nada que no sea de muy buen nivel.

Muy recomendable si uno se lo puede permitir.",4,2014,11,23
237,Völlig überbewertet,"Ich habe eine Nacht im Morrison verbracht und wurde in eine Junior Suite verfrachtet. Das Zimmer hatte ein King Bett und ein Sofa, bei anderen Hotels ist so ein Zimmer Standard. Das Bad war schrecklich, mit einem kleinen Fenster. Im Fahrstuhl sah ich dass im 4 Stock ein Hilton Honors Stock ist und ich fragte mich warum man mich als Gold Member in das 2. Og mit Ghetto Blick anstatt mit River View setzte. Zudem habe ich bei meinen Hilton Honors Account Informationen als Zimmerwunsch "" high floor "" angegeben. Das Frühstück war gut und gemütlich, der einzige Lichtblick am Morrison. Ich habe im Januar im Conrad übernachtet was um Klassen besser ist. Auch die Gegend fand ich nicht vertrauenswürdig gerade wenn man spät heimkommt. Alles in allem würde ich nicht wieder kommen und gehe das nächste mal wieder ins Conrad.",3,2014,11,15
237,Hotel molto curato e ben posizionato,"L'hotel è collocato a due passi dal cuore pulsante di Dublino.La stanza è ben isolata e silenziosa. Molto curata nei dettagli e pulita. Stile un tantino impersonale rispetto ai caldi ed accoglienti hotel della campagna irlandese, ma di sicuro ottimo nel suo genere. Stanza molto attrezzata, dagli accappatoi extra all'asse da stiro.
Peccato per la vista sul ristorante, anziché sul fiume.
Molto bello anche il bagno, nonostante non ami le tendine e le vasche e preferisca le docce a vetri, la tendina è molto pratica, con un doppio strato per evitare che invada i vostri spazi durante la doccia. Ottimi anche i prodotti. 
Un po' scomodo il tardo check in. Non prima delle 15 nel nostro caso. 
Carina l'accoglienza, con biscotti e tanta cortesia.",4,2014,11,07
237,Rasenta la perfezione,"È un hotel di livello, dove nulla e trascurato. Le camere sono perfette, non manca niente, c'è addirittura il ferro da stiro comprensivo di asse. È chiaramente un hotel ideale per un viaggio di lavoro, ma se si vuole andare a Dublino in un hotel che ti offre il massimo questo èil posto ideale.
La connessione internet è perfetta e anche la colazione è di livello. Diciamo che per una città come Dublino che di fatto è abbastanza spartana, è forse  un hotel di qualità eccessiva, ma nella vita, a volte, qualche lusso ce lo si può anche.  Se dovessi tornare a Dublino, ci tornerò sicuramente.",4,2014,10,08
237,ottimo,"L'hotel è in posizione centrale praticamente affacciato sul fiume Liffey  e ottimo per visitare a piedi la città. Siamo infatti a pochi passi da Temple Bar (una zona particolarmente vivace la sera che merita una visita da sola perché esprime il vero spirito della città) da O'Connel Street (la via principale di Dublino) e dall'O'Connell Bridge.
L'hotel è della catena Hilton, seppur griffato con il brand ""di primo accesso"" Double Tree.
Ha comunque un taglio molto moderno ed è in definitiva molto superiore alle 4 stelle della categoria ufficiale.
La grande reception ha comodi salotti ed è arredata con gusto.
Le camere dispongono di ogni comfort con grandi televisori al plasma, arredamento moderno, frigo bar, ottima connessione internet accappatoi e ciabatte.
I bagni sono spaziosi e moderni seppur con vasca e doccia insieme.
La colazione è eccellente ed offre -oltre al buffet- la possibilità di scelta alla carta.
Consigliatissimo.",4,2014,09,21
237,"Räumlichkeiten Mittelmäßig, Küche Top","Das Hotel hat eine Super Lage - besser geht es nicht, die Räumlichkeiten sind meiner Meinung nach mittelmäßig, über die Zimmerausstattung (weiss mit rosa Beleuchtung) lässt sich streiten.
Das Frühstück war Top, das Poached Egg, das beste, das wir in Irland während unserer einwöchigen Rundreise bekommen haben.
Der Empfang ist freundlich und zum Abschied gab es noch zwei Wasserflaschen als Verpflegung mit auf den Weg.",4,2014,09,10
237,Posizione perfetta e buona struttura,"Abbiamo soggiornato 3 notti in questo buon hotel centralissimo a Dublino a 200m circa dal Temple Bar e da diversi luoghi di interesse, raggiungibili quasi tutti a piedi!
Abbiamo prenotato e pagato una stanza superior con vista sul fiume. Abbiamo chiesto con largo anticipo un piano alto ed invece ci hanno riservato il primo piano; per dei clienti fissi della catena Hilton, speravamo di essere accontentati come accaduto pochi giorni prima a Londra.
Le stanze sono molto belle e moderne. Il bagno ha la sola vasca senza doccia separata.
Colazione sostanziosa anche se ripetitiva. Ottimi i biscottino gratis all'arrivo!
Diciamo che abbiamo cercato il meglio ma forse il prezzo è esagerato per quello che abbiamo trovato.
Un grazie sincero a Gina (spero si scriva così) per averci aiutato con il check in del volo per Glasgow con il quale avevamo avuto dei problemini e per la gentilezza con la quale ci ha sempre accolto! A parte lei, personale piuttosto freddo.",4,2014,09,08
237,Maravilloso,"Nos ha gustado todo, hemos disfrutado a fondo del hotel mi hija y yo. Es una maravilla. Todo son ventajas: enclavado en el centro-centro de Dublín, a un paso de todo lo visitable, una decoración exquisita tanto en sus zonas comunes como en las habitaciones; éstas son amplias y fantásticas, equipadas con todo lo necesario y más: colchones comodísimos, sábanas y edredón suaves (quizás un poco durillas las almohadas, pero supongo que, aunque yo no lo hice, se podrán pedir de otro tipo), minibar, caja fuerte, infusiones, cafés, chocolates y agua de cortesía (te los preparas en un santiamén), plancha y tabla de planchar, muchísima luz (directa, indirecta, focos, de cama, ...); todo da una sensación de buen gusto y de tranquilidad que te hace sentir bien. El cuarto de baño también es grande, con una ducha muy cómoda, todo tipo de adminísculos ( y los que se echan en falta, se pueden pedir), y también mucha luz (algo que yo siempre agradezco), albornoz, zapatillas, toallas grandes, todo de lo que seca bien. 
Las zonas comunes, igual de bonitas, con salón de estar grande al lado de recepción, restaurante, cafetería, con servicio impecable, siempre pendientes de ti. El desayuno una maravilla, de todo, frío, caliente, con una carta de posibilidades que amplía lo que ya te ofrecen en el bufé que está preparado;como pega una pequeñez, hay que olvidarse de los zumos naturales (aunque entre nosotros son algo habitual en hoteles de esta categoría, aquí parece que no). 
Eficaces y encantadoras las personas que atienden en recepción y en restauración (pendientes en todo momento de que te sientas cómodo y a gusto). Siempre hay alguien que habla o chapurrea español. 
Conclusión: el título de este comentario, ""maravilloso"". Si tus posibilidades económicas te lo permiten (es un hotel caro, pero hay que tener en cuenta que Dublín es cara, y que lo que ofrece el hotel lo merece),te lo recomiendo al cien por cien para visitar la ciudad y sentirte fantásticamente.",5,2014,08,30
237,Tolles Hotel im Zentrum mit perfektem Frühstück,"Wir waren ein Wochenende in Dublin und haben uns für The Morrison entschieden denn das Hotel liegt im Zentrum, direkt gegenüber dem Temple Bar Viertel. Unser Zimmer war ganz oben mit Blick auf den Fluss Liffey. Wir haben am Empfang zwei warme Cookies bekommen die sehr lecker waren. Das Zimmer ist schön und sauber. 
Das Frühstück, das wir ursprünglich nicht gebucht hatten, war einfach das Beste das wir je in ein Hotel gegessen haben!!! Der Speisesaal ist klein aber das Angebot ist gut und es gibt eine extra Frühstück-Karte mit kostenlosen Gerichte: wir haben uns für das French Toast entschieden. Es war so lecker, wir sind immer noch davon begeistert.
Ich empfehle auf jeden Fall das Hotel weiter.",5,2014,08,30
237,Ubicación perfecta y decoración muy moderna,"Está cerquita del centro, para ir caminando., al lado del río además. La decoración muy moderna y con gusto tanto en el hall como en las habitaciones y salones. Los desayunos completos y el bar con ambiente para tomarte una Guinness mientras esperas o cenar en la barra una deliciosa hamburguesa.
Me encantó y si vuelvo a Dublín no me importaría repetir.",4,2014,08,25
237,Nel cuore tranquillo di Dublino,"L'hotel, rinnovato nel 2013, gode di un'ottima posizione, in una zona tranquilla sul LIffey, l'altra sponda rispetto a Temple Bar. L'interno è elegante e di stile internazionale. La camera era grande e tranquilla. Anche qui qualche incertezza nei particolari: un frigorifero che non funzionava, un bagno con la tendina di plastica sulla vasca e uno sciacquone a pulsante a muro vetusto (e durissimo): ma i bagni non sono il punto forte delle isole britanniche.
Comunque consigliato per posizione e comodità.",4,2014,08,19
237,"Tolle Lage, sehr schöne Suite","Wir haben die Suite mit Verbindungstür zu einem 2. Zimmer sehr genossen während unserem 4-tätigen Aufenthalt. Die Complimentary Nespresso-Maschine haben wir sehr geschätzt! Man hört zwar den Strassenverkehr und teilweise auch das Nachtleben vom Temple Bar District - aber wen kümmert es, wenn man mit dem Blick auf den Liffey entschädigt wird. Die Zimmer sind modern und geschmackvoll eingerichtet und waren sehr sauber.",5,2014,08,17
237,Una gran hotel,"Un hotel maravillosamente situado, tienes todo Dublín a la mano. El personal es excelente y simpático. Muy limpio. Muy buen servicio de desayuno y de bar-restaurante.
Lo único que falta es algún canal de TV en español.",5,2014,08,15
237,sehr schönes Hotel in Dublin,"Sehr schönes Stadt Hotel in Dublin. Mitten im Zentrum und in der Nähe von Temple Bar. Einkaufsmöglichkeiten ebenfalls gleich in der Nähe.

Habitaciones amplias y muy silenciosas.
Excelente atención además.",5,2014,07,21
237,Sehr schönes Stadthotel,"Lage: Ausgezeichnet; Frühstück: Ausgezeichnet; Freundlichkeit: Ausgezeichnet; Zimmer: sehr schön aber klein; Badezimmer: schön gemacht aber warum hat man die alten Wannen drin gelassen ?? Alles in allem ein schöner sehr zentraler Platz. Wir kommen wieder, herzlichen Dank",4,2014,07,10
237,Hervorragendes Stadthotel,"Der Aufenthalt im Hotel Morrison in Dublin ist in jeder Hinsicht ein gelungener - schnelles Einchecken, guter Service, schöne Zimmer, gute Lage, feines Frühstück (nur das Müesli fehlte...). Ein rundum gelungener Stop over.",5,2014,07,09
237,veramente bello,"Ho pernottato 2 sole notti in questo centralissimo hotel. Molto moderno, stanze pulite con ottimo wi-fi, ben arredate, ottimi i bar. personale molto gentile. Colazione di ottima qualità.
Da consigliare.",5,2014,06,30
237,Lavoro,"Splendido hotel, vicino temple bar.ottimala cucina e la disponibilità degli operatori dell'albergo .servizi eccellenti e la pulizia dell'albergo ad alti livelli di comfort.da vivere pienamente !silenzioso e tranquillo.prima colazione abbondante, la cena e il post dinner di livello",5,2014,06,28
237,Sehr gut und zentral gelegen,"Ein typisches Hilton in exzellenter Lage, nur wenige Meter vom Stadtkern entfernt. Zimmer neu renoviert, obwohl man über so manche Farbgebung unterschiedlicher Meinung sein kann (lila, pink, u.Ä.)
Personal sehr freundlich und professionell.
Perfekt für einen Wochenende-Trip.",4,2014,05,31
237,Eccezionale!,"L'hotel si trova nella zona dublinese di Smithfield, opposta a Temple Bar: zona ricca di centri commerciali,negozi e ristoranti e vicinissima alla vivacissima O' Connell Street.
Zona comunque tranquilla,lontana dalla rumorosa e sempre affollatissima Temple Bar.
Il personale è molto gentile e disponibile, come la maggior parte degli irlandesi del resto!Al vostro arrivo sarete accolti con due biscottoni al cioccolato caldi caldi che si sciolgono in bocca!
Stanze spaziose, pulite, dotate di ogni comfort, persino di una bella zona fitness per chi ama fare sport anche in vacanza.
Colazione ai massimi livelli, ricca e di qualità, sia per chi ama la più sostanziosa Irish breakfast,sia per chi predilige solo cose dolci come cappuccino,caffè, succo, pane marmellata e croissant.
Il ristorante al piano di sotto è molto frequentato e la qualità del cibo è molto buona, in grado di soddisfare i più diversi palati.
Davvero un hotel eccezionale, da non lasciarsi sfuggire.",5,2014,05,05
237,Impeccabile,"Sono tutt'ora in questo hotel....ma ho deciso di scrivere subito questa recensione perché sono rimasto estremamente soddisfatto.
La posizione è stupenda, il costo accessibile soprattutto se si approfitta di una delle tante offerte.
Le camere sono spaziose ed arredate in maniera moderna piacevole e funzionale.
La prima colazione è ricca e di discreta qualità.
La pulizia regna sovrana ed il personale è molto gentile e disponibile.....poi al vostro arrivo vi accoglieranno con uno stupendo hot cookie!!!!!
Non potevo scegliere meglio!",5,2014,04,18
237,Perfektes Stadthotel für ein Kurztrip,"Das Hotel ist genau das richtigen für einen kurzen Städtetrip! Sehr zentral, unkompliziert, moderne und saubere Zimmer - so wie man es von einem Stadthotel erwarten kann. Der Service ist ok.
Die Hotelbar ist für auswärtige Gäste bis Mitternacht zugänglich, jedoch für Hotelgäste open end! Wenn alle Pubs schliessen kann man auf ein Nightcap Drink bei der Bar vorbei.",4,2014,04,05
237,Uns hat es hier gut gefallen,"Das Morrison liegt sehr zentral in Dublin.
Man muss allerdings aufpassen, wenn man mit dem Auto ankommt, denn der Eingang liegt nicht am Lower Ormond Quay, sondern in einer Seitenstrasse und ist leicht zu uebersehen.

Unsere Zimmer machten einen frischen, stylishen Eindruck, alles ist sehr funktional, vielleicht ein wenig unterkuehlt, aber man fuehlt sich dennoch schnell wohl.

Klar, daß es bei ""Hiltons"" in Puncto Sauberkeit und Service nichts zu meckern gibt, auch das Fruehstueck ist eine Wucht, der Preis vertretbar.  Was will man mehr?",4,2014,03,09
237,Hotel veramente di alto livello,"Hotel posizionato a fianco della zona di Temple Bar, il centro della vita notturna di Dublino.
Camere ampie, ben curate e silenziose. Il pezzo forte secondo me è la colazione. Tipica all'inglese con un'ampia scelta di piatti caldi, affettati, formaggi e mostarde.
Alla prossima occasione sara sicuramente una mia prima scelta. ",4,2014,02,07
237,Suite King con Vista Fiume,"Complessivamente una bella struttura.

L'arredamento della Suite era moderno ma sobrio. Il letto comodo e la stanza silenziosa.

La vista sul fiume merita quei pochi euro in piu'.

La colazione e' mista, ma complessivamente buona.

La posizione e' ottima per chi vuole stare vicino alla zona ""turistica"" o ai tipici Pub Irlandesi.

Pulizia eccellente, staff alla reception molto gentile e disponibile.

Consigliato!",4,2014,01,20
237,Una certezza,"Soggiorno in questo hotel 2 settimane l'anno per motivo di lavoro ed è sempre una soddisfazione. Appena rinnovato è una certezza
Per quanto riguarda pulizia, comfort, gentilezza dello staff. Posizione ottima e colazione abbondante e molto varia. Ristorante nella media",5,2013,12,16
237,Hotel trendy. Ubicación perfecta,"Ubicación fantástica, junto al río y frente al Temple Bar. Diseño muy inspirado, tanto en los espacios comunes como en las habitaciones. 
Trato súper amable
El desayuno merece la pena, en una sala preciosa y con variedad y productos frescos.
El precio es elevado, pero acorde con el estilo del hotel ",5,2013,12,08
237,Hotel accogliente e confortevole,"L' hotel e' molto moderno e molto confortevole .La posizione e' centrale ( vicino al Temple)sia per le visite al centro storico che per lo shopping . Le stanze sono spaziose , ben arredate e pulite . Il ristorante ha deluso le nostre aspettative per il prezzo e pre la qualita' del cibo .Consiglio pero ' la colazione continentale che costa 12 euro ma vi offre ampia scelta e buona qualita'.",5,2013,11,13
237,Top Lage,"Die Lage ist hervorragend, zu Fuss können viele Sehenswürdigkeiten erreicht werden. Das gesamte Hotel in modernem Design ist sehr sauber gehalten. Als wir an der Rezeption wegen eines Lärmproblems (festl. Anlass) reklamiert haben, wurde auf kompetente Art und Weise auf unser Problem eingegangen und eine sehr gute Lösung gefunden. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Erschrecken sie nicht über den Maxibildschirm (ohne Ton) im Frühstücksraum, ich habe es als Kunstobjekt angeschaut. Gesundes, vielseitiges Frühstücksangebot.  Die Anzahl Handtücher im Bad ist für ein 4 Stern Haus etwas gering, aber das ist ein Detail. Das fehlen der WC Bürste kann zu unangenehmen Situationen führen. Gerne komme ich wieder. ",4,2013,09,21
237,Ottimo Hotel,"Ottima posizione per visitare la città sia a piedi che con ogni mezzo pubblico. La struttura dell'Hotel è molto ben curata e la camera era ampia, molto pulita e ben arredata. Il personale sempre disponibile e molto cortese. Consigliato vivamente!",5,2013,09,04
237,Stile da vendere!,"Iniziamo con il dire che l'unica nota dolente che si potrebbe riscontrare in questa struttura, andando a spezzare il capello in quattro, è il prezzo.
E' un po' sopra agli standard ai quali eravamo abituati, ma d'altra parte, ci è stato restitutito tutto in termini di servizi e di qualità in generale.

L'hotel è in posizione centralissima, proprio sopra a Temple Bar.
Si arriva comodamente anche con il bus di linea di Dublino: scendendo in O' Connel Street (ottava fermata, se ben ricordo), basta arrivare al canale e poi girare a destra.
Dopo qualche isolato si incontra il ristorante dell'hotel che fa angolo (ha la tendine viola scuro: non potete sbagliarvi!).
L'hotel, in realtà, è poco più avanti, sulla strada perpendicolare, e di fatti noi ci abbiamo messo un attimo a capire dove dovessimo andare.

Per alloggiare dovete versare una caparra: se avete una carta di credito dovete dare loro quella, altrimenti se volete andare di cash, vi basta dare 150€ che vi verranno restituiti del tutto praticamente sulla parola, nel senso che vi chiederanno se avete preso qualcosa dal mini bar, ma non controlleranno mai se avete dichiarato il vero oppure no.

La lobby è bellissima, si sale con l'ascensore usando la chiave della stanza (solo per salire).
La chiave è una card elettronica che si appoggia al lettore per entrare e si lascia in uno slot per tenere le luci accese all'interno.

Dentro troverete: gel doccia, shampoo e latte corpo, tanti asciugamani, un accappatoio, un ferro da stiro, un phon non da parete molto potente, un cuscino di riserva, set per farsi caffé, thé o cioccolata (gratis) e persino un ombrello!
La camera che avevamo noi era una King.
Bellissima e all'ultimo piano con una finestra unica davvero molto suggestiva.

Bellissimo anche il televisore e la postazione per il portatile.
Il Wi Fi non è pubblico, ma dedicato, stanza per stanza con password personale e gratuito.
La banda offerta non era poca visto che ci ho chiamato senza problemi con Skype tramite il mio Smartphone.

Le stanze sono quasi del tutto insonorizzate, il materasso un po' durino, ma gradevole, i cuscini di due tipi e potete scegliere quello che vi aggrada di più.

Pulito, bello e consigliato... solo non prendete nulla dal mini bar perché è caro da far paura (4€ una bottiglietta d'acqua!).",5,2013,08,19
237,"Molto accogliente. Posizione centrale, ma tranquilla","Tutto molto gradevole. Personale gentilissimo. Ambiente di design, sobrio e accogliente. Posizione centrale, ma fuori dai percorsi turistici.  Se mi capiterà di tornare a Dublino, prenoterò sicuramente una stanza qui.  Parcheggio vicinissimo, ma (unica pecca) a pagamento.",4,2013,08,10
237,Ottimo hotel in centro,"Abbiamo soggiornato 3 notti in questo hotel,al centro di Dublino.
L'hotel è in zona Temple bar,ma fuori dalla mischia,infattimsi arriva dalla parte del Temple,attraversando un ponticello.
L'albergo è molto accogliente,tutto molto moderno e personale disponibile.
Unica pecca,è un pò freddo, e spesso ci sono matrimoni o convention,per cui c'è molta
confusione,in ogni caso nel complesso è buono",4,2013,08,08
237,Vacanza da sogno,"Siamo arrivati al Morrison hotel dopo aver trascorso due giornate stancanti alle isole Aran. L'inizio della vacanza dublinese e' stato turbolento (si è verificato un disguido circa la prenotazione della nostra stanza); cionostante abbiamo trascorso tre giorni fantastici poiché siamo  stati accolti dallo staff del Morrison con una gentilezza, una disponibilità fuori dalla norma a partire dal fatto che ci hanno assegnato una stanza di livello molto superiore a quella che avevamo prenotato. L'hotel e' bellissimo, moderno, pulito, dotato di tutti i comfort, con ottima colazione e posizione perfetta. Rivolgiamo un ringraziamento particolare alla receptionist Kerry per la professionalità, il sorriso, per la cura che rivolge al suo lavoro.",5,2013,08,04
237,"OK, aber nicht perfekt","Der erste Eindruck: Sehr stylish. Komme spät abends an, recht freundlicher Empfang, der sich meine Angaben zur Rechnung (auf die Firma ausstellen, Zahlung aber normal über Karte) anhört und aufnimmt und mir einen Keks in die Hand drückt - nette Idee (und ja, er ist lecker). Mein Zimmer ist im Mezzanine, der Stylo-Eindruck schmiert spätestens ab, als ich aus dem Mini-Fahrstuhl in einen ebensolchen Flur komme: Das zwischen Kopf und Decke gerade noch ein Blatt Papier paßt, ist das eine, der modrige Geruch jedoch echt störend. Der Gammel-Geruch läßt zum Glück im Zimmer nach. Das ist dann wieder stylish und recht groß. Die Brandflecken deuten auf ein baldiges Ende des Lebenszyklus des Teppichs hin, aber geschenkt. Ärgerlich sind die Details - es ist ja schön, daß zwei weiße Kaffeebecher prominent im Raum stehen und es gibt auch einen Wasserkocher - aber in meinem Fall weder Tee noch Kaffee... Hat sich bis zum Ende meines Aufenthaltes auch nicht geändert. Die complimentary zwei Flaschen Wasser nahm ich dankbar am ersten Abend zu mir - wurden nicht aufgefüllt, dafür standen die leeren Flaschen am nächsten Tag immer noch da. Man ist versucht zu sagen - ich brauche keinen Kaffee im Zimmer und das Leitugswasser ist trinkbar - aber wenn, dann macht es richtig...
Die Lage hingegen ist wirklich perfekt - der Flughafenbus hält 10 Min entfernt (zu Fuß) , die Docklands sind mit der LUAS hinterm Haus schnell zu erreichen und Temple Bar / Innenstadt ist direkt auf der anderen Seite des Flusses. 
Zum Frühstück kann ich nichts sagen, da ich unterwegs gegessen habe.
Zum Checkout war die Rechnung nicht auf die Firma ausgestellt, und es bedurfte etlicher Korrekturen und 20 Minuten bis ich den Firmennamen nebst Anschrift auf der Rechnung hatte. Würde ich wiederkommen? Vielleicht.",3,2013,08,03
237,Perfektes Hotel,"Das Hotel war ausgezeichnet. Das Personal sehr freundlich. Die Zimmer sind sehr modern eingerichtet und grosszügig. Nebst dem Frühstücksbuffet, kann auch a la carte bestellt werden was im Preis inklusive ist. Eine tolle Auswahl an verschiedenen frischen Broten, runden das tolle Angebot ab. Die Lage könnte nicht besser sein. Ich kann das Hotel nur empfehlen.",5,2013,07,15
237,Beim nächsten Mal wieder!,"Für einen Kurztrip habe ich mich für das Morrison entschieden und wurde nicht enttäuscht. Das Hotel ist sehr günstig gelegen und bietet einen optimalen Ausgangspunkt für eine Städtetour. Alle Sehenswürdigkeiten sind gut zu Fuß erreichbar. Das Jerviscenter, Dublins größtes Shoppingcenter, ist 3 Minuten die Straße hoch. Dort findet sich im Untergeschoss auch ein Tesco Supermarkt, in dem man sich mit allem eindecken kann. Für die Strecke vom und zurück zum Flughafen empfehle ich den Flughafenbus von aircoach (tickets unter aircoach.ie). Die Fahrt bis zur Haltestelle ""O´ Connell Street"" hat 20 Minuten gedauert. Von dort aus sind es noch einmal 10-15 Minuten zu Fuß.

Das Personal war sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Zur Begrüßung gab es einen warmen Schokocookie und die Gepäckaufbewahrung am Abreisetag war kein Problem. Mein - sehr ruhiges - Zimmer (Zimmer 223 zur Seitenstraße) war mit allem ausgestattet, was man so braucht. Sehr praktisch war der Wasserkocher. Für ""Kleidernotfälle"" gab es sogar ein Bügelbrett und ein Bügeleisen im Schrank. Die Klimaanlage war etwas laut. Auch die Kissen haben mir nicht so gefallen. Sie waren für meinen Geschmack zu hart. Dennoch habe ich gut geschlafen und deshalb gibt es insgesamt die volle Punktzahl!",5,2013,07,14
237,"comodissimo ,moderno e pulito","Ho soggiornato in questo hotel per 4 notti,  hotel moderno, molto pulito  ottimo rispetto allo standard di Dublino, centrale  pochi minuti a piedi da Templebar per  cui si hanno tutti i locali e ristoranti vicinissimi ma non si è nel mezzo della confusione. La mia camera era con vista molto bella sul fiume,tranquilla, e dotata di tutti i confort come appare sul sito. Non posso dare un giudizio sulla prima colazione perchè non l'ho mai fatta in hotel.
  Ad un isolato di distanza vi è  anche un centro commerciale dove fare acquisti. Collegato all'hotel vi è anche un ristorante, niente di speciale,ma va bene se si si è stanchi e non si ha voglia di uscire. Prezzo molto ragionevole ma  ho prenotato 2 mesi in anticipo con booking.com",4,2013,07,09
237,Posizione perfetta!,"Appena rientrata da un soggiorno di tre 3 notti al Morrison della catena HIlton e posso affermare che la posizione sulla riva del fiume e alle spalle di Temple bar è davvero ideale per rimanere al centro in tranquillità.Lalbergo è ristruttutaro da poco, moderno e molto curato , soprattutto con molti fiori nella ampia hall.
La stanza non era enorme ,ma aveva un letto matrimoniale grande ( materasso comodissimo!) e una tv con schermo grande( richiedete una camera con vista sul fiume, altre stanze affacciano proprio di fronte ad altre finestre ) *.L'unico canale in lingua italiana era Euronew.Il wi-fi nella mia stanza era assente.Il.bagno era ampio,con vasca e completo di kit doccia ma carente di superfici di appoggio.Inoltre sul tavolino 2 bottigliette di acqua  insieme ad un biscotto caldo danno il benvenuto.Non ho usufruito nè della colazione nè del ristorane.Senza dubbio lo consiglio.",4,2013,06,24
237,Hotel indimenticabile,"un albergo uguale ad un sogno. Posizione molto centrale tuttavia lontana dalla movida notturna che caratterizza la zona dei pub di Dublino. Affaccio sul fiume e stanze molto ben arredate con dei letti che dire comodi risulterebbe poca cosa, piumini e cuscini favolosi. Per un disguido sulla prenotazione il personale dell'albergo senza aver chiesto noi nulla ci ha attribuito una stanza di categoria superiore e sono queste le piccole cose che fanno l'eccellenza di un hotel. Difficile non tornarci in un prossimo soggiorno dublinese. Consigliato vivamente per un'esperienza favolosa",5,2013,06,17
237,Super,"Super Hotel, perfektes Service, sehr sauber, nette Bar. Es gibt keine Beanstandungen, ausser, dass die Fenster besser schallgeschützt sein könnten, dann wär es das perfekte Hotel. Alles andere hat gepasst, vom Empfang über das Service bis zum Cookie zum Abschied! Gerne wieder!",5,2013,06,06
237,Super Lage - OK Service,"Ich war auf Geschäftsreise im Morrison. Die Lage ist perfekt, mitten in Dublin, ich denke besser kann man es nicht erwischen. 
Bei Einchecken mussten wir etwas warten, da die Rezeption unterbesetzt war. 
Es gab nach dem Einchecken einen (DER BESTEN) Cookies (die ich je gegessen habe) als Willkommenspresent den ich mir auf dem Zimmer habe schmecken lassen.
Im Zimmer jedoch musste ich als erstes auf meiner weissen Beddecke lange schwarze Haare entfernen, vermutlich vom Zimmermädchen oder so...... das dürfte eigentlich nicht passieren in einem sonst sehr schönen Hotel.
Leider gab es auch keinen Bademantel oder Schuhe im Zimmer, was ich nach dem Duschen normalerweise sehr gerne nutze.
Die Fernsehkanäle waren prima, alles was das Herz begehrt!
Insgesamt würde ich schon wieder dort übernachten, und die kleinen Macken kann man beheben.",3,2013,05,07
237,Ottimo hotel,"Un ottimo hotel. Cortese il personale, pulitissimo e nuovo: stanze ampie, ben riscaldate, con tutte le comodità.  Colazione da urlo, ricchissima di salato e dolce. La posizione è buona: centrale e vicino al fiume e al temple bar . Sicuro non conveniente e senza spa,",4,2013,04,05
237,Location spettacolare,"Ho soggiornato per 2 notti presso questa meraviglia.
Hotel davvero bello e pulito,struttura posizionata in zona centralissima.
Personale cortese e attento ai minimi dettagli.
Colazione un po povera.
Bar e ristorante ottimo
Da ritornarci assolutamente!",5,2013,03,13
