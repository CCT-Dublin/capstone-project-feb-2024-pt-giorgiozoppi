210,A beautiful Hotel with stunning rooms.,"We stayed at The Leinster Hotel for 2nights in September and found the hotel absolutely stunning. Our room was gorgeous and had everything we could have needed and more. There is a minibar to purchase items from and also chocolate, popcorn and various other items. The bathroom was amazing with good quality toiletries and a Japanese toilet which had a heated seat and a remote control to offer you a wash and dry! The room also had slippers and bathrobes and a Dyson hairdryer. Our bed was enormous and very comfortable. 
We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to but there are plenty of taxis to be found also. The staff were all very friendly and helpful too.
we had breakfast in the beautiful roof top restaurant and the only negative point was that they didn't have any decaffeinated tea. We visited the ground floor bar on the first night and although it is a lovey setting sadly cant recommend the cocktails. For me personally, having a cocktail is a treat and I enjoy the process of watching it being made but mine was bought to me ready made in a bottle and just poured into the (very small) glass in front of me with no ice or fruit garnish. Although it tasted nice it was very overpriced for the lack of effort involved.",5,2024,10,03
210,Fantastic stay at The Leinster!,"We had a wonderful four days stay celebrating our anniversary at this new boutique Hotel. At The Leinster everything was fantastic. The location, was really close to the Museums, parks, Pubs, and good restaurants. We walked to everywhere. The elegant decoration and the amenities of the beautiful room, made our stay and our visit to Dublin lovely.
An special thanks to Maria, Mara, Anna and Marcos than made our trip really memorable. Thank you very much. We will be back soon!",5,2024,09,07
210,High scores all around!,"We were blown away! The interiors were gorgeous, the staff so lovely and accommodating, sheets and linens soft and cozy! Honestly we made our reservations somewhat under duress and at the last minute because our other accommodations in Dublin fell through. The hotel staff upgraded our daughter to a larger room which was so kind!  I agree with a previous reviewer about the lack of closets and storage. We were in Dublin at the beginning of a 2 week trip through Ireland and London so we felt the lack of closets a bit acutely. 

We loved the dining options and ate and drank at both the Collins bar and the Jean Georges restaurant atop the hotel, food and drinks were amazing!  The location was just right for us, walking distance to everything but quiet and safe. 

We will definitely be back at the Leinster the next time we visit Dublin!",5,2024,08,31
210,Ok experience but not much more than that,"We visited for a few drinks in the downstairs bar. Reception staff were very welcoming .. bar decor  is cool but music was way too loud and not to our taste .. so if it was less loud it may have been ok. Server was ok.. no beer mats, Guinness mediocre. We live close enough to be willing to go back and give it another try .. maybe!",3,2024,08,23
210,Stunning hotel - would definitely recommend!,"This hotel was perfect for our 3 day trip to Dublin. Staff were very friendly and accommodating and the breakfast was delicious, and reasonably priced. 
Location - It‚Äôs around a 25 minute walk from the centre, really straight forward walk too. 
Room - The decor is stunning, bathroom is just beautiful! Comes with shampoo/conditioner/shower gel. The room then has tea facilities and a coffee machine. 
I felt it did lack one or two very small things that would have made more sense/the stay more comfortable - this would not put me off returning. 
To note this would be the lack of space in the room for luggage, if you had a suitcase you would struggle. 
The room also has a very efficient air conditioning unit. 
Food - Breakfast is not included in the stay however we decided to eat at the hotel twice. The food was delicious, large in portion size and reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend this.  
Facilities - Although not used by us there‚Äôs a gym which has been kitted out to a high spec. There‚Äôs also a second bar situated on the ground floor, again not used but this looked very enticing. 
Overall this is a wonderful hotel where it‚Äôs clear a lot of thought, love and energy has been put into its layout and stunning decor. 
I would recommend staying here to anyone!",4,2024,08,20

210,Wow!,Booked at the last minute this hotel break was nothing short of fantastic. i nearly giddy with all there was to look at.the interiors were so divine. we fancied a night away but not really city centre with all that brings and this location is so amazing.quiet and central! we chose to eat in and the rooftop restaurant was fab.overlooking georgian dublin it felt really special.will definitely be my go to hotel in Dublin now.,5,2024,08,08
210,Cozy restaurant,"Great location. Great starters. We had meat and fish. The lamb was delicious . The warm chocolate with ice cream dessert was the best . The black tea was real, strong plus lemon, you can soften the strength with milk - it's wonderful! Irish coffee is served very appetizingly. Good service. Great place to meet friends.",5,2024,07,25
210,Very pleasant stay,"Stayed here for two nights recently.  The hotel is in a good location, walking distance to town.  Quiet area at night.  
Staff are very friendly, especially the food/bev staff.  
Room was snug, but beautiful, had everything you needed, very comfortable beds.  All toilets gorgeous as is the decor throughout the hotel.  Had breakfast both mornings upstairs, very good service.  Bar downstairs serves good cocktails.  
All in all, we enjoyed staying here, and would highly recommend it.  We hope to stay again when in Dublin.",5,2024,07,09
210,Brand New & Stunning,"Spent three nights in the brand new Leinster Hotel in the heart of Dublin.  My gosh this hotel is truly a five-star experience. The staff is outstanding, the decor is thoughtful and - get this - they have the fanciest toilets I've ever used in my life!  Heated seats, conformed for comfort instead of just flat, a bidet for washing and dryer for - well - drying.  Darn things were so comfortable my wife and I never wanted to get off the toilet, so to speak!
Do yourself a treat and eat at the fabulous Jean-Georges restaurant on the top of the hotel.  Better yet choose the breakfast option and eat there every day for breakfast, and then treat yourself to dinner at least one night.
I predict this will end up one of the top three or four hotels in Dublin.",5,2024,06,27
210,Lovely new hotel,"We recently stayed at The Leinster for a few nights and loved it! It‚Äôs a really nice new hotel, beautifully designed and decorated with lots of nice things like the wine glasses in the room (we know they‚Äôre good as we have the same ones at home!), even the kettle is really aesthetic. The bathrooms are just so nice, the shower is great and we loved the Japanese toilet. 
All the staff were very welcoming, friendly and helpful and little extra touches like the turndown service with chocolate truffles makes it all feel very special. 
We had drinks in the cocktail bar one night which were really nice (although a bit overpriced), and we had a cooked breakfast once in the top floor restaurant. The breakfast food wasn‚Äôt anything amazing but the coffee was good, as was the service. 
We stayed in the standard room and as a few other reviews have mentioned, the rooms aren‚Äôt exactly huge - we just had hand luggage suitcases so were fine but you would struggle if you had bigger suitcases! 
The only other small thing was the door to the room did let a lot of light in underneath - which also meant noise could be heard outside the room. Maybe something could be added to the bottom of the doors to improve this? 
We will definitely be back though!",5,2024,06,17
210,Perfect stay,"The hotel boasts stunning decor, ensuring every comfort in the room. The staff, particularly the receptionists, are incredibly helpful and friendly, providing exceptional and attentive service. I would gladly rebook in a heartbeat üíì",5,2024,06,15
210,Delicious and educational on the palette,Staff took care of me from start to finish. Recommended a tasting pairing menu between drinks and food. Music was incredible in the Collins bar downstairs. Outside terrace smoking area had heaters and a view of the dublin mountains as well as some of the baggot street area and beyond.  The duck was indescribable paired with a beautiful merlot. Finished off the evening with an espresso martini and butterscotch dessert. Special thanks to Eric who made sure I wasn't allowed to work and had to relax. Hats off to the chef and staff. I watched the building be built and wasn't disappointed. G,5,2024,06,07
210,Such a disappointment...,"Despite making several trips a year to Dublin we've yet to have been impressed by any of the supposedly luxury hotels that we've stayed at. When we found out that The Leinster would be open in time for our next stay we jumped at the chance to try somewhere that promised both an excellent location and more importantly, a contemporary take on luxury.

We had booked a superior room and when we were shown up to it we did something of an about turn. The room was tiny; effectively it was a king size bed with some furniture on the periphery. The ensuite shower room was equally diminutive. I cannot recall a smaller hotel room, not even in lower end properties. The staff were extremely understanding and accommodating and we were kindly upgraded to a corner room.

Whilst this room was larger - everything is relative - it was still miniscule. The room was probably only a couple of feet wider than the length of the bed and it had a television that was wall mounted in a frame and protruded so that you had to turn slightly to walk past it and it could not be viewed from the small seating area without craning your neck, so if you wanted to watch television you had to lie in bed. The ""wardrobe"" comprised four hangers, so if you're planning on staying for more than a night or two this isn't the place for you.

The minibar selection was probably the best thing about the room, lots of local treats, both sweet and savoury and a good selection of artisan/premium spirits etc. There was so much choice in the minibar yet I'm not quite sure of the logic of having such an extensive in room food and beverage offering when there is precious little space to comfortably enjoy it.

The windows have a black-out blind and curtains so if you want to have both privacy and daylight there is no voile to achieve it. In some hotels this doesn't matter if the room is not overlooked, but the rooms here are overlooked by the neighbouring buildings and offices. They need some voiles - very standard in pretty much every other hotel.

The shower room also had dolls house-esque proportions and lacked the space for two people to use it at the same time without literally treading on each other's toes. The rainfall showerhead was excellent but the decision to place it very close to the wall on one side rather than in the centre was ill conceived as you had to shower very close to the wall to get the full effect (the head is fixed and can't be tilted). Also, the seals around the shower door were inadequate so the bathroom flooded each time you had a shower. The encaustic floor tiles are already chipped and looking worn - not a good choice for high use areas i.e. hotels.

There is a lot of noise from the corridor and lifts at night as the entrance doors to the rooms aren't heavy enough and there is absolutely no space for a secondary inner lobby. If people are returning late and you're a light sleeper, they'll wake you up even if they're not being noisy! The fire doors need the closers adjusted as they slam shut every time they are used - the staff were aware of this so I'm not sure how it's taken so long for this to be addressed (a simple fix).

This hotel is both an architectural and design fail. I understand that they probably needed a certain number of rooms to make the hotel financially viable, but at this price point the micro-rooms are not acceptable. The design of the rooms is so impractical that despite being just a couple of months old some of the finishes are already looking worn in places.

Housekeeping was a bit hit and miss; on one day we returned after having vacated the room for a good few hours and hung a ""please make up our room"" sign on the door only to return to find that the room hadn't been serviced. 

The best bit about the hotel is the rooftop Jean-Georges restaurant where we enjoyed an excellent breakfast on each of the 3 mornings of our stay. The service still needs finessing but the quality of the food was good and the dishes were innovative enough that they stood out from the crowd and offered something different to your usual hotel breakfast. It was a really great start to the morning.

The irritating thing was that we had booked a rate that included breakfast. Ordinarily, that means at the very least you will be able to have a continental breakfast i.e. a fruit juice, hot drink, and some pastries and in most hotels it means you get at least a hot dish as well, but not here. At the Leinster it means you have a EUR 20 spend per head which is not even enough to have an Irish breakfast and a hot drink. Either offer a B&B rate that means just that or only offer room only options.

Effectively it feels like the whole hotel has been designed by amateurs who don't think about the necessary practicalities and equally it is now being run by a management team that are either deliberately trying to do the basics completely differently to any other hotel just for the sake of it or haven't put processes in place in line with other hotels.

All that said, the duty manager did an excellent job to try and make up for the hotel's shortcomings, and was extremely kind and accommodating, trying her utmost to ensure that our stay was as enjoyable as it could be. Ultimately most of the issues arose from a poorly designed hard product which with even the best will in the world cannot be changed overnight.

Perhaps this hotel is aimed at ultra short stay guests who are happy to pay their rates for tiny rooms and don't really care that it doesn't offer good value compared to equivalent properties elsewhere. I'm really disappointed as this hotel could've been great and as it stands there is no way that I'll be returning.",3,2024,05,21
210,Comfortable and relaxing experience,"Stayed in the Leinster for two days at the weekend visiting the literature festival in Merrion Park. Really lovely experience - staff were courteous and helpful, the hotel itself was beautiful and the breakfast in the rooftop restaurant very good.
I didn‚Äôt have dinner in the hotel but it seemed popular.
I stayed in the smaller standard room, which was a little cramped but fine for 1-2 people for a few days. Comfortable bed and I could properly black the room out with blind and curtain which I appreciated as a light sleeper.
Standouts were the turndown service with chocolate truffles on a bed of petals and the bidet toilet seat (which admittedly took a while to work out!)
Not cheap - when is Dublin ever - and this is a luxury experience but worth the money.",5,2024,05,20
210,Do not miss out on the Jean Georges experience!,"We stayed here the night before our honeymoon and we were delighted with our decision to do so!
Highlight of the night was our stunning dinner and drinks in Jean Georges - would definitely recommend booking this well in advance to secure a spot! Particular favourites were the tuna tartare and wild turbot.
Can blow the budget if you want to or more reasonable options in keeping with usual Dublin prices.
All in all, one of the best dining experiences we‚Äôve had in Dublin in a long time!",5,2024,05,20
210,Disappointing,"Lovely roof top restaurant & bar
Ordered bottle red wine ,servered feezeing cold asked for it to be warmed a bit came back had decanted it but still the same cold temperature 
Food ok ,presentation not great 
Staff very inexperienced 
Such a shame as has great potential",3,2024,05,08
210,Mixed Experience,"Having recovered from a strong waft of fragrance as we entered (think Abercrombie & Fitch) we were checked in very quickly by friendly and efficient staff. Just to note payment in full was requested plus a ‚Ç¨100 deposit for extras (with any balance to be refunded after the stay, which it was).  The Setanta car park is more than 10 minutes walk away and at check-in we were given a discount card for 50% of the 24 parking cost.  If your party has a lot of bags or the weather is poor it would be best to drop everyone and their luggage first and then park afterwards (you may be awarded brownie points from your significant other too !). A plus for me is that the hotel is right beside Merrion Square park. I'm guessing it's about 10 minutes walk to Grafton Street.

We stayed on a Saturday night in a standard room on the first floor. This wasn't ideal because it was over the  noisy bar and close to the lift. On entering the room there was a strong smell of plaster/cement which I guess is because the building is new but we could open the window and everything was ok after a while. The room isn't that big but was nicely finished with high quality fixtures and fittings. Unfortunately there is very little space for luggage or to hang clothes. It is probably ok if you are staying one or two days but that's about it. The room is very well stocked with drinks, snacks and 'personal care' items at a cost (thus the large deposit). The bathroom is small but again very nicely finished and had a 'Japanese' toilet which was novel (remote control, heated seat, warm water jets etc.). The window in the room overlooked the street and had excellent black out curtains but I couldn't see an internal blind or mesh curtain so it was completely overlooked by buildings across the street during the day. 

At check-in we were notified that the roof top restaurant was fully booked for dinner. Breakfast wasn't included but we went up to look at the rooftop area and it's beautiful and probably the highlight of the hotel (so book ahead if you want to eat there). 

I think this hotel is probably best suited for couples for a short city break in Dublin. Our room wouldn't work for a long stay or really for business as there wasn't really a work area. At ‚Ç¨339 for the night it wasn't cheap and I'm not sure what would convince me to go back here as opposed to other hotels in the city for future visits. It's maybe a 3.5/5 for me.",3,2024,05,01
210,Excellent,Made a booking last minute. Staff member was very helpful getting a reservation for us as it was fairly booked up. Had a delicious dinner in the rooftop restaurant. Staff were very nice.  Decor very trendy. Beautiful bar on ground floor. Will definitely go back.,4,2024,04,13
210,"If you don't stay here, you're doing it wrong.","The Leinster is a must for your next trip to Dublin. I'll start with the easy stuff: the rooms are exceptionally designed with thoughtful details (Dyson hair dryer, UK adapters, Nespresso machine, gorgeous artwork and red velvet couches). The hotel itself has an eclectic and fun aesthetic combining classic art deco with modern touches. They display art by Irish artists throughout. The Collins Club just off the lobby is a place to see and be seen, and the Jean-Georges restaurant is fantastic. Now for the stuff that's harder to find: unmatched hospitality, staff that becomes your friends, and an overall feel that people are willing to go out of their way to ensure your stay is absolutely perfect.

My friend and I were the first two guests to ever check into the Leinster, and from the moment we arrived we were not only taken care of, but part of the Leinster family! Martin, Mara, Melanie, and Bryan spent ample time making sure we were comfortable, and went above and beyond to ensure we were set up comfortably as our room was being prepared. We attended the first night at Collins Club and the cocktails were fresh and exciting.

We were provided with Martin's A+ bar/restuarant recommendations (O'Donoghue's became our home pub), and Bryan's favorite sites (Trinity College, The Creative Quarter). Thank you so much to everyone at the Leinster, we can't wait to visit again!",5,2024,03,26
210,Simply Amazing,"Simply amazing! Chic, stylish and uber cool, with the service to match. The new kid on the block, knocks the socks off the competition. This is our new go to place when staying in Dublin. The location is also a winner, with easy access to the best part of the city. The 5th floor restaurant is very special and well worth a visit to enhance your experience as well as the ground floor cocktail bar.",5,2024,03,24
210,Chose Hotel out of Desperation and Lucked Out with a Great Stay,"My friend and I decided to go see the St. Patrick's Day parade in Dublin and started looking for a hotel a bit late, like last November. We found a room at The Leinster after desperate searching and chose it because it had availability and were just happy to have a place to stay. As it turned out, we lucked into a fabulous stay. We got into the hotel from the airport around noon and asked to drop our luggage until check-in time. The staff were so friendly and welcoming and suggested several nearby options when we asked about places to eat. Off we went and when we got back around 3, the staff very apologetically told us our rooms were not quite ready, explaining they had actually just opened the hotel for business that weekend and were a bit behind working out a few kinks. They offered us a complimentary round in the bar while we waited - and the bar was beautifully done in sort of an art deco-ish vibe, with amazing cocktails and wonderful staff who were helpful, attentive, and helpful with descriptions and suggestions. We lingered over our drinks - if you like peaches, order the ""Peach"" - like nectar of the Gods! The manager, Martin, came and got us when our room was ready and escorted us up to our room, showing us how everything worked, asking if there was anything else we needed, sincerely asking us to let them know if anything was missing or not working as we would be the first to stay in the room. He also offered us a free breakfast the next morning to make up for our wait to get into the room. The room, like the rest of the hotel, was well decorated and well appointed, the bed was sink down under the comforter and I dare you to stay awake longer than a few moments - cozy, the shower had a rainfall shower overhead and had plenty of room, not cramped at all (I hate those showers so small you can barely turn in a full circle in them) with shampoo, conditioner and body wash with lovely fragrances. We actually fell asleep, due to the double tap of the cocktails and large, irresistible bed, and after a nap, went out for the night. The staff helped direct us to where we had decided to go and wished us a good time as we left. The breakfast the next morning was spectacular and the dining room was lovely, the staff similarly cheerful, friendly and accommodating, and they made sure we  knew where we were going so we got to the parade without a problem. Hours later, we came back and decided to warm up and relax in the bar and had another fabulous round of cocktails and banter with the staff, who welcomed us back like we were family. We went out for some dinner and post-parade activities and then returned and went up to the restaurant for dessert and a nightcap. The service and atmosphere were again outstanding, and we enjoyed the show put on by the bartender who was setting up two little girls in their pajamas for a ""nightcap"". We listened to them giggle as he made pink, fruity, girly nonalcoholic drinks for them with great flourish, solemnly asking them for their honest opinion of his creations after their first few sips. They conferred rather seriously and then gave them an 8/10. Full of Irish coffee and butterscotch pudding - which was far better than I remembered from my childhood - and with smiles on our faces, we headed down to our dreamy bed which had been given turn-down service and instant sleep. When we left the next morning, Martin was there again to thank us for our visit and direct us to the correct stop for the airport bus, and he and the other staff there waved us off and wishing us safe journey. I would never have guessed they had just opened and have rarely been so pleased with a blind booking made out of desperation. I will definitely go back. Thanks so much to Martin, the bar staff, and all the other staff to making our stay just as much of a special event as the parade turned out to be.",5,2024,03,19
