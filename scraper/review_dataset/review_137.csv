137,Exquisite!,"From the moment you walk in the door, you know you're someplace special. After a warm welcome, you're whisked to the 5th floor Executive Lounge, seated on a plush velvet sofa, and served champagne while an extremely professional and friendly staff member introduces you to the hotel. My room was upgraded and included everything you can imagine needing, from slippers and robe, to a full tea seat, stocked mini-bar, heated towel rack, etc., etc., plus surprises each day upon my return. The room was pin-drop quiet for sleeping. The Lounge is full of food all day long (plus the bonus of an ice cream freezer!) and the attentive staff anticipate your needs before you can even think what you need next: more wine, directions, or a taxi. I won't mention specific staff because I'm sure I'd leave someone out - they are all excellent and make you feel like you're at home. The location is great - 2 blocks to the Victoria tube station and right across the street from Buckingham Palace. We all have lots of choices of hotels in London, so if you're considering one of those well-known hotel chains where your room looks the same whether you're waking up in Chicago or Dallas, and their service is mostly non-existent, choose the Hotel 41 - you truly won't forget this experience. I won't be staying anywhere else when I visit London in the future.",5,2024,10,14
137,Phenomenal 41,"We go to London just to stay at this wonderful hotel. It is simply exceptional. From the moment you arrive you are welcomed and cosseted by the remarkable staff - they are marvellous. Anything you want at any time, they will make happen - as the “anything anytime “ button on your room phone indicates.  We were surprised with a room upgrade - an unexpected but wonderful start to our three day stay! 

41 is an elegant calm oasis in the hustle and bustle of London. Decor is black and white throughout and all designed for your comfort and ease. 

The heart of the hotel is the magical Executive Lounge, where the fabulous team make delicious food and drinks appear at all times of the day and night.  Nothing beats a welcome from Steve bringing the champagne trolley over as you check in! 

The breakfast is superb - from the gut health ginger shots to the most delicious hash browns to be found on the planet. 

From 17:00-19:00 canapés (which change daily) and the insanely delicious and moreish croque monsieurs are served. From 20:00-1:00 the plunder the pantry opens with a hot dish, salads, pate, cheese and desserts are served. And there’s a 24/7 fridge full of Jude ice cream to help yourselves to. 

And then there are the little gifts and surprises left on your bed when the housekeepers turn down your room each evening. 

The most exceptional aspect of the hotel are the staff. They greet you by name even if you’ve not met them before. They remember your preferences, they anticipate your needs. They are kind. Their level of service is phenomenal and genuine. 

We can’t wait for our next visit whenever that may be. Hopefully sooner rather than later.",5,2023,07,25
137,We wanted for nothing.,"We were overwhelmed upon arriving to be greeted by a traditional doorman, resplendant in red and black velvet, then by Callum, a guest services representative, dressed in a tuxedo, who escorted us to the Executive Lounge where we were able to relax in an amazing, fireplace-lit library with comfortable tables, chairs, setees and sofas while being checked in. We were asked if we would like a glass of champagne while we were waiting, then given the option of three varieties. When poured, we were also offered some lovely hors d'oeuvres as accompaniment.
Our room was spacious and so comfortable with multiple pillows on a king-sized bed, a setee, table with chairs, and a desk, as well as a fireplace, blackout shade, large screen television, coffee maker and tea service. The bathroom had a full sized tub with shower in addition to a single shower, a large sink with vanity and lovely personal amenities. The room was made up in the morning and turned down at night.
We were given the opportunity to raid the pantry after 8:30 every evening in the executive lounge and were provided a full ""honor system"" bar in same. We were attended to and spoiled every minute of our stay by countless staff members who were also available to recommend area attractions, restaurants, transportation, and necessities. As the final hotel of a five-week travel adventure, 41 spoiled our experience at all other hotels where we have stayed, and will reserve in our future! A most FABULOUS hotel!",5,2024,10,14
137,Top notch service and elegant style,"I wanted to write about our exemplary stay at the Hotel 41 in London.
What an accommodating staff and what a gorgeous property! From the moment we were welcomed to the fabulous executive lounge to the moment we were escorted to our room it was clear this place was dedicated to the highest level of service. 
Our stay was made great by many of the staff with Ruben being a true standout. He welcomed us with a great personality and thoroughly explained all of the wonderful amenities the property had and offered and also took us in great detail through our room, the amenities it offered and the housekeeping and turndown service provided.
And oh my the turndown service was top notch!  My wife and I stayed there for our 20th anniversary celebration and it was all we could have asked for. From the fireplace to the water bladder and the music it was truly relaxing after a day of touring!
We also received such great care and support in the executive lounge from all of the friendly staff there and when we left Ruben wrote us a nice personalized note thanking us and asking us how we enjoyed our stay. Great touch and I immediately wrote him back to thank him. We were truly sad to leave.
Also the decor is very classy and modern with the black and white aesthetic while still being classic at the same time if that makes sense! Lovely place. 
Thank you for the great stay and keep doing what it is you and your team are doing. We would love to come back some time to this or any Red Carnation properties for that matter if this is what we can expect!",5,2024,10,14
137,Cannot fault the experience,Simply cannot fault the experience. The attention to detail from head to toe was amazing. Right through from the quirky check in to the availability of umbrellas. Thoroughly worth the money in my opinion the staff were attentive and couldn’t do enough for you.,5,2024,10,14
137,"Hotel 41, pushing ""6 stars"" accommodation's","After being in Munich for Oktoberfest, I flew up and stayed at Hotel 41 in London at the end of Sept. 2024. I must admit the service was unimaginable. I will be spoiled for the rest of my traveling days. Hotel 41 is a premium luxury boutique hotel inside a luxury hotel, The Rubens. At the Rubens, I enjoyed the epicurean delight of the Curry Room (Curry Sampler) and The English Grill (Steak Diane signature dish). Again the service was top notch. Hotel 41 guests are lead through a ""secret"" passage to the restaurants  and any bottle of wine or champagne is relocated over to Hotel 41 for consumption at a later opportunity. Room amenities were again wonderful including still and sparkling water replenished as needed. Do Not overlook the ""Plunder the Pantry"", food presentations constantly. I had mentioned loving smoked salmon and was informed that at 9pm several forms of smoked salmon were being served and my remaining bottle of champagne was put to great consumption. I will be staying here whenever I return to London. As a solo traveler, they were incredibly helpful and suggestive.",5,2024,10,13
137,Hotel 41: An Intimate Escape in the Heart of London,"Hotel 41 is a unique resident’s hotel, meaning it caters exclusively to its guests. Unlike many London hotels, there are no public spaces such as bars or restaurants, ensuring a tranquil and private environment. If you’re someone who appreciates peace, quiet, and personalized attention, Hotel 41 is the perfect retreat.

Upon arrival, guests are greeted at the ground-floor vestibule, where a porter collects their luggage. From there, they are escorted to a private elevator that takes them to the fifth floor—the exclusive home of Hotel 41. Check-in takes place in the elegant Executive Lounge, where guests are invited to sit in plush chairs while the formalities are handled. A signature touch of the hotel is the offer of champagne during check-in, though on our visit, my husband and I were pleasantly surprised by the option of a finely crafted Manhattan cocktail. How could we resist?

As we sipped our Manhattans, it became clear that the hotel staff had remembered details from our previous visits. Over the years, we’ve stayed at Hotel 41 several times, with our first visit likely in 2009. During our previous stay, my husband had requested a Manhattan made with Antica Formula vermouth. At the time, they didn’t have it in stock, but this time, the Manhattan arrived with the distinct richness of Antica Formula, a small but memorable detail. Upon recognizing the barman, I confirmed that our custom cocktail was prepared because they remembered our preferences—a perfect example of the impeccable, personalized service that Hotel 41 is known for, especially for returning guests.

The hotel features just over 30 rooms, each stylishly appointed in a sophisticated black-and-white palette. On previous visits, we stayed in the Executive King rooms, which are compact yet beautifully appointed—some even feature fireplaces. For this stay, however, I opted for a Junior Suite, and the difference was remarkable. The split-level Junior Suite offers a significantly larger space, with the bedroom and bathroom on the upper level, both of which feature skylights. The bathroom is generously sized, complete with a large walk-in shower, a deep soaking tub, a bidet, and a spacious vanity area. The sitting area on the lower level is a cozy retreat, with a fireplace, comfortable chairs, and a minibar discreetly tucked away in a cabinet. A two-story window and chandelier connect the two levels, and even the under-stair closet holds thoughtful details—such as umbrellas, ready for London’s unpredictable weather.

For those concerned about getting a good night’s sleep, rest assured: the skylights are equipped with shades, and the bed is supremely comfortable. As an added touch, before bedtime, guests are treated to a famous quote about London left on their pillow, accompanied by a calming Elemis spray.

While Hotel 41 does not have a traditional restaurant, it offers continental and full breakfasts for a fee. Beyond breakfast, complimentary snacks are available throughout the day, and at 9:00 PM, the hotel provides two hot dishes along with a selection of salads, cheeses, and desserts. A 24-hour freezer stocked with ice cream is also available, ensuring that no craving goes unsatisfied. Alcoholic beverages are available for a fee, and although the hotel promotes an “honor bar,” in practice, attentive staff are always on hand to mix drinks or pour champagne, ensuring that you never need to lift a finger.

For those on holiday, Hotel 41’s location is ideal. It’s just a short walk from Victoria Station and conveniently situated across the street from the King’s Mews at Buckingham Palace. As someone who loves to explore the city on foot, I find that most of my favorite spots are within a 1.5-mile radius of the hotel, making it a perfect base for experiencing London’s best attractions.",5,2024,10,12
137,Luxury gem in the heart of London,"Cozy, comfortable, friendly, outrageously good service!  The room was beautifully appointed, and no amenity is overlooked.  I felt completely at home, and everybody who works there seems to love the hotel - and love the guests.  Only 41 rooms, all on the same floor, and all with full access to the “executive lounge” - which is a gem.  There you can get a full breakfast, all kinds of beverages and snacks all day long.  In the evening, enjoy cocktails, desserts, cheeses, wine, champagne and more - there is a delicious offering of hot food as well.  In fact, if you had to be inside all day and all night (too bad if you’re visiting London), you could very happily have three meals, drinks, after-dinners, and feel right at home the whole time - though I’m sure you’d put on a few pounds!  This is a fabulous, small, lovely luxury hotel in the heart of London.",5,2024,10,10
137,Simply Brilliant!,"In terms of cleanliness and customer service, as a TOTAL package, Hotel 41 is the best hotel I have ever experienced. And that is saying something considering the hotels I have even just recently visited (ex. St. Regis in Bora Bora, Art Maisons Aspaki in Santorini, etc). The hotel and the suites are spotless.  If you are slightly OCD about clean rooms and beds then Hotel 41 is heaven on earth.  The hotel is immaculate without being gaudy or over the top and the suites are so nice, clean, and comfortable that we found ourselves wanting to return to the room just to relax. 

We received a free upgrade and the suite was magnificent.  But what really stood out was the incredible service.  So responsive.  So friendly.  So intuitive. The housekeeping and turn down service were the best I’ve ever received. They do the typical cleaning the room, turning down the bed etc but go further and light a candle, turn on classical music, and then leave a small treat and note on the bed along with a hot water bottle under the comforter to warm your bed.  Absolutely flawless and brilliant.  

The doormen constantly rush to flag a taxi for us are holding an umbrella over our heads, and everyone in reception was incredibly responsive, friendly, and helpful. I cannot say enough about the CUSTOMER SERVICE at the hotel.  Rather than having a private butler, like some upscale hotels provide if felt like everyone was our own private butler. 

They also provide other great amenities like free ice cream hidden at the bottom of a staircase in the immaculate lounge area and a free snack bar that you can munch on throughout the day and evening if you get hungry. The made to order breakfast was delicious and there really is no amenity or service they did not hardly think of providing or could quickly provide with a phone call to reception. In fact their “operator” button says “whatever whenever.” this is all you need to know about this. Absolutely brilliant Hotel.",5,2024,10,09
137,Best Experience!!,"We had an outstanding experience at Hotel 41. The staff were incredible and took care of our every need. The executive lounge was beautifully appointed, and we looked forward to having a night cap and food there every night after a long day of sightseeing. Very understated and private with attention to every detail.",5,2024,10,07
137,Epic Stay,"While I will review exceptional venues from time to time, Hotel 41 stands out even among the best I've known.

The rooms are superb (enjoyed both the Conservatory Suite and a junior suite), but it is the location, excellent facilities, and the incredible service which stand out.

I'd name names of the staff who went above and beyond, but then I'd be listing their entire employee directory.

When I return to London, it will include staying at Hotel 41. It's that good. 

Full stop.",5,2024,09,29
137,"Wonderful, Warm and Welcoming","To celebrate my dear husband's birthday, we stayed at The 41.  A wonderful, warm and welcoming reception awaits you should you choose to stay at this elegant boutique hotel, in the heart of London.   Nothing is too much trouble and all the staff were lovely.  The rooms are beautiful and the beds / linen incredibly comfortable and of high quality.  The hotel wraps you in a soothing calm of comfort and luxury, with the hustle of the city a world away as you walk through the doors.  Thank you to all at The 41 for a wonderful stay.",5,2024,09,29
137,A hidden gem in London,"Hotel 41 in London is a hidden gem.  My family of ten stayed there this past week and we could not be happier with the hotel and the luxury accommodations.  We are a family that travels and we stay at top notice properties throughout the world.  Hotel 41 offers the best of amenities in a boutique setting.  No corners were cut to make sure we were completely comfortable and well served throughout our stay.  The rooms are beautiful and comfortable.  The lobby area is intimate and well stocked with treats and service to always make the guests at home.  We enjoyed a served lunch and breakfast for the group of ten in a specially arranged space that overlooked the lobby area.  Quite nice.  The staff has an attitude of warmth and service.  The rooms were cleaned often and kept immaculate.  Enough said.  Stay there for a unique and luxurious stay in a big, noisy and bustling city.",5,2024,09,27
137,Disappointed with my stay,I stayed while visiting London in my Europe trip. Based knowledge reviews my wife chose hotel. Staff was not very friendly and its way to expensive for what you get. It’s OK but not the best in the area. Not sure why so many raving reviews. Will stay somewhere else next time,3,2024,09,26
137,"Fantastic, lovely staff, exceptionally dog (and people) friendly!","Actually we went in September 2023 for my wife’s 60th birthday. Our stay was exceptional, the staff were all amazing and the hotel was fantastic. 

I had asked for ‘something special’ to celebrate her birthday and we were upgraded to a split level junior suite. The hotel’s signature macarons were waiting for us on a slate, complete with the London skyline in icing sugar. There was also a red velvet cake and a few gifts.

We had our dog with us and he was welcomed (by name) and given a range of doggy presents too!

We had a busy weekend and regretted not having time to eat at the hotel or enjoy the complimentary snacks but we are going back next month and plan to spend more time in this wonderful hotel.

We would absolutely recommend this hotel! The staff were lovely and made you feel welcome and special.",5,2024,09,21

Cannot give enough praise for the staff, service, food, decorating, ambience, attention to detail, beauty.  It feels incredibly intimate like a small private club.  Every wish is their command. The food is top drawer.  Love the ice cream fridge.  Loved the turn down service.  Loved the cocktail appetizers and late night food.  Stellar breakfasts.  We are world travelers and this is one of the best accommodations we have ever had.",5,2024,09,18

Whether it is giving you a wonderful start to your day with a superb breakfast or giving you a calm place to relax after your busy day, the 41 is top notch.  We plan on staying there at least three times in the coming year.  It is definitely our home away from home in London.",5,2024,09,16
137,First time in London,"I cannot say enough about Hotel 41, as it exceeded our expectations.  From the moment we arrived, to the day we left, the staff and service was exceptional.  Everyone was so kind and willing to answer our hundreds of questions.  We truly felt like royalty.   The room was very nice and when I needed them to swap out the pillows, as I'm allergic to down, they made sure to take care of it immediately. 
The location is great for walking and seeing all the sites.  If you are headed to London, consider this quaint and lovely hotel.",5,2024,09,15
137,Wonderful Stay with Outstanding Service from Sanjana,"We had a great stay at this hotel. Everything was excellent, from the food to the atmosphere.

137,Hotel 41 is an experience like no other- truly spectacular hotel.,"Spectacular is the only way to describe our stay at Hotel 41. This was our first trip to London and our honeymoon. The staff, amenities, accommodations were all top notch. The staff helped us navigate the city and made sure we got where we needed to go on time. They took care of us like we were family. As much fun as we had exploring London however, we really enjoyed coming back to Hotel 41 and relaxing in the Executive Lounge. The food, drinks, snacks - all delicious. It truly is a one of a kind experience. My husband and I will be calling Hotel 41 our home away from home when we visit London. Thank you to everyone there for giving us such a memorable vacation. Until next time!",5,2024,08,30
137,Five star and beyond,"This hotel was the ultimate in luxury. We stayed here as a special occasion and it surpassed all expectations. Room was amazing and we were greeted and shown to a seat with nibbles and choice of champagne whilst formalities completed . My husband had pre arranged afternoon tea , nothing wrong with that except it was not needed as this hotel has “plunder the pantry “ and there was a continual supply of snacks , sweets,  meals , ice cream and drinks which were changed at intervals throughout the day . Staff treated us like royalty , we are dreaming of a return visit one day",5,2024,08,26
137,Finest Hotel in London,"The experience at Hotel 41 continues to astound in it's thoughtfulness, elegance, attention to detail and unrivaled service.  It is the best hotel experience that I have ever had (except for my previous stays at Hotel 41).  Conveniently located near Buckingham Palace, it is very easy to travel to see London by bus, Tube or cab.  The staff greets you by name and spares no efforts in personalizing your stay.  A great touch is their ""Raid the Panty"" buffet each evening with outstanding food and snacks available until midnight.  They easily handled all our transportation and restaurant bookings with insightful suggestions.  Daily snacks, little gifts and personal messages with the turn-down service was a daily treat.  The attention to detail went so far as neatly coiling and binding our phone charger cables each day to ensure the perfect looking room.  I most highly recommend Hotel 41 and know that you will not be disappointed if you stay.",5,2024,08,26
137,Royal Treatment at Hotel 41,"We loved this boutique hotel, every single member of staff was warm and welcoming, and made the time to chat or answer questions when asked,

Hats off to the chefs for the out of this world full English Breakfast.",5,2024,08,25

137,"Wow, wow, wow!! Can’t miss!","My new husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 for part of our honeymoon stay in London- and it was honestly the best stay at a hotel either of us had ever had in our lives (and we’re no stranger to nice hotels). The service was incredible, and the entire hotel really went above and beyond to celebrate our honeymoon and make our trip special and memorable with thoughtful, genuine attention, literal gifts, and a joyous atmosphere. As for the hotel generally, the food was delicious (we literally ate there almost every night, and enjoyed daily ice cream), the location was so convenient and walkable (a mere 5 minutes from Victoria station and 5 minutes the other way to Buckingham palace), and the service was always so warm and friendly, remembering us and addressing us by name. By the end of our trip, we found ourselves becoming friends with the staff!  We stayed 9 nights and will definitely be coming back again when we return to London. You really can’t miss this gem!!",5,2024,08,19
137,Best Hotel Ever,"Hotel 41 is a unique gem in the heart of London across from the Royal Mews. I travel frequently and there is no better hotel that I have ever stayed at. All of the staff are gracious and welcoming. Special requests are accommodated whenever possible. I have only eaten breakfast and high tea here, but they are both excellent.  Menu adjustments are possible as I only order some parts of the Full English Breakfast.",5,2024,08,18
137,Simply amazing,"Simply incredible, from room service to concierge to restaurant, everything is perfect.

137,Luxurious break,"We absolutely loved staying here as an extra special treat! We have never stayed in such a high end hotel before and it blew us away.
As soon as you walk through the doors you are greeted and made to feel at home. Everywhere smelled amazing. All the staff members are so friendly, there is always someone around ready to ask if you want anything and really look after you. 
We were surprised by a room upgrade on arrival which was wonderful, and we loved all the little treats left in our room and on our pillows at night, and those brought over to us in the executive lounge (such as some gorgeous little chocolates with our drinks). We felt truly spoilt.
The lounge was our favourite part, it was a super relaxed and intimate atmosphere which suited us for our couple of nights away. The free snacks and food on offer are brilliant.
Thank you so much for making our stay so memorable, I hope we are lucky enough to stay again sometime in the future.",5,2024,08,08
137,Wonderful stay and exceptional staff,"We had a wonderful time at Hotel 41! We were surprised with a room upgrade to the Conservatory Room - the huge skylight was wonderful! The staff went out of their way to help us arrange tours and tickets and a birthday celebration. Every single staff member we interacted with treated us kindly and professionally - just that extra touch that makes you feel special and is the true trademark of an outstanding hotel. We loved our breakfasts and Afternoon Tea, and all the extra snacks, including the ice cream!
The room was well thought out and extremely comfortable. I enjoyed the vanity area near the bathroom for ease of getting ready. Bed was very comfortable. 
Location is perfect, easy walking distance to Buckingham Palace and many other must see attractions. One slight drawback to the location is that it can be quite noisy at night. We easily solved this by having the air conditioning running, but the noise may disturb lighter sleepers.
We would definitely stay at Hotel 41 on any future trips to London!",5,2024,08,08
137,Hotel 41 Fantastic Place!,"This is rated as a 5 star.  I would give it 10 stars.  Great location in London, very welcoming staff, excellent rooms, service, food, etc.  Small place where everyone knows your name!  I have stayed at a lot of very nice places over the years and Hotel 41 is at the top of the list.  Highly recommend staying here when visiting London.",5,2024,08,05
137,Wonderful jewel of a hotel! A must visit for Royal London!,"Another wonderful stay at a jewel of a hotel. Each time the wonderful staff go above and beyond to ensure a perfect stay. Thank you ! 

On this occasion : we were here for my daughter’s birthday. We have stayed many times but if you are new to finding out about Hotel 41 - it’s perfectly situated for all things ‘Royal Family.’ It’s right opposite the Royal Mews, The Kings Gallery and a 2-3 mins walk from the summer entrance to Buckingham Palace.  It’s maybe a 15- 20 min walk on the flat to Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, Parliament etc. 

Afternoon tea next door in The Reubens is wonderful and you can access it through a ‘secret’ door. In our opinion it’s better than Fortnum and Masons afternoon tea - having tried both quite a few times! 

From the time you arrive in the Hotel 41 private lounge - you are welcomed with a complimentary glass of champagne  followed by complimentary afternoon tea, or canapés from 5pm and a really lovely supper called ‘Plunder The Pantry’ from 8pm until after midnight. Guests are so well looked after. Breakfast is also superb! 

There is also a beautiful roof terrace looking out over the London skyline with tables, chairs and umbrellas with full staff service. It’s a wonderful place to relax with a book and a glass of wine. It’s open all day from about 12 until sundown. 

So overall: Hotel 41 is a wonderful place to stay. It’s so comfortable, every little detail is thought of",5,2024,08,04
137,AMAZING first stay in London,"The service at the Hoxton was second to none. The interior, atmosphere and especially the staff were outstanding for my first ever stay in London. Georgia and John were so welcoming and made sure all my needs were taken care of. Georgia lent me a phone charger which I thought was exceptional service and she really went above and beyond.

Will definitely be staying again",5,2024,08,03
137,"Beautiful, friendly and outstanding attention to detail","Hotel 41 in London exceeded all expectations during our recent stay. Here are the top 10 things that made our experience first class:

1. The pillow spray - an amazing touch for a peaceful night's sleep.
2. Impeccable turndown service, leaving the room beautifully prepared for bedtime.
3. 'Plunder the Pantry' - indulging in a first-rate chicken curry and cheese selection, all complimentary! On the second night I had beef stroganoff and hotel 41 cake.
4. Stunning decor throughout the hotel.
5. Exceptionally friendly staff who genuinely seem to love their work. Describe it as a family and love to talk as much as you want. I consider happy and well treated staff to be the critical sign of a good hotel.
6. Enjoying a lovely drink at the rooftop bar in the sunshine (also pesto hummus snack)
7. Staff remembering our names after just a brief introduction; also preparing some lovely and thoughtful surprises for our silver wedding anniversary 
8. Welcoming glass of complimentary champagne upon arrival.
9. Afternoon scones, jam, and cream - also complimentary.
10. Beautiful room with thoughtful amenities.

Also - brilliant location ; everything within 10 min walk.

Top 10 negative points …. Can’t think of any right now

In summary, Hotel 41 offers a luxurious yet personal experience that sets it apart from other high-end London hotels. Some other guests described it to me as being like a home - that seemed right to us too.",5,2024,08,01
137,"Lovely hotel, lovely staff","Unfortunately I arrived at the hotel after having gotten quite ill on my flight. I wanted to go straight to my bed ASAP as I felt faint and nauseous. They ushered me right to my room without checking in. And offered anything I needed.  They were helpful and gracious to my poor son and his girlfriend who were patiently waiting for me to rally as they waited in the executive lounge. Even though my interaction with staff was minimal ( I never recovered during my two nights there) it was obvious they were there to help. The place is spotless and the bedding luxurious. The room was lovely albeit small. Aside from giving a positive review under my circumstances while there, I also want to apologize for the confusion when I didn’t arrive at the hotel. The airline sent me to the hospital  director so I was not there to meet the transport from the hotel even though I was assured that my bags would be picked up and delivered to my hotel. That didn’t happen. I also wanted to say that I was heartbroken after saving and planning for my stay at Hotel 41. I was so looking forward and had wanted to return to London and stay there after a previous visit years ago when I first learned about your hotel. My bad luck. Even worse, I remained ill throughout my time in Oxford where the was visiting my son. I hope to return if possible. I never even got to plunder the pantry😢😢😢",4,2024,07,31
137,First Rate,This was my second visit to the Hotel 41.  Their service and attention to detail is second to none in making their guests feel comfortable and at home.  They live up to and exceed their motto that no request is too big nor detail too small.  I will stay here every time I visit London.  Highly highly recommend to other guests who want luxury  combined with excellent service in Central London.,5,2024,07,31
137,Great location to enjoy London. Great hotel to feel spoiled at while enjoying your time off.,"This hotel is amazing! The staff, the room, and the rooftop bar make this the best place in London. Perfect location for attractions, food, and bars. Every detail is considered and taken care of. Champagne upon arrival, and nightly turn down service are a few small details you can expect.",5,2024,07,30
137,Perfection,"Wonderful hotel with the most attentive staff that cater to every detail possible. High price but worth it. I was on a trip with my husband and our friend who was getting married in a few days. They made us and him feel so welcome, happy and excited for the big day in every possible way. Don't miss the breakfast. Best I've ever had.",5,2024,07,27
137,"Different and so, so special!",This place is just soooo amazing!! Like a little secret corner of London just to the side of Buckingham Palace. It’s part of the main hotel next door but they’ve turned one floor into this really exclusive ‘private members’ style section with its own private check in and lift. The room was small but very luxurious and the main thing is the service you receive is designed to defiantly you feel special. Nothing is too much trouble and small attention to detail makes the stay much more memorable. Very personal and exclusive with a complimentary food area for when you come back from your evening out including the most delicious ice cream tubs!  The only thing stopping me recommending Hotel 41 is I don’t want too many people knowing about it as room numbers are limited and we will be going back soon!!,5,2024,07,25
137,Incredible comfort and service,"From the moment you walk in, your every need is taken care of with incredible attention to detail. After a long trip around the British Isles, I could not have asked for a more comfortable and caring retreat to celebrate my 10-year anniversary with my wife. Whenever I am in London, I will look for an opportunity to stay here.",5,2024,07,24
137,B is for Boutique,There is a reason this is the  #1 Tripb Advisor hotel in London!  Excellent service. Excellent location.  Beautiful rooms.  Wonderful breakfast. Great restaurant next door on sister property. Great rates. Will not stay anywhere else......,5,2024,07,23
137,Highest recommendation 10 of 10,"Hotel 41 is an absolutely wonderful boutique hotel in the heart of London to which I give my highest recommendation. The staff provides a level of service and attention to detail that made our stay feel truly special and as if we had an entire team dedicated to making every meal, drink, and night's stay better than the previous. The concierge reached out to us prior to our arrival to ensure that any special requests were known, dinner and theatre reservations made, and to a point of contact in case we needed anything. Our arrival came with a warm welcome, check-in, welcome drink, and tour of our room and lounge.  The quality, cleanliness, and amenities in the room were all exceptional.  Every evening the turn-down service provided special gifts on our pillows, room and mini-bar freshen-up, soft music, and a lit candle in the bathroom. My favorite was a lovely lavender pillow spray. The doormen always hailed us taxi's, provided walking directions and helpful suggestions, and refreshing drinks of herb-infused water upon entering the hotel.  The food and drink quality were top-shelf.  One night we were running tight on time so the concierge walked us to our restaurant reservation at the adjacent Ruben's hotel Curry Room and ensured the restaurant would expedite our service (the food and service here was excellent too). There is even a super cute rooftop bar and lounging area, complete with blankets and even sun glasses, should you have forgotten to bring yours along.  Loved this hotel and its staff!",5,2024,07,22
137,Didn’t meet expectations,"Despite all the amazing reviews we had seen, we were left quite disappointed for the following reasons. 
1. Room not ready for check in at 3pm. It was closer to 4pm. 
2. When we did get into our room, the bags were not delivered and we had to request them to be brought. 
3. The room & bathroom were small and not practically set out. For example, the TV on the wall had to be navigated passed to get into bed and the bathroom had nowhere to lay out toiletries and the shower head was very low and anyone above 5’10 would not have been able to stand under it. 
4. Everything was centred around the executive lounge, refreshments, breakfast, dinner, reception, relaxation which made it feel like a bit of a goldfish bowl. 
5. for this reason we did not take breakfast in the hotel, and when we mentioned to a member of staff that we had gone to coffee shop down the road, she shook her head and tutted! 
6. The only thing we requested for the room with some skimmed milk on two occasions, but both times we were brought semi-skimmed milk instead. 
7. And on checkout, we were charged £40 for service! - being British we paid it! 
8. We were given a review questionnaire on departure which strangely asked how likely we were to recommend the hotel on a scale of 1 to 10 but stating that if we did not give a 10 we needed to provide reasons!

On a positive note there were always plenty of sweets,  chocolate and ice cream on offer which were complimentary and the evening buffet looked great, but we ate out as there wasn’t really anywhere to eat apart from the executive lounge.",3,2024,07,21
137,Beautiful stay,"Amazing! The staff is super attentive, the rooms are elegant and comfy, and  the location is perfect, near Buckingham Palace.  Loved the Executive Lounge and special touches. Evening  turndown service with treats was a lovely touch too.  Thank you so much, will be back !",5,2024,07,21
137,Luxury and service at its finest,"We reserved a room at Hotel 41 for one night at the end of a two-week European trip to celebrate our 35th anniversary. It was a splurge, but we had also spent a couple of nights there 14 years ago, and we had loved it then. I've traveled all over the world on business, and I had thought our stay at Hotel 41 in 2011 marked it as perhaps the best hotel I've experienced. 
Well, this time was even better. When we arrived, they had us leave our bags in the lobby, and they quickly ushered us up to the Executive Lounge, where they gave us some lovely snacks and a complimentary glass of wine/champagne. They explained that additional chef-prepared snacks (a chicken croque and something else I've forgotten) would soon be available. A few hours later a complimentary dinner buffet was laid out, which included a delicious butter chicken curry. 
When we finally decided to make our way to our room, we were again ushered there -- when they informed us we'd been upgraded to a suite. In we walked into a suite that included a large sitting room, another small sitting room, and THREE bathrooms (one shower stall; one with a toilet, sink, and bathtub, and a third with a toilet, sink, and shower). What? 
The staff is wonderful -- super-friendly and knowledgeable without ever being overbearing. The food is superb, the beds are incredibly cozy, and the building is beautiful. I was also struck by the lovely smell when we first got in. 
If you want to spoil yourself, this is the place to stay.",5,2024,07,19
137,recommended,"Loved my room that much, very cozy, warm, homey. All the details were beautifully decorated and also provided everything guests need for their comfortable. The staff were friendly, courteous and helpful. Highly recommended and would love to stay here again",5,2024,07,13
137,Lovely visit to London in a fabulous boutique hotel.,"My wife and I just returned from a ""bucket list"" trip to London to see the Wimbledon tennis tournament.  We stayed 5 days at Hotel 41.  The experience was amazing.   Personalized attention to detail like we've never before experienced.  Upon checking in we mentioned that we were going to Wimbledeon and that it was also our wedding anniversary.  Each day in our room, they left handwritten notes along with treats, rose petals, and upon our return from the tennis, they had souvenirs waiting for us.  No request took longer than 10 minutes to fulfill.  While we typically stay at the larger ""grand"" hotels, we took a chance with this boutique offering, and I am so glad we did.",5,2024,07,13
137,Beautiful stay!,"Very clean and nicely appointed room, comfortable bed and pillows, air conditioning. Great location across the street from Buckingham Palace. The lounge was inviting and relaxing, a nice way to start and end our days. Truly wonderful customer service from start to finish—the staff here are incredibly warm, friendly and go out of their way to ensure you have anything you need.  I cannot say enough about how lovely our stay was—thank you to our “Hotel 41 family”!",5,2024,07,12
137,A must!,"Second visit to this wonderful hotel. Staff are incredible, friendly, professional and make you feel very welcome. Ambience is warm and relaxing and our bed was very comfy. The little things they do such as leaving a chocolate on your pillow in the evening and shutting the blinds. It’s was our 25th anniversary and we had a pillow with Happy Anniversary on it. It meant something to us. 
The location is ideal for tube but also easy to walk to Westminster and other iconic venues. We walked back after a west end show and probably noticed things we may not have had we caught the tube. 
We will return!!",5,2024,07,12
137,Excellent Overall Experience,We had a delightful stay in this boutique hotel. The accommodations were very comfortable and the staff provided us with an extraordinary level of service and support. The location is central and I highly recommend Hotel 41 for visitors to London.,5,2024,07,12
137,40th Wedding Anniversary in London,I have never stayed at a hotel with a more attentive and professional staff. The customer experience was beyond compare. The hotel takes care of your every need from booking restaurants and transportation to helping with directions. Definitely the best hotel in London.,5,2024,07,10
137,Wonderful stay at 41!,I love this hotel.  Second time staying and it just improves with age.  The staff is wonderful.  We traveled with our nine year old and everyone was so kind and accommodating.   Location as always is perfect.  The room was more than adequate for three people.  The roof top area was great as was the executive lounge.   All around 5+ star experience!,5,2024,07,09
137,"The very best in service, style and comfort - a true home from home","Difficult to know where to start really -  the location is fantastic as are all the team. From the minute you arrive (and enjoy your welcoming glass of champagne) to the minute you leave, you are made to feel truly welcome and looked after. Nothing is too much trouble and it is the little touches which are just the icing on the cake. Honestly - a truly wonderful hotel. The room was beautifully decorated and equipped and given you are in the centre of London, so peaceful! A real oasis of calm. Breakfast just such a special start to the day.  Expensive? Yes. Worth every penny? Absolutely!",5,2024,07,08
137,Wonderful,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful staff, excellent service and really comfortable rooms. It was a very luxurious experience from start to finish. Champagne on arrival and a stunning cake in our room to celebrate our anniversary were extra special touches. Thank you to all the staff at Hotel 41 for making our stay so special.",5,2024,07,08
137,Fantastic hotel,"Great hotel!
Everything was perfect .... attention to detail, check in, room, breakfast, and most importantly service was great
Added bonus as we were upgraded to a split level junior suite as it was my birthday ..... and a small birthday cake too 👍
Had dinner in the adjoining English grill which was very good but book in advance
Absolutely no hesitation to recommend this hotel ... it deserves its Tripadvisor rating",5,2024,07,07
137,Relax in quiet luxury,"If you crave a quiet, slow pace, smaller hotel to escape the hustle and bustle of London, but desire fantastic and genuinely friendly family like service, this is the place for you.  This hotel is completely unique, all rooms are located on one floor and the same floor is home to the lounge.  The rooms are very comfortable, great bed and sheets, invisible but fantastic housekeeping service, and everyone is so very helpful.  You won't find crowds, you won't find lines or waiting, you won't find noise or a jammed bar, but you will find delicious food, superb cocktails and wine.  It's so relaxing that a couple we met told us they slept in to 11 am, something they never, ever do.  Let the world melt away, drop by for a stay, you will return.",5,2024,07,05
137,Best of London,"A wonderful hotel with world class staff who genuinely care about their guests. Excellent food and service. 

The rooms are newly remodeled and beautiful. Surprising treats everyday and many personal touches. 

Oliver and his team are the best. Great location.",5,2024,07,04
137,Exceptional experiance,"From the moment we arrived, we were impressed by the warm and attentive service. The attention to detail, personalized service, and luxurious amenities exceeded our expectations.

Hotel team’s commitment to ensuring guests’ needs are promptly met is commendable. Thoughtful extras like free champagne and snacks on arrival in the plush lounge and useful gifts in the evening set Hotel 41 apart.

Moreover, the recommendations the team provided about the city were incredibly useful. Exploring London based on their suggestions allowed us to discover hidden gems and experience the city like a locals.

We look forward to returning to this hidden gem!",5,2024,06,30
137,Great boutique hotel,We enjoyed our stay at Hotel 41. We stayed in a lovely suite facing the Royal Mews. The staff were wonderful. The rooms were very comfortable. We especially enjoyed the rooftop bar and Executive Lounge. The pantry is fun and we also ordered dinner on night after the theater.,5,2024,06,23
137,"Hotel perfection takes form in Hotel 41, a beacon of calm in central London.","There are very few things in life more rewarding than allowing oneself a moment of indulgence, be it a nice piece of cake, a relaxing massage, or a stay in a luxury hotel. And when it comes to hotels, Hotel 41 is the Sticky Toffee Pudding with proper Devonshire Clotted Cream of hotels!

Despite the fact that my partner and I live in London, I/we have been staying at 41 for at least a decade now, be it for celebrations or just because we deserve that hit of indulgence from time to time. I don't think I can find a single bad word to say about 41. The staff are incredibly friendly, welcoming, efficient, and knowledgeable. Every possible effort is made to ensure your stay is the very best it can be, from a glass of champagne at check in, to the turndown service before bed.

Speaking of bed, have you ever been hugged by a cloud that was just given some really good news? Because that is what sleeping in a 41 bed feels like. The rooms and suites, all of which are decorated in the hotel's signature art deco theme, are beautifully appointed and every elegant detail has been thought through and perfectly executed.

On this particular trip, my partner and I were celebrating a year since he agreed (for reasons that will forever escape me) to marry me. We stayed at 41 to celebrate on that occasion as well, and were treated like royalty. This weekend was no different. We stayed in the Balmoral Suite, a divine space with a lovely bathroom, a separate shower, a walk in wardrobe, and a separate little lounge area. We spent time relaxing in the hotel's Executive Lounge and plundering the Pantry. What is the Pantry? Well, it's a section of the lounge where food is laid out throughout the day the you can just help yourself to. And it changes depending on the time of day. In the afternoon, there are scones, jam, and clotted cream. In the evening it changes to a hot option, plus salads, quiche, cheese and crackers, desserts etc.

All in all, I can never and will never stop singing the praises of this beacon of calm in the heart of London.",5,2024,06,11
137,Amazing and Luxurious Stay in London,"Wow!  The service at this hotel is beyond incredible. The employees go out of their way to make you feel important. The Lounge is a welcome place where you can get breakfast, scones, and my favorite - ice cream. When we when to see Wicked, we came back to find macaroons decorated with the Wicked logo put in our room during Hotel 41’s turndown service. I could go on and on. Special thanks to Stef, Esin, Angelica, and Aji.",5,2024,06,07
137,Spectacular boutique hotel,"The customer service is impeccable! This boutique hotel delivers service across the board with special touches throughout the day.  My husband loved the secret candy room. We started each day with superb breakfast, enjoyed mint tea and scones after tours, and ended with special notes and treats with turn down service. They arranged all taxis,and restaurant reservations. We were well taken care of and felt spoiled!  We wish we had stayed longer!",5,2024,06,04
137,Hotel 41 - Second stay and still exceptional!,"Exceptional, best-in-class service, tremendous location and amenities. This hotel has it all and the staff is wonderful.

From the welcome champagne trolley to the lovely turndown service, all the small details are taken care of for you. Highly recommend!",5,2024,06,04
137,This hotel will tempt you to never leave!,"Absolutely the lap of luxury. Flawless service, and personable staff. Enough can’t be said about this amazing property. Well worth the price. Right behind Buckingham Palace, in a great location, but then you feel so pampered you don’t want to leave the hotel! If you want a gym or swimming pool, a place for your kids, this is not for you.",5,2024,06,01
137,Our stay was too short!,"Definitely a place that makes one feel very special. Attention to detail is the key. Champagne trolley when you check in. Little snacks and goodies all day. They brought vegan snacks for my husband. Lovely lounge area with roof top bar. 
Our room was very comfortable and clean. Everything about our stay was five stars. Hope to stay here again but this time for more than one night.",5,2024,06,01
137,The best hotel experience in my life!,"I stayed at Hotel 41 in early April with my daughter. I have traveled the world and stayed at some of the top hotels (Ritz, Four Seasons, Montage, etc.) and this is by far the top hotel experience that I have ever had. Every detail in the room is top notch and the service is truly spectacular. If you want to experience a true service magic, you stay at this hotel. I can't say enough about how every individual that works here has been trained to provide the utmost in service. There is no task that is to cumbersome or unachievable for the staff here.",5,2024,05,30
137,A wonderful short break,"Our daughter had invited us to join her for the Eric Clapton concert at the Royal Albert Hall which provided a great excuse for a small family gathering.

We booked two rooms for two nights to take full advantage of our time together and indulge ourselves. 

Hotel 41 never fails to excel with superb service and the exclusivity of the resident only facilities. The Executive Lounge is always a peaceful haven for a relaxed cocktail or glass of wine and we were treated to excellent breakfasts to fortify us for visits to the National Gallery, and also the King's Gallery just across the road. We were delighted to return to the unique Plunder the Pantry offering where we indulged in a late evening supper and digestif.

Always a pleasure to return to our very favourite home from home in Town.",5,2024,05,30
137,Don't miss out on this hidden GEM in London!,"I will start by saying you would miss out on an INCREDIBLE stay if you don't stay at Hotel 41!  From the moment you arrive with a Champagne toast to ""plunder the pantry"" it's a lifelong memorable stay!  The staff is second to none!  You are treated with special care and concern to every detail!  You feel like you are coming home only better!  The rooms are elegant and the beds and linens were superb.  This has truly becoming one our favorite landing spots in the world!",5,2024,05,29
137,Best hotel experience we have ever had.,This was honestly the best hotel experience we have ever had. Everything was exceptional from the room to the service.

137,Pleasure and service,"'This hotel provided a remarkable experience for us.  We arrived in London after over 24 hours of air travel from New Zealand.  It was an absolute relief and pleasure to be welcomed by Connor and his team.

The bedroom was elegant but comfortable, the staff extremely helpful and the location ideal.  We highly recommend this establishment.",5,2024,05,24
137,The very best,One of the very best hotels I have ever stayed in. Everyone was so kind and really went above and beyond to cater to our needs.

137,A Hidden Gem Worth Finding,"This hotel is a marvelous gem tucked away on Buckingham Palace Road.  To start, the staff are excellent; each one professional and courteous.  From the moment we arrived until our departure, they were there  to help.   The lounge where drinks, tea and light meals are served is steeped in English charm.  We had a lovely ‘high tea’ with the requisite finger sandwiches, sweets and of course, teas, which were really quite good.  The rooms are spacious and the beds are extremely comfortable.  It was hard not to give in to the jet lag… Our room looked into the south end of the palace grounds and a small garden which was lovely.  The area is walkable to so many iconic British sites that we’d highly recommend a stay!",5,2024,05,23
137,European vacation.,"They are a well oiled machine of guest service. Highly trained staff, gorgeous hotel, special surprises, turn down service, going above and beyond at every turn.

137,My new favorite hotel!,"This is my new favorite hotel! From the moment you walk through the door into this beautiful, boutique hotel, you feel welcomed and pampered. The service can not be beat. The hotel is pricey; however, you never feel as though you have paid too much for what is provided. The hotel rooms are beautiful and have everything you could possibly need. The gathering space is perfect for spending time with friends and enjoying drinks and their ""raid the pantry"" meals and treats! The location is also great. We will definitely return to stay here.",5,2024,05,20
137,Across the street from Buckingham Palace,"One of my favorite hotels in London. Been here many times. Great service and very comfortable and very private. 
I am now needing to walk with a cane and find the tub showers hard to use so I ask for a room with a shower or a handicap room if available.",5,2024,05,20
137,Best Hotel Ever!,The staff and service here made this the best stay at a hotel I ever had. They really went above and beyond to make this a memorable experience.

137,Perfection in every way!,"This hotel is nothing short of magical. Every member of staff makes it their mission to assure you have the best stay, that you're looked after and offer assistance in any way you could need. Everything was perfect in our rooms, spotlessly clean every day and the decor was incredible. 

The best way to end our trip was here. The hotel cannot be faulted in the slightest and every member of staff is a delight, I've never stayed anywhere as dreamlike and awe-inspiring as here.",5,2024,05,15
137,Magical and Unforgetable!,"What a magical and unforgettable stay.

It was a dream for us to be able to return to 41 and as always, it exceeded all of our expectations.

I cannot put into words how much we enjoyed our stay. The wonderful hotel, our beautiful room, the impeccable service, the food, the cocktails, everything!

The personal touches in the hotel is one of many things that sets them apart from the others. The little notes, the turndown service (loved having Classic FM on in the room when we returned for the evening), the in room treats, and not forgetting plunder the pantry and the gorgeous champagne and canapes on arrival.

A few mentions to Summer, Stef and Callum. So friendly, so attentive and couldn’t do enough for us. This goes for everyone, but we had more interaction with them and so really wanted to give them a shout out.

And a very special mention to our lovely Shan! His smile is infectious, always so happy, so polite and so interested in what we were up to. We won’t forget him, he added to our wonderful memories and long may he stay at 41. 

Thank you to all at 41 for making our stay so memorable. This is one of the nest hotels in the World!

We are very sad to leave it behind and will hopefully soon plan our return.",5,2024,05,14

I think some people might stay there and not realize it is two blocks from Victoria Station. You can get anywhere.",5,2024,05,13
137,A very special hotel,"This hotel is a small gem.  The hotel is beautiful, elegant, and professionally run.  At the heart of this hotel are the wonderful people who work tirelessly to make this place truly unique.  This is a hotel that you want to recommend to people when they are coming To London.",5,2024,05,07
137,"Stunning, handsome boutique Hotel 41","A 5 star experience from start to finish. The staff are incredibly efficient and ready to welcome guests and meet every need. Not only is the aesthetic handsome and striking with its quintessential English black-and-white scheme and beautifully trimmed nooks and crannies, but each space exudes comfort and luxury. I stayed two nights in late April and May '24 with my 10 year old child and we simply could not stop smiling. The location across from Buckingham Palace and adjacent to the Victoria tube station is convenient, safe and exciting. We are already hoping for another trip.",5,2024,05,06
137,Special spot in the heart of London,"41 is a special place, run by a team of people who are very good at what they do. We were traveling for the first time with our 7 month old, and were bracing for disaster at every turn...and it became pretty clear, after the first day or two, that that wasn't going to happen. They've got you covered. 

The surprises are good (your favorite newspaper in a tote bag at the door each day, a baby bathrobe [!] laid out next to mom and dad's), and the staples are surprisingly good (the cream that came with our morning coffee...man). There are a lot of nods to an earlier era of luxury travel (personal service, deep bathtub, decidedly analog check-in/check-out), but 41 carries everything off while remaining delightfully unstuffy. 

The Executive Lounge is the clincher, though: a skylit room of requirement that serves up early-bird breakfast, afternoon tea and scones (and jam, and clotted cream...), midday tranquility, late-night treats...or, y'know, the one place in London you can have a cozy late-night drink while remaining baby monitor's distance from your room. 

And yes, the location is top-notch -- walkable to everything, but *just* far enough away from Mayfair and the palace to feel like a refuge. 

This was ~2x more/night than we've ever paid for a hotel room, and it still felt like the best value we've ever gotten. We'll definitely be back.",5,2024,05,04
137,"Beautiful, boutique hotel in the heart of London with outstanding service!","This is an absolutely beautiful hotel in the heart of London!  With only 28 rooms, the staff goes out of their way to know each and every guest by name.  You are greeted with champagne or a cocktail while you complete your registration and then shown to your room.  We were lucky to have a two-story room with a living room area downstairs and the bedroom along with a desk area upstairs.  Unlike most London hotels, this bathroom had a bathtub as well as a walk-in shower which was nice.  The staff is beyond compare, and anything you want or need is just an ask away.  My husband was going to go down to the lobby to get a cup of coffee as the staff told them there was a fresh pot being brewed downstairs.  By the time he got there, they were waiting with a cup already poured, with cream in it just like he takes it!  Due to it's location, you can walk to most places in the heart of London.  Just across the street is the King's Mews, and Buckingham Palace in minutes away as well as Westminster Abbey, Churchill War Rooms, Parliament House, the London Eye and most other major London sites as well as a tube station. The heart of the hotel is the reception area on the 5th floor where all the rooms are located.  There you can find something to satisfy your cravings at any hour of the day - from the ice cream freezer, to the small buffet of goodies they have out that changes due to the time of the day.  And, of course, any cocktail you could ask for.  You never have to sign for a bill as the staff knows who you are and just adds it to your tab. The room had beautiful linens, bathrobes and slippers (which were placed next to the bed during turndown service).  If you are looking for an upscale, boutique hotel near all the action in London, this is for you!  We will most definitely be going back.",5,2024,04,29

137,Great hotel (with a few adjustments),"- We stayed here for four nights in April in one of the executive king rooms.  This is our second time staying in a Red Carnation property and while we would stay here again, there’s definite room for improvement.  
Pros
- The hotel has a pleasant, private feel (a separate side entrance adjacent to its sister hotel Reuben’s) and is all on one floor.  As a result, everything feels like a private club, is easy to walk to, and you don’t have to worry about the noise of any upstairs neighbors.  Our room had a fireplace, a view of the Royal Mews, and faced Buckingham Palace Road.  While the street is very busy during the day, it is extremely quiet at night which was a pleasant surprise.   
- The beds were comfortable and the room, while small, was pleasantly decorated.  The housekeeper was attentive and even changed the his/her slippers to her/hers when they realized I was staying with my sister. 
- The hotel is centrally located a block from Victoria Tube station and adjacent to Buckingham Palace.  The area, however, is much quieter and emptier at night—-a reflection of the many offices nearby—and while there were many food options most were casual.  If you’re a foodie and love bustle at night, I’d recommend a hotel in Mayfair instead.  
- The breakfast was excellent and had plenty of vegan options.  They also provided our breakfast to go one morning when we had an early excursion.  
- The staff are plentiful, helpful, and extremely responsive.  Requests for items to be brought to our room were responded to almost instantaneously.  
Cons:
- The shower situation is, in a word, ridiculous.  There are technically two showers—a standing shower and a tub with a shower head attached.  The first night we attempted to use the standing shower.  It is possibly the smallest shower I have ever seen in a hotel and that includes cruise ships.  The shower head, which is extremely large and not adjustable is very low and dispenses water with such force that it’s akin to showering in a waterfall.  While the waterflow can be adjusted, because the shower head cannot and the shower is so small, it’s impossible to even wash your hair outside the range of the water.   I actually inadvertently opened the shower door with my elbow while showering because of the close quarters.  For reference, I am thin and 5’4.”  I cannot imagine a medium height person using it.  The second night we used the “tub shower” but that was similarly bad.  This time because the water flow is too strong to drain quickly (the sink also didn’t drain well), if you lower the water flow the exposed tub makes for a very cold shower.  The tub is also extremely high so for anyone short it’s difficult to get into or out of.  I realize the building is old but for the price, I recommend a single larger shower.  
- The staff are, as noted above, plentiful and very willing to help.  However, there is a definite air of inexperience amongst the staff that I expect to be fine tuned at a hotel of this caliber and there’s room for improvement in communicating about charges with guests.  For example, we were provided with vegan “snacks” in our pantry.  We took them with us during the day but never ate them on our outings and returned them to the pantry the day we left.  On checkout I was told this was actually part of the minibar and not included in our room charge.  This was corrected but should have been explained in advance.  Finally, there is a “discretionary” service charge that is automatically added to your stay for each night you stay there to cover tips, etc.  This was only explained when I asked why the total amount invoiced differed from the amount quoted on my reservation.  Again, communication is key.  
- The “pantry” which is advertised quite often as being a whatever/whenever snack room is actually not entirely free as we learned at checkout.  We are vegan and so frequently had few meal options late at night when we returned from excursions.  We also don’t drink alcohol.  But we did ask for bottles of still water a few nights in a row, assuming this was part of the “pantry.”   So I was surprised upon checkout to be told that any drinks obtained from the lounge must be paid for, even if it’s water.   This was certainly not explained when we arrived and had we known, we would have bought water from an adjacent supermarket.  They did remove the charge from the bill when I explained this to them but it should be communicated in advance.  The pantry is also “policed” but two staff members who watch as you peruse items.  This is presumably to make sure guests don’t take the alcohol but it makes for an odd and unenjoyable experience in such a small space.  Finally, for a hotel that advertises itself as providing a bespoke experience, I was disappointed that despite informing them well in advance of our dietary needs, there weren’t always vegan options in the pantry for dinner, the food is not labeled, and the staff members frequently didn’t know what the food actually was.  
- The front door is operated by a card reader, even during the day.  We were never able to open it successfully and one night, when the reader failed and the intercom was not working, we had to get a doorman from Reubens to open it for us.  They seem to be aware of the problem but it’s important for safety that late at night guests be able to enter the property without waiting around.",4,2024,04,21
137,A beautiful hotel with a wonderful ambience,"A beautiful hotel with a wonderful ambience, where you always feel comfortable and at home. The service is very attentive, courteous and simply outstanding. The location is central and offers many opportunities to explore the city and its various neighborhoods. Many thanks for a very pleasant stay!",5,2024,04,08
137,Pearl in the middle of London,"Small hotel with a family atmosphere, excellent service, friendly staff ready to fulfill any wish, perfect position. We spent there prolonged a family Easter weekend. We all believe we will be able to return there and enjoy their excellent service soon.",5,2024,04,02
137,5 Stars that really is a fully 5 Star Hotel,"Thanks to Costco, we stayed at 41 across from Buckingham Palace on our 3 day visit to London. We are fairly well traveled and I have to say that this is my favorite hotel I have ever stayed in. Not the biggest, but the best. Why? Because the attention to detail is the highest paid I have ever experienced in a hotel stay. It starts on the outside of the building, to the doorman, to reception, to the OUTSTANDING decor, to the attentiveness and politeness of the staff, to the absolutely LOVELY intimately beautiful executive lounge. And then all the nice little goodies they offer you nonstop, all included in your hotel stay price——bowls of Lindt truffles, champagne and appetizers upon arrival, our package included FULL, served, hot breakfasts AND one royal high tea that was FABULOUS. And our room was so stately, clean and comfortable with nice touches everywhere (slippers, hot water bottle, orchid, high end toiletries, custom cookies on our desk, black throw blanket, loofah sponge, good magazines, automatic black-out blinds, tv with tons of channels, newspaper delivered each morning, and starting at 8pm they have Plunder the Pantry with free hot food you can nosh.
The hotel is located across the street from Buckingham Palace with a really great restaurant adjacent nextdoor with good view for people watching, too.
Basically I LOVE this place and will return. I have uploaded 24 of my own photos to accompany this review",5,2024,04,01
137,Would definitely stay again,Lovely hotel.  The service and food are great.  Nice little ice cream fridge and gratis snacks and drinks at various times of the day.  Recommend choosing the breakfast option when you book as it will save you quite a bit.  Great location - a few blocks from Victoria Station and a long block from Buckingham Palace.,5,2024,04,01
137,Outstanding guest experience- very highly recommended,Outstandingly good experience from this jewel of a hotel in London’s crown. We came as a family for an Easter break & stayed for 2 nights. The staff are totally focussed on excellent guest experience & work together to achieve this consistently. Rooms & the guest lounge  are based on a classic black and white palette with extremely comfortable beds & sofas. There is an excellent breakfast service and a complimentary ‘plunder the pantry’ supper offer which changes daily. I would not stay anywhere else in London,5,2024,03,31

Many Thanks from California and until we meet again!",5,2024,03,28
137,5-star hotel yet very casual,"5-star hotel and service yet unstuffy casual atmosphere - you can’t find anything better than the Hotel 41. Convenient block from Victoria Station one way, Buckingham Palace the other. Friendly personal service anticipating your every want and remembering you and your preferences. Relaxing lounge/library with free food all day/evening (tip: eat lunch out and have the complimentary hot food and canapés in the evening!). This is old world charm with all modern conveniences.",5,2024,03,26
137,Simply the best!!!,"This is the place to stay if you want a truly boutique pampered holiday.  I just returned from a wonderful week with friends at the Hotel 41.  From check in the check out the surprises never stopped.  At check in, located in their beautiful cozy library, we were greeted with champagne and an overview of the hotel and their services which included complimentary wonderful food, snacks and desserts at different times during the day.  Our room was lovely, with heated towels, robes, coffee and a mini bar to name just a few.  Turn down service at night was very special, including a warm water bottle in your bed, a treat and a little note.  We travel quite a bit and I have to say you don't find kindness and attention to detail at this level very often.   Thank you so much to all of the wonderful people at Hotel 41.",5,2024,03,25
137,The perfect hotel for a London stay.,"The perfect hotel in London. Their personal service and attention to detail is second to none. I much prefer hotels like this to big corporate ones but even this surprised me as to how perfect it is. 
Located near Buckingham Palace, it was perfect for our weekend stay.
The staff and service at this hotel make it so special.  It was my birthday and they provided some cake which was lovely. 
The complementary snacks, ice cream, canapés and hot food in the evening is a great touch and we certainly took advantage of this. 
Highly recommend this hotel and will definitely return. I don’t think you’ll find better in London!",5,2024,03,23
137,Birthday celebration stay,"The stay was absolutely fabulous and if we could give them more than 5 stars we would, as it was 10/10 for us. The service was amazing, all of the people we met that work for Hotel 41 were delightful and friendly. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Thank you very much to all that work for Hotel 41 for making the stay memorable.",5,2024,03,20
137,Doesn't Get Any Better Than 41! Book it Now,"Hands down, the best hotel experience I have ever had in my life! This place is NEXT LEVEL. Unbelievable value for the price. No joke. I will be a forever customer! Any time I'm in London, this is now my hotel. First, the staff are incredibly kind and welcoming. Shout out to Gabriel in the lounge! Oh- can we talk about the lounge for a minute? Dark Academia meets My Fair Lady. Absolute Magic. I felt so fancy being in there. Moving on. This place is truly ""boutique."" The small size makes it feel more like a swank, royal apartment. I stayed in a Deluxe King. The rooms are incredibly well appointed and have so much details. Management put so much thought and care into those rooms. There are even scissors, stapler, paper clips etc in the desk! There are all kinds of surprises when you turn in for the evening but my fav has to be the hot water bottle in the bed1 OMG so British! I honestly felt like crying on the day I had to check out. Hotel 41...I love you! I'll be back soon and I can't wait to eat my toasties!",5,2024,03,17
137,"Having travelled the world this small hotel is based on family. As a guest of someone’s home, 41 is just that","Our last trip to London we stayed at Marriott’ Bankside which was incredible. But 41 is beyond that and more. Every guest is known by name likes like you are staying with friends.

We had English tea there which was wonderful and our package included breakfast which is a la carte. Plus we were upgraded on our room so ever better.

We love London if we return this will be our first choice

Plus the little extras put 41 in small class of excellence",5,2024,03,11
137,Amazing,"This is my second visit now to hotel 41 and it seems to get better every time. 
From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave you feel relaxed and thoroughly spoilt! Unfortunately my husband couldn’t come so my daughter came instead who felt like a princess for the weekend- she especially loved the sweets in the cinema room and mocktails! 
We were lucky enough to be given a room upgrade which was just amazing! We aren’t lavish or ‘rich’ people at all but for a treat it is so worth every penny. 
Already looking forward to our next visit!",5,2024,03,10
137,Wonderful Stay,"I recently stayed at Hotel 41 for the second time, and I can say for sure that it won't be my last. The rooms and lounge are beautifully decorated, but what truly sets this hotel apart are the exceptional staff. Every member of the team is friendly, attentive, and take great pride in their work.

Don't miss out on the opportunity to unwind in the lounge and savor the delicious complimentary canapés and Plunder the Pantry. It's the perfect way to unwind after catching a show or coming back from a busy day in London. 

If you have any doubts about booking Hotel 41, I fully encourage you to go for it - you won't be disappointed!",5,2024,03,08
137,Absolutely Phenomenal,"Despite high expectations from all the stellar reviews, I was surprised to still be amazed by the Hotel 41. 

The Hotel 41 is private, exclusive oasis within the larger Rubens at the Palace Hotel building. There is a separate entrance with an attendant to help usher you up to the Hotel 41. There are only ~30 rooms at the hotel 41 so guests are given very personalized, attentive service. 

The rooms are exactly as described on the website - spacious (for London standards) and comfortably fitted. The room decor is largely black and white, a theme which is carried over wonderfully to the bathrooms as well. The beds were very comfortable and we had a very restful stay each night. Service is really where the hotel shines - staff is attentive and proactive to every guest need. There is a “plunder the pantry” each night, where guests are invited to the lobby / library and served desserts / cheeses from a trolley cart. Each day was different and highly enjoyable. 

The Hotel is located a stone’s throw from Buckingham Palace so very convenient to sites in Westminster and Belgravia. It’s a different area than we stayed in the past, but we highly enjoyed the proximity to so many wonderful places. We’ll definitely return.",5,2024,03,04
137,Exceptional Stay at Hotel 41,"Hotel 41 is the type of Hotel you continue to think about after you’ve left your holiday, and count down the days until you get to return. My husband and I visited from the States and spent 3 nights here. The level of service from the moment you pull up to the hotel, to the moment you drive away is exceptional. From the small treats in the evenings to custom messages from the hotel team on our bathroom mirror, everything was intentional and so appreciated. Every member of the team seemed to know our itinerary and would ask us about our day each time we came into the lounge. We cannot wait to return, hopefully sooner than later.",5,2024,03,04
137,Simply the best,"We’ve had the opportunity to stay at done excellent hotels, but this may be the best of the best! The service is impeccable and lovely — not an ounce of pretentiousness. And the hotel itself is so cozy, with beautiful details, from the woodwork to the crown molding to the black and white signature decor. 

It was my husband’s birthday trip, and they upgraded us to a magnificent two level room. We mentioned that we were heading to Paris the next day, and when we got back from dinner, there was a fire going in the fireplace, a lovely note and a personally prepared packet of information with great recommendations for museums and restaurants. Wow - they made us feel so special! 

We only stayed a night but wish it were longer and are already looking forward to returning. A really special place!",5,2024,03,04
137,A home away from home!,"What an absolute gem of an experience in a beautiful hotel. The thing that will absolutely bring us back in the future is the Staff and the service. You can find ""nice"" hotels all around London in ""great locations"" but there are so few times where you can take a uniquely English styled hotel experience + super location next to Buckingham Palace + a discrete staff with very attentive service = a special stay. The rooms are all well appointed - beds very large and comfortable sitting rooms and bathrooms are not tight or cramped and the main library plays a fun role in your entire stay. Snacks are everywhere and again, so are the staff to attend to your needs. My wife and I will definitely be back in 2025 and are looking forward to bringing friends or family. Thank you Connor Burns, Adele and Jonathan for a wonderful stay.",5,2024,02,28
137,Perfection,"Simply one of the finest hotels in the world, full stop!  In terms of staff is there a rating above 10 out of 10?  If so, the staff there would receive it!  The location cannot be beat, Victoria Station minutes away, Belgravia adjacent, a short walk to Buckingham Palace.  What more do you need!",5,2024,02,21
137,Exceptional - couldn’t fault it,"I have been reading about Hotel 41 for years and never thought we would be able to afford to stay. We are not rich people and the cost of two nights in London is a big expense, but we both feel that it was worth it. We have stayed in other top hotels in London, including The Savoy and The Shard, but Hotel 41 was truly exceptional.  Everything about the hotel surpassed our expectations and we hope to return again soon, perhaps with our dog!

While the location, surroundings, food and drink are all amazing, it is the staff that make Hotel 41 so special. We were particularly impressed by Connor’s friendly welcome and by the outstanding care and attention to detail shown by Rory and Esin whenever we were in the lounge.

As a gay couple, we were filled with happiness to find ‘his and his’ slippers in our room, after years of enduring ‘his and hers’ items, this detail going unnoticed in other hotels. The red rose on Valentine’s Day and other little extras in our room were hugely appreciated and we felt completely safe and welcome in the hotel, which hasn’t always been the case.",5,2024,02,16
137,Just fabulous!,"My husband and I had the most magical of weekends staying at Hotel 41.  The location is the best, literally a stones throw away from Buckingham Palace and fabulous restaurants in Mayfair, Belgravia, Chelsea are all easily walkable to.  The service at the hotel was very attentive - nothing was too much trouble.  The staff were warm and friendly and genuinely seemed to care about their guests.  The room was spotless with lots of room and fabulous little touches to enhance the stay.  I would highly recommend and can't wait to go back.",5,2024,02,07
137,Wonderful stay at Hotel 41,"We had a 4 night stay at Hotel 41 last week as a belated treat to celebrate our Ruby Wedding anniversary and it far exceeded all our expectations. The service was exceptional and all the Staff were wonderful, professional and kind. The whole ambiance of the Hotel was perfect for us. The breakfast was the best we have ever had and the Chef's pantry in the Executive Lounge where you could go and help yourself to different types of snacks both hot and cold depending on the time of day was excellent.
We were lucky enough to be given a room upgrade and the room was lovely with absolutely everything we could want or need and the bed was really comfortable.  We really appreciated all the little extra touches including some extra surprise gifts for our anniversary, gifts left on our pillows when they did a turn down service at night, candle left lit in our bathroom, hot water bottle in our bed and a little card with a thought for the day.  All these things and the superb staff just made our whole experience wonderful.
We also had a lovely meal in their sister hotel The Rubens which is next door and we were even escorted by a member of staff through a hidden door in the hotel and taken to the restaurant. The staff there were equally wonderful and the meal superb.
Overall we could not recommend a stay at Hotel 41 highly enough. We really hope we will be able to return.",5,2024,01,30

137,Nothing compares to Hotel 41.,"If you’re looking for a special place and a special experience, this is it! Nothing compares to Hotel 41. Best of the best in London.

137,So special,"This is the place to go if you want to be made to feel special.  It was my partner's birthday during the stay and throughout there were so many extra special touches that made her feel so special.  I won't go into too many more details as I wouldn't want to spoil the surprises, but all the staff in the hotel and the sister hotel next door wished her a happy birthday!
The attention to detail and the willingness to do anything for you makes this place so good.
I cannot recommend Hotel 41 high enough - It is a magical place",5,2024,01,18
137,London’s best kept secret,"Everything about this place oozes effortless style. From being greeted at the door, to being checked in with a glass of fizz in the lounge.
The room was amazing and the fire being on when we came back on a cold night was wonderful.
The staff really made the place and their attentiveness over our cocktails and comfort whilst we ‘plundered the pantry’ to finish off our Saturday night was second to none.
Would highly recommend and have already booked another weekend stay.",5,2024,01,14

137,The perfect place,"From the moment we stepped into Hotel 41 we were made to feel very welcome. We cannot fault anything about this hotel - what makes it special is the staff - they make you feel like royalty.  The breakfast was five star - again, nothing was too much trouble.

We can’t wait to come back! ",5,2024,01,04

The property exudes calm and peace while being nestled in an ideal location just down the road from Buckingham Palace.  It truly feels like an oasis.  The staff is always happy to assist in any manner.  The guest rooms are well appointed with many special treats and touches.  The executive lounge is a warm and welcoming spot to come together or to just relax and read.  Many delicious nibbles and bites offered in late afternoon /evening on a daily basis for guests.  So many wonderful touches.  Truly an experience to remember at Hotel 41!,5,2023,12,27
137,Great Boutique Hotel for those looking for a quiet stay in London.,"Hotel 41 is a true gem for those that like boutique hotels.

137,Hotel 41.,"I chose the hotel for a weekend in London with my wife as it had an exclusive feel and looked a bit different to others we had stayed in. We were not disappointed, it's an amazing place to stay, from the moment we arrived, we received superb service. The room was fantastic, but it was the little touches that made our stay so unforgettable. The cable tidies, the music, night lights, tidying my wife’s make up, ( shes messy when getting ready). I cannot fault a single thing about the hotel, my new favourite in London. 

",5,2023,12,23
137,Perfect ,"Another wonderful stay, everything about 41 is world class. Attentive service but never intrusive, little touches that make you smile. Leave a bit of space to raid the pantry after a busy day in London. Best hotel experience I've ever had - again.",5,2023,12,18

Staying at 41 is ""our special place"" and have been staying here since our honeymoon ten years ago. Over the years, we have stayed in their executive rooms, two level junior suites and on our honeymoon, the amazing conservatory suite. We love the gas fireplaces in many of the rooms and enjoying a cognac the fireplace in the executive lounge.
All of the staff members learn your names very fast and go out of their way to make you feel extra special.

137,Fantastic stay in a fantastic city.,"We had a lovely stay at Hotel 41 a few days ago.

Our little baby girl (9 months old) couldn’t have been made more welcome by all of the staff, which can sometimes be a bit of a worry at the more luxurious hotels!

The breakfast here was a particular joy - the eggs Benedict is incredible.

It would have been nice to have had some Christmas decorations in place being as it was toward the end of November (I think it would have made a nice festive touch).

This hotel feels a lot more intimate than any of the larger 5* hotels in London with the executive lounge being such a lovely quiet and gentle place to relax and have a cocktail.

We ate at the Curry Room next door in the Rubens one of the evenings which was really delicious, they sat us in a nice quiet corner and the waiting staff here were also so lovely toward our little girl!

I also ate a pizza from the food and drink menu the other evening and was a little dissapointed (it felt like a typical cheap oven pizza so this could definitely be improved).

The lift was also seemingly out of order going downstairs to the Curry Room so this does also need looking at.

The valet parking was very smooth and precise which really helped us out.

All together it was a top quality stay at a top quality hotel - we really had a great and enjoyable time, and we will definitely choose Hotel 41 for another one of our London trips.

5* all round!",5,2023,11,27
137,Above and beyond,"Hotel 41 is the epitome of a boutique hotel. If you're looking for an intimate experience, Hotel 41 is sure to meet your expectations. From the moment we walked in the door, every staff made sure we were welcomed and made to feel special and a priority. From a champagne greeting to afternoon tea to evening noshes, we couldn't possibly have ever have gone hungry or thirsty. When we went sight seeing, they prepared a goody bag for us to take along. We had an evening spent in their theater room for a movie, popcorn, and sweet treats. What an experience on such an elegantly, well appointed hotel. I watched one staff polish a door to a high shine and was so impressed - he didn't just wipe it down, he really got it to shine! That to me conveyed what Hotel 41 is all about: commitment to excellence. Thank you to all the staff for making our few days there so memorable.",5,2023,11,24
137,A delightful experience in London !,"This is one of the very best luxury hotels ever ! The location, furniture, quality of beverages and food were awesome.

137,If you are looking for somewhere to stay for a special occasion this is the place.,The best hotel we have stayed in when in London …. The staff and the atmosphere were amazing. We were staying for a very special anniversary and they did everything to make sure it was special. The rooms are superb and comfortable and the food provided was amazing.,5,2023,11,19
137,Another stay another WOW,"It wasnt the first stay at the Hotel 41 and for sure not the last. I travel alot around the world. I‘ve seen many really great hotels but the crew of the 41 really achieved the highest level of service quality. Whats unique whats different to others? The attention to detail! Everyone knows your name / they really invest time to get to know you / they really wanna give you a unique experience. I‘m a gay traveller usually there is no need to mention this fact but this time it is. After the turndown service we received slippers by the bedside with a bag stiched with His or Hers (thats what my parents received) we, both men, receiced twice His. That kind of attention that feeling of beeing taken care of was really unique. It touched my heart on a really special way and will stay forever in my mind. Thank you!",5,2023,11,19
137,Business trip ,"Came for a business trip and had a brilliant stay! Couldn’t recommend this hotel more, was lovely to come back to such a clean and welcoming environment after a long days work. Staff were also brilliant! Will be staying again ",5,2023,11,16
137,PERFECT AT ALL,"It is not necessary to write more than everything is PERFECT there. There was nothing less than perfect at this excellent boutique Hotel.
It was 3 days stay and the whole family says the same thing
We'll visit London again but stay there absolutely.",5,2023,11,15
137,The Definition of Excellence in London!,"To these well-travelled guests, Hotel 41 is the new standard-bearer for the five-star experience. We have stayed in larger hotels, more expensive hotels, and newer, hipper hotels, but my wife and I have never experienced such sincere, friendly, and genuine hospitality and effortless comfort and luxury as we received on a recent nine-night stay in London.

Hotel 41 is run as a private hotel with only 28 rooms and a central lounge that functions as social club, dining room and lobby, which lends the whole affair an air of intimacy and exclusivity. However, it is the meticulously trained and knowledgeable staff that makes one’s stay truly exceptional and memorable. They really get to know their guests, and always endeavor to delight with kindness and professionalism that borders on ESP. We were particularly impressed with how much attention was paid to our pace and rhythm as travelers. If we had a long day planned, breakfast appeared almost instantly, all obstacles were cleared well in advance, and we were off on the day’s adventures without delay. If we had a more languid schedule, we could linger over coffee and tea, chat with other guests and generally soak in the carefully curated ambience. We frequently ended our days with a hot pot of fresh mint tea in front of the fireplace, casually learning about our hosts and making new friends. Service is always the height of professionalism, yet tempered by old-fashioned friendliness. There is nothing stuffy or snobbish about the Hotel 41 experience – just a wonderful generosity of spirit from everyone that extends from check-in to the farewell bag of treats that we received the night before our departure. I would love to commend specific members of staff for their care, but I would inevitably leave someone out, and that would be unfair, as everyone we encountered was so good to us. 

The hotel is stunning, consisting of a private entrance off Buckingham Palace Road and a single, fifth floor level. The central lounge is exactly the kind of updated club room that one hopes to find in London – a skylit library with a lovely, eclectic collection of antiques and soft surfaces that invite guests to sit back and relax. This space is open and staffed for guests all day and night, providing a luxurious enclave for postcard writing, dining, and late-evening reading. A fully stocked pantry is available to all guests throughout the day and evening for snack raids and pick-me-ups, and breakfast and dinner are available daily. We found the food to be excellent, with breakfast done to absolute perfection and some of the best fish dishes either of us have ever enjoyed (no small point, as we are from Seattle, an area known for its fresh seafood). Cocktail service is similarly exquisite from staff members who are as skilled with a shaker as they are with every other detail of hotel life.

Our room was a luxurious and extremely tranquil getaway from the hustle and bustle that is Central London. We chose an Executive King room, which included a sumptuously dressed bed, seating area and writing desk, as well as ample room for storage. The décor is bright, but warm and cossetting, with an elegant black and white motif, and a charming collection of prints on the walls. The bath is luxurious, featuring both a walk-in rain shower and a soaking tub/shower combination, tiled in marble with classic Lefroy Brooks fixtures. The housekeeping staff kept our room in perfect order throughout our stay, magically making it up according to our schedule and providing a delightful turn-down service with carefully curated treats each evening. 

To illustrate the delight that Hotel 41’s staff takes in the details, we had mentioned that we would be travelling to the Warner Bros. Studios to tour the Harry Potter sets early in our trip. The night before our scheduled outing, one of the staff members showed up with a tray of custom-made macarons that the pastry chef had created in full Harry Potter regalia to celebrate our tour. We had a number of similar experiences throughout our stay, and they helped make the trip truly memorable. We felt appreciated and cared for at every turn.

These days there are plenty of hotels, particularly in London, that are famous for their grand designer lobbies and willingness to redecorate entire floors to satisfy the whims of visiting dignitaries and the glitterati. What they achieve is amazing, but one can’t help but feel that it is to the detriment of other, more normal, guests. By keeping things small and intimate, Hotel 41 avoids this sense of hierarchy, treating everyone who enters its doors to the same levels of effortless comfort and delight. There is an experienced intuition at play here that simply cannot be imitated or instilled without the right people, the right training and loads of experience. Hotel 41 gets everything right, and it does so with good humor and grace. As we look to increase our travels to London and surrounding areas, it is wonderful to know that we have found a resting place that feels like home.

137,An intimate gem in the heart of Westminster,"We visit London regularly and were delighted to discover Hotel 41. It is a boutique hotel with limited rooms in the heart of Westminster - a stones throw from Buckingham Palace. The rooms were clean and spacious. The staff was professional, efficient, and friendly. Meals were a delight in the beautiful main lounge area. Guests are pampered by the service and availability of snacks and other goodies in the pantry area. We would highly recommend Hotel 41 and definitely plan to book our next stay there.",5,2023,10,28
137,"Excellent, as always!","Once again I’ve had the pleasure of staying at 41.

From the welcome when I walked through the door, the ambience, service and sheer quality of the establishment were so satisfying. Having arrived and sat down to drinks and canapés, we settled down in the Executive Lounge after our journey, before heading to our  rooms close by to relax before going out for the evening meal.

The Turn-down service ensured that, having had my luggage taken to my room, and having freshened-up before going for dinner, the bed was warmed by a hot-water bottle, the fire was burning and music was playing upon my return.

Adele, the Resident Manager and her staff catered to our every need, with Gabriel attentively making sure that our drinks were topped up.

Having slept so well, we were greeted by the ever-smiling Esin in the morning, and we had an amazing Full English breakfast , with Shadrack serving our coffee, and Marlen the Deputy Manager making sure  that we were happy and sated. 

Overall, as always, a first-rate stay in this excellent hotel, the only downside being that it was just for the one night. 

I eagerly anticipate my next visit, and hope to see you all again very soon!",5,2023,10,28
137,Great Vacation,"We thoroughly enjoyed our recent stay at Hotel 41.  Every staff member that we came in contact with was ever so helpful.  I would like to thank Nishan for all the work he did prior to our arrival.  He recommended and arranged all of our tours, restaurants reservations, shows, etc., and secured the tickets prior to our arrival. His expertise was invaluable.  Our morning breakfast was handled expertly by Shadrack; he was efficient and an absolute delight. Throughout the day we were greeted by Esin who was most helpful and so pleasant and sweet.  We cannot say enough wonderful words of praise for the staff.
The hotel facility is lovely.  It is truly an oasis when you want to escape the hustle and bustle of London.  It is beautiful, clean, and tranquil.",5,2023,10,24
137,No better place in London to stay,"This was our 10th stay at Hotel 41 since 2013.  It only gets the better with each stay.  From the moment we arrive a little sleepy from our overnight flight to the last breakfast before heading to the airport the service levels are unparallel to any hotel in the world.  As I may have said in previous review, any hotel with a button on the phone that says ""Whatever, Whenever"" is a place you must stay.  We will be back again (and again).  

The entire staff always has a smile on their face and treat you like family.",5,2023,10,24
137,Recurring theme,"Back to 41 again, and how lovely it was to return.  When you haven’t stayed for a few months, you tend to forget the amount of pleasure you feel when the greeting comes from each and every member of the team who approach with a welcoming smile. 
And so it begins: the experience of being a treasured guest at every moment of contact, your every wish carried out and in many cases, anticipated and a choice offered.  This is five- star hospitality as it should be, as the prestigious Forbes rating denotes.  
There are many accounts of the quality of the Team, the Executive Lounge, the impeccable housekeeping, the wonderful quirkiness of the building and the Plunder the Pantry offering (which was recommended to me by an American guest who was unaware that I was a regular, and was indicative of the appreciation of other guests who were happily tucking in) – all of these.  You have to experience it to understand how special it is.  You could choose to book a different hotel with a plethora of large suites to choose from, but that’s a trade-off for the loss of the personality of staying in this socially historic building just opposite that other Palace, where you can walk around the corner to the front gates and tell from the flagpole if the King is in residence.  This kind of history is hard to beat.",5,2023,10,19
137,The best of the best,"Hotel 41 can not be beaten. It is so comfortable and relaxing with attention to every detail. We have stayed many times and will continue to do so. We feel so at home in the lounge, where we enjoy the friendly atmosphere, and a laugh with the staff. Satish, Esin Rory and Gabrielle are just priceless.",5,2023,10,18
137,The most fabulous hotel in the heart of London.,"An exceptional boutique hotel next door to Buckingham Palace and 2 minutes from Victoria.

Only 28 rooms, each beautifully appointed and very, very quiet, despite being in the centre of London.

The staff provide 5 star plus service from booking to departure. They are friendly, gracious and extremely helpful.

A perfect oasis for a short or long stay.

Delicious breakfasts. Snacks on display and a magnificent range of wines, cocktails and spirits.",5,2023,10,15
137,Practically Perfect In Every Way,"The ideal London hotel. The staff lead the charge in creating the charm, elegance, and character of this wonderful respite. They work in tandem to create incredible bespoke experiences for their guests, taking care to understand our personal and practical needs, while enriching our experiences with their own personal flare. It was such a pleasure to spend time with each and every one we met there, and sincerely appreciate their attentiveness, thoughtfulness, and creativity. 

The beds and amenities are modern and comfortable, and the rooms, halls, and lounge exude cozy luxury. The lounge spoils guests with day-round availability of snacks, and there are fresh scones, jam and clotted cream after 2pm...skip the mid-day nap and rest up for your evening out by having scones and a pot of tea on a comfy sofa.

The experience provided at Hotel 41 is reason enough to visit London, and we will back as soon as we can!",5,2023,10,12
137,Very unique and memorable hotel.,"I've been to many 5-star luxury hotels, but Hotel 41 left a very special impression.
The entrance to the hotel was not large, but the hotel staff, who seemed to have been waiting for us from the moment we opened the door and walked in, welcomed us, guided us to a special lounge, served us welcome tea, and we received check-in service while eating a small cake. I was very impressed that the hotel already knew who we were and provided service before I even said my name.
The hotel room was very comfortable, luxurious, and clean, and they provided cleaning service in the morning and evening, as well as a small gift.
Also, every time we came back from sightseeing in London, they welcomed us at the door, so we felt like we were coming home every time.
All of the bedding at Hotel 41 was extremely comfortable, all the staff knew us, and we felt welcomed every time we met. When eating and drinking tea, he always came close to us to check that we were being treated well.
What impressed me the most was that we had briefly mentioned that we would be visiting Oxford at the time of check-in, and they remembered that fact and commented on our tour and paid attention to it.
We were proud of our choice to stay at Hotel 41 at every turn and feel so lucky to have stayed at Hotel 41.
This hotel is truly one of the best and a gem among many London hotels. Our trip to London was perfect thanks to this hotel.
Even if I come back, I definitely want to stay at this hotel.
And thank you so much.",5,2023,10,07
137,Exceptional Service,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 for three nights while in London. The hotel is wonderfully situated for exploring the city.  The room was lovely.  It was very quiet and the bed and pillows made falling asleep easy after a day of adventuring.  The shower had plenty of hot water and great water pressure.  

The best thing about the hotel is the personal service.  The staff was eager to make sure we enjoyed our stay and our experience in London.  When we arrived after an overnight flight, the concierge saw to it that we got the best coffees to keep us awake and going throughout the day.  We were even able to check into our room early!  For the hotel happy hour, the server brought us canapés and salty snacks gratis.  The concierge was always eager to offer help and suggestions about our planned itinerary.  We were so well cared for!  

There’s also a lovely rooftop bar. We enjoyed sitting outside watching the world go by and talking with our server about life in London. Absolutely incredible experience at Hotel 41.  We will definitely go back.",5,2023,10,03
137,Stay here for a wonderful experience ,"I've stayed at many hotels, 5 stars among them over the years, but this place in terms of furnishings, and exceptional service absolutely stands out. In a word, it is a fabulous place and in a great central location as well. You can usually find something to critique wherever you go but we couldn't here.  From the time we arrived to when we left the service was 5 star plus. Consider this for your next trip to London as we will on our next trip...I can't imagine staying anywhere else after being here",5,2023,09,23
137,Hotel 41 stay was excellent!,"My spouse and I stayed here for one night in mid September 2023. We loved it. We arrived into Heathrow from east coast U.S. at 6:30 a.m. and took the Tube To Victoria Station. From there it was about a 5 minute walk to the Hotel. We had emailed a couple months in  advance to ask about an early check-in. We got a quick reply with an offer to leave our bags and relax in the Executive Lounge. Arriving around 1000, we received exactly what we were told. The Executive Lounge was excellent! We enjoyed coffees, ordered greek yoghurts with raspberry compote (delicious) and very soon after our room was ready. The staff at check in and in the Executive Lounge were great. Our room (Junior Suite) right outside the Executive Lounge was top notch. A very large bathroom with both a large shower and a separate large bathtub were welcome after the overnight flight. Our room had a nice sitting area on the entrance floor and the large bed and  bathroom were actually up a set of stairs. This added to the roomy feel. The large windows in the sitting area and the skylight in the bedroom both had remote control blinds so we were able to take a nap…appreciated. The location of Hotel 41 afforded us the opportunity to walk through St. James Park as well as Hyde Park to see Buckingham Palace, Westminster Cathedral, Thames River, Kensington Gardens and outside view of Kensington Palace as well as Albert Memorial and outside of Albert Hall. The staff at Hotel 41 arranged for a taxi to Paddington Station (just 2.4 miles but with luggage we opted for transport. We arrived in plenty of tome to catch GWR train to Chipping Camden and the start of our Cotswold Way walk. We definitely enjoyed our Hotel 41 stay and thank the staff.",5,2023,09,21
137,Simply the best of the best.,"By far the best hotel I have EVER stayed in. The service was second to none. I stay in London often and often treat myself to a superior room or a suite. Their Executive King room trumped anywhere I have ever stayed including exclusive chains like the Baglioni and St Pancras Renaissance. 
The staff were simply amazing. They made sure to know both my husband and I by name our entire stay.  The little touches in the room just went above and beyond. It was truly an experience. 
Special shout out to Shân who was absolutely lovely.",5,2023,09,20
137,Unique experience - feels like staying at a friend in his old Englisch home. Highly recommended.,"Excellent! Very unique experience. Not your typical hotel with a gracious foyer or reception. Feels more like staying at your friends old English home. Very cozy. Unbelievable friendly, vigilant and helpful staff. Great location. Lots of attractions and restaurants/pubs in walking distance. Hanging out in their executive lounge provides tranquillity and brings you back in time. The same applies to the rooms. Breakfast and drinks are outstanding. They even have a little rooftop terrace with seating and a bar. The only thing, though: I am 6 feet tall and not all of the sitting areas in the beautiful executive lounge are spacious enough to sit comfortably. One bathroom in our room felt more like I have to put it on rather than being able to walk in. Given the otherwise outstanding experience I personally looked at it as a minor issue. After all it’s an old Englisch house and not constructed with nowadays needs in mind which partly contributes  to this great and unique experience. It would not keep me from returning for a few romantic days. Clearly a 5 + star experience.",5,2023,09,17
137,Perfection,Just returned from a 3rd visit to Hotel 41 as was celebrating a big birthday. From the minute you step foot into the downstairs foyer you are treated like royalty. All the staff are so helpful & nothing is too much trouble. I do have to give Connor a special mention here as he was who we all dealt with the most. They  arranged canapés & champagne on the roof top bar before we went out. You actually don’t even need to go anywhere as there is always something out for you to eat! We all can’t wait to return & are already planning our next visit.,5,2023,09,08
137,Wonderful experience.,"We loved this hotel.  The staff treated us like royalty the moment we walked through the door. Hotel 41 is a boutique hotel with only 28 rooms.  The staff’s attention to detail is remarkable.  The rooms were nicely appointed and the black and white decor is very attractive .  Upon arrival, we were taken to the Executive Lounge where everything happens.  Breakfast, tea time and dinner is served in the lounge.  Our breakfast was included with our reservation.  All other food was complimentary.  The only complaint we have is that it was not made clear that the beverages are not included (ie juice, coffee, tea, soda).  It was our understanding that only alcoholic beverages were not included.  There were four of us present when the amenities were explained.  I don’t believe all four of us could have misunderstood this detail.  We were surprised when we checked out to see charges for beverages ( they are expensive).  Even with the miscommunication, we will still highly recommend Hotel 41.",5,2023,09,07
137,Brilliant!,Outstanding service. Excellent location opposite Buckingham Palace. Have stayed twice and will return. It’s the little touches like staff knowing your name that make this hotel stand out. Breakfast was fabulous too.,5,2023,09,02
137,Service with a capital S!,"The service at this hotel is AMAZING!  It is in a great location, and the rooms are really nice, but what separates it is the service!  From the welcome champagne to the day long snacks, they really could not be any more accommodating.  Our stay in London was too short this time but would definitely return to the 41 on a future trip….five stars all the way!",5,2023,09,01
137,Outstanding Service In an Elegant Boutique Hotel,"The most superb experience we've ever had at a 5-star property.  Outstanding personalized service, beautiful accommodations, and amazingly attentive staff.  We were greeted by name by each staff person, provided super helpful suggestions for day trips and dinner cruise, and made to feel incredibly special.  One of the best boutique properties we've ever experienced - and we've been to a lot! ",5,2023,08,28
137,Excellent Experience,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for two nights and found the experience to be perfect. From the seemless check in, to the fantastic staff. Our room was extremely well appointed and lacked for no amenities. The Executive Lounge was wonderful, and our breakfasts were top notch.",5,2023,08,27
137,Absolutely stunning hotel,"Hotel 41 is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed!  The rooms are absolutely gorgeous.  The staff is UNBELIEVABLY helpful, courteous, welcoming and accommodating.  We will definitely return and will recommend this hotel every time someone asks us about our trip to London.  This one should not be missed!  ",5,2023,08,26
137,50th birthday celebration,"Stayed for my wife’s 50th birthday, from the moment we arrived to the minute we left everything we experienced was just totally flawless, from  the staff to the whole experience of the hotel was just outstanding, the staff go above and beyond making your stay special, by far the best hotel we have stayed in and we will definitely be returning, well done hotel 41 you deserve all the accolades that come your way 👏👏👏",5,2023,08,26
137,Hotel 41 Is What Every London Hotel Should be Modeled On,"This is hands down my wife's and I favorite hotel (and now even our 3 children)! We've been there 3 times now and It's pure English Class with the best service that we have ever received anywhere in the world. The rooms are impeccable and the thoughtfulness  and attention to detail of the staff is exquisite. 

Also, their executive lounge (the heart of the hotel) is one of the most coziest and relaxing places we have ever had a meal or drinks. It made me feel like at anytime I could turn my head and see Sherlock Holmes in a corner sofa drinking some brandy attempting to solve his next case. 

All that to say, if you want an unforgettable time in London, Hotel 41 is a must! ",5,2023,08,20
137,Suberb and welcoming !,5 star service ! From the arrival to the departure. Very impressive. Connor was so kind and congenial.

137,The No 41 experience ,"Second time at this hotel and definitely won't be the last! A luxurious stay from start to finish . Beautiful rooms,wonderful staff and such a calm , tranquil atmosphere. Fully deserving of its reputation as the best in the UK.",5,2023,08,12
137,Not our cup of tea by a long shot!,"I have relied on TripAdvisor to book hotels and restaurants for almost 20 years. We even sometimes select cities to visit simply based on the hotel. As such and because I so rely on reviews that I relate to, I want to provide a clear picture of what you get at Hotel 41. We have previously stayed at The Edgerton House (another Red Carnation hotel in London) and the Ritz Carlton in London - and we absolutely loved both. In fact, we so enjoyed our time at The Edgerton House and after speaking with the manager there, we wanted to book another hotel in their collection.

We extremely disliked the ""atmosphere"" as well as the teeny tiny rooms, extremely narrow hallways, and limited common space at Hotel 41. And no one, except for the gentleman at the lobby desk one evening, ever asked us if we liked our room or the hotel - just baffling!!!

1. ""Atmosphere"" - There was absolutely no joy or laughter or fun to be had anywhere in this space. Everyone spoke in hushed tones. When I asked people at reception if this was the ""normal"" atmosphere, they said yes, all the time and this is what their clients want and expect. Think of Downton Abbey - upstairs only.

2.  ""Food"" - We travel for food and are overly critical but the food was just fair. What we did not like was the push to buy drinks (coffee, tea, soda, water, alcohol) as soon as breakfast was done since everything cost $. An example is when I was feeling a bit under the weather and a receptionist said she would order me some tea to make me feel better -  I said sure and how thoughtful! $9.50 later I thought less of her ""thoughtfulness"".

3. ""Rooms"" - We booked an Executive King. We travel extensively and I must say this was one of the smallest rooms we have ever had with a tiny bathroom (no room for any makeup bags only a sink), and a shower so small and narrow I could not even bend over to shave my legs - and I am a petite person.

4. ""Location"" - not a pretty area and a long walk to everywhere except the stables of Buckingham Palace (which are not pretty) and which the hotel faces.

And so, fortunately, there are many types of hotels and options open to all of us when we travel. I just wanted to provide an honest review of our experience at Hotel 41 - the 5th floor of a building ""hotel"".  For some people, it is perfect, but for us, it is not our cup of tea and we would never consider staying there again.  
",1,2023,08,11
137,Excellent,Excellent staff and service food and location brilliant rooms really lovely and decorated to a high standard wonderful stay all round hopefully will be back soon thank you to all for making us feel very welcome ,5,2023,08,11
137,Hotel 41. Highly recommend for a London stay,"Hotel 41 is an amazing hotel. Great location, very friendly and helpful / accommodating staff, comfortable rooms I would never think twice at always staying at hotel 41 when in London. Hotel 41 makes you feel at home. Highly recommend. BTW: Great snack bar in the Fabilous lobby ",5,2023,08,05
137,Perfect,"We’ve just returned from a two night stay at 41 - where stayed over 20 times.

It’s hard to des rube just how good the event is. I call it an event because every member of staff is consistently brilliant, helpful and friendly. Many staff have been there years and it’s like coming home - but nicer.

41 is a boutique hotel - rather like an exclusive club - quite old fashioned but in a brilliant way. The staff are simply exceptional. Nothing is too much trouble. The executive lounge is perfect in its tranquility and style. Adele and Marlen are stalwarts who make everything perfect. 

There is a ‘grab’ bar of sweets during the day, scones in the afternoon, various dishes / cakes during the evening all complimentary. It’s annexed to the Rubén’s hotel so the extent of beverages and food available is immense. The rooms are uniformly stylish and always quiet and welcoming.It’s in a brilliant position to get to most places. 

I cannot speak more highly of 41 and in particular the staff. We cannot wait to return.",5,2023,08,04
137,Worth it,I think I have reviewed 41 on other stays but I am not sure I said the following: It is worth the premium you pay simply for the service and the wonderful people that provide it. We actually miss the friends we have made on the staff. And I am not sure there is a better location of a hotel in London to reach everything. Victoria Station two blocks in one direction and Buckingham two blocks in the other.,5,2023,07,27
137,Just like Home.. without the work,"This is a home away from home experience.  If you want a big hotel vibe with loads of action go next door to their sister hotel.  We LOVED our experience here.  The staff were like family by the time we left.  From check in to the incredible bar/waitstaff you literally are spoiled.  Rooms are well appointed with big waters, beautiful soap and lovely little presents on your bed in the evening.  The location is the best close to the changing of the guard, and Buckingham.  The hotel has a cute small rooftop bar that you can have a cocktail and just get away from the chaos of the city.  If I return I will stay here as it felt like home.",5,2023,07,26
137,The Best Hotel In The World. Period.,"This is the best hotel in the world!

We've stayed at the Burj Al Arab in Dubai, Pendry New York and The Savoy. None of these have come close to what we received at Hotel 41, pure luxury.

As soon as you walk through the front doors, the pleasure begins.
Your bags disappear and you're escorted upto the Executive Lounge where you are treated with a glass of Champagne. Instantly every staff member knows your name and you're given time to relax and unwind from the outside world. Once settled, the staff, in our case Andrea, guides you to your room. We were very lucky to be given the Monarch Suite. 

OMG, the Monarch Suite, what a suite! From the Queen size bed, two bathrooms and lounge and every extra you need for a stay. It oozes lush.

Once you get over the room, you'll head back out to the Lounge where you'll be waited on hand and foot. The attention you'll receive is second to none. As soon as your glass is half full, someone will be over to fill it.

The unlimited pantry was delicious. From Jude's ice cream (had a lot of that) to afternoon tea, popcorn, crisps and cakes, it was hard to leave the hotel because of this.

We've not had a night's sleep like this for a long time, silence and sleeping on a bed of air. Refreshed for what comes next.

Breakfast. What can I say about breakfast, it was out of this world. Best quality food in the perfect surroundings.

Now to the staff at H41. They exceeded expectations and they can't do anything more for you even if they tried. Big thanks to Andrea, Rory, Nishan downstairs and the breakfast man (Indian guy, can't remember his name, sorry) for their care.

Only one place I'll be booking for when we come back to London. H41.

Mr and Mrs K.",5,2023,07,24
137,Best hotel we have been to!,"By far the nicest hotel we have ever been to. The staff is super friendly and will help you with anything you need. Yes, it is expensive, but it is worth every cent. The hotel is super quiet and you can sleep all day if you would want to. The location is perfect, near Buckingham Palace, walking distance to Harrods and Bond Street so great for shopping. The interior is not boutique hotel modern, but very old school English. Can't wait to be back! ",5,2023,07,21
137,The best of its kind!,"We’ve just returned from a seven night stay at Hotel 41. We had a split level suite with a king bed that suited our needs perfectly. The attention to detail was evident everywhere, not only in the facilities and amenities, but also in the little touches such as daily replenished fresh fruit and the daily “treats” left on the bed at turndown. 

The bathroom featured INSTANTLY available hot water, more than ample water pressure (you never realize how important this is unless you don’t have it), heated towels and ample space for toiletries for two. The bathtub was of a size to encourage basking and the shower was both versatile and intuitive in operation — a delicate balance seldom achieved. 

Shortly after your arrival, most, if not all, of the staff will know you by name. At any meal, you simply order, eat, and leave. The “Executive Lounge” changes identity throughout the day. In the morning, it is a breakfast room, during the day, it doubles as a lounge and a dining room. The available “snacks” are replaced at 8:00 PM by an array of heavier fare, all included in the price of the room.

A welcome feature of the Executive Lounge is the hushed tones the ambiance encourages. Normally, in a crowded dining area, diners must speak in raised voices to be heard above the din. Not so at Hotel 41! By magical mutual agreement, even when crowded, diners speak in hushed tones, audible only to those at their own table. I can’t tell you how much I appreciated this!

And while I’m on the subject of the lounge, let me relate the following. I am an early riser,  my wife — well, not so much. Each morning, I would perform my daily ablutions and descend to the lounge to read and quaff a pre-breakfast cup of coffee or two. Or three. By the third day, I no longer had to order the coffee. It would magically appear with milk and no sugar — just as ordered the first two days of our stay — within minutes of my arrival. THAT’S the kind of personal touch that you can expect at Hotel 41!

I could go on and on — perhaps I already have — but I feel I must conclude by touching on a few caveats suggested by our stay. Hotel 41 is a boutique hotel of 28 rooms. It is not all things to all people. Its very nature precludes some of what might be seen as the advantages of a large hotel of analogous repute. Most significant for us for hotels in its price range was the lack of a dedicated concierge service with fingers in all the local pies, with the “ins” necessary to get last minute tickets, with the clout to cop otherwise unavailable reservations at the best restaurants. The lack of a powerhouse concierge service would not be worthy of mention had it not been for their recommendation of a supposedly “Michelin starred” restaurant for our departure dinner. We should have checked, but didn’t, so that’s on us. The recommended restaurant indeed appears in the Michelin GUIDE, but it was instantly apparent that not only had it not acquired even one star but also that it had no aspirations to do so. 

That said, Hotel 41 is by far the best small hotel we’ve ever stayed in. When we return to London we will be sure to stay there, particularly now that we are acutely aware of its limitations. It is a wonderful hotel that anticipates and caters to your every whim.",5,2023,07,17
137,"Always stay here when I am in London. Great service, impeccable hotel.","We have stayed at Hotel 41 for the third time. And there is a reason why we always come back. Feels like a quaint Hotel in a large city in the perfect spot. 

We spent our anniversaries here for the third time. Always feels special. The rooms are wonderful, staff is amazing and location you can’t beat. 

Even the scent of the amazing hotel is something I love. We always think of Hotel 41 as the place to go for a special occasion. Even our happy anniversary pillows and a yummy cake to celebrate. The little things matter in an age where service is hard to come by. 

Highly recommend. And always will come back. Thank you for making it wonderful.",5,2023,07,14
137,The best hotel ever,"The best hotel i have ever stayed! Simoly the best! Complimentary pantries during all day long (ice creams, lindts chocolates, candies - canapes from 5pm to 7pm and many dishes/goodies from 8pm to 1am), many perks at our room - very cosy place, amazing bed and pillows. Two options to our bath separately ; bathtub and a shower. The breakfast is also incredible, many options. One of the highest point, the icing on the cake: Eder and Pedro , completely wonderful hosts - polite, helpful, always smiling. Their hospitality turned our experience into a marvellous experience. ",5,2023,07,09
137,What a FANTASTIC experience ,"We visited for my birthday and from start to finish were treated to such an amazing stay, with everything thought of it was a wonderful place to be, we also loved going for drinks in the downstairs bar which also serves sushi. Picturesque hotel!",5,2023,07,06
137,Hidden Gem Near Buckingham Palace,"This is a wonderful boutique hotel found on the fifth floor of the same building as the Rubens. They give very personalized attention—from showing us the room details to helping us with getting a take away breakfast for our early morning flight. We had a gorgeous room and thoroughly enjoyed ""plundering the pantry"" each night!",5,2023,07,04
137,Wonderful stay in London,"This boutique hotel is truly excellent!  It is small and the service is very personal.  It is better than some Ritz Carltons I have stayed in.  The staff could not have been more pleasant.  It is quiet and not one of those places to be seen in.  Given how hectic London is, it was truly an Oasis.  It is a bit expensive but we do not travel to London often.",5,2023,06,30
137,The Best,"I have stayed at some of the best hotels around the world and I must admit that it takes a lot to impress me.  Hotel 41 not only impressed but surpassed all expectations.  

The hotel has only 28 rooms all on one floor close to Buckingham Palace.  The hotel has the feel of an exclusive private club without an air of pretentiousness.  Our room was very very nice with bed sheets and pillows that were a joy to experience each night

But it was the service that truly set this hotel apart from others.   Individuals like Eder, in guest services, went out of his way to ensure that we had all that we needed.  He took the time to personally help us pick up an item that we needed as opposed to just providing directions to the pharmacy.  This was a hint of the type of service that we experienced",5,2023,06,29
137,TIME TO RELAX and be SPOILED!!,"I chose this hotel because it was part of the a Leading Hotel of the World.  Upon arrival I have to be honest I was SO surprised at how tiny the check in area was. No lobby, etc, but stay with me.  We were warmly welcomed and escorted upstairs for check in.. Checkin in is literally in their small cute dining lounge. Again because we travel a ton this not the traditional expectation.   It took a minute ( about 20)  for me to adjust.  Our room was not read yet  as we had arrived at 8 am.  We decided to relax in this lounge/eating area and have breakfast. It was at this moment when I started to ""get"" the reason this was a Leading hotel.  First we had the loveliest Spanish girl check us in.
When we sat for breakfast we were welcomed with a glass of champagne and then spoiled with attention.  Rory suggested we try the apple ginger shot to get our day going and then we sat back and had the most relaxing long enjoyable breakfast.  We were exhausted from our overnight flight so it was so perfect to not be rushed and enjoy tea and a fab breakfast.  We had two rooms and one was ready early 11 am so it was exciting to get to check in and nap.
The rooms are very classy.  There was a fireplace, nice couch comfy bed and really nice soaps/waters etc.  All the nice extra touches and details were appreciated.  At night they would do fun things like leave lavender spray or other items on your pillow. 
Our second room was a suite as you see in their advertising pictures.  It was also nicely appointed.  The only thing that would steer me away from booking this room is that if you struggle with stairs ( bedroom in a loft type area) or if your over 6ft 2 the ceilings may be a bit low for you. My husband had no issue but if your taller it will be tight.  Other than that you can't go wrong with either room.
Now, what makes this 5 star?  The staff!!!! They are amazing.  The coziness of the place turned on its charm.  Instead of going to other bars/pubs our two daughters ( 20's) wanted to have pre dinner and post dinner cocktails there. Did I mention the cute fridge with ice cream cups you could have at anytime?   It was such a nice quiet chill environment after a hectic day out sightseeing. They have a great little rooftop deck which is fun for cocktails.  I loved all the little snacks anytime of day, from chips, candies etc.  Rory was the BEST he was so attentive to all as were Alex, Dermo and the list goes on.  Our housekeeping staff were amazing our room was always perfect. THANK YOU. The best part of this little hotel is that it is ONLY for the guests so no one random is in your hotel.  I literally saw a woman walk into the lounge with her robe to get a late night snack it was amazing!  This is the most relaxing EASY hotel I have stayed at.  It is great if you want to reconnect with a loved one, honeymoon or just get away from the craziness.  If you need more action they have a sister hotel next door with the big bar etc but it is SO nice to come back to Hotel 41 after and know it will be zen after your busy day!   Thank you to ALL the staff at Hotel 41.  You made our stay so special. ",5,2023,06,23
137,Perfect boutique hotel in London,"The wonderful staff make this hotel- they couldn’t do enough for us +++. The signature scent is devine and permeates throughout the hôtel. Wonderfully comfortable bed, fabulous breakfast. Reception and dining area - gorgeous. Complimentary snacks 24/7, scones in the pm and champagne on arrival. Great location. Couldn’t fault anything. Lovely rooftop area",5,2023,06,22
137,Hotel 41 - London ,"Hotel 41 is an incredibly special hotel. Truly a jewel in London! The rooms are warm, charming, and unique to the wonderful property. We are eyeing the conservatory suite for our next stay! A night under the stars! More importantly to us, as boutique hotel, guests become family members. The Hotel 41 team is amazing. They treat you like family, welcoming you as if they’ve known you for a long time. Every time we left on an outing and returned to the hotel, team members asked about our day and engaged in genuine conversation. We also never wanted for anything. We never wanted to leave! Really. Highly recommend. We will return. Thank you to the Hotel 41 team!",5,2023,06,19
137,The essence of traditional British hospitality service in its finest quality.,"I can't tell you enough about this jewel across the street from Buckingham palace, and I am a spoiled brat, staying at Ritz Carltons, Four Seasons, etc. In addition to all amenities that you get at a fine hotel of that level, it has all the character that one could imagine watching TV series like the Crown, including its fine hospitality service. It is located on the last floor of a six story late 19th century building, with its own entrance and door man. There is a lot of privacy in all areas. There is a private club lounge that serves fine snacks and drinks almost 24 h. day. There is a butler that takes care of you and everyone knows your name. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone that goes to London for a special occasion or to dive into the cultural experience. My kids that went for the fist time absolutely loved it. I go more often and this is where I will stay from now on. Roof top terrace is very cute and the food is delish. It is mid range price for London standards but it fills like a fine one.",5,2023,06,19
137,Highlight of our trip!,"We stayed here for a mother-daughter trip to London. From beginning to end, we were amazed at the service and accommodations. The Executive Lounge area was the hub for meals, tea/beverages, and a place to relax and snack. We ate breakfast there daily and it was delicious and plentiful. They also offered a roof top area that we enjoyed amazing sunset views. The location was convenient and we walked most places including a bus tour that we caught a few blocks away. My daughter turned 18 and the staff really made her feel special with cards/notes, red velvet cake, and a gift. It was a very unique and overall exceptional 5 star experience. I would 100% recommend and would stay here again in the future.",5,2023,06,18
137,Can we say incredible!!!!,We visited London and chose Hotel 41 and can we say pampered and covered in luxury and caring staff!  Everyone made sure our stay was perfect and we had everything we needed in this boutique hotel right next to Buckingham Palace!  Just do yourself a favor and stay there!!!,5,2023,06,18
137,London Holiday,The hotel is amazing and the service exceptional. A beautiful stately hotel in a great location conveniently placed to access Victoria station.  The breakfast is in lovely old world setting and the quality of the food is fresh and prepared according to your request.  The rooms are also maintained to a high standard and there are no tell tale marks of wear and tear. The staff also take note of what you may have told them and we arrived back from Wicked show to have a message written on our mirror hoping we enjoyed the show along with a couple of macaroons with the Wicked logo upon them.  Just one of the special touches to enhance our stay.,5,2023,06,14
137,Spoiled by the best staff ever!,"Exceedingly attentive, friendly, helpful, and professional staff, from top to bottom. 
The room was clean, had a very comfortable bed, and excellent A/C.
We felt at home here in London for 6 nights.
Would definitely stay again!!",5,2023,06,11
137,Perfect (again),"I stayed with my son for a couple of nights.  The staff were, as usual,  the shining light of the hotel. Nothing is too much trouble for them - always friendly and very helpful. Bedrooms are immaculate and breakfast is top notch.  Another return visit is planned …",5,2023,06,11
137,Exceptional place to stay in London!,"It was my husband’s birthday and I treated him to 2 nights at Hotel 41. We were not disappointed as the room was superb, the staff genuinely pleased to see us and the breakfast was plentiful. A lovely haven not far from Buckingham Palace. You are greeted with a glass of champagne the minute you walk in to register! Even after coming back from a celebratory meal we had a cup of tea in the lounge and the staff produced a little cake beautifully presented with a candle for him! While I was there I booked a whiskey tasting experience which was very informative and they even gave us a little cake and a glass of champagne with there compliments as it was his birthday!
It is a hotel that treats you like a family and gives you a sense of luxury with out being overpowering! The plunder the pantry idea is brilliant as if you don’t want to go out to find a meal they have various snacks during the day & at 8p.m. they have a hot recipe for you to choose all complimentary. Where else can you have an ice cream at 2a.m.
Thoroughly recommend this hotel!",5,2023,06,11
137,The best city hotel there is.,The most wonderful experience.  A rare solo trip for two days and was welcomed and treated like an old friend.  The staff are all wonderful.  Was given a surprise upgrade to the magnificent monarch suite which made this tired travelled immediately relaxed and refreshed.  It’s the best breakfast I’ve ever had and the executive lounge is relaxing at any time of the day.  Wonderful experience and can’t wait to come back.,5,2023,06,06
137,Staff made us feel truly welcome,"Lovely stay.  The hotel staff went above and beyond, and made for a memorable London experience.   We enjoyed spending time in the lounge and on the rooftop patio, both of which were great places to relax after a day of exploring the city.  Highly recommend.",5,2023,06,03
137,Beyond expectations!!,"Outstanding facility all the way around.  Covered us up with smiling service, consistently, and everyone was a delight to be around.  The room was very clean and we were gifted champagne for our anniversary.  Dermo went above and beyond and arranged for packages to be mailed back home.  There are many good reasons that it's the #1 hotel in London.  We're so glad to have stayed with them.",5,2023,06,01
137,Exquisite is an understatement!  ,We have never experienced this type of uniquely refined experience and attention anywhere!  From the time you step your foot into the door you are treated like the King and Queen of England--truly.  Attention to detail at every turn.  Hotel 41 is a charming old English experience without being pretentious.  Treat yourself - it is worth it!,5,2023,05,29
137,Authentic hospitality like we’ve never experienced before,"41 Hotel - where do I start. We’ve stayed at most of the top London hotels so were greatly looking forward to this experience. 
The hotel is located on a busy road just a stones throw from Buckingham Palace with many traffic restrictions so we were a little nervous about arriving by car. Luckily the hotel had thought of everything and had sent a detailed information mail in advance outlying their services to assist the guest experience. We alerted them to our arrival so a helpful and cheerful valet was already waiting for us to whisk the car away. When you enter the ground floor lobby, you are transported away from the tourist chaos outside in an instant to a calm and opulent oasis. You are greeted by Marble floors,  wood panelled walls and chandeliers. The friendly staff member outlined the hotel and its quirks (the hotel actually only
Occupies the 5th floor) and you’re then picked up by another member of staff to the check in counter on the 5th floor.
Check in was smooth and again, very informative as there’s a lot if information to digest. We were invited to relax in the Executive Lounge and were given a run-down of services, which are truly astounding:
They have a complimentary snack bar which is stocked with crisps, sweets, candies, healthy snack, nuts etc … complementary scones are served every afternoon … we were offered a complimentary welcome drink … every evening a complimentary spread of food is on offer … astounding!!!!! 
After enjoying our much needed welcome drink, we were shown to our room. We were given an upgrade to a mezzanine suite which truly made our day. The suite was stunning, beautifully appointed and the bed could not have been more comfortable.
Breakfast was amazing too. Fresh ingredients, perfectly presented and set in the stunning executive lounge. 
If you think all of the above couldn’t be topped, you’re wrong. The true stars of this hotel are the staff!
From being welcomed by the valet to being waved off on check out, every single interaction we had was amazing!! Authentic, warm and born from a clear love for their profession and pride in the hotel they work for.
It was very evident and the staff truly enjoy their job and live the art of hospitality.
Loved our stay and can’t wait to be back.",5,2023,05,28
137,Relaxing Stop to End Long Trip,"The staff is especially responsive, the service prompt, the rooms are charming, the hotel's location is central to key London sights, the martinis are perfect and the ice cream is delightful for a late-night snack.",5,2023,05,26
137,Outstanding hotel even better staff.,"This was our third visit and everything was simply outstanding as usual. 

My partner had booked us a room last minute as a treat for my birthday and we were massively surprised to find that we had been upgraded when we were shown to our room. 

From the complimentary glass of champagne during the booking in process through to the open pantry and cheese and ham toasties before dinner and the fantastic choice of snacks until 01:00 hrs you just can’t fault what’s on offer, but the thing that makes the hotel so special is the staff! 

Every single member of the team go over and above to make you feel so very special and have so much time for you. 

The hotel itself is ideally located for the normal touristy things…Buckingham Palace is your next door neighbour and Hamilton is playing less than 5 minutes walk away. 

If you’re looking for a special place to stay in London, this is it!",5,2023,05,21
137,I was treated like royalty,"Everything about Hotel 41 is excellent. The comfortable rooms and bed and the fantastic service. From the moment I arrived to my departure I loved every minute. We discovered this hotel many years ago and I had not returned for several years and found that this property has aged well and if anything the service has improved which is hard to believe. They do have rooms with a shower and I have a hard time getting in and out of a bath.
I will return again.",5,2023,05,20
137,Weekend break ,"A hidden gem. No bar or restaurant, just the 'executive lounge' which is the hub, where guests are welcomed (with champagne and canapés) and where you can relax, it's also where breakfast is served.  The benefit feels like a quiet private member's club , where you can leave  the hustle and bustle of central London outside,perfect if you don't want a really busy hotel with lobby, lots of other people around.  The downside is a slight feeling of claustrophobia due to the narrow entrance and narrow corridors and the one small social space. To be fair, there is a secret door that leads into next door Reubans Hotel, where there are great bar's and restaurants to choose from, which adds to the exclusive feel of going back to hotel 41 as a nice separate space.The service is impeccable and personal. We would stay again",4,2023,05,20
137,Best London Hotel,Having never visited London we wanted a hotel with great reviews that was central to the major sites. You cannot go wrong staying here. Amazing service and food and comfortable rooms with everything you need!! And the staff could not be more responsive or pleasant! We couldn’t be happier with our stay at Hotel 41!!!,5,2023,05,12
137,A hotel to remember!,"We visited Hotel 41 in late April. It was the first stop on our Europe trip. What a way to start off! This boutique hotel is small (I believe 28 rooms). Due to the size, the service is very personal. Every staff member is trained to anticipate and meet the needs of every guest. It’s quite amazing! The top button on the phone is labeled Whatever Whenever and the really mean that! 

The hotel is beautiful. The Executive Lounge s very tastefully decorated and the room decor is awesome. It is clear that attention has been paid to every detail. The hallways are small, a bit uneven and very windy which just adds to the charm. We had a fresh fruit basket in our room every day which was great. 

The location was good - not far from Buckingham Palace. I would highly recommend this property if you’re looking to treat yourself!",5,2023,05,11
137,Persfection Personified,"We arrived at Hotel 41 on the morning of Coronation where we were warmly greeted, taken into lounge and handed a very welcome glass of champagne at 9.30am! Previous to that we had received correspondence from the Hotel helping us with instructions of how to get to the Hotel through the crowds of Coronation, where we were told if there was any issues whatsoever we were to phone and they would come and get us on foot!
I have run out of superlatives to say about this hotel, it was perfection personified, if we were ever anywhere else we always wanted to rush back to Hotel41. The staff are so special, kind and attentive. We spoke with American guests who are regular visitors, and would not stay anywhere else.
We were lucky enough to participate in ""The Curry Experience"" which was out of this world and we have never tasted curry like it, having previously joined Chef in the kitchen who took us round India, spice by spice. Completely spoilt, the Curries were paired with wines something we have never had with curry and my goodness wow wow wow!! The wines come from a South African Vineyard the company also own, as well as their hotels. We had a lovely chat with Malcolm the Managing Director who hailed from our part of the world (Scotland) and were treated to champagne on the roof top bar where we could watch the red arrows flyover whilst sipping Champagne. A huge thank you to you all. My partner was very jealous when I told him all our stories so will bring him to the Hotel in October when we shall be visiting London again!",5,2023,05,11
137,I must do luxury stay,"From the fist step through the door,  the service was nothing short of excellent, attentive and pleasant.  The aroma within the hotel added to the boutique ambiance.  I had the fortune to be upgraded and i can only say, the junior suites are home away from home.  The pillows and bedding made a normal difficult sleep, turn into an easy and recharging stint.  The location offered a brilliant setting for an early morning run, on the door step of Buckingham Palace.  

Thank you Hotel 41 and all the staff",5,2023,05,01
137,Exceptional Hotel 41,"We stayed 6 nights 2 weeks before the Coronation. Difficult to imagine a more satisfying experience. From location to quality of room, front desk, service, and food and drink, the entire stay exceeded expectations. A exceptional staff and a fabulous experience! ",5,2023,04,30
137,Great hotel near Buckingham,"Fantastic hotel with the best service we could ask for. Great staff, food and atmosphere. Clean and appealing surroundings. We got upgraded after a small inconvenience. Would definitely recommend a stay at Hotel 41, and we will definitely come back our self.",5,2023,04,30
137,Hotel 41 is like heaven on earth,"Hotel 41 is an absolutely magical place! From the moment I arrived I felt like I was in heaven. The staff was so polite and went above and beyond.  The staff seemed to take a genuine interests in the guests. All the staff members my family and I engaged with during our stay, including, Rory, James, Dermo, Satish, Summer, Belle, Trevor, Seamus, and Mengyu, were so kind and personable.

The breakfasts and cocktails were always delicious. The ""Plunder the Pantry"" was such a unique and much appreciated complimentary offering. The food from the ""pantry"" was very good, especially the ice cream. I really enjoyed the gin & tonic flavored ice cream.  During our stay the pantry items included various foods, such as, beef stew, cottage pie, desserts,  pastries, various cheeses, caramels, fruits, crackers, popcorn, chips, and salad.  

It seemed that every day/night of our stay at Hotel 41 we were always pleasantly surprised by some gesture of the staff or accommodation of the hotel. The evening before we checked out of Hotel 41 to travel to Paris, the hotel staff left a gift bag in our room which contained packaged snacks and beverages for our trip along with an informational travel guide for Paris.

In regard to the more practical details of the rooms, I know water pressure can be hit and miss at hotels. The water pressure in our bathroom was great.  Face cloths were included among the towels provided in the bathroom (some of the other hotels we stayed at in Europe did not have face towels, but Hotel 41 did).  The toiletries provided had an elegant scent which was not overpowering, and our room was very clean.

When I plan my next trip to London I won't bother looking at any other hotels because Hotel 41 is THE place to stay in London.",5,2023,04,26
137,"This is the best hotel in London, but sshhh! please don’t tell anyone, as we want to keep it to ourselves!","My goddaughter and I just spent a gorgeous weekend at Hotel 41. The room was so comfortable, the executive lounge (where all the special pantry eats and late-night feasts can be enjoyed) so enticing and warm, and the location so perfect. But above all it is the wonderful staff, their warmth, kindness and attention to detail (our lemon drizzle birthday cake to die for!) that makes this hotel a place we could never tire of visiting. Thank you!",5,2023,04,24
137,"Posh, comfortable and a special hotel. Fantastic locations and top- notch amenities. Enjoyed the lounge and staff.","From our arrival to the departure, we were warmly greeted and provided the best service. Our stayed in an upgraded suite which made returning from a long day of sightseeing the best treat. We enjoyed the executive lounge for breakfast, afternoon beverages and little treats. I especially like the tea service as it was just very special & lively. My husband referred to it as my adult tea party. The champagne, beer and spirits were top notch. I enjoyed my morning cappuccino which was perfect in every way. The evening turndown service made us feel extra special. We were assisted with excursions, dinner reservations & recommendations and getting transportation to our excursions. The chilled water each night  by our bed stand was much appreciated. Rooms were charming and very clean. This was the best hotel experience we have ever had! We will return as will family members who recommended to us.",5,2023,04,16
137,Your own private club experience that transports you to the time of real hoteliers! Extra everything.,"Doctor Strange Sanctuary meets John Wick’s Continental - without the drama!  And that’s just the decor. Exceptional staff, beautifully appointed rooms, comfortable beds plus your own “Easy” button for anything your heart desires.  Add cool club like atmosphere and never ending ice cream and other yummies in the lounge, and the experience is perfect.  Fresh milk was a lovely touch and fresh fruit option was great.  Beautiful green wall with 10,000 plants on the side of the hotel and secret entrance - literally round the corner from the King’s palace makes it a must stay.  Will want to try the under the stars room next time. Very memorable and enjoyable stay and really hard to find hospitality. Well done!",5,2023,04,15
137,Amazing hotel and very attentive to all needs.,5 star service. Everyone is very attentive as soon as you arrive. Lots of extra touches which makes the stay even more special.

137,Amazing honeymoon experience 😍 ,"My husband and I recently stayed at hotel 41 London, in the Conservatory suite for our honeymoon. From the moment we walked in we felt well taken care of, and we enjoyed everything from the greeting glass of sparkling wine to the optional extras like flowers and chocolates in the room. The meals, the service, and the beauty of this historic boutique hotel were all excellent. Be aware though, it is in the heart of the city and if you're a light Sleeper you may want to consider something to cut the noise of sirens. ",5,2023,04,09
137,Unique interior and very friendly staff,"Very friendly staff who helped us, excellent customer service, great location, nice food, the roof terrase is an extra cool feature of this hotel.

137,"The best hotel in London, hands down!","This is the second time we've stayed at Hotel41 and it won't be our last. What makes this hotel extremely special is the care that each and every staff members provide. It is amazing that the staff knows and remembers your name. Once you arrive, they never ask your name, they just know it. I tried to find out how they do it, but no one would divulge this secret. :-) 

We loved hanging out in the lounge before and after dinner! The endless amount of snacks provided are also such a special touch. The housekeeping staff is the best staff that I've ever encountered, and we've stayed at many luxurious hotels. We can't wait to come back and visit again!",5,2023,04,06
137,Hotel 41 - Only Option!,"I don’t usually write reviews, but in this case, I must. The staff at Hotel 41 graciously welcomes you into their family and makes you feel like home.  After spending seven nights at Hotel 41, I can truly say that other hotels simply do not and cannot compare. This is a 5-star hotel that is head and shoulders above other 5-star hotels. A few specific shout outs are absolutely necessary. 
Sebestian (from Ruben’s) - His cheery disposition and positivity is second to none!  
Alexandros - His thoughtful dining suggestions quickly became our list of musts. Alexandros’ quiet and considerate nature was so welcomed after long, busy days. 
Belle - She always knew what we wanted before we even had to ask. Being proactive, attentive, and personable are just a couple of Belle’s strengths. 
Michael - He was the first person that we met at Hotel 41 and can honestly say that our stay wouldn’t have been the same without him!  He consistently went above and beyond for us!  And as an added bonus, he was able to balance being professional and joking with us, which we loved!
All of the employees at Hotel 41 are the consummate professionals!  They will do whatever they can to make your time in London as enjoyable and comfortable as possible. 
For me, there is only one hotel where I truly want to stay when traveling to London!  ",5,2023,04,03
137,Fantastic stay,"Fantastic stay at hotel 41. We stayed for two nights and had a wonderful stay, the bed was so comfortable,soft luxurious linen. The room was clean and had everything you needed. The staff couldn’t do enough for you, very attentive and professional. There is absolutely nothing to criticise, from the moment we walked in to the time we checked out.",5,2023,04,01
137,Exceeded Expectations ,"A place you dream of going back to. Prime location close to sights and public transportation, quiet, staff that treats you with a personal touch, a plethora of amenities from a free high-end buffet to little treats left at turndown and plush rooms that mix modern touches with old English style. 
What a value for a hotel that makes you feel special each moment you come in or leave! Every staff member was friendly and interested (huge shout-out to Alex who served me several times in the lounge) and they made an effort to listen. For example, on my first night I returned home from a show to find a note from housekeeping saying they hoped I enjoyed it. 
The accommodations are quiet and peaceful. I spent hours in the lounge in the evening reading and enjoying the complimentary buffet of snacks and beyond. While the drinks are pricey, it was worth it on vacation. The rooms are small (vanity especially and the space around the minibar/luggage rack) and lack views, but it was perfect for a single traveler who was out most of the morning and afternoon sightseeing. The beds were comfortable and the room had all the amenities I enjoy when on vacation such coffee, tea, premium toiletries and good wifi. I greatly looked forward to returning to the comfort of my room each night!
Thanks for an incredible start to my UK trip.",5,2023,03,31
137,At Home in Hotel 41,"Before my family travels abroad, we usually research the highest rated (by ranking) hotels in our destination cities.  In 2016, Hotel 41 (A Red Carnation Property) was one of the highest ranked hotels in London & featured stellar reviews for its location &  service.  We decided to stay there and were thrilled we did.  We will never forget the tea and treats, the uniquely designed rooms and convenient location.  All the photos of their rooms and common areas on the  website look pristine and that's exactly how we found them.  

After busy days of exploring London, visiting Stonehenge, and taking in the musical Aladdin, we return to Hotel 41 ready to relax as if it were our home.  We would usually sit in what looked like a large library or observatory and just exhale & recount the day's activities.  We would highly recommend staying there to experience how customer service was intended to be.",5,2023,03,31
137,Amazing hotel and such attentive staff.,"Where to begin?! We went to London to go to the theatre for my wife's birthday and stayed two nights. All members of staff at Hotel 41 were fantastic and nothing was too much trouble for anyone. We were upgraded to an Executive Suite which was lovely. The room was super comfortable and the little touches were so nice from a little message on the mirror in the bathroom to finding our glasses cleaned and a hotel styled glasses cloth each left for us. Petals by the bed and a hot water bottle waiting for us were more wonderful touches. The food throughout the day was delicious- big fan of the plunder the pantry- and all staff from the doorman to the porters were all fantastically friendly, helpful and attentive. We felt like they were all so eager for us to have the best possible stay. The hotel itself isn't large, but that makes it feel so much more personal and the experience is all the better for it. We would certainly stay here again!",5,2023,03,30
137,Simply First Class,"We recently had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 again on a trip into London.
It's an absolute gem.
From the moment you walk through the door you are treat like royalty, every member of staff will go out of their way to make your stay as pleasant and as enjoyable as possible.
The room was fantastic with every little detail considered and thought through so you want for nothing, with special little touches thrown in like welcome Macarons, turn down service etc.
Drinks and plundering the pantry add to the whole relaxing and enjoyable experience.
Having tried many similar hotels in London, this is our hotel of choice, it is simply first class!",5,2023,03,23
137,Very Warm Welcome,"How great to return to your room in the middle of winter with the gas fireplace glowing. With all our previous stays at the amazing Hotel 41, this is the first time our room came with a fireplace. We loved the warm, cozy atmosphere the fireplace created in our room. Although every room and suite can be very different, although they all have the famed black and white design theme. 

Of course, hospitality and service by this caring team are still second to none. With the departure of former resident manager Lauren, the resident team of everyone including Dean and Marlen went out of their way to ensure we enjoyed everything and left with smiles on our faces. Thanks Adele for the goody bag of treats for our travels to Birmingham. This is the the only place we will stay when visiting London. It feels like home. Looking forward to our next family visit.",5,2023,03,21
137,Incredible hotel ,Absolutely awesome hotel. Cannot fault it at all. Pure luxury. Customer service is the best I’ve ever experienced. Special mention to James. Complete maturity and professionalism from a 20 year old. Cannot wait for my next trip here. ,5,2023,03,12
137,"41 is a jewel amongst hotels in London,","I am very spoilt when it comes to hotels. Since I'm a german Lifestyle-journalist who used to traveling the world.  I know a lot of hot spots already.   ...but what shall I say.... Hotel 41 is unique in every kind of a way. The extras like complementary sweets, the plunder the pantry-service. The VIP service for every ! guest (not only for the Very v's) ,. The very private atmosphere. the high-end decor and surrounding. It feels like (I guess)  a little bit like being part of the movie Downtown Abbey, spending time in a Castle, not in an hotel . Feeling like a Duchess in front of the fire place drinking tea and eating scones. Served by so wonderful, high professional , lovely members of the staff of 41. Unfortunately I forgot the names since, but I remember Esin, what a wonderful  lady - as all the staff  was in 41!  Always smiling! As all the stuff does, all the members of 41 do a lot of effort  to make your stay just perfect!  I would like to  say thank you to this very sweet lady who was serving us Breakfast )it is a pity, that I do not remember her name), and all the lovely guys. It would be not just fair to mention one of them, because all!!! of them were great at same level! We will be back next year 2024.  Sure you can have more modern , more stylish hotels in London. But whenever  I am in London, I want the British way, NOT the international way - that is something you have everywhere. 41 you get nowhere else . But   in London .The very British way. The way of 41.",5,2023,03,11
137,Amazing,"Second time here and I have to say the place is unreal, from the minute you step in the door to the minute you  leave, the service goes above and beyond.  The welcome glass of champagne before you even check in, was a great start.
Stunning room, amazing breakfast and top quality staff.",5,2023,03,09
137,Can’t recommend highly enough,"I can’t praise this hotel enough. Probably the best hotel I have ever stayed in for lots of reasons, and I’ve stayed in some of the best hotels around the world. It’s basically a boutique hotel with 28 rooms. There’s no standing around to check in at a reception desk, they come to you with an iPad while you’re enjoying your welcome drink and some well thought out nibbles in a gorgeous cosy gentlemen’s club like lounge area. In this same room they have an array of complimentary food day and night and a fully stocked paid bar. They are open 24hours. You also get your breakfast there which was delicious. We were upgraded (no idea why) to a suite that had a free mini bar, sky tv and a gas real flame fire that they put on for us that evening. The small group of staff couldn’t be more friendly and helpful. I honestly can say that I won’t be staying anywhere else when I go on my regular trips to London. Just brilliant.",5,2023,03,09
137,Totally pampered,"From the moment you enter the Hotel 41 you are treated with incredible service. There is 
 amazing attention to detail which makes the stay so memorable. The highlight for me was coming back to the room after a long, tiring and chilly February day in London and finding a hot water bottle in the bed. Bliss! ",5,2023,03,02
137,Wonderful Stay,I had a wonderful stay at Hotel 41. My room was very comfortable and I really appreciated the little surprise touches for my birthday. The service from the staff was exceptional; everyone was friendly and made sure I had everything I needed. One of the best breakfasts I’ve ever had and ‘Plunder the Pantry’ was great to return to after an evening out. I can’t wait for my next stay.,5,2023,02,28
137,A cocoon of calm in the heart of London,"We love this gem of a hotel - it is instantly soothing, from the refreshing water on arrival, to the gorgeous scents and chic black and white decor. The beds are divinely comfortable, all the better to flop into after ""plundering the pantry""! The staff are friendly and give you really personal service. We hope to be back again!",5,2023,02,21
137,A little gem hidden in the city!,"I cannot fault this amazing hotel. It was an oasis of calm in the middle of the city! Every member of staff were exceptional, making us feel so welcome and anticipating our evert need. Being a small hotel made such a difference as you were made to feel very special. The rooms were spotless and very comfortable. We had such a lovely relaxing stay here and we will most certainly go back.",5,2023,02,19
137,A true 5 star hotel,"Late review but I had to show appreciation when I remembered. 
From the hotel doorman and entrance hall, to the lounge and room, everything was magnificent. 
Lounge had a complimentary sweet bar and fridge stocked with ice cream for guests and we were welcomed with a glass of champagne. Full English breakfast was one of the best we’ve had and very generous. 
Room was small but very nice with comfortable bed and nice touch of lavender pillow spray for us to use and take home. Also a surprise birthday cake for my husbands 30th. 
All staff were friendly and accommodating without being overbearing, no snobby staff who haven’t got the time of day and look down on you here. 
We loved this hotel and would definitely visit again, it’s the perfect place for a special occasion or just when you want a quality place to stay in London.",5,2023,02,09
137,"An introduction that went really, really well.....","Three of us checked in to 41 – two of us as regular returnees and one as a new guest – to kick back and relax.  Dean had coordinated the new booking seamlessly and was there to greet us. From the outset, our friend was impressed with the efficiency and outstanding, welcoming service that we know is the heartbeat of 41.  

Another success was our supper reservation at The Curry Room downstairs. Read a separate review for that excellent meal.  No need to venture outside on a cold night. Just sign your bill to the room.    

Plunder the Pantry on Saturday night was the acid test after a delightful lunch at The Wolesley followed by a long walk.  He loved that evening’s offering of pork pies, cheese, and pickle jars, and went back for seconds of the mac'n'cheese.  And this was after he had fallen for the canapes and  the ever-popular Croques Messieurs in a big way!  

The wine we chose to accompany our Plunder was Hannibal and this kept him sitting in the Exec Lounge long after we two had retired.  He just loved it and the team looked after him well in our absence, anticipating his every wish.  Both breakfasts were enjoyed with gusto.  
 
The entire experience lived up to and beyond expectations and he has been surprised and delighted.  So are we.",5,2023,02,08
137,"Lovely hotel, great location, outstanding service.","We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in February 2023. Good room, great location, but most impressive- outstanding service from every single staff member.  Helpful, courteous and knowledgeable, from the chambermaid to the manager. Fabulous!",4,2023,02,05
137,Best hotel stay ever,"This Hotel and the staff are simply unbelievable! From the moment we walked through the door to the moment we had to leave I cannot describe what a fab stay we had. Unforgettable and we will return! 

The service, complementary food, the room, the location - everything was simply perfect and made our anniversary stay so special.  Thank you!",5,2023,02,05
137,The Best!!,"I would recommend Hotel 41 for all the obvious reasons - the best location in London, rooms, amenities, exceptional service and most importantly; value for money. I have stayed at Hotel 41 previously and most recently stayed at the hotel during the end of December 2022. It is what you would expect from a 5 star hotel - absolutely no faults. But, what sets Hotel 41 apart from other hotels are the amazing staff. They make the experience of staying at this hotel truly memorable - they are always friendly, extremely attentive, and clearly the best at what they do. Nothing was too much trouble for them and the smallest of details matter, from arrival to check out. Thanks again to Adele, Marlen, Dean and Dermo that were willing to go out of their way to make it an unforgettable experience. There is no better hotel to stay in London!",5,2023,01,31
137,Best 5-star hotel,"My wife claimed to be speechless when we entered our room at Hotel 41, but the superlatives kept coming.  From the very discreet entrance near Buckingham Palace to the check-in process (with complimentary drinks and food) to the executive lounge, the facilities are luxurious and the staff professional and extremely friendly.  The list of things they can help you with is long and includes packing your belongings prior to checkout.  The hotel is located in a very nice area of London within short distance of places to visit and a 2-minute walk from an underground station.  A stay at Hotel 41 is a lifetime memory and it is the best 5-star hotel we have visited.",5,2023,01,30
137,Lovely stay,"Everyone we met was so lovely. They remembered everything about us, couldn’t be more helpful and were very attentive. Wish we were there longer than 1 night. The room was really nice and the little touches like the candle in the bathroom made it extra special. ",5,2023,01,29
137,Incredible ,"We had our trip gifted to us for Christmas and it’s safe to say we will most definitely be back. The whole stay from the moment we checked in and felt like Luxury. The staff are phenomenal and cannot do enough. There is so many fabulous touches, the candles and petals in the room, the complimentary pantry, scones, ice cream. Not a single bad word to say as the hotel was incredible. We are looking forward to coming back to experience the pure luxury again! ",5,2023,01,28
137,The Perfect Stay in London,"Hotel 41 was the perfect stay in London. From check in to check out, every need and question was catered to. The staff was unbelievably friendly and really went out of their way to make my stay extra special. All the small noticeable touches were so lovely, especially the turn down service, what a lovely way to get ready for sleep. The executive lounge was such a beautiful spot to sit outside of the room and socialize with other guests. All the food, from afternoon scones, to plunder the pantry, and all the treats available all day long, the canapés, there was literally not a single moment to feel hungry. The breakfast was top notch. I don’t have a single complaint about my stay and cannot wait to return in the near future.",5,2023,01,27
137,Amazing service at Hotel 41,"We stayed at Hotel 41 in late December and I have to say that I have never experienced more attentive service. From the moment we arrived the staff were  super eager to help. We arrived on an early flight from Australia and  started with complimentary champagne and an excellent breakfast by the fire. They had our room ready soon after breakfast - something I really appreciated after such a long flight.

 Hotel 41 is a boutique hotel - it is not large and aside from your room there is one main area that is used for reception and food service, as well as a smaller room used for reading or to host large tables for meals. After a small issue with the bath tub we were upgraded to suite. Stay in one of these if you can - it was beautiful. Our previous room was lovely and had everything you could want, but was quite small. The suit had two levels - the first with its own fireplace and the second with a really good sized bathroom and queen bed. The hotel has a 'plunder the pantry"" service - you can help yourself to snacks and ice cream when ever you want. We did not have time to have the complimentary Devonshire Tea but based on our experience of breakfast - I am sure it is excellent.  It is however, the staff that really stand out at Hotel 41 - they seem to genuinely want to help you to have the best stay possible and the atmosphere of the hotel is, as a result, very calm, cozy and relaxed. Thank you for a wonderful stay.",5,2023,01,26
137,Perfect London hideaway,"Lovely, comfortable hotel with flexible eating arrangements and a good linked bar/restaurant next door.   Very friendly and capable staff.   Extremely dog-friendly.   My late husband and I were regulars through and after lockdown and now that I am on my own I am totally comfortable there and made to feel welcome rather than an inconvenience as in some hotels.   Previously we used to stay at the Milestone, a sister hotel, also first class but Hotel 41 now suits me better.   Perfect.",5,2023,01,24
137,Wonderful Hotel,"We have stayed at Hotel 41 on two occasions and this has become our preferred hotel when staying in London. The whole experience from check in to departure is faultless and attentive without being intrusive.
All the staff are exceptionally professional in dealing with hotel guests and genuinely make you feel at home. Check in is a great experience, expect some delightful quick wit and repartee with Steve, who will make you most welcome.
The location is ideal for visiting many attractions in central London, but the hotel feels like a personal London club away from the busy hustle and bustle of the City.
If you are reading this to consider whether to stay or not, then go ahead and book, you will not be disappointed.",5,2023,01,24
137,What a gem of a hotel!,"What a gem of a hotel! 

We are regular guests of the 41 hotel since Christmas 2017 and we thoroughly enjoyed every our stay in this beautiful boutique hotel.

The hotel is a short walk to Buckingham Palace, as well as Victoria (underground, railway, coach) station to easily explore other sightseeing.

The 41 Hotel is quaint and charming; the decor and atmosphere are perfect. We love it! 

Our room was perfect; about sleep quality, our room, with view on The Royal Mews of Buckingham Palace, it’s been extremely quiet at night.

Adele,Marlen,Dean and the entire new staff is extremely courteous and helpful. Very accommodating, very knowledgeable and is apparent they do their job with love and did everything with a smile.

The breakfast, served in the Executive Lounge, is delicious with freshly cooked dishes from the kitchen; many thanks to all staff of the breakfast especially Esin, Alexandros, Sadiq, Alexander. 

In the Executive Lounge you also have snacks, cocktails, ice cream,as well lunch and dinner, served during all the day; furthermore we would like to recommend to visit, for a drink or a lunch/dinner, the Bbar on the corner, same property as the hotel, many thanks to all the fantastic and perfect Bbar staff.

Would absolutely stay here again and would recommend 41 Hotel to anyone making a trip to London.",5,2023,01,22
137,Another Great Stay,"Have stayed here and at other great hotels in the Red Carnation Group many times over the years and this is our favourite when staying in London.
It is close to  Victoria Train and coach Station. Short taxi ride from Waterloo Station. 
Overlooks the Royal Mews and is Ideal for Buckingham Palace and parks such as St James’s and Green Park.
Just like a private club with first class attentive and friendly service. Nothing too much trouble.
The Executive Lounge is great place to relax and unwind.
Plenty of included extras such as Raid the Pantry in the evening, Jude’s Ice Cream and afternoon Scones.
In the warmer seasons there is the roof terrace, weather permitting.
In the colder seasons return to your room in the evening to find a fire has been lit and hot water bottle in the bed.
Easy access to restaurants in Rubens Hotel and BBar next door.
Plenty of other eatery’s in Nova Centre, near Victoria Station.",5,2023,01,22
137,Quietly indulgent,"We have officially lost count of the number of times we have stayed at 41.

This hotel is a fantastic little oasis in the middle of the bustle of Victoria. It is highly convenient for transport and also for getting into the west end. Nothing quite beats an amble up past the illustrious neighbour of Buckingham palace (some rooms overlook…), and you can be in Mayfair/St James in a matter of minutes. 

For us it is all about the service. Nothing is ever too much trouble and someone is always on hand to help. 

This is the very best way to have your own place-to-stay in London without the difficulty of buying such a place (if you could). We’re in London almost monthly (bad theatre and restaurant habit) so it’s pretty key to have a reliable but luxury location.

We’ve stayed in other hotels but nothing is quite the same. We’ve even stayed in other Red Carnation hotels in London. This hotel has personality and this is delivered by the staff. 

Isn’t it a bit pricey? You might ask this but I’d argue that no decent London hotel room will be cheap. For us it’s about value-for-money and that’s where 41 wins. 

We’ve stayed in most of the rooms and they’re all a little bit different. Have we a favourite? Possibly 4116.",5,2023,01,22
137,Christmastidings of comfort and joy,"My husband & I visited London the week between Christmas & New Year. We came to see London decked out for the festive season & 41 Hotel was the perfect backdrop. From its central location to transport & all attractions, to its fantastic staff, delicious food, and comfortable rooms. We’ve been fortunate to visit London several times in the past and have always stayed at 41 Hotel. While each visit has been different, 41 Hotel has been a constant - one we see no reason to change. Can’t wait for our next visit to London & stay at 41 Hotel.",5,2023,01,22
137,The best of the best...,"I popped into Hotel 41 as I was in the area and missed my favourite hotel in London! As I walked into the pristine lobby I was greeted by the friendly receptionist as the familiar hotel 41 scent wafted up my nostrils...home again! Oh how I had so missed this oasis. 

I took the lift to the 5th floor and entered the calm familiar black and white corridors lined with  quint portraits, which led me directly to the luxurious members lounge. More friendly faces welcomed me as I sat down in the large comfortable leather seat and took in the ambiance. The fire was lit and warming a couple, as they sat snuggled up on the  sofa and enjoyed a lush afternoon tea, champagne at hand and sweet treats galore. Others were quietly reading a paper or engrossed in a novel. The honesty bar was brimming with every drink that could be imagined and the treats and snacks were endless.

Our last stay seemed so long ago. I was here to enquire about booking our next stay to celebrate my birthday and couldn't wait to experience all hotel 41 had to offer once again; from the best nights sleep in a savoir bed, to top notch customer service from a team that could ascertain exactly what you may want, at exactly the precise time you wanted it. Nothing was too much trouble for a team trained to be the best in London. 

I remember wanting to do my morning YOGA exercise early and before I could stay Jack Robinson, I was sitting on my YOGA mat looking up at the azure sky, as the sunshine kissed my skin; a roof top YOGA session was certainly the best way to start my morning at Hotel 41.

Breakfast was always leisurely affair, starting with strawberry and banana granola, followed by a full English and hot cup of strong ginger and lemon tea. The food is exceptional and grazing is encouraged through-out the day, with plunder the pantry treats- a particular favourite of mine after a late evening at the theatre.

When I think of hotel 41, opulence and class are words that come to mind. The key to luxury is imagination and making dreams come true...well, Hotel 41 is that place and I cannot wait to return.    

   ",5,2023,01,22
137,Still Wonderful,"We first stayed at this hotel just before the pandemic struck, and had to cancel our next stay due to lockdown closures. We had fond memories of our first experience and were looking forward to our second stay. Although we missed some of the very nice and helpful staff we encountered the first time, particularly since they had great amounts of institutional memory with regard to the neighborhood and its food recommendations, we thoroughly enjoyed getting to know the new staff members. 

This trip we had a room that faced the courtyard and was therefore relatively free of traffic noise. It was a bit larger than our last king room, with a writing desk at the entrance, which was convenient for the small amounts of work I needed to do during our vacation. All of the familiar touches were still present, from the distinctive black and white décor with the old-fashioned drawings on the walls, to the champagne in the Executive Lounge at check in to the turn down service that makes you feel a bit more pampered at the end of a long day. Some reviewers have complained about the lounge experience, but I actually find it relaxing after spending nearly an hour in a cab with our luggage, contrary to the front desk experience at most hotels, which can be rather unappealing. The lounge has two levels, so if you feel like retreating from the world a bit you can just climb the stairs and tuck yourself away, as we did one morning for breakfast, and I did by myself one night at dinner. 

The hotel’s staff excels in making you feel cared for, and their energy makes the hotel a welcome refuge from the bustle, and if you want a different energy for a drink or a meal the larger sister hotel next door, The Rubens, is a mere elevator ride away. Hotel 41 also has a private screening room for the use of its guests, which we were planning to try but had to cancel at the last minute when my husband was feeling unwell. It is definitely on our list for next time. There are older hotels, large grand affairs with rosters of famous guests, but I can’t imagine staying anywhere else than 41.

137,A must visit hotel in London,"The entire experience at the 41  was truely AMAZING!!! Anything from the welcome we got, the hotel it self, the staff, their service and food was FANTASTIC!!! I f you really want to spoil yourself, or someone you know, you should choose to stay at the 41. A beautiful and classic ""old school"" London club hotel,  where you also have snacks provided throughout the day.",5,2023,01,16
137,Small but perfect boutique hotel,"Excellent hotel for the best service and real english feel.
Stayed hear in 3 rooms with family and grandma. Still one night to go but already on the conclusion that it’s excellent. Not posh but stylish. No surprise it’s top of the league every year. The staff and service makes it stand out to other hotels. 
No doubt we will stay hete again or at any of the other excellent hotels of red carnation.
Thanks again.",5,2023,01,06
137,Amazing hotel,We travel with our little dog. An excellent welcome awaited us as soon as we entered. They took incredible care of us until our check out. They had prepared a very nice bed in our room for our little dog. We will definitely be back. Especially everything in the restaurant is very tasty and worth trying.,5,2023,01,06
137,20th Anniversary Trip to London,"We could not have dreamed up a better hotel  for our anniversary trip to London! The size of Hotel 41 is what makes it special. Connected to The Ruben, Hotel 41 has its own entrance and private elevator that goes straight to the fifth floor, which is where all 28 rooms are located. We only ever interacted with Hotel 41 employees, aside from when the doormen at The Ruben hailed our cab. When we left early one morning for our Eurostar adventure to Paris, Tio from the Ruben came out and gave us maps and advice for our day!

You immediately feel pampered upon arrival as you are escorted to the fifth floor by the lobby attendant. Once upstairs, you check-in in the Executive Lounge. During the check-in process, you are treated to a glass of champagne and snacks. To our surprise, our room was ready when we arrived! This was unexpected and greatly appreciated, as we had just arrived on a red eye flight from the US. Ali took us to our room and showed us the important details, such as how the lights and electric blinds work, as well as where the coffee, tea, and mini fridge were located. 

The Executive Lounge was cozy and inviting. We enjoyed breakfast, dinner, scones/tea, and late night snacks there during our stay. The staff was super accommodating and helpful. Two mornings, when we just didn’t have time to sit down for breakfast before our first excursion, one of our favorite staff members (I wish I could remember her name! Dark, curly hair) boxed up pastries and coffees to-go for us! Alexandre from Ireland served us our breakfast each morning, and our dinner one evening. He was friendly and personable, and we very much enjoyed our conversations with him!

Thank you for such a memorable stay! We will be back one day and look forward to staying at Hotel 41 again!",5,2023,01,05
137,41 GEM OF LONDON,"I stayed two nights at the 41 hotel in London 23 - 24 December 20022.  Was meeting my sister, her husband and my uncle in central London so wanted to check out a hotel not in central London.  41 was the best boutique hotel I have ever stayed in.  Next to the Rubens Hotel and owned by the same company 41 was a great experience.  From check in to check out I was pampered, taken care of and helped with any travel questions I had.  Location is not great but it is 3 minute walk to the tube.  Rooms are fantastic, with a fire place on the first level,  the room I had was a two level room.  The check in area is also the hotel lounge which serves drinks and food and snacks at time.  The lounge also had a big library, so if you like to read it had lots of interesting books.  Over all a real 5 star hotel.  Staff was great.  Special thanks to Michael, who was everywhere during my stay there and helped me a lot.  Great hotel for solo traveler or couples.  Not really a family hotel.  Well worth the price for what you get!",5,2023,01,05
137,Best hotel stay ever!,"Hotel 41 was the most amazing hotel experience I have ever had! This was my first trip to London and I will never forget it because of this fantastic hotel! 
I found this gem not realizing how wonderful it was until we visited. The people were helpful, genuine, and made me feel important yet cozy at home. The hotel and staff took wonderful care of us! My husband and I can't wait to return to stay with them again. ",5,2023,01,04
137,Hotel 41 over Christmas,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for nine days over Christmas. We chose the hotel based on a stay there in 2013 which had been very enjoyable. The location of the hotel is excellent, the rooms are comfortable and the single, central lounge is warm and welcoming. But what makes this hotel different is the staff. The staff to guest ratio is higher than in most other hotels and the service is simply outstanding. Every one of them goes out of their way to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. I cannot thank them enough for making our Christmas a home away from home.",5,2023,01,01
137,A hidden gem,"Well what can I say from the moment we arrived and pulled up outside. The staff were quick to park the car and the feeling of total relaxation descended. The care, the greetings and smiles , the warmth , of the ambiance of this beautiful hotel took hold. We were upgraded and the room was to die for. The drinks , food and the personal touches made this stay very magical at Christmas, so we can’t thank and praise enough the staff at the hotel 41 for the pleasure. We also popped next door to Rubén’s hotel for the cocktail experience which was a lovely evening so a big thank you to the staff there also, in summary if you want luxury at a personal level please try this jewel hidden in London well worth the visit .",5,2022,12,29
137,Post Xmas joy!! ,"To take a phrase from Craig Revel Horwood our stay was 'Fab-u-lous Darling'!!!.
From the moment we both arrived and checked in, to the morning we sadly departed a wonderful experience was made. 
Many thanks to all the wonderful staff who made our stay special. ",5,2022,12,28
137,Exceptional staff,"This hotel is special because of its staff.  The rooms are nice , the position is good  but so are in many other 5* hotels in London, but you never get a service quite like in Hotel 41.  I was a bit skeptical when I read reviews in the past but they are in the class of their own.  It is not just that the service is great, it is that all the staff seem to be happy to be and work there!  It makes a big difference.
There seem to be two types of rooms - the reasonably priced rooms and the not so reasonably priced suites of various types.  We stayed in the reasonably priced room which had everything you could want though some of it was a little on the bijou side, e.g. shower cubicle.  But hey, there was one as well as bath so it is great.  
The bed is comfortable, there is a space to sit down and read in the room, the public room is cosy, the number and variety of bottles in the bar is impressive (sadly no Spanish brandies though, only French), the breakfast is excellent indeed, they have a gin and tonic Jude ice cream in the pantry (the best ice cream ever) and staff is charming and full of character.
Over all - we loved it

",5,2022,12,19
137,Beyond excellence,"I recently made a return visit to Hotel 41 as the previous experience with my husband was superb and we intended to return. I now travel alone having lost my husband but was determined to return to Hotel 41 as we had planned. I experienced excellence at all levels of Hotel 41 from the rooms, facilities and of course the wonderful staff who  were attentive, warm and caring making this stay extra special. I am so looking forward to my next visit in 2023. Thank you to everyone at Hotel 41.",5,2022,12,12
137,the only place to stay in London,"Our delight was the staffs main concern every moment & every night we stayed @ Hotel 41. This exquisite boutique hotel surpassed every one of our expectations. We are an international traveling couple. And to receive from the Staff of Hotel 41 such individual greetings, assistance & personal attention is an art of service seldom experienced. This art of service is solidly engrained in every fiber of the true character of Hotel 41's being. The staff's commitment to detail is effortless on their part, its simply their nature. We experienced an unsurpassed caliber of service, relaxation & comfort in the Executive lounge for afternoon tea, evening snacks & beverages, to the plush comfort & the delicious macaroons in our suite. So may tiny details of perfection! In passing, we mentioned we were heading over to Paris for a few days & we received a Hotel 41 staff's personalized suggestion to improve our discussed itinerary . . . simply amazing ~ If you stay ANYWHERE else - you're missing out on one of the most memorable traveling gifts you can give yourself!!",5,2022,12,06
137,Another fabulous stay at the faultless Hotel 41,"Outstanding- fabulous as always!
Another wonderful stay at Hotel 41. I would not stay anywhere else. The team are faultless in the care they take of guests and the level of comfort and the efforts made to ensure guests have everything they need is exceptional. 

There have been lots of new staff join in the last few months but many of the old team remain. The new team are of a very high standard - really pleased to see such high standards being maintained 
Thank you",5,2022,12,04
137,Exclusive hotel,"Hotel 41 really is a unique hotel experience. As you enter the entrance hall and walk along the beautifully polished marble floors, and you are taken through to an elevator that takes you up to the executive lounge. You are provided champagne and canapes before checking in. The moment you arrive you are treated impeccably, and we were loved the intimacy of the hotel.  

The room itself was lovely with some lovely finishes such as a welcome cake and macrons and overall impressions were very good. 

Much to our own determent we had booked a number of experiences so did not fully use much of the hotel's unique points such as their plunder the pantry and evening canapes. We did however have delicious breakfasts when we could, and the staff were attentive and catered for any needs. 

We loved our stay and would highly recommend to anyone that wants a 5-star experience.",5,2022,12,02
137,Incredible incredible incredible,"Everything at the hotel was EXCEPTIONAL. The hotel’s crew specially. They were all very caring and always available to help. It is very well located, the rooms are excelent and very clean.  Only the higher of compliments and hoping to stay there again soon!",5,2022,11,26
137,Luxury and personal,"Stayed for 9 Nights so I got to experience the service and hotel over a long period. 

Ad you can see from the photos, the hotel is gorgeous. 

On arrival, a beautiful introduction in their executive lounge orients you to the sensory pleasures that await. Their team, headed up by Diarmaid, set out to make every person feel welcome and that they deserve being spoilt with an exceptional and personalised service. 

If you are visiting the Uk/London and want to spoil yourself, stay at Hotel 41 where you will experience many others spoiling you too!",5,2022,11,24
137,Perfect (again),"This is our fourth visit to Hotel 41 this year - that, in itself, should speak volumes.  The staff are amazing and cannot do enough to look after you.  Prior to ‘discovering’ Hotel 41, we have stayed at all of the ‘top’ hotels (Savoy, Connaught, Four Seasons, Shard, Ritz etc ….)  but this is now our ‘home from home’ in London. VERY highly recommended.",5,2022,11,16
137,Perfect stay,"Since the moment they open the door you feel like a home away from home. Their hospitality is exceptional. Every detail makes the difference when staying with them. Plus, the food is great and abundant. Walking distance from main attractions and their convenient advice is always  helpful. We'll definitely stay there again!!",5,2022,11,14
137,First European Trip,"My Daughter & I enjoyed an amazing experience at this beautiful hotel! Impeccable service from the beginning to the end of our stay. Our room was definitely 5 star in every detail possible. 

We were treated like royalty while enjoying complimentary champagne upon arrival, afternoon tea, wine & appetizers before dinner & also delicious English breakfasts!

The staff was very attentive, friendly & entertaining. We will definitely return on our next trip to London. Hotel 41 offers the best of every detail possible!",5,2022,11,13
137,The hotel that exceeded our expectations,The entire experience was incredible. The check in was personal and easy and the welcome cocktail was much appreciated. The hotel itself was beautiful and comfortable. The lounge is very inviting. The rooms though on the small size were great.,5,2022,11,13
137,expectations exceeded,The service was the best that we have ever had.  We love boutique hotels and Hotel 41 did not disappoint. The rooms were lovely and the main room was inviting and warm. The location was a quick walk from Buckingham palace and Mayfair.,5,2022,11,13
137,Ruined!,"Attention grabbing but true. My stay at Hotel 41 was so incredible that it has certainly ruined almost any future hotel stay I have elsewhere. The purpose of my trip was a brief relaxation in luxury surroundings and it absolutely lived up to that. Although slightly overwhelming initially, the staff and glass of champagne soon help you feel comfortable.

The hotel and bedrooms were beautifully presented, but the star of the show, and the real differentiator, is the staff. The level of personalised service, genuine warmth and interest in you having everything you need sets this apart from any other hotel experience I have had.

I will absolutely be back in the future and can't wait!",5,2022,11,12
137,A Unique experience,"How do you describe a stay that was so exceptional it boggles the mind? Yes, this hotel is not cheap- but it is an extremely unique experience. Everyone is there to make sure your stay is the best that it can be.  My room was beautiful- there is no other description. I asked for a referral to a place that had a nice Sunday roast - with an hour’s notice. Fifteen minutes later they found 2 perfect choices, I made my selection, and off I went to a lovely dinner at a fabulous gastro pub, after they secured a cab for me on a very rainy day ( with a printed map in case I wanted to wdlk) . Or perhaps my experience walking in to breakfast, and having someone following me with pair of scissors in her hand, mentioning that I had a tag hanging out that she could help me with… Then there was the breakfast with the best bread I have ever tasted. Mind you, this is in addition to what all the other reviewers have said about plunder the pantry etc. There is no way I would not stay here again the next time I am in London-Thank you Hotel 41….",5,2022,11,10
137,Loved our stay at the gorgeous hotel 41❤️,"The service was absolutely immaculate, the hotel was extremely clean and everything was so neat and tidy. I most appreciated the scent in the hotel it always smelled so lovely. Diarmaid did an exceptional job to take into remembrance our daily plans and to jot them down so we could have an itinerary! The entire staff was so kind and breakfast each morning was really delicious as well. We will definitely be coming back ❤️❤️",5,2022,11,09
137,Awesome Hotel and Staff!,We stayed here as part of our 30th Wedding Anniversary trip.  Everyone at Hotel 41 made us feel special during our entire stay.  The Hotel and Staff did all the special touches as to why we will definitely stay here again the next time we are in London,5,2022,11,09
137,A special hotel,"It had been 4 years since my last stay at Hotel 41 when I returned in August travelling solo. Another stay ensued in late September, this time with my husband. 
I love the attention to detail and special touches both in our room and the lounge and of course the fabulous staff who make staying here so wonderful. Hotel 41 is comfortable, cosy and in a great location. Hands down my favourite hotel and I can’t wait for my next visit.",5,2022,10,30
137,Magnificent!,"My husband and I had the absolute pleasure of staying at the hotel for a birthday treat ! It was nothing short of magnificent! The hotel itself is exquisite and impeccably cared for but what really made it for us was the staff. They are quite simply phenomenal and that includes those at the door, porters, reception staff, housekeepers - they are all an absolute credit to the hotel. Nothing was too much trouble and we had some lovely conversations with them all, each and every one showing a real interest in us both. We had breakfast which was delicious on all counts and served in the executive lounge which has such atmosphere ! The room was immaculate and cleaned to perfection with everything you could possibly need.The only downside was leaving ! Thank you so much to everyone for a truly memorable visit we will return!",5,2022,10,30
137,Incomparable ,"41 never disappoints. The location is ideal. The staff is incomparable.  Everyone manages to be attentive, professional, knowledgeable and also fun! The lounge is perfect. The rooms are elegant and comfortable. We have stayed here many times and intend to visit often. It is, quite honestly, our favourite place away from home.",5,2022,10,28
137,"Awesome, amazing, the best ever!","This hotel was amazing.  The rooms were luxurious and comfortable.  We ate at the restaurant multiple times.  The food and drinks delicious.  Everything was perfect.  The best.....was the staff.  To the person, they were attentive, helpful and kind.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone.

WE WILL BE BACK!!!!!!!!",5,2022,10,27
137,A truly lovely place,"Second time  and still just as lovely. You can quite understand why people continually return. A simply wonderful place and to appreciate it, you need to plan a stay. Bedroom once again was a sheer delight and with a perfect sleep, one could not ask for more. ",5,2022,10,26
137,Could not be happier,hotel 41 made our London experience as positive as it could possibly be. From the second we walked in the door the staff treated us better than we could have asked for. We never needed to ask for any service they promptly tended to every need we had. Alex was our favorite! He was so helpful with answering our questions and couldn’t have been more attentive. He recognized us when we walked into the lounge and even had our room number down. He created such an amazing and luxurious vibe for our stay here. So incredible! I couldnt recommend this place more.,5,2022,10,26
137,Exceptional Team giving 100% and more,"The staff truly make this hotel. From the moment you walk through the door, they are attentive and ready to help you with anything. This was our second visit to Hotel 41, unfortunately it didn’t go as we had planned. My husband was hospitalised on the day we were meant to leave. Dean and the team quickly jumped into action and prolonged my stay in our original room, provided me with support and company following my hospital visits. Little treats like a foot spa and lovely bath products where provided. I really want to thank all of the team for helping me through a stressful time, they were all truly magnificent. We will definitely return to hopefully complete an uneventful stay, we wouldn’t stay anywhere else in London. Thank you again to my Hotel 41 family. If you are planning to visit London I would definitely recommend Hotel 41.",5,2022,10,25
137,Spoiled,Very nice boutique hotel right behind Buckingham Palace.  The Executive Lounge always has complimentary food along with menu for purchase.  Staff is very attentive.  They go over and above expectations.  Not a party hotel.  I normally don’t like macaroons but they have really good marshmallow flavor… Also their shower gel and hair products smell very good.  ,5,2022,10,22
137,Wonderful hotel experience on our first trip to beautiful London,The hotel was exceptional!  Service is outstanding and decor throughout is beautiful!  Staff was always available for anything you needed and always extremely pleasant. I would highly recommend this hotel  You will not be disappointed!,5,2022,10,13
137,The Crown Jewel,"I can't express how much I loved ""the experience"" at this little gem. We arrived in London on Sept 28th for 6 nights for the Vikings/Saints game. My husband wanted to stay in Chelsea for the last 3 nights to be near friends who live there, but he allowed me to pick a hotel for the first 3 nights to celebrate my 50th birthday (and a belated anniversary gift). 

Hotel 41 is the exquisite little sister hotel to the adjacent full service Rubens hotel situated in the heart of London, a quick walk from the gates of Buckingham Palace. When you walk in, you are warmly greeted each and every time, like you are a missed family member that they are happy to see You feel like you are in a 5 star hotel, without the arrogance of many 5 star hotels. 

Your luggage is whisked away to your room, while you're brought to the beautifully appointed executive lounge on the 5th floor for a welcome glass of complimentary champagne provided the charismatic Steven Jones (""aka Jonesy"" as the staff at the BBar next door calls him). He alone, is what every 5 star boutique hotel needs. He's charming, witty, interesting and quite honestly, I would have been happy sitting in the executive lounge for 3 days basking in his presence and listening to his stories. 

After our glass of champagne, we checked in with Andrew, the most darling, funny and charming of all of the check ins I have ever experienced. I could count on him for a wink and a smile each day.  I adored these two gentlemen, along with the rest of the staff. I knew all of their names while there, but as I write this, I feel terrible for forgetting-  because every single one of them deserves high praise as they were each uniquely  impeccable in every way. 

We stayed in the split level junior suite that abuts the Executive Lounge and it was absolutely beautiful in every way. The bed was hands down the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in and my morning lattes ordered to my room were splendid. 

The executive lounge is stunning and provides a ""plunder pantry"" full of fun complimentary snacks. My favorite, hands down, was the Jude's Gin and Tonic mini ice cream (I'm still dreaming of it).  I missed the afternoon scones, but I did get a chance to try the canapés the first night we checked in which were delicious. They also put out an array of canapés at night - while we were always full from dinner, my husband found a duck salad on the pantry bar at 11pm that he said was divine.",5,2022,10,12
137,Love this hotel!,"What a delight to find this fabulous hotel.  It is the epitome of English hospitality and service.  Small hotel only 28 rooms.  The service was 5 Star.  We will be back again the next time we are in London.  Just what we needed before departing back home to California.
Marta and Stephen",5,2022,10,09
137,Best little hotel at the heart of London,"Very comfortable hotel at the center of London. Rooms are vey accommodating, beautifully decorated and very clean. Stuff is great, tending to all your needs. The lounge is great with snacks and beverages served all day and night. We stayed at the hotel for four nights and enjoyed it very much.",5,2022,10,08
137,This hotel will spoil you for every other hotel. Great experience!,"There is absolutely NOTHING not to like in this hotel. From the moment you arrive, till the moment you leave, you are spoiled and pampered. Everyone is going out of their way to make you feel at home. The beds are the best I've EVER slept in. The temperature in the room is easily adjustable, There is no noise disturbance, even if you may expect this in an old building and the service is above and beyond. The warmed floor in the bathroom, heating for your towels, a bath, the room was spacious, with loads of storage, safe and special cabinets for your smaller items. USB spots to charge your items, near the desk and next to your bed. Very convenient. I loved every part of my stay. The room is a great size for what I'm used to in London, but the lounge is just stunning. With complimentary food from the afternoon till past midnight. ",5,2022,10,08
137,"Very special small luxury hotel, but service is not what it used to be","This is a very peculiar hotel in the middel of London, set in the 5th floor of the Ruebens Hotel it has its own entrance and elevator, this is my third stay at the property.

Service is still very good and personal, but it takes forever to check in and out.

Rooms are on the small side, and the decoration is starting to look a bit dated (the black sofa on our room 4112 is worn.

Beds are delicious, but upon asking for dow pillows what we got was not satisfactory.

All in all still a very private and good experience, but not as good as the previous two.",4,2022,10,03
137,A fabulous experience,"We were treated by our daughter and grandson to stay at Hotel 41 as part of our Golden Wedding celebrations. We did not look at any reviews beforehand as we trusted our daughters selection. 
From the minute we walked into the beautifully scented foyer until the time we left we were treated by staff as visiting VIPs - with no exception. 
On our first night we arrived very late due to flight delays and as we sat down to a welcoming glass of champagne another resident asked if we had stayed here before. We explained this was our first visit and she said that you will never want to stay in any other hotel in London again. How right she was. 
The food throughout our stay was excellent and we certainly enjoyed the complimentary snacks. 
If you are looking for something special, this is the place of choice. 
We look forward to returning in November as an early Christmas treat. 
A fabulous experience.",5,2022,10,02
137,Excellent!,"What can you say about a hotel that is this amazing. Personal and excellent service 24 hours a day. Professional and discreet service from the moment you get up until you go to bed.  Food, drinks available 24 hours a day. Small gifts and hand written notes each night.  Beautifully appointed rooms and bathrooms. All this and a great location. I will definitely return.",5,2022,10,01
137,Prepare to be pampered,My husband and I ended a 3 week vacation  with our stay at Hotel 41.  It was definitely a 5 star experience.  We felt so pampered.  The staff anticipated our every need and we really enjoyed the ambiance of the executive lounge. We definitely enjoyed their team of professionals in meeting our requests and helping us feel relaxed in a new city. The hotel is very close to Buckingham Palace and is a great starting point for many other 'must see' attractions.  Thanks to everyone who helped make the end of our vacation just perfect.,5,2022,09,30
137,Three days of bliss,"It was lovely to return to 41 again and to relax on the sofa with a greeting glass of their excellent house champagne.  Owing to the pandemic, our recent visits have been reduced in number but we hope to bring them back to a regular pattern as time progresses.  
Lots of new faces - again owing to the huge changes in the whole of the hospitality industry - and all the new staff are of the same high standard of friendly, efficient service as in previous times.    Only the best for 41.  Alex has only very recently arrived - a matter of a few weeks - and yet he conveyed a knowledge and attentive, caring attitude that made us feel as though he had been there for much longer.  Giving us his full attention, he still kept a discreet eye flickering over the room as a good professional should, without missing a beat.  We enjoyed meeting all of them.  
Thank you, Team 41,  for making our return feel just the same as we always anticipate and enjoy.  Just perfect.",5,2022,09,30
137,Un-British in quality and service,"London has many fantastic hotels and unfortunately I found out today that this is not one of them. If you are looking for high quality and hygienic British establishment at this price with staff who value etiquette and manners please consider the Rosewood; the Connaught, the Park Lane Hotel, the Hamyard Hotel, the Chiltern firehouse, so on. Even the Savoy packed on a hen-do filled weekend is better. 

The doormen are lovely, I have walked by this spot for many years and had lovely exchanges them. I thought I might go in for a spot of lunch with a friend who was staying at the hotel after a long morning of volunteering. I wanted to change into a better outfit before sitting down.

I entered and the entryway was full of tourists; it smelt damp and felt stale but I suppose it wasn’t that surprising given the location. Not great but I prevailed. I couldn’t see anyone in the restaurant; it was empty; so I asked an older white male where I could freshen up before I sat down and he told me to use a public restroom. 

I was speechless. No hotel staff member has ever suggested to me to use a public restroom in my life, whether I have been a guest or not. I explained my situation but he absolutely insisted that I leave imminently unless I could give him the number of the room in which my friend was staying in, which I did not know. Given that I was coming in for lunch and paying for them I didn’t think that would have mattered.

Writing this, the only explanation we can think of is that this man genuinely thinks a public restroom is more hygienic than his own hotel. Given my experience of the hotel thus far, this idea is not entirely inconceivable. Either that or he is extremely rude or socially challenged and refuses guests to use facilities, but I cannot imagine anyone lacking etiquette or common sense or gentility to that level. Perhaps it is a policy to not allow restaurant clients to use bathrooms but it is a rather shocking one and I have not come across another hotel in this city or in this country… or even in this world with that policy.

For future guests - please do not experience London in this place, or if you already have, please do not let it ruin your experience. It is truly un-British in quality and service.",1,2022,09,29
137,Anniversary,"A truly memorable stay made special by the amazing staff and service. 
The experience was personalised and thoughtful we would be delighted to visit again soon and will recommend to family and friends wishing make a wonderful memory.",5,2022,09,25
137,Hotel One-derful!,"Stayed at Hotel 41 from September 11-15, 2022.  From the moment we entered, the staff just lavished us with TLC!  We felt that we could ask them for anything to lessen the fatigue and stress that is felt the morning after any travel involving crossing time zones.  The Queen’s passing made the neighborhood around the hotel quite crowded and  chaotic.  Once you entered the lobby, it was quiet and felt like an oasis of calm.  We loved the comfortable bed, delicious snacks and breakfast and most of all, the cheerful, professional, courteous and kind staff.  We will look at other Red Carnation Group hotels when we travel again.  Thank you, Hotel 41, for making our first visit to London very special.",5,2022,09,25
137,Wonderful Hotel and Staff!,"I really can't say enough about our experience at Hotel 41. The hotel itself is beautiful, with a gorgeous main lounge/lobby, and a beautiful rooftop terrace. The room was spacious and chic, and the amenities were plentiful. But the thing that really shines is the staff. Every person we encountered was lovely and so helpful. Their attentiveness was such that I felt like we were the only guests in the entire hotel. They even surprised us with an upgrade to a suite when I told them it was my birthday, and went above and beyond to delight us throughout our time there. I will absolutely be back, and cannot recommend this hotel and it's staff enough.",5,2022,09,22
137,Top Notch Service,"We had a lovely time at Hotel 41! The service was phenomenal and attention to detail was pristine. The staff was always overly accommodating to any request we had. The breakfast was always enjoyable. We appreciated the cleanliness of the hotel. Also, the location was great.",5,2022,09,22
137,An amazing stay in a wonderful hotel with fantastic staff,"This was our second stay at this unique hotel and was our number one choice to enjoy another special occasion, this time my wife's birthday. After first staying 6 years ago to mark the night I proposed I thought this couldn't surpass that occasion and the extra mile the staff went to ensure it really was a special event but they pulled it off. 

To say we were given a room upgrade is an understatement of epic proportions. We were presented with the Conservatory suite in all its splendor, which was a wonderful surprise for us both. I can't thank them enough for making this happen. The room was mind blowing and thankfully we had a clear night sky and was able to fall asleep beneath the stars.

The staff are amazing, friendly, knowledgeable and made us feel at ease throughout our stay. We enjoyed drinks in the lounge area which is a fantastic setting in which to unwind after our adventures in the capital.

It's not just a place to stay but an experience and one which we'll certainly be booking again.",5,2022,09,20
137,A pleasure!,"Charming, beautifully designed & appointed boutique hotel. Staff went above & beyond to help us during the very difficult weekend of the Queen’s death. Wonderful breakfast & gorgeous executive lounge. Black & white decor is stunning. Lovely experience!",5,2022,09,20
137,Outstanding!,"A return visit and such a treat. Unparalleled hospitality and comfort from a superb, professional team. A special thank you to Steve Jones for the genuine warmth of his welcome - what a gentleman! Also to Esin who's smile and real friendliness was matched only by the late summer sunshine streaming in through the windows!
Thank you too, Adele, for your kindness on checking out. The whole team are an absolute credit to the business - it's not often you can say that.",5,2022,09,19
137,Friendly and quiet town house hotel with discrete and immaculate service,"Quite and friendly atmosphere, excellent rooms and service. Clean and large room. Great lunch and breakfast and we were also offered excellent drinks late in the evening. We also received a nice welcoming letter in order for the hotel to adapt to our needs. This is from now on our favourite hotel in London.",5,2022,09,10
137,An absolutely incredible boutique hotel within walking distance to Buckingham Palace,"We had an absolutely amazing time during our stay at Hotel 41. So much so that we skipped the last stop on our trip to go back to Hotel 41 for 1 more night before heading back to the states. The hotel itself is beautiful and in a perfect location but the staff is what really set it apart. Everyone was incredibly welcoming, helpful and attentive. If I find myself in London again, I won’t even bother looking at another hotel!",5,2022,09,09
137,Amazing service!,Amazing boutique hotel across from Buckingham Mews.  Great location and the service is amazing!  Very personalized service from the most professional and friendly staff.  We will definitely return and will make this our go-to London hotel.,5,2022,09,08
137,It's a little gem and you're lucky if you stay there!,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at Hotel 41! It all started with Stephanie's big beautiful smile when we arrived late at night from the airport. She greeted us with a warm welcome and checked us in. It was our first time in London and her friendliness put us at ease right away and made us love the place.

The lounge area where we were checked in was elegantly beautiful and they had complimentary delicious food buffet-style available all whole night.

We asked for a quiet room in advance and we couldn't be happier - in the center of London we didn't hear a thing even when our window was open. Our bed was very comfortable.

The next morning Vera took care of us for an exquisite breakfast. Very sweet, with impeccable manners and skills, highly attentive and caring - she truly made our breakfast the most enjoyable start to the day.

Our first morning we had some questions and Adele was there for us. Highly professional, gracious, with a positive attitude and perfect problem-solving skills, she helped us in every way we needed throughout out stay and made us feel at home.

Everyone we met, in Hotel 41 was nice, helpful and efficient.
It's a little gem and you're lucky if you stay there. We are definitely coming back. Thank you to everyone for making our stay outstanding!",5,2022,09,06
137,Hotel 41,"We retuned back to Hotel 41 again and nothing has changed. 
When you arrive at the front door you enter a small entrance and hallway where you are greeted to by the door man who takes your bags. You ascend  to the 6th floor where the library / reception is and you are greeted with a great hospitality and drink. They don’t worry about checking you in they make you comfortable and you can help yourself to some incredible food and more beverage. 
Bedrooms are very well appointed and fitting for the design of the hotel. No expense was spared. 
Location is a across the street from The palace, a walk to Chelsea , Mayfair and soho. August /September are great months to spend in London. Walking , shopping , museums patios and of course all the history one could want. 
Our stay at this hotel was a 10 out of 10. The price , the staff and of course location. 
Thanks Hotel and thanks Adele for making it a great stay again.",5,2022,09,04
137,British Hospitality at it’s Best!,"From the moment you enter the front door you know this in not your typical hotel. Old world elegance, great service from people who truly care and very comfortable rooms.  The air conditioning was probably the best we’ve had, very much appreciated during London’s recent heat wave.  Very nice lounge and breakfast, and the grill restaurant at the Rueben’s next door (affiliated) was amazing.",5,2022,08,27
137,Greatest hotel In London,"It is hard to describe what a stay at Hotel 41 is like. There is no doubt in my mind that it is the finest hotel in London. We have traveled to all parts of the world and 41 is undeniably our favorite hotel. From the moment you step out of the cab to the moment you leave; your every request is fulfilled. The staff are some of the finest people you will ever meet. The aroma therapy throughout the hotel is intoxicating. Upon arrival, you are greeted with a complementary glass of champagne and that is only the beginning of world class service. They offer a wonderful executive lounge that is open 24 hours, with complementary snacks and drinks. The bedrooms are beautifully appointed, and the showers are amazing. The bed and linen are top of the line. Absolutely heavenly.",5,2022,08,27
137,The ultimate personal 5 Star  hotels in the World.,"We have been privileged to stay at many 5 Star hotels around the world London included, however Hotel 41 is a true “Diamond” .
It is just not the uniqueness of this hotel rooms but the level of service provided by its totally “commitment staff “ to excellence and personal attention. 

Over the past 7 or 8 years we have got to know all members of its staff, from the leader Mr Malcolm Hendry GM,
Andrew Muir & Dean Sparrow, In full charge of all things wonderful about the very professional yet, “personal service”  

I fully recommend on your next visit to London, treat yourself to a Royal stay at Hotel 41, looking out over Buckingham Palace!

Thanks for the wonderful experience yet again!

137,Hotel and staff are as close to perfection as possible.,"Wow. Just WOW. Hotel 41 is something very, very special. Immaculately presented, the common area was just stunning. Canapes and champagne on arrival whilst you are taken through the check in process.
Our 2 story Junior Suite was out of this world luxurious. 
The common rooftop area along with their own bee hives (in the centre of London mind you) is a place to get away from it all. The staff. I can only equate the professionalism and attentiveness to that of Kato from the Pink Panther movies. The staff pop up everywhere and at anytime ready to fulfill your requests. Dean, the assistant manager, WAS JUST WONDERFUL. Warm, approachable and very hands on, he is an asset the company would do well to do whatever it takes to hang on to him, should he ever wish to leave. Then there's Alex. Alex had only been there a week and a half. Alex too was exceptional. We requested Alex to take us through our 1st and also HIS 1ST Sabage, which he duly did with precision and coupled it with all its regalia. What an awesome experience. Thank you Dean and Alex. 
The night staff, Steph and James too were wonderful. Chatting with us until the early hours of the morning also made for funny and unforgettable great times.
The food. WOW WOW WOW. Let me start by saying, simply stunning. The full breakfast was probably enough for 2 let alone 1. I cannot recommend the high tea 
enough. We booked for 2. Was it worth the cost...I WOULD HAVE PAID DOUBLE it was that good. 
The wine menu was also fantastic. I ordered a 2018 vintage dry white. Delivered by Gabriel, he took the time to chat about this particular wine. Outstanding Gabriel. Thank you.
Every single staff member of Hotel 41 was exceptional. I cannot fault Hotel 41 nor it's staff in anyway at all. In fact, nothing I say can truly encapsulates just how amazingly good the hotel and staff are. Words do not do either justice.
I am back to the UK in March 2023. I look forward to again having the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41.",5,2022,08,24
137,Hotel Perfection,"My wife and I just completed a nine night stay at Hotel 41.  All aspects of this hotel are outstanding:  friendly, helpful, warm and attentive staff, great food, a wonderful lobby space for breakfast, tea, and late night glasses of wine/champagne or cocktails, an outdoor rooftop area for cocktails or just hanging out, no surprises on the final bill, and a central location in London.  If you are looking for the perfect hotel for a short or long stay in London, this is the place.
We stayed in the Conservatory Suite, which has a large glass conservatory roof over the bedroom (with two electric retractable privacy shades), as well as two bathrooms (the downstairs one has a toilet and sink, while the upstairs one is very spacious and includes (along with a toilet and sink) a large jacuzzi style bathtub and a fabulous shower stall), a separate sitting area on the lower level, two work areas, three televisions, and massive amounts of storage space for your clothing.",5,2022,08,22
137,Perfect from beginning to end!,"Hotel 41 is absolute perfection.  The attention to detail, service and staff are all top notch.  I loved returning after a day out to Hotel 41.

The staff can’t do enough for you. Gorgeous executive lounge. We will definitely return. Massive thank you to all the amazing staff.,5,2022,08,08
137,"A most wonderful stay, pure relaxation and comfort","We decided to stay for three nights for our 10th wedding anniversary whilst we explored London and visited Goodwood for the races.

The standards of all our our service, the friendliness of the staff and the quality of all the good were second to none. Nothing felt stuffy, the staff were just all there to ensure we were happy and looked after.

We asked for feather pillows- no problem, we left our luggage with them whilst we enjoyed London on our last day- no problem, we had a parcel delivered a week after due date and they are posting it to us FOC- no problem.

No matter what time of day there will be tea and scones, arrival snacks, evening canapés that await you and in the evening when coming back from shows etc there is a wonderful pantry to plunder with cheeses, fruit, cakes and more.

Our room was lovely, a tad small for us as I had to navigate the large tv to get down my side of the bed and my 6ft2 husband struggled with the fixed shower head height but we were ultimately very comfortable.

Lovely hotel scent everywhere and a feeling of comfort in every part, we didn’t get to the roof terrace but wish we had.",5,2022,08,08
137,A Perfect Hotel and well kept secret,"We traveled as an American family of 4 including 2 teenage daughters - with 2 rooms, one king room and one room with 2 twins.  Both were beautifully appointed with equal care and attentiveness from housekeeping. The location was perfect.  Close to Victoria station, easy walking to sites if you’d like but also always easy to catch a cab if you’d prefer. The service at all levels was exceptional. We particularly enjoyed that it was a residents only hotel that felt like our own private respite from the “busy” of the city.  Breakfast was substantial (not just American continental) and the other complimentary snacks throughout the day including “plunder the pantry” added to the total experience.  I have nothing negative to say about this hotel.  It is a best kept secret that i selfishly want to remain secret.  We will definitely return again.",5,2022,08,06

Review of Hotel 41
Pending review
I was traveling alone on a one night stopover in London on route back to the U.S. It was a rare moment to myself to breathe after spending 6 weeks, 24/7 with my teenage daughter and in-laws. But, I couldn't have anticipated how wonderful the experience at 41 was going to be.  It was like getting a brief chance to experience what I imagine life must be like for the Queen. As I walked out of the doors of this spectacular hotel and around the neighborhood, I realized that I was spontaneously grinning.  I couldn't believe my good fortune.

The staff at 41 are exceptional. From the moment I walked in the door I was met with sincere (but never overbearing) warmth, kindness, and a level of professionalism beyond any I have ever experienced in a hotel setting, or any other customer service experience for that matter. Every single member of the team was absolutely wonderful. Their attention to detail, anticipation of the clients needs, and desire to go above and beyond were extraordinary.

Being that my stay was so short, I had just enough time to explore the neighborhood on foot for an hour or so...the location was ideal--a 2 minute walk to Buckingham Palace and St. James Park, beautiful little pubs abound, and easy access to the tube. Central, safe, and just the right level of bustling.

The hotel itself was gorgeous--intimate but not stifling. The executive lounge/dining room was sophisticated but not stuffy. Stand out examples of what made 41 especially comfortable: A dreamlike bed, lovely robe, and little touches like an Elemis ""quiet mind"" pillow spray in an organza bag left on the bed upon arrival--even the chairs in the executive club seemed designed to make one feel at ease while enjoying a gorgeous breakfast.

Spotlessly clean, from top to bottom. Un excellent rapport qualité-prix! If you have the chance to stay here, take it.",5,2022,08,04
137,First Rate Hotel,"This is an excellent boutique hotel.  Our room was well appointed and clean.  The staff is first rate, friendly and helpful.  The ""Executive Lounge"" is an all-day and evening setting for food and drink.  The hotel is very well located in Central London.  One of our favorite hotels anywhere.",5,2022,07,28
137,Fantastic Experience!,"This was without doubt the finest hotel I have stayed in. We booked direct with the hotel for a couples experience to celebrate my wife’s 40th birthday which was during lockdown. The wait was worth it. On arrival we were greeted by a friendly receptionist and then a couple of minutes later a gentleman came down to take us up to the main reception on the 5th floor.
He was fantastic and offered us complimentary champagne and snacks whilst he processed our check in and made sure our room was ready.
A few moments later he took us to our room and informed us that they had upgraded us to a suite. This was wholly unexpected and a wonderful surprise. 
The suite was amazing with a separate living room with bathroom and a bedroom with a huge bed and sofas. It was spectacular. 
The little touches throughout our short stay such as a cake and macaroons to celebrate my wife’s birthday were just great.
Everyone who greeted us was super friendly. I can’t thank the staff enough - it was just a great experience from start to finish and I honestly cannot find one single criticism.
Thank you so much.",5,2022,07,25
137,Week stay at the 41,I just finished a week long stay at Hotel 41 with my wife and we are totally spoiled.From the time we were greeted the first day by Steve and Esma until checking out with Adele we felt like we were members of the family.Everyday started with a wonderful English breakfast and ended with a raid on the pantry for snacks late in the night.Our room was very comfortable and surprisingly quite and very convenient only steps to breakfast.The shower being a bit small was the only negative.Everyone was very helpful setting up diners and buying show tickets.The location was excellent right next to buckingham palace.We walked nearly everywhere and the Victoria tube station was just a block away.We can’t wait to visit again.,5,2022,07,24
137,Felt like we were staying at Buckingham Palace,"We stayed in two rooms with our two teenage sons for 5 nights last month on a two week UK trip and this was a delightful place to begin our adventure.  It is like a little secret and we felt completely at home there.  The rooms are a little bit on the small side, but were perfectly appointed and oh so comfortable.  We loved the food, and experienced all the meals including tea at some point during our stay.  We also loved being able to get delicious snacks and treats all day and evening and just were overall delighted by the staff, the location, the attention to detail and the feeling of home.",5,2022,07,21
137,Best Boutique Hotel In London,"All the positive reviews about this hotel were right on.  Staff is amazing (Steve, Ali and Deryn) and makes you feel like family with every interaction.   The Executive Room is a great place to hang out with tasty snacks around the clock.  Regular rooms aren't huge but super cozy.  Location is great next to Buckingham Palace and close to beautiful parks.  Would stay again at this over-achieving hotel time and time again!!",5,2022,07,19
137,Highly recommended,"We have visited this hotel several times recently and we have always thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The staff are amazing.  We had a slight issue on our latest stay (nothing major), but the hotel reacted perfectly to put things right.  My mantra has always been not too judge a business on an error or mistake but how they respond / rectify it - on this note, Hotel 41 went above and beyond.  We will be back soon ……",5,2022,07,15
137,The Best service you will receive anywhere!,"We spent 3 week and traveled all over the UK.  We only stayed at the the very best hotels (all 5 stars) and Hotel 41 offers the the finest service in all of the UK.  We have stayed at their sister property, the Ashford Castle, which is one of the best resorts in the world, but the experience here feels like you are a member of the the most exclusive club in the world.",5,2022,07,12
137,"Highly Recommend, Must Stay Here!","What an experience! Absolutely impeccable service, people, and place, starting with the champagne checkin to the beautiful room, snacks, plundering the pantry … I can’t say enough. The rooftop bar is fabulous and the perfect way to feel as if you’re in another world. Actually, everything about 41 Hotel feels like you’re in another world. The location is perfect  — just a 5 - 10 minute walk to Victoria stations (tube, train, coach), close to restaurants, a great location for Hyde Park concerts. The room was fabulous — and the service again — they even neatly  wrapped our USB cords with velcro. Every member of the 41 staff was delightful! Esin, Ellie, and other names I didn’t write down made the experience beyond expectations. I love this place and will definitely stay again. I wish I could give more stars because they would be well deserved!",5,2022,07,11
137,Hotel 41: World Class,"From the moment I stepped through the front doors, I was struck by the friendly, welcoming, attentive and hospitable staff. It was a level of hospitality rarely seen. The Hotel is extremely stylishly decorated...a perfect mix of class and yet comfortable. My favorite was to go up to the rooftop terrace, order a Gin and Tonic. Hotel 41 and their amazing team are world class...cheers to that!",5,2022,07,10

137,London Jewel,"Hotel 41 is my new favorite hotel in the world. It's location is perfect. But the main draw is the exquisite service and amenities other hotels don't even imagine.

137,A Hidden Gem,"This was probably the best hotel experience I’ve ever had in all my travels. The hotel is small  and the rooms are cozy but the service is big! They pay attention to every detail to make your stay comfortable. You’re well looked after. The executive lounge is the heartbeat of the hotel. They always have something complimentary on offer at all hours of the day and night. Staff were helpful and courteous and went out of their way for us. It’s in a fantastic area, within walking distance to many of the sites. Definitely give it a try.",5,2022,06,29
137,Exquisite luxury boutique hotel,"This is a totally splendid small five star - at least - hotel. Perfect central location, within walking distance from several must-sees in London, and three minutes walk from Victoria tube station. The hotel comprises just a few - twenty-ish - rooms located on the fifth floor in a charming old building. Service, staff, interior, rooms, yes everything, is totally impeccable. It's not cheap, but I say you get value for money with a lot of staff, and very personal treatment as a guest: The staff know personally who you are, they address you with your name and you are never asked to sign a bill for a drink and so forth. Large and beautiful rooms - even for British conditions. Beautiful and nice lounge where you also eat a perfect breakfast with all the variations you should expect in England: The Full English B was splendid! And personally served without delays. The only minor drawbacks I could mention is that the location in Buckingham Palace Road can be quite noisy from car traffic (however it was quiet at night). To summarize, this is a hotel I can really recommend to anyone who is looking for a five star stay in central London.",5,2022,06,28
137,Partners 60th birthday treat - 25th/26th June,What a wonderful hotel! Right from booking with support from the great Victoria to having the car collected from directly outside the hotel - greeted and  looked after by lovely helpful caring staff - Steve Jones greeted us with champagne and directed us to what was offered along with the history of the hotel - lovely black and white quirky room - fabulous food - the curry room is a great experience- and the whole experience was truly marvellous making my partners celebration perfect- and of course right next to Buckingham Palace and near to the theatre district- absolutely fabulous- well done to you all X,5,2022,06,28
137,"Class, Style & Luxury","Luxury hotel with incredible service and perks.  Everyone instantly knows who you are and are ready to serve you in any way.  You are treated with great respect.  Rooms are lovely,  The executive lounge is incredible.  Raiding the pantry at 8 PM is a must.  Great location too.",5,2022,06,27
137,Exceptional in every way,"I couldn’t be more pleased with my experience at Hotel 41. I was greeted with a complimentary champagne and relaxed in the stunning executive lounge. They serve a delicious breakfast there each morning but also have tasty treats available until 1am. There wasn’t a request or a question that wasn’t handled quickly and with a friendly approach. The staff truly became family to our group of 3 ladies traveling together. They were protective and warm and assisted with securing reservations when needed. I will definitely return to the small, luxurious gem near Buckingham Palace.",5,2022,06,25
137,Amazing hotel not to be missed,I recently stayed at the Hotel 41 for several days and was pleasantly surprised by what an enjoyable experience it was.  This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at.  The service at the hotel is amazing. Every staff member knew our names from the minute we arrived and they went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable.  The rooms were very comfortable.  We had an issue with a light in our room and a maintenance man came on a Sunday evening and cheerfully handled it.  There is a beautiful lounge available 24 hours a day with food and drinks. We ate a delicious breakfast there every morning. Great location near Buckingham Palace and the Victoria Palace Theatre where we saw Hamilton.  I will definitely stay there again and highly recommend it.,5,2022,06,22
137,The best way to end the trip!!,Asmaa and Steve definitely know how to make you feel welcome. The hotel is beautiful and is a great place to relax and feel at home after a wonderful trip!! Steve whips up an awesome Negroni as well as other cocktails. #attention to detail. Thank you Hotel 41!!,5,2022,06,21
137,The perfect getaway,"This was our second stay at the 41; we have stayed at a number of hotels in London but the 41 has become our favorite. It is a warm and intimate setting.  The staff is very friendly, competent and couldn’t be more accommodating (even when you’re cranky from lack of sleep)!!  The location is close to all the things you’ll want to see and very close to rail and bus transportation. We’re already looking forward to our next stay.",5,2022,06,19
137,A Gem of a Hotel in the Heart of Royal London,"Hotel 41 is a jewel of a hotel. The rooms are beautiful, comfortable and very clean.

The location can't be beat -- it is literally across the street from Buckingham Palace. I can't wait to visit, again!",5,2022,06,16
137,Excellent,"As usual, the staff and experience were wonderful. We could treat the hotel as a home where we were pampered. Our time in the lounge in the evenings, meeting and talking to staff and guests was just delightful. In our life of travel, we don’t think we have ever met such an attentive and well-trained staff. This is especially impressive during this difficult time of hiring and retaining staff.",5,2022,06,10
137,Great stay at Hotel 41,"I felt compelled to write a review about my stay at Hotel 41. To be perfectly honest this is not my normal level of hotel as it is not cheap. It was a huge splurge for me and my granddaughter. The staff are tremendous as I was feeling a little intimidated, but they were all sweet and welcoming. I especially want to mention Adele who is so excellent in every aspect of her job from being open and friendly to problem management. Also, Esin is so warm and friendly. The rooms are lovely with comfortable beds and spacious bathroom. Nice touches like turn down service with chocolate or a nice pillow spray. One night we sent to see Mary Poppins and they left a glowing message on the bathroom mirror when we got back hoping we enjoyed the show. Notes wishing us a good day..just little touches that put this Hotel over the top. The complimentary snacks and small plates are great! Complimentary Jude’s ice cream completely impressed my granddaughter!!",5,2022,06,03
137,It just doesn't get any better,"The staff at this hotel is the best I've ever seen. From the reception to the servers in the lounge where you have breakfast and several complimentary snacks. The maids were so caring! But especially the lounge staff, who tirelessly cancelled reservations, got me medical care, and asked constantly how i was (yes I got covid!) The rooms are smallish, but very comfortable. I would go back in a minute!",5,2022,06,02
137,"One of the best hotels in London, if not the Best!","I have recently become familiar with the Red Carnation Brand and I must say, I love everything about it! they truly make you feel at home. 
The staff is incredibly attentive, the rooms are beautiful and no request is too small. 
Check-in Process: 
Esma from front desk was just amazing, very bubbly and full of life and made the check-in process incredibly fun!
Rooms: the Conservatory suite is to die for - the bed is very comfortable, the room is spacious, lots of storage space. truly a beautiful suite. 
Lounge: the staff are very attentive and they will make sure that all your needs are taken care of. the food is exquisite, often in lounges, the food can be average however the food there was freshly made with lots of choices. 

We booked the private cinema experience which is highly recommended, we opted for the Romantic evening (we had a bottle of champagne, chocolate covered strawberries and lots and lots of candies and popcorn!). 

Luxury is service (people anticipating what you want) and they simply excel at it! Highly recommend Hotel 41 - will definitely be back.",5,2022,05,26

The staff were exceptional and the whole feeling of the place is an intimate private VIP club. Room is great and very comfortable. Location is fantastic. Can walk everywhere and Victoria station is right there. The snacks are fantastic. Only complaints is that I was introduced to a very fine red wine. So now, I have to try to get it in the US. You get the royal treatment. We stayed 4 nights. They helped us book a day trip to Bath.. I so recommend.",5,2022,05,16
137,Perfect 10,"Was I dreaming?...

Had the most amazing few days at Hotel 41 celebrating my birthday! From the moment I stepped foot into hotel 41, everything was a perfect 10. 

A warm welcome in the lobby, and then greeted again with affection in the executive lounge and handed a glass of champagne, whilst hubby sipped a glass of merlot.

The room was cosy and clean, with a fire place and small seating area. All the expected amenities in a luxury 5 star pad, and added personal touches included a welcome letter, macaroons and birthday cake.

We enjoyed canapes and drinks before heading off to the cinema, returning to plunder the pantry with a bowl of hot chicken pie and salad, and naughty but nice desserts at midnight.

The turned down room awaited us, as the fire warmed our toes and we reflected on the day,  and looked forward to a second day of celebrations.

In the morning, I stretched my body into familiar yoga poses whilst looking up to the blue sky, the sun shining on my face, alone on the roof top of hotel 41...what a way to start my birthday! 

A special breakfast hot chocolate with cream and a flake, followed by a full English breakfast, just how we like it, made for the perfect morning. 

Off for some retail therapy at Harrods, a ten minute stroll away, the sun was beaming and we had the perfect base in London, central to all the places we wanted to visit. 

We returned for another evening of canapes but this time, we sat on the intimate roof top and enjoyed the evening breeze before a fun night at the theatre and home to Hotel 41, what more could we want! 

The pantry was stocked and waiting for us when we returned, the service  impeccable, a lovely way to end another great night on the town.  

Another amazing morning with roof top Yoga, a filling breakfast and a complimentary later check out. 

Top mark for customer service, for care and kindness, and for making my birthday so special.

It wasn't a dream but hotel 41 is dreamy! Can't wait to book another stay. 

Thank you to the dream team at hotel 41, the best hotel in London!",5,2022,05,14
137,I honestly don’t think you could do better than 41….,"I’m not sure you can do better than the 41. This was a bit of a splurge for our 20th and it was worth every penny and then some. Though this is not our typical level of hotel, not once did anyone make us feel like we didn’t belong. All staff bent over backwards to make our stay as comfortable and memorable as possible. Rose petals and candles on the nightstands, a handwritten happy anniversary message on the mirror, a little something on the pillow every night….they know how to make you feel special. I am so glad I made this reservation and wouldn’t hesitate for a second to make it my first choice if we were to return to London one day.",5,2022,05,13
137,Small hotel with big personality,"Brilliant small hotel. Quirky layout of just 30 rooms allows a real sense of intimacy. I was there just 36 hours and was amazed to find staff knew my name, where I was heading next and what I’d done for the day. A bag of snacks sitting in my room before departure with a hand written note wishing me safe travels on my flight back to Australia. Very impressive",5,2022,05,11

The location cannot be beat - we love to stroll through St. James Park and love to visit central London.  The service cannot be matched.  Each and every employee was knowledgeable, friendly, and caring.  Their evening turn down service was the best we’ve had anywhere in the world.  The calm environment and wonderful food and beverages in the Executive Lounge provided a calm start and end to our day - and afternoon tea allowed us to refresh before dinner.  Waking up in the states today and sooooo missing our lovely space there!  Thank you to the amazing staff who made our visit so special!!!",5,2022,05,11

I’ve been visiting for several years and you’re always made to feel part of the family. This was a first time visit for my parents and the Hotel 41 team did not disappoint. Even by Hotel 41 standards they were superb, always seeking to give the best possible experience.

It’s certainly not cheap, but it’s an experience and you quickly realise the value the team provide.",5,2022,05,08
137,The best hotel in London without question,"This is London's only real 5***** hotel. We have stayed at all of the others...the icons of Mayfair and  Park Lane but none compare with Hotel 41.

they have a thing called plunder the pantry for dinner time and there is judes farm ice 
cream 
the rooms are the best and confy beds 
and good toileteries 
it is close to victoria train station 
the staff are kind and helpful and nice 
they have coffie machines in the rooms 
the brekfasts are good 
i would recomend the pancakes and the eggs benidict 
the rooms are really clean",5,2022,05,04
137,A wonderful club-like choice.,"A wonderful intimate hotel that feels like a private members club. The lounge is splendidly British, where you can spend hours as if it, in and of itself, was the purpose of the visit. Service is immaculate and the staff is beyond first class. 
Cons: while bordering with Buckingham Palace, the street has a ""spillover"" sensation from bustle of Victoria Station. 
Bottom line: Go, absolutely.",5,2022,05,02
137,Always brilliant!,"A quick 48 hours in a gem in a bustling city makes it feel like time is almost still. From the first Champaign upon arrival to the pantry our stay was brilliant. We decided to have breakfast both mornings and both meals were absolute perfection, every night was capped with cocktails in the lounge with sweets and snacks. We’ll be back again soon!",5,2022,05,01
137,Great again!,"We stayed 3 nights at the end of our 3 week trip, we have traditionally stayed here at the beginning of our trips and staying at the end felt really special.  This trip started in Milan which is the only reason we didn't stay here at the beginning of the trip, once again the service was fantastic.  We really think of this as our home away from home, which is pretty strange because nobody serves us drinks, breakfast, makes reservations, etc at our house!  Anyway, we really enjoy the location, the evening banter with Steve is probably our absolutely favorite thing.  Ellie was new for us this trip, but she was also delightful!  

I took some time and read the negative reviews before I wrote this review, there aren't many so it didn't take long.  I understand some of the viewpoints but disagree with the negative aspects.  This is a smaller hotel, it has some quirks but that is one of the things we find charming about it, maybe that is not for everybody.  If you are looking for a ""standard"" 5 star Hotel room that could be anywhere then maybe this isn't the choice for you, but if you are looking for a comfortable environment in an unbelievable location with fantastic service then give Hotel 41 a try.",5,2022,04,24
137,3 day stay,"Stayed for three days and must say this has been the most enjoyable experience one could have ever asked for. From the moment you turn up you are the most important thing, customer service on a different level. Champagne on arrival whilst booking in, room top quality, plunder the pantry excellent for nibbles with drinks during the day. I cannot thank everyone enough for a fantastic stay. 

Hotel 41 staff excellent customer service.",5,2022,04,21
137,Another Brilliant stay,"It’s fair to say we’ve stayed at 41 a few times. We treat this as our home-away-from-home in London. There are many great things:
1. The service level is always ‘just right’
2. The staff are brilliant and nothing is ever ‘too much’. The fact that so many of them stay and turnover seems low says a great deal about the hotel and the ethos of the owners. I understand this as my staff only tend to leave when they have to. This keeps a stability and clients/guests love stability when they’re frequent users of a service. This marks 41 out against others who may choose to declare themselves as 5 star. 
3. We’re not quite at the point of having stayed in every room but we have been in a lot of them and they’re all great with enough individuality to make them each of their own kind. I couldn’t recommend one particular room but I’d certainly recommend the split-level junior suites. We usually book an executive double and that’s perfect for us for a weekend.
4. The pantry is great and perfect for a bit of snacking particularly if you don’t want a full meal at any point.
5. The executive lounge is a real oasis of calm from the bustle of London. In fact, the calm starts the moment you walk in to the lobby. 
6. Whatever the cost it’s certainly a lot more cost effective than buying a property in central London! 
7. The hotel is always perfectly presented and there never seems to be a time where it looks like it needs a refurbishment. I guess there’s an ongoing program of repairs we just never see (apart from the missing chandelier a couple of months ago! ;) )

It does rather set a high bar and I guess if you want a hotel which will cater to all your needs with understated luxury then this is it. If you want one with a big name, big price, a big lobby and average rooms then this is not it. There’s a reason we keep coming back.",5,2022,04,19
137,"Exceptionally enjoyable experience, very personalised service, fabulous location and a taste of luxury.","Absolutely loved our stay, perfect location to explore London, however more importantly the standards of service along with the attention to detail, personal touches give this hotel the rating it deserves. Having stopped in many hotels across London this one is for me a favourite, the feel of a private members club. We will be back to plunder the pantry, delicious.",5,2022,04,13
137,Every stay is amazing!,"I've been staying at 41 almost every year for the past 10+ years, and I keep coming back for the amazing decor, the beautiful rooms, the unmatched friendliness of the staff and the level of service that is simply above and beyond every other hotel I have ever experienced. This is simply the best hotel, not just in London, but the world, as far as I am concerned.

A great place to stay year round, although my favourite time at 41 is always the cold winter months around Christmas to New Year's Day. The lounge is my favourite  place to relax at anytime of day, with a great selection of drinks. 

The staff are amazing at recommending and securing dining reservations. I've had great experiences at restaurants I would have never found if not for the team's recommendations. They are also incredibly helpful with all my requests. I always enjoyed chatting with Steve, and I learned a lot about the various beverages from him.

Simply the best.",5,2022,04,12
137,What a Treat!,"This is a fabulous hotel with beautiful decor, which is comfortable and luxurious. But the thing that sets it apart is the staff.  They all manage to make you feel as if you are their special guest, maintaining a friendly, relaxed manner as they do all they can to make you feel at home...but a pampered home!
We have been to celebrate some special occasions over the years and have never been disappointed.",5,2022,04,11
137,Another Fabulous Stay,"From the moment of arrival to departure, our stay was perfect. The outstanding staff ensured we were looked after in this beautifully luxurious hotel. We are regulars and always made to feel like valued customers.",5,2022,04,11
137,I'd forgotten how good it is,"It really is a cut above everything else. The rooms are amazing, but it's the team that makes it amazing, nothing is too much trouble and they seem able to anticipate your every need. I can't recommend enough!",5,2022,04,02
137,Well Worth It!!,"Wow, just wow! What an exceptional experience we had. We were brought a night away by my partners mother as an early wedding present as we are getting married in June. We didn’t know what to expect as we have never stayed in a London 5* hotel before and this one did not disappoint! 
From the moment we stepped in the staff were so courteous and helpful. 
We were taken to the Hotels lounge where we were greeted again, but lovely staff, a glass of champagne and some nibbles. 
We were left to relax and unwind by the fire which is lovely when you just arrive into London. 
The staff were asking us about our stay and we mentioned our wedding was in a couple of months to which they went above and beyond to make our stay magic. 
They upgraded our room, and made lovely little gestures including writing on our mirror a lovely wedding message! 
We would love to return again & we just wanted to say a massive thank you to everyone there!!!",5,2022,04,01
137,Brilliant place to stay!,"We were looking for a special place to stay for my husband's 60th birthday weekend and from the moment we stepped into this hotel, we were transported to a different world. Everything is elegantly decorated and the staff very welcoming and friendly. 

We were welcomed with a glass of good champagne and snacks (the olives had been marinated and were amazing!). We were then taken to our room which was lovely and had every extra in the room you could think of. I have not stayed in a hotel room with so many extras!

The hotel generously offered free snacks and chocolates in their dining room which we could help ourselves to at any time. It is well situated and fortunately quiet enough to enjoy our night's sleep in the very comfy bed. 

Highly recommended!",5,2022,03,30
137,Unbelieveable,"My wife and I stayed at the 41 on Saturday/Sunday 19th/20th March. Only thing I can say is, it is absolutely amazing! The staff, the building, the rooms are all out of this world. The food was superb although we only had breakfast, and ""plundered the pantry"" on a couple of evenings. The full english breakfast was exquisit. The room was fab, and the romantic turndown was the icing on a particularly super cake. I can't praise this Hotel and the staff highly enough. They made a super weekend into something we will never forget. Thank you all, and we WILL see you again soon.",5,2022,03,27
137,One of the best parts of our trip to England!,"We wish we could rate this hotel even more than 5 stars as our whole family (4 teenagers and two adults) cannot stop raving about the entire experience. The people (from servers to concierge), food, location, rooms could not be better. There is a cozy “living room” that serves as a meeting place in the evenings where drinks, food and free ice cream (the teens loved this) were served. We played cards there as a family every night as we had 3 rooms. Each of our rooms were different but all cozy. The hotel did the little things- like notes written in the mirror for the kids- well and made us feel at home for our visit. We cannot thank Hotel 41 enough for making our kids’ first trip to London so memorable. We had a friend from home insist we stay here and it exceeded our expectations!",5,2022,03,26
137,A hotel that lives up to its promise,"From the moment you arrive you’re made to feel welcome & the staff do an amazing job to make your stay feel special. 

From check in to check out nothing is too much for them and the hotel is full of lovely surprises. 

From the welcome glass of champagne to afternoon tea & the croque monsieur to the evening delights, this is without all the goodies available to help yourself too throughout the day (the black coconut ice cream is delightful). 

The hotel itself is spacious & the rooms are comfortable & luxurious, there’s even a little surprise when you arrive in there too. 

The drinks menu is vast with a good selection cocktails and whilst we didn’t eat in the hotel, there are good food options in and around.

The choice at breakfast was also vast, everything looked great, we went for the smoked salmon & poached eggs & the full English, both were delicious (and you had access to the continental menu too).

Thanks for making our stay such a pleasant one & we hope to be back again in the future",5,2022,03,24
137,Penny Square Restaurant,"I had dinner at the main restaurant, Penny Square, It was lovely. Great tasty food. Definitely a must try in East London. Received a very attentive service by Konrad and Matyas, amazing guys. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone.",5,2022,03,13
137,We know why it's always #1!,"We have been staying at the Hotel 41 for years. And after every stay, we remember why we we always come back. It's a true 5 star experience. The staff remembers you throughout the stay and is always welcoming and accommodating.

It's like staying in a posh London manor where you are a house guest. Feels warm and intimate but you don't lose your privacy as in a bed and breakfast. Every room is insulated from noise and other guests. Yet, the inviting lounge is just steps away and open 24/7. We especially like the lounge hosts where every request is met with ""of course, right away"". A special shout to Steve, one of the lounge hosts, and who is a main reason we come back year after year.",5,2022,03,08
137,Attentiveness of staff was exemplary.,"A hidden gem. Small hotel that really makes you feel at home. Staff were unbelievably attentive and hospitality of the hotel amazing. Exceeded our expectations in many ways.  Whilst the facilities were limited the hotel made up for in many other ways. The rooms were spacious and clean, executive lounge welcoming.",5,2022,03,04
137,Fantastic Stay for a Special Birthday with Friends,What a fantastic hotel. Absolutely 10/10 on all fronts which made a very special birthday even more amazing. They make hospitality look easy. Felt like home from home. Location in Victoria on Buckingham Palace Road again was spot on for what we needed. Highly recommend Hotel 41!!,5,2022,03,03
137,third time at this hotel,"great location to Victoria underground and theatres
 fantastic service from the hotel

137,Top class stay!,"Absolutely outstanding customer service! Amazing rooms and top class hospitality. I really couldn’t fault it. The food, the room, the facilities, the staff, the location. We were made to feel very special, I would highly recommend this hotel. Nothing was too much trouble!",5,2022,03,02
137,I can't wait to go back!!!,"This hotel was amazing! My husband surprised me with a trip to London for our 5 year anniversary and we stayed here at Hotel 41!! The room and staff were amazing. They were so friendly and accommodating! They brought us special treats to celebrate our anniversary (and Valentines day) it was perfect! The stuff knew the places to go and the advice they gave us on things to see and places to eat were fantastic, we were impressed! We wanted the full London experience from Sunday roast to bar hopping in Soho (try the Pornstar Martini it is the best). We can't wait to go back this will be our forever spot to stay!!! Thank you so much for making this a wonderful trip for us! We've told all our friends and hope they visit too!! I have to be honest Hotel 41 was our first stop of this adventure and I wish we never left! Thank you again-The Rodgers",5,2022,02,26
137,Short break to London,"Look no further than Hotel 41 if you are looking for an excellent stay in a wonderful hotel based in the heart of London, with Buckingham Palace just a few minutes walk down the road. The hotel is superb, with very friendly staff, where nothing is too much trouble to make your stay a fantastic experience. Very upmarket and would highly recommend. With regards the staff, we have stayed in many hotels around the world and would consider Hotel 41 to be the most courteous.",5,2022,02,25
137,Praise where praise is due,"We stumbled upon Hotel 41 by accident over 10 years ago.  We have been privileged to stay in some exclusive hotels but have learnt a simple fact.
Hotels are only buildings it’s the staff that make the difference between that simple fact and a memorable experience and this is where Hotel 41 exceeds. 
It is our 9th stay here and wewould like to say again a big thank you to all at Hotel 41",5,2022,02,23
137,Truly 5 star.,"Best hotel I’ve ever stayed in in the UK. The service is attentive and friendly, yet not intrusive or annoying. The complimentary snacks in the pantry were a great detail and the birthday cake and sleep spray left in our bedroom were a lovely touch. The breakfast was amazing, a mixture of cooked and continental, with a lot to choose from. Also the hotel is in a great destination, 5 mins from Victoria station and 5 mins from Buckingham palace. I would love to come back soon, hopefully in the summer to try out their rooftop terrace bar/garden!",5,2022,02,22
137,City break for birthday made extra special by a special hotel,"Exceptional hotel with the friendliest and most helpful staff I have encountered. We went to some shows for my birthday and surprises and treats were left in the room that added to the experience. The hotel is next to Buckingham Palace and we were treated like royalty. Nothing was too much trouble.
Phenomenal breakfast and very attentive waiting staff. I would highly recommend. We stayed an extra night due to a cancelled flight and fortunately another room was available. 
This was my second visit to 41 and we will definitely be back. Can’t recommend highly enough.",5,2022,02,21
137,"Always excellent, Londons number 1 hotel","The hotel is amazing,The staff are wonderful from the minute you walk in the door until you checkout, the beds are super comfy and I always have a fab nights sleep, 
I would fully recommend Hotel 41 - to my family it is the number 1 hotel in London + we would not stay anywhere else. Excellent customer service from all especially Andrew, Adele, and Marlin and Dean",5,2022,02,21
137,Just perfect,Usually we stayed in another 5 star hotel in London. This time we decided to stay here which was really a great decision. Its a small very familiar hotel with a unique concept in service. The attention to detail is incredibly!! The turndownservice with turning on the fireplace. Light up a candle in the bathrom and preparing the tv is unique. We‘re definitly gonna come back in this hotel!,5,2022,02,20
137,Another impeccable stay at Hotel 41,"I travelled to London mid October of 2021; issues with the pandemic had made travel and accommodations difficult; however as always Hotel 41 stepped up to help me in each and every way. I had a significant delay with my flat rental and needed to find a place for an additional two weeks duration; the staff stepped up to make sure I was well taken care of and that I had a good place to stay for this extended period. The service was once again amazing. I can't rate Hotel 41 high enough, and give it my highest recommendation.",5,2022,02,19
137,Our love affair with Hotel 41,"It was a cold winters night when my husband and I checked into Hotel 41 having had an awful experience in another hotel that shall remain nameless, and that’s when the love affair with Hotel 41 began. From the  staffs attention to every detail, the cosy luxury of the rooms; the beautiful signature aroma; turndown with a hot water bottle;;great service; fab location…I could go on. We go back at every opportunity, and we live in London! Our favourite boutique hotel without a doubt!  Thank-you for the memories Hotel 41!
Carol & Paul",5,2022,02,17
137,Like a Private Club,"I travel a lot and stay in many hotels. I’ve been privileged enough to stay in many exceptional hotels. Hotel 41 may be the best hotel I have ever had the pleasure of staying in! It feels like a private club. The hotel is small and exceptionally well decorated. The staff is beyond!, they each know your name immediately and  have a way of providing service that is warm and never stuffy or elite. 
The room I had was wonderful with the most comfortable bed. I received personal notes and small gifts  each night of my stay. There was even a hot bottle warming my sheets when I returned at night.
The executive lounge is amazing. Small but well appointed, it’s where you check in, eat breakfast, grab a drink or tea or whatever you want to eat. And after hours? There’s more food available for “Plunder the Pantry”. My only regret is that I didn’t stay longer. This will be my new place when visiting London and I can’t wait.",5,2022,02,17
137,Another amazing weekend at Hotel 41,"A huge thank you to all the staff at Hotel 41 for making Hannahs birthday so relaxed, fun and enjoyable. There is no other hotel like it, not only in London but anywhere around the world, and we travel a lot. This is the definition of relaxed top tier service. There is nothing to fault. Until next time. Thank you, Pete",5,2022,02,14
137,Loved it,Noisy which was annoying but loved my stay at this hotel as staff were nice and my husband and I felt welcomed at all times would recommend any time as i will be coming back when i come back from france,3,2022,02,13
137,Perfect - 10/10 for Hotel 41!,"A wonderfully luxurious home from home - simply the best! Nothing is too much trouble for the amazing team at Hotel 41. From the minute a guest arrives until checkout - everything is superb.

Check in is the best ever with a complimentary glass of fizz, rooms are superbly comfortable with gorgeous Floris toiletries, complimentary chocolates & Nespresso machine.

In the evening there is either an a La carte menu and the lovely complimentary Plunder the Pantry - served at the table because of Covid precautions.

All in all - it’s perfect at Hotel 41 and my family & I love it!",5,2022,02,12
137,Perfect Birthday weekend,"We arrived for my surprise birthday and I can honestly say it was the best weekend I have ever had. From the moment we arrived we were greeted with a glass of champagne. The room was perfect with everything you needed. We relaxed in the executive lounge in the evenings, in front of the fire with a glass of espresso martini along with the selection of evening snacks, including my favourite, the truffle Camembert. The staff were amazing! On my actually birthday all the staff wished me a happy birthday and I even received a little cake in my room. I can honestly say that this was the best experience and I will be returning",5,2022,02,07
137,1st visit but definitely not the last ,"Booked directly with hotel and almost immediately received the customer preference email so was able to choose any particular type of beverage, or preferences that would make our stay special.  It was a lovely touch that immediately made us feel valued.  

The hotel check in, from the front desk downstairs to the complimentary glass of champagne whilst taking in the rich surroundings of the executive lounge immediately set the tone.  The friendliness and attention to detail every single member of staff afforded us means Hotel 41 is somewhere we will definetly return. 
The pantry with it's never ending supply of complimentary snacks is such a lovely treat as was the turn down service complete with lit fire and hot water bottle in the room, (much appreciated on a cold, damp night in London)
Thank you Hotel 41 we will return. 
",5,2022,02,06
137,Great Hotel and excellent service,"The hotel is very well located, close to many landmarks. 
Even though the hotel is central, our room was very quiet.
The staff was very helpful and really nice. I think this is what makes this hotel special, the service and the attention from the staff.
My wife was pregnant during our stay and we were upgraded (without any request) to a suite. 
The breakfast was also very good. It is a la carte and the choice is pretty large.
Overall, we really had a good time in this Hotel.",5,2022,02,01
137,A hidden gem,What a wonderful hotel this is and we have stayed in many London hotels.  The staff are phenomenal and make your stay so special.  The rooms are lovely and the executive lounge is very special. Staff are extra attentive and the food was fabulous. The afternoon tea was out of this world.  We loved our stay and can’t wait to go back. Very special staff who I can’t name all but Shatish who looked after us at breakfast was so attentive and kind.  Andrew looked after us so well throughout and the young man that looked after us for afternoon tea. The girls were lovely and always made sure we had everything. Thank you.,5,2022,02,01
137,Still our no. 1 Hotel in London!,"I don't begin to understand the algorithm that TripAdvisor uses to determine which is the ""best"", but I imagine percentages of scores and cost are high on the list of considerations. After staying at this delectable hotel about half a dozen times, I took it slightly personally when I saw ahead of our latest visit that Hotel 41 had been knocked off the top of the list. Upon reading some of the usurper's reviews I concluded that the thing that was missing from the no.1 hotel at the time is the one thing that makes Hotel 41 exceptional: the personal service. We're not rich by any stretch of the imagination, but seven years ago my now husband chose to take me to the top rated hotel for my birthday when he proposed, and the special memories created there draw us back every year for a birthday or anniversary. If you're happy with a busy bar or restaurant and the hustle and bustle of a contemporary modern hotel, then an alternative no.1 will be right up your street. But if you prefer a very warm welcome, attentive service and elegant surroundings that make you as sad to leave as if you were saying goodbye to members of your family, then Hotel 41 should be first on your list.",5,2022,01,30
137,An experience we'll never forget.,"Beautiful hotel, but the biggest asset is the intimacy and feeling the place evokes. This is a different League of experience that if you compare to other London attractions is actually incredibly good value in relation to the time you spend here. We were here for my wife's 40th and the staff made every effort to make it special.  If you want to treat yourself and experience london in style, I highly recommend this place.",5,2022,01,29
137,What a special place,"Where to start! The staff at this hotel really make the best experience ever! From arrival to when you leave there is always someone to assist you.  We spent one night for our sons birthday. In his room was a birthday cake. Champagne on arrival by the fire. 
The pantry treats are available all day then hot food in the evening with other delights too! We ate in the curry room in the adjoining Rubén’s hotel but part of the same group. Staff from hotel 41 took us to the restaurant through secret doorways! The curry room again was a great experience with champagne on arrival and more birthday cake. We returned to the executive lounge and spent the rest of the evening in a relaxed atmosphere with drinks by the fire. Talking with staff and in particular Andrew Muir. It was our pleasure talking with you and the attention to detail given to us was out of this world. 
Can not wait to return and visit the new venue in Scotland! ( that’s after ashford castle of course)
Thank you all!",5,2022,01,26
137,Wonderful Hotel,"Wonderful hotel.
Certainly deserves the 5 star rating.
The staff were courteous and very helpful.
The facilities were second to none.
Great location.
I would definitely recommend this hotel and am very much looking forward to staying again.",5,2022,01,24
137,Creating memories with Hotel 41,"Wow what an amazing hotel.  My husband and I were totally spoilt from the moment we arrived to the moment we left.  Nothing is too much trouble and the desire of everyone to ensure your stay is perfect is authentic and very much appreciated.  
From the fabulous upgrade to the tasty treats and first class breakfast - all the little touches are what sets Hotel 41 apart.  We have a weekend of memories and want to say a massive thank you to everyone.",5,2022,01,23
137,Just had two wonderful nights at the gem that is Hotel 41.,"Just had two wonderful nights at the gem that is Hotel 41. Not my first stay but my first solo visit to meet with chums for some post lockdown retail therapy. The amazing team made me so welcome, just like coming to a second home. As always the room was fabulous, with everything a girl could need and although in the centre of London I slept exceptionally well. 
The food is great, the lounge larder is plentiful and extremely tasty, especially after a very tiring day shopping. The extremely thoughtful staff even made sure my room had bath salts and relaxation sleep spray to help me chill out. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel - simply put its wonderful!",5,2022,01,19
137,Outstanding hotel and service.,"Beautiful hotel, with a lovely room and a wonderful lounge in which to relax and enjoy food and beverages. It also had by far the best service we have ever experienced, surpassing that of any other 5-star hotel we have stayed at in Europe or North America. Perfect for any special trip or occasion, and I greatly appreciated celebrating my birthday here. This is now our hotel of choice in London.",5,2022,01,17
137,Perfection,"We visited Hotel 41 this past weekend for the second time. It was even better than I remembered. 

The attentive staff and incredible service make this hotel the gem that it is. 

All of the little touches are just perfection. I was there to celebrate my birthday and I felt so special and spoilt from the moment I arrived to the moment I left. The car journey home was even made better by the hot chocolates they sent us away with. 

We will back as soon as we can find an excuse!",5,2022,01,17
137,Perfect 10,"From the moment you step into this hotel to the moment you step out- it's simply perfect. The staff make this hotel what is it. They welcomed us back with a smile and added a lovely touch by stocking a new non-alcoholic champagne- pink bubbles! We had another surprise with a complimentary upgrade; a stunning room with lounge, and the added touch of a welcome letter from the assistant resident manager Dean. Early evening, before our theatre trip, we enjoyed canapes and cocktails in the executive lounge, where staff are on hand to meet any request, discreet, professional, and dignified.  Returning from our outing, we were welcomed back as we plundered the pantry; duck, mango, and sweet potato fusions tempted us, followed by a slice of the famous hotel 41 chocolate cake, as the fire burned brightly, and midnight struck. We retired to a turned down room, dimmed lights, curtains drawn, sweet treats left on our pillows, a water bottle tucked away under the luxury linens, inviting us into a toasty, comfortable bed. In the morning, after a naught but nice lay in, breakfast was superb, with a fresh ginger and lemon tea which certainly woke us up. A complimentary late check out was the icing on the cake, leaving us feeling completely rested. The team at hotel 41 are one of a kind and we look forward to returning in March to celebrate hubby's birthday and mark a special occasion, in a special place.",5,2022,01,16
137,It doesn't get any better! ,"What an amazing and stunning hotel this is. I'm not easily pleased but this hotel and all the staff were above our expectations! From the point of arrival,  the welcome we received from the staff and how at ease we felt in the opulant surroundings it was just  perfect. We stayed for just one night (new years eve) as we were to see the new year in on the belmond british pullman. Victoria Station is literally just a 5 min walk so made it perfect. The breakfast the following day was spot on as was the service from the staff. Honestly can't fault 41 at all and will definitely be back for another stay. Well done and thankyou for an amazing time All @41",5,2022,01,07
137,We treat hotel 41 as our holiday primarily and the sites of London secondarily,"We have been going to Hotel 41 in London for about 20 years. It is a very special yet luxurious hotel. The lovely people that work there have an innate ability to read your mind to cater to you. Just outstanding service from the street level front desk, to the lobby front desk, the ""butler"" in the lounge etc etc. We are always treated special here. We sometime do not even leave the property and get pampered in the lobby.",5,2022,01,04
137,Birthday weekend,This was our first visit to 41 and it won’t be our last. The room was excellent and the Staff were exceptional and made the stay one to remember. We were made to feel at home from the beginning and nothing was to much for them to make the stay memorable.,5,2022,01,04
137,Wonderful!,"After almost 2 years, one of the things we have missed most was a stay at Hotel 41.  We were able to travel to London this month and the hotel is still, in a word, perfect!  It felt like coming home to a lovely environment and a staff that is unsurpassed.",5,2021,12,29
137,Exclusive hotel and a best kept secret the moment you walk in and get directed to the 5th floor your experience starts,This is a special place the feel is just tremendous the staff so warm and welcoming you will not be disappointed - the intimacy and quality is outstanding our bedroom was lovely and well equipped our bathroom was quite small red carnation are good at doing a great job of looking after your needs,5,2021,12,20
137,Forget any of the big name hotels stay here! ,"This our third visit this year. We love 41, besides the elegance of the hotel, the staff really make this hotel so special, little things they do to make sure you are comfortable and have everything you need, making your stay perfect.
This time we decided to bring out pet as the hotel is pet friendly, wow, do they spoil pets, on arrival we all get a glasses of champagne but your pet has a choice of pet beer or wine (lol), in the room they have a bed made up for them with toys etc. I'd go into more detail but I think you should just book a trip and stay here, you won't be disappointed. 
To all the staff thanks again for all you did for us during our stay, have a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year's ",5,2021,12,19
137,One of our favorite hotels in the world,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 for 4 nights at the end of November.  We had stayed there in the past and decided to spoil ourselves and go back.  It was just as good as we remembered.  The rooms are beautiful and the executive lounge is really special - a warm, cozy place with yummy food and drinks. It's such a nice touch that guests are treated with a glass of champagne while checking in. The staff is wonderful.  The location is also great, perfect for walking lots of places but also very close to Victoria Station, where you can catch a train or The Underground. We will definitely return.",5,2021,12,17
137,1st visit was good..2nd visit was even better👍🌟,"Our 1st visit was back in July & I booked our 2nd visit very soon after I returned home.
Fast forward to it December 10th👍..
Just like the July visit, we were warmly greeted at the front door & ushered up to the wonderful executive lounge, where the warm welcome continued.
I'd booked a  champagne🥂 cream tea for 16:30, which was delivered with consumate style by Steve, who was also part of the 'Sabage entertainment' that was lead by Dean.
All the 'goodies' on offer were ,as with everything else at #41, presented with courtesy & aplomb.
Malcolm ( the general manager) has put together a staff team that always puts the customer 1st.
We are already looking forward to  our next visit👍",5,2021,12,12
137,"Without doubt the best hotel in London,amazing in every way, wonderful staff, excellent service with a fabulous ambience","We have been coming to this hotel for the past 5 years, it’s our Xmas treat and it never fails to live up to its excellent reputation. The staff are wonderful, Steve greets us every year like we are returning friends making us feel special in every way, over & above what you would get in any other top London hotel. Andrew is also an excellent host, all the staff here can’t do enough to make your stay wonderful The ambiance in the lounge is like a private club and the rooms are all beautiful 
If you want a small luxury hotel with excellent service this is the place to come.",5,2021,12,08
137,Thankful in London!,"The staff and attention to detail is unmatched. Before and during our visit we were given the utmost care. Charming rooms, the executive suite warm & lovely and staff engaging & thoughful. Proper elegance but not stuffy. A great holiday away from the States!",5,2021,12,07
137,Another Wonderful Stay at 41,"We were ""welcomed home"" when we walked into 41 last Sunday. As usual, we sat with a glass of champagne in the executive lounge during check-in. When we we shown to our room, everything was absolutely perfect. The staff here cannot do enough for guests and really spoil you. Reservations were made for a very nice tapas restaurant, a short walk from the hotel. By the way, the Christmas lights on Regent, New Bond and Carnaby Streets were absolutely fantastic and worth a special pre-Christmas visit.
After a great night with a very comfortable sleep, we enjoyed a superb breakfast (eggs Benedict and lattes are highly recommended). Afternoon tea service was quick and expertly presented. We had dinner next door later next door at BBar, which was up to the high standard of 41. We thoroughly enjoyed not only the food, service but two bottles of 2015 Lussac Saint Emilion (we did not drink it on our own as we were joined by family and friends).
We look forward to our next london visit and being spoiled once again.",5,2021,12,06
137,One of the most exceptional hotel experiences ever.,"There was no detail too small.  My wife and I recently stayed at 41 for two days of our trip, and our only regret was not booking the hotel for the entirety. Andrew Muir handled our check-in, and is a consummate professional, He provided us with every bit of information we needed and handled all of our requests. I am someone who has been fortunate to stay at many top tier hotels around the globe, and 41 is at the top of the class. Thank you so much to Andrew and the entire team at 41. Sammy H",5,2021,12,05
137,Unique & very special,"We absolutely loved our stay at Hotel 41, & found everything about it exceptional & very unique.
We have walked past this Hotel & even stayed at Rubén’s next door without even knowing it was there, but now we have discovered this absolute gem of a place we will definitely be coming back…(have already booked for the Summer when the roof top bar will hopefully be open).
Service is attentive, Food & Cocktails are delish & the whole Executive Lounge grazing experience is a great foodie treat.
Rooms are beautifully decorated & the attention to detail surpassed all our expectations, from chocs in the room on arrival to a hot water bottle in the bed & tea lights glowing in the bathroom.
Small but beautifully formed, Hotel 41 could teach some of the big name 5 star London Hotels a trick or two!",5,2021,12,03
137,Wonderful experience,"We stayed at the hotel with our dog for a few days and thoroughly enjoyed it. The service from every member of the team was impeccable - incredibly welcoming, helpful and thoughtful. Not only were we pampered by the team but our dog was too. He had toys, bottled water and treats, and the team treated him like a member of the family. The executive lounge was particularly cosy, and the daily snacks were not only delicious, but were a perfect accompaniment to the wide range of drinks available to help us unwind after a busy day. The food available from the menu in the executive lounge was of good quality. 

This was the first time we stayed at the hotel and we can’t believe we have  not stayed here before. It is really a hidden gem in terms of the amazing service, comfortable rooms and great location. We would definitely stay at the hotel again and our dog would love to see the team again",5,2021,12,02
137,A wonderful Thanksgiving,"Another magical stay at Hotel 41. The staff is just above and beyond. Andrew and Diana made our visit perfect, secured all our reservations and were just brilliant  with service each day. I highly recommend Hotel 41 for any and all visits to London. Such a great location and staff. Best hotel we have ever stayed at on holidays and family trips. Thank you for the details each day, a wonderful time and the memories!!!",5,2021,11,29
137,Very Nice!,"I really enjoyed my stay there. Very beautiful and welcoming Hotel
The room was very big and beds were nicely arranged .
My whole family enjoyed the stay. But the price is too much.it should be reduced.
We will be back definitely!",5,2021,11,28
137,Heaven on Earth,The place to stay in London great location .The staff and service you receive are truly amazing from the minute you enter the front door you are treated as part of the hotel 41 family . The hotel has a guest lounge  with a working fire where you can relax and use the facility they call raid the pantry where treats are available all day and evening to enjoy,5,2021,11,26
137,Luxury Treat,"Decided to seek out a luxury but intimate hotel for a trip to London.  Hotel 41 is a perfect choice, the staff are smart,unfailingly helpful and always smiling.  The bedroom was immaculate and no detail overlooked.  The decor is one of an exclusive gentleman's club and the food and cocktails first class.  Andrew made us feel at home from the first moment and you can tell that the management of this hotel has got the boxes ticked.  Ideally situated for walking to the many attractions, we took taxis from the railway station but in future would use the underground as Victoria is literally round the corner.  Top Hotel,  you will not be disappointed!",5,2021,11,25
137,"Hotel 41, simply the best.","This hotel is truly one of London’s best kept secrets. Having stayed several times now, I simply wouldn’t choose anywhere else. Writing a review only reveals it to more people but it is truly exceptional. 
From the management team down, there is nothing here that I could fault. From Andrew at the helm to Steve in the lounge, everyone is friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and skilled. An extraordinary group of workers. 
The location, the food, the decor , the rooms,
the “vibe”and the service - all exceptional. 
Guests are made to feel extremely special, nothing is too much trouble, and goodness we’ve tried. 
We’ve stayed in many many places all over the world, but hotel 41 is still the best and our favourite.",5,2021,11,24
137,Special birthday surprise,"An absolutely beautiful hotel. From the moment I made an initial enquiry the hotel staff were polite, friendly and very helpful. They answered my emails quickly and made several restaurants bookings for us. On arrival we were greeted by lovely staff and a glass of champagne. They had even provided a birthday cake and bottle of champagne in our room which was a lovely surprise. The hotel room was fabulous, luxurious and very clean. All of the staff were friendly, courteous and approachable. Nothing was too much trouble and they were always on hand to answer any queries. The breakfast was delicious with plenty of choice. The plunder pantry was amazing. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and will definitely be making a return visit.",5,2021,11,24
137,3 Day stay,"I can say without doubt this was one of the best hotel stays I’ve ever had and my wife and I have stayed in some nice places. The staff are without exception the friendliest people you could want to meet. The only way you can discern them from your closest friends are the uniforms. I would also like to give special mention to Steve Jones the Lounge Manager , a fantastic host. I would also like to mention the Assistant Manager Marlen for her assistance in booking up our next visit.",5,2021,11,21
137,Wonderful Hotel and outstanding service,"Thank you and your staff very much for making our stay truly wonderful, we enjoyed every minute of our trip from amazing welcome when we arrived to great service from all the staff during our stay. The attention to detail in the hotel and service was outstanding.
We will definitely stay in Hotel 41 in the future.",5,2021,11,21
137,One night stay,"We stayed here for one night for a special birthday, all the staff at Hotel 41 were very friendly and helpful and made the stay a memorable one.

The hotel is discrete, but high class. All the interiors are manitained to the highest standard.

I would definately stay here again.",5,2021,11,20
137,A memorable experience ,"Fantastic hotel with absolutely fantastic staff.  Great location and really good rooms. Bed was superb, bathroom excellent.  But the staff make all the difference, and elevate the experience from a city break to something a little more special. ",5,2021,11,20
137,Amazing 41,"2nd stay at this fabulous hotel and it does not disappoint. Beds are so comfortable and the attention to detail is second to none . But most importantly the staff are amazing , so friendly and nothing is to much trouble. Have just booked again , can’t wait to return",5,2021,11,17
137,41 has to be the friendliest hotel in London.,"This was our second time at 41 and once again it was outstanding. In our opinion the best hotel in London. 
It was only fitting to return to the place we got engaged 12 months ago, for our London mini moon. 
From the moment we arrived, the attention to detail by every member of staff was exemplary. We were made to feel so very welcome by Adele, Lauren and the whole team. This really is a special place. Looking forward to a return trip soon. 
Thank you for making our few days with you so special",5,2021,11,15
137,Fantastic Hotel,"The professionalism of the staff , the quality of the service, the rooms , location and the little unexpected touches go to make this one of the best , if not the best hotel we have stayed in and well deserved of the 5* Forbes rating.

From the moment we stepped  through the front door we knew were in for a treat. 
We had two rooms and had booked for an Anniversary and birthday celebration.

We were mainly looked after by Andrew, who was very helpful , engaging and had a very natural flair , nothing was too much trouble and Dean who was also polite and attentive.

The small details for me are the main reason this Hotel is outstanding, the turn down service treats, the cake for the celebrations, the chocolates, the hot water bottle tucked in your bed to name but a few and not to forget the Plunder Pantry
Even though every guest receives the same treatment , you are made to feel special and important without going over the top.

We hope to go back next year , thank you all so much",5,2021,11,15
137,Blown Away,"Well, I know a lot has been written about Hotel  41  but I just need to add our experience of this wonderful place.

We drove from Edinburgh to London, 1st time driving, and when we arrived at 41 the organisation was flawless.

We were met by a very smart red coated concierge and porter who just whisked our luggage away, and the car just vanished for the next 5 days. Super service and a nice welcome to both Hotel 41 and London. 

We proceed into Hotel 41, again a lovely welcome from the guest relations and then we proceeded to the lounge.

On entering, again more warm welcomes and made comfortable in this lovely space.

No sooner had we sat down when we were approached by the lounge host, Mr Steve Jones, a glass of champagne was offered along with canapes, and we immediately felt calm and relaxed.

All the staff at 41 are top notch, they excel in customer service, on that we both agreed, however we must single out Steve Jones as probably offering the best welcome and service we have ever experienced.

I too work in hospitality, its not always easy, but he worked that room so well that we returned time and time again. Nothing was too much trouble, advice if required was given, suggestions were given, and all in all we found him to be simply 1st Class. 

He oozes style, his attention to detail is outstanding, its not something that can easily be taught, you either have it in you or you don't, but it was evident Steve Jones is just different class in terms of looking after guests, and in my opinion, someone that should be treasured, as not many places offer this level of professionalisim these days.

The hotel itself is immaculate, public spaces are so comfortable, and bedrooms just perfect. Location wise you could not be better placed for exploring, 2 minutes from Buckingham Palace, who could wish for more!

So a huge thank you to you all at Hotel 41, the people we saw, and the others behind the scenes keeping this place looking so good. You made our trip and we will be back for sure.

C&J",5,2021,11,08
137,Anniversary treat,"Superb service, friendly efficient staff.
Lovely old english charm with comfortable, cosy rooms.
Recommend the Curry room and the chefs banquet.
Definitely be returning.
The wife really appreciated all the little touches organised by the hotel.",5,2021,10,31
137,Amazing,"We don’t ever write reviews but felt that we had to for Hotel 41. It really is amazing. Special thanks to Andrew for taking such good care of our dog Chester and to Steve for the best expresso and bespoke Martinis. All of the staff are great, breakfast is outstanding, the complimentary pantry snacks are really, really good and the rooms/ whole place is just lovely.",5,2021,10,30
137,Best in London,"This was my 3rd stay at Hotel 41 and it didn’t disappoint. This place is truly special. This is mainly due to the fantastic team that work here, nothing i:”s too much trouble and I don’t think you can better the service they provide.

What is really unique is the Plunder Pantry where you have complimentary treats and snacks all day in the lounge area which is for hotel guests only. There is also a stunning terrace area. The rooms are beautiful and immaculately clean.

I truly wouldn’t stay anywhere else in London and look forward to my next stay.",5,2021,10,28
137,Wonderful,"We arrived to a glass of champagne and a wonderful upgrade to a suite. We extended our stay as we had had a train journey to Venice cancelled. If you want excellence, this is the ideal hotel for you. Staff very courteous and always ready to suggest things to enhance your stay. We intend to return next October when we hope to have our trip to Venice. We have never stayed in the same hotel twice which is an indication of just how good this establishment. You will not be disappointed.",5,2021,10,28
137,It was fine but not outstanding,"We stayed for a week for our 25th wedding anniversary and booked through Costco Travel.  We were looking at Hotel 41 and The Savoy and I was won over by the reviews and website which said that the service was outstanding and you would feel like it was your home.  We did not experience that at all in fact the canine customers had a better level of service than we did.

Other than one employee (Bethany) no one knew our names, no one made any effort whatsoever to engage with us.  We were in the Executive Lounge one day (that was enough) in the afternoon and got drinks but no refills.  Everyone else was being engaged and we finally realized that we were the ""scholarship kids"" and since our room was on discount we were the bottom feeders.  

I will say that everyone was polite, no one was rude but instead of feeling like it was our home, it was like visiting your mean old Aunt Edna who is afraid you are going to break something.  In the end it was fine but I would say that the level of service was the same as a Marriott.

Our package was supposed to get complimentary items and we did not get any - mostly because we felt uncomfortable and no one ever explained how to even get them (still waiting for that glass of champagne LOL)

Our stay was fine, their breakfasts are outstanding but I would not return.",4,2021,10,27
137,"Great stay, we hope to stay again","We stayed here 1 night. What a wonderful hotel! Across the street from Buckingham Palace, and walkable to lots of sights and attraction, at least it was for us as we like a walk if its dry.
Enter at street level, leave your bags and up to 5th floor check-in, with a nice glass of champers. This is in the executive lounge, where nibbles and breakfast are served. Food of various sorts available all day.
Easy peasy check-in, then shown to our room  which was spacious, usual amenities plus electric blinds.
Nice anniversary cake too! Thank you for the special touches.
We missed the scones in the afternoon as we were out, but canapes from 5pm were very nice 3 each. Plunder the pantry had a cheese, biscuits, salad pots and cakes.
Bottled water available all day, alcoholic drinks on the pricey side but it is a 5 star hotel so to be expected.
The staff are, without exception, so friendly and helpful. Nothing too much trouble.
Our rate included breakfast, taken in the lounge. Very nice and again excellent service.
We were shown the roof terrace, which would be a lovely place to sit on a pleasant day.
A minor issues was resolved quickly and we received a call checking that we were happy after which was a nice touch.
Hotel 41 is deservedly one of the top hotels in London, a truly wonderful hotel.",5,2021,10,25
137,Centrally located boutique hotel with outstanding service,Hotel 41 is a quiet boutique hotel situated on the top floor of the same building as the Rubens Hotel but with its own entrance.  Exceptionally attentive and friendly staff give every client individual personal service.  We were welcomed with a glass of champagne in the comfortable lounge where the excellent breakfasts are also served and refreshments are available throughout the day. There is a rooftop garden with views over London.  Like all London hotels 41 is expensive but the outstanding staff and their attention to detail make it excellent value for money.,5,2021,10,22
137,Hotel 41 - what a hotel 5*,"This is by far the best hotel I’ve ever stayed in and dog friendly too!

This was a special visit for our anniversary and wanted our dogs to join us for the occasion.  The service, from the point of booking, has been incredible.  All of the staff are polite and very helpful making our stay that extra impressive.

On arrival we were sat in the beautiful lounge, which is stunning and had a glass of champagne (pawsecco for the dogs).  There is a complimentary snack cart, which serves a variety of delicious foods throughout the day.  We were shown to our room and what a room it was.  I believe we had been upgraded and found a beautiful anniversary cake, chocolates and card on the side.  The dogs had their own bed with popcorn and treats as well as toys.  

We had already planned a separate restaurant booking  (as we had the dogs) but returned to the lounge in the evening.  After having a few drinks (and some more treats from the cart) we returned to our room to find evening biscuits and a card address to the dogs and our bed ready for a great nights sleep.  

I would 100% recommend this hotel.  I felt like a queen for the night and the fact we could have our dogs with us everywhere, really made it for us.

Thank you Hotel 41, would love to return.",5,2021,10,20
137,My New Favourite London Hotel,"I recently spent 2 nights at Hotel 41, this was a second attempt due to lockdown.
I feel loathed to tell you how marvellous my stay was for fear of not being able to get a room when I next want to visit as there are only 28 of them.

Without exception all of the staff are excellent and without being overbearing, they ensure you have everything you need for a pleasant stay.

My husband and I booked the cinema for an afternoon movie with lots of fresh popcorn and pick n mix sweeties.  We literally felt like a couple of kids in a sweet shop and had a thoroughly good time watching the movie of our choice, do book it whilst you are staying, you are truly spoiled!

We cannot wait to return and have another indulgent couple of days feeling pampered and rested.  Bloomin well done Hotel 41 for absolutely getting it right, you are now my favourite London Hotel.

PS The location is fabulous for a casual walk through St James Park, Buckingham Palace and nearby Theatres.",5,2021,10,16
137,Holiday,"My husband and I had the most amazing couple of days at Hotel 41,which is less than a minute from Bucking Palace.
We were made to feel so welcome when we arrived.
Andrew Muir who was front of house
Was outstanding,we really enjoyed chatting to him,he is so charming & extremely knowledgable.
Steve who is in charge of the beautiful club Lounge,greeted us with a glass of rose champagne & a bit later toasted sandwiches & other very English yummy food,like homemade scones with clotted cream & jam to boot.

All of the staff we met were truly amazing.
We were upgraded to a suite,which we didn’t want to come out of,it was so cosy,especially when housekeeping lit the fireplaces.
We really recommend this hotel,you will Love it.
We cannot wait to come back.",5,2021,10,14
137,"A fantastic hotel, with a fantastic staff","I had the pleasure of staying in the hotel in two different occasions, the first in September and the second in October of this year. It is now my favorite place to stay in London, and I strongly recommend it to anyone visiting the city. The hotel itself is fantastic, the location, the attention to details and the staff. Adele and Lauren take care of all your needs with a smile. They are always present and concerned with your experience in the hotel, but also in the city. I am already planning my next visits to London, and I will certainly stay in the hotel.",5,2021,10,13
137,"This hotel is beyond a ""Star Rating"" - this is a Supernova standard hotel","Myself and my partner decided to stay at Hotel 41 for a couple of nights after we got married in a private ceremony.
From the moment you arrive at the entrance of the hotel you are greeted by the most incredible signature smell as well as three members of staff, the concierge, the doorman and a member of staff who guides you through the hotel taking you straight up to the Executive Lounge.
If you're lucky enough you will then be left in the hands of Steve Jones who will seat you down in the beautifully decorated and intimate room and offer you a complimentary glass of Larson's Champagne alongside cheese straws, olives and pecans.
Steve then explained to us that all bottled water, crisps, popcorn, ice creams, scones, pastries, chocolate and cheese found in the Executive Lounge was complimentary and we could help ourselves any time.
While Steve recommended dishes we should try from the B-Bar restaurant nextdoor, another member of staff came over to congratulate us on our wedding and offered a free upgrade to one of their suites!.
Excited, we finished our drinks and made our way to the room to find that we had been left cake and chocolates to enjoy whilst laying in our super king bed and watching Sky TV.
The bathroom was spacious and stunning too with his and hers basins, powerful shower and a large bath with a TV to watch Sky on also.
You don't need to ask for anything in this hotel, they know what you want before you do.
At breakfast the next morning I mentioned that the complimentary bottles of still water was a really nice touch as my partner and I drink around 3L each per day and then by the time we had gotten back to the room they had swapper out all of our 330ml bottles of water with large 750ml of bottled water.
Breakfast  is fabulous too and the eggs are the nicest I have ever had!
I have to admit, there is so much that the staff and this hotel offer that I would be sat here reviewing for hours but to save ruining all the experience for everyone else I will summarise that the staff and exceptional, the hotel is stunning, the view over London from the rooftop is breathtaking, the food is phenomenal and the B-Bar restaurant's is  Parmesan Chicken Shnitzel is outstanding.
I honestly will never stay at another hotel in London other than Hotel 41 ever again!
Thank you to all the team who made our experience unforgettable!!",5,2021,10,12
137,The perfect date night,"Where do I start? This was our second visit to Hotel 41 and somehow it was even better than the first!

Due to the pandemic, our previous two bookings had to be rearranged. We got engaged at Hotel 41 on the 18th December 2015 and have always wanted to return and last month we finally got there. What makes it special, beyond the beautiful decor, attention to detail, delicious food, etc, is the exceptional service. Somehow, the staff make every guest feel they are their most valued customer and they will go above and beyond to ensure you have the best possible experience.

We were welcomed by Erica and shown to the lift. As soon as we entered the lounge, Lauren welcomed us, ensured we were comfortable and brought the champagne trolley over so we could enjoy our first bit of luxury as we checked in. We then decided to get some lunch and soak up the atmosphere as we reminisced about our previous visit and were brought breadsticks, olives and nuts to nibble.

Although we had originally planned to return in December, September showed us a totally different side to the hotel. Light floods through the skylight which makes the lounge (a relatively small space) bright and airy. My husband chose to have the wagyu burger while I opted for the lobster mac and cheese. Hotel 41 will make reservations on your behalf for other restaurants but we’re really glad we decided to stay at the hotel as the food was excellent and David, who served us, was charmingly attentive.

After lunch, Marlen showed us to our room. We were lucky enough to stay in 4128 - the Balmoral Suite. Wow, just wow, it was something else! We have never stayed anywhere as fancy as this room. There are two bathrooms, both with showers (one has a bath) and a separate double shower as well! There’s an office and dining area and two sofas in the lounge area. You also have luxuries like electronic blinds, a huge walk in closet and multiple TVs.

I’d arranged to have a bottle of champagne in our room and this was beautifully presented alongside a handwritten card, a cake and petit fours. It really is the little things that make Hotel 41, and we want to say a heartfelt thank you to (the other) Lauren for the kind words and sentiment in the card.

We then enjoyed a sunny afternoon on the rooftop (this didn’t exist in 2015) sipping cocktails and watching the hotel’s bees from a distance. The hives are tucked out the way but it’s worth going to have a look. Sunglasses, suncream and snacks are always readily available so it’s hard to want for anything…but we were still asked by David just incase!

We enjoyed a relaxing evening in the lounge consisting of exquisite canapés (the croque monsieur is very tasty) cocktails and generous glasses of wine. During this time Marlen was kind enough to help us recreate a photo we took nearly 6 years ago, we chatted with Ioanna and had an in-depth conversation about the icecream selection before finally deciding on black coconut and gin and tonic!

We both think you’ll be hard pushed to find a more comfortable bed than the ones at Hotel 41. We definitely had a great night’s sleep and enjoyed a lazy lie in before heading to breakfast.

After a more-than-filling breakfast (good luck deciding what to have!) where we were looked after by another David, it was finally time to check out. Throughout our stay, we could have requested ‘anything, any time’ via the button on our room phone but the most we ever desired were a couple of extra bottles of still water after an indulgent evening…and of course, these arrived within a couple of minutes on a tray to our room. If you’re looking for a weekend where you feel truly spoilt, look no further as you won’t be disappointed.",5,2021,10,11
137,Beautiful hotel,"The reviews don't lie. Everything about this hotel is absolutely wonderful. It's located near Buckingham Palace and is really a hotel within a hotel. The rooms are spacious for London standards and are all well-appointed. The housekeeping is fantastic - I'm pretty observant and nothing was every missed in cleaning. The lobby / lounge are is a great meeting point and the fact there is always ice cream, snacks, drinks available makes it really enjoyable. However, as others have noted, what really sets this place apart is the service. definitely coming back here",5,2021,10,11
137,A Special Place,"We were made to feel very special, and were upgraded to a suite which was very unexpected and very tastefully decorated and comfortable.  Excellent service and nothing too much trouble.  Great location for walking to attractions or shopping !

137,A hotel like no other,"From the moment we arrived for our stay at Hotel 41 we were made to feel completely special and at home. the hotel is absolutely beautiful and the staff could not do enough for us during our entire visit. we have never experienced a quality of service like it before, and I wouldn't hesitate to stay again, or recommend to everyone. It was simply wonderful from start to finish.",5,2021,10,10
137,Not just a hotel but an experience!!,"This isn’t just a hotel, this is an experience!! A genuine haven of peace and luxury in the heart of bustling London! 

The team at Hotel 41 were impeccable in their service, professionalism and creativity in making our trip unforgettable. We stayed at the hotel for four nights in October for a wedding anniversary and the team couldn’t do enough to help us plan the visit. The hotel itself is a stunning place to relax and unwind after a busy day in the capital. The rooms are first class, the executive lounge feels like a home from home and the staff brilliantly friendly. The Red Carnation Hotel group have a unique ability to make you feel like one of the family with welcoming and warm engagement but doing so with a poise that doesn’t feel too over familiar. 

It was a wonderful experience and one we will surely rekindle in the months to come. 

Thanks to all for making it so special.",5,2021,10,06
137,The best  hotel in Britain,"This is our 1st visit to hotel 41, but not the last. It was our 39th wedding anniversary and    l must say the staff could not do enough to make our stay the best it could be. They went way beyond our expectations to make our celebration so special. The hotel facilities are fabulous, the staff exceptional in everything they do. We would like to thank each and everyone of them for giving us the best 3 days of our lives. Quite simply the best hotel experience we have ever had.",5,2021,10,05
137,Wonderful hotel,"We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41. It was a late birthday celebration, but well worth the wait. The staff were so professional and friendly from the minute we arrived. On checking in we were given a complimentary glass of champagne  which they offer to all guests. A lovely surprise was the upgrade to the Balmoral Suite and chocolate cake and a box of chocolates to celebrate my birthday. The hotel itself is decorated to the highest standard. Plenty of choice for breakfast and so tasty. We couldn't fault our stay and will definitely be back for another visit.",5,2021,10,04
137,Second stay; Look forward to the next!,"We had our first experience at Hotel 41 last year and booked again for our latest trip to London. As lovely as the rooms and common areas are, it is truly the staff that make this hotel experience top-tier. The staff's attention to preferences and personal touches raise the bar on service. The rooms are comfortable, well-appointed, and make it feel like a home away from home. We'll be back again on our next trip, without question!",5,2021,10,03
137,Fabulous,"Absolutly perfect! This is a hidden gem at the back of Buckingham palace. The bedroom we stayed in was lovely and the executive lounge such a nice place to relax! 
The best was the “whatever whenever” dial in on the phone… made any request possible!",5,2021,10,03
137,Amazing,"Me and my fiancée had stayed at the hotel before and we were coming back for our anniversary. We were not disappointed. All the staff are amazing. When we arrived we saw a few members of staff that were at the hotel last time and what I found nice is that they actually remembered us as well which I found brilliant (well I hope for good reasons). On night we wanted to go out to a restaurant but it has been closed down so when speaking to reception they recommended a few restaurants for us to chose. They had booked the table for us and also mentioned to the restaurant that it was our anniversary. They also organised things for my anniversary like roses, champagne, a lovely cake and a lovely hand written card. The staff are so friendly and helpful. Anything you need they will get it for you. I look forward to coming back to the hotel again.

Many thank to all the staff",5,2021,10,03
137,Birthday stay,Best hotel we have stayed at in the UK. Rooms were great as you would expect for a 5 star hotel. However it’s the service that sets the place apart from other 5 star hotels. Hotel 41 feels like you are a guest in someone’s home and all staff are exceptional. I must mention Steve who served us pre football and when we got back to the hotel. A great birthday treat in a great location,5,2021,10,02
137,Intimate wedding party,"My fiancée and I held an intimate wedding party at the hotel during the evening, and then ourselves and our guests stayed in the hotel overnight. The whole day was organised by the hotel manager (Lauren Hargrave) who could not be faulted, the service was nothing less than exemplary from her and her team, assisting with travel arrangements, flower delivery, transportation, dining and the overnight stay. The commitment, compassion, professionalism and service offered was unwavering throughout. The team made the day truly unforgettable and we will certainly be returning on each anniversary, to remind ourselves of a truly special day.",5,2021,09,29
137,memorable stay,"Stayed for 2 nights in the Monarch Suite which is a fine room overlooking the side of the palace. The hotel has a grand, yet intimate and welcoming feel. The staff here are on a different level. Everyone is really engaged and happy to spend the time to talk about the hotel and things to do in London. Complimentary champagne, scones, chocolates were welcome surprises.
The location is outstanding. In 2 minutes we were walking past the front of Buckingham Palace and through to St James Park. Victoria rail stations are 5 minutes walk away.
We ate at the BBar which is one of their restaurants next door. I had an amazing steak.
We really enjoyed our stay and won't hesitate to go again.",5,2021,09,28
137,Exceptional stay,"Registration was effortless, having been offered a glass of champagne and nibbles, we admired the oldy worldly surroundings; fresh flowers, books, polished wood panels and soft lighting. 
The black and white decorated bedroom included a king bed, writing desk, fire place, small sofa and coffee table, bathroom with bath and shower, wardrobe with plenty of draws and hangers, hairdryer, brolly, shoe horn, laundry bags, a safe dressing gowns and slippers. Coffee and tea facilities, along with sparking and still water. A celebratory cake, card and chocolates acknowledged a special anniversary celebration. The room was spotless and with a distinct sweet aroma in the air; the hotel 41 scent. 
All we planned to do was relax and enjoy a change of scenery, switching off from our busy schedules and the executive lounge was the perfect space; ample space, soothing background music, staff on hand, varied in house dining menu, the honesty bar with every drink under the sun, complimentary still and sparking water and snacks to graze on throughout the day; crisps, nuts, chocolate, popcorn and ice-cream. To add to this, there were fresh scones at 4, canapes at 5-7 and more nibbles between 8-1am. 
Having discovered a place where the service is exceptional, along with the food and accommodation…is well, quite extra ordinary.

",5,2021,09,28
137,Another visit to The best hotel to stay at in London,Second visit to this wonderful oasis of bliss and luxury.  Far too long since my last stay courtesy of the Pandemic.  As before you feel like you have stepped into an exclusive club and indeed you have!  No standing at reception to check in like other hotel -  cases are taken at the main door and one of the many staff whisk you up to the lounge for you to recline relax and then comes the first dilemma.  You have to make a choice of either white or rose champagne.  On the house of course!  Andrew deserves special mention as he found and arranged a fantastic restaurant for our last night.  Since the pandemic a lot of restaurants close Sunday Monday -  something you just don’t think about when in the capital.  Any Restaurant 34 was terrific and thanks to Andrew!,5,2021,09,27
137,Superlative,"This was our 13th stay at 41 - and just wonderful.

Staff have been incredibly kind and helpful making our stay superb. 

Room was stunning, food and beverages top notch, ambience to die for.

Wonderful position to explore London. 

Cannot speak more highly and have already booked another three stays !",5,2021,09,24
137,Exceptional birthday stay,"Wow! 
Left speechless by the warmth and impeccable service we received.

From the time were contacted by Erica at the time of booking to the time we were greeted & shown around  by Nigesh, David, Dean, Steve, Alex and Marianne, everyone made us feel so welcome.

The afternoon tea, breakfast & free snacks in the exec lounge were exceptionally good. Plunder the pantry was such a lovely concept, not often seen in this country.

My requests for making the two birthday people’s birthdays special and  the halal food were totally taken on board.

Rooms are lovely as is attention to detail for the little things too.
Book without any hesitation; you won’t be disappointed!",5,2021,09,19
137,Regular visitor,"I make an annual trek to London to visit Hotel 41. This is a special place where your name is remembered. As a frequent guest I always get the same room, a junior suite. The service is impeccable. Drink with the general manager was a nice touch that was part of my rate.",5,2021,09,18
137,Without doubt the best hotel experience I have had in London.,All our expectations were surpassed at our stay in hotel 41. The service is exceptional and we were made to feel so welcome from the moment we arrived. We have been lucky enough to stay in a number of 5 star hotels all over the world and I am struggling to think of a better experience. They made my birthday weekend truly memorable and it is so nice to come somewhere this highly commended and not be disappointed. I could not recommend this hotel more wholeheartedly.,5,2021,09,18
137,Living proof that you can smile despite a mask,"You can't get better than this for these strange times as we gradually,  carefully, and with hope, emerge from the pandemic.

Team 41 take great care of their guests and their staff, ensuring safety with luxurious comfort and discreet care over every detail.  Being 'resident only' ensures no through-flow of people, and small numbers that are easily spaced.  

We were in London for a small, private event and we returned to 41 for the first time since before the pandemic - the first time anywhere - a long gap, and we have missed its charm and dedication to the very best in hospitality.  To walk through the doors again was like being enveloped in a cashmere wrap, and the glass of champagne arrives with an even warmer smile. The mask can't hide that.  

The weather was lovely so we went straight up to the rooftop terrace and settled back to admire the skyline, the hotel's own beehives in the near distance, and the general ambience of fresh herbs growing around us with cantilevered parasols moving gently in the light breeze.  

Having rested after our event, we opted for a Raid the Pantry supper of cheese and crackers with a glass of Bouchard Finlayson's Galpin Peak - a favourite combination, then a peaceful night in our lovely room overlooking The Royal Mews 

This was followed by a beautifully cooked breakfast in our favourite corner of the Executive Lounge - perfect scrambled eggs with crispy bacon.  A shot glass of apple with fresh ginger was a new addition and much enjoyed instead of our usual orange juice.   

We left, as always, eager to return.  Thank you, Team 41.  You haven't changed your lovely style.",5,2021,09,17
137,Fantastic stay,What a lovely hotel. Such lovely staff. We were upgraded to a Junior Suite for my partner’s belated 40th. So many lovely touches. Champagne on arrival. The Plunder Pantry went down well. Would stay again. A great location to visit many London attractions.,5,2021,09,16
137,A very special hotel…,"This beautiful hotel makes you feel special as soon as you arrive…. What better way to be welcomed than with a glass of champagne in the hotel lounge. The lounge area is the heart of the hotel where you can relax, enjoy amazing cocktails & canapés, and indulge in all the complimentary treats on offer (including ice cream) During our stay we were even lucky enough for the sun to come out so we could enjoy a drink at the roof top bar. Our executive king room was spacious, elegant and provided everything we needed for our two night stay. The hotel is situated in a great location (basically next door to Buckingham Palace) so we were able to walk everywhere and see so much of London but we also loved spending time in the hotel and relaxing. All the little details did not go unnoticed, the welcome note, the turn down service, the team always using your name. The Hotel 41 team are incredible and embody a real passion for hospitality.  You leave feeling part of the family, relaxed and completely spoilt. Thank you so much and we cannot wait to come back.",5,2021,09,14
137,Absolute perfection,"Ordinarily I wouldn’t review a hotel until after I’ve left but this visit was so exquisite to date I felt it only right that I give it the praise that it deserves.
From answering the telephone addressing us by name prior to arrival to leaving a slice of anniversary cake. 
I asked for a quiet room and that’s exactly what we got. Usually we bring the dog on holiday with us but he has an issue with doors banging and barks but no such problem, I’d certainly bring him here on the next visit.
On returning from an evening out, water had been left by the bed, slippers too.  The remote controls sanitised again, a handmade soap and classic fm playing on the tv. What more could you want?",5,2021,09,13
137,"Forget The Ritz or Claridge’s next time you stay in London, go to Hotel 41 instead!","5 out 5

Customer service second to none. All the staff we encountered were smiling, friendly and genuinely engaging without being overbearing or intrusive.
Check-in was a breeze, not rushed, with a choice of white or pink champagne, nibbles & afternoon cream tea, as we arrived in time for this.
White gloved serving staff, complimentary all day grazing table & packaged little snacks to have there or take away on your onward journey, including bottled water & individually wrapped hand napkins, to clean your hands afterwards! They have thought of everything.

More of a private members club, especially as hotel guests are only allowed on this 5th floor hotel, so real personal service.

After experiencing Hotel 41, you won’t want to stay in a big hotel chain again in London.",5,2021,09,13
137,London Trip with the youngest Son,"Took my smallest Son on his first trip to London and wanted to treat him to a nice hotel, we were not disappointed. Fabulous service from the outset with super friendly staff with a great attention to detail. Lovely decor and fabulous room. Great location for exploring London. I have stayed in some of the best hotels in the capital and I have to say that this is up there with the best. You know it must be good when you ask a 7 year old “What was your favourite part of the trip to London” and he replies “The lift and the bed”!!!!!",5,2021,09,12
137,Birthday break in London.,"Always nice to return to this fantastic Hotel. An exclusive Residents only, with 30 Bedrooms and Suites with wonderful staff who provide an exclusive, personal service second to none. Try it you will not be disappointed. Great location close to Buckingham Palace.",5,2021,09,12
137,Tranquil escape,"Our second visit to Hotel 41. Can’t really add anything new to the positive comments already posted in pretty much every review on here for the hotel. All I’ll say is I very rarely visit the same anything twice as there are so many amazing places and things in the world to sample so why do the same thing twice. Hotel 41 has been the exception however, ever since staying 2 years ago we have longed to return, it really is a beautiful peaceful escape from the rest of the world, sitting on the rooftop bar or in the executive lounge is a beautiful thing and an amazing place to be. The staff treat you like royalty, the inclusions are great and I will make a third visit. ",5,2021,09,09
137,Felt very special,"I had read very good reviews of the hotel and i was definitely made to feel welcomed and accommodated, you can tell making the stay personal for the guest is very important and I felt if there was anything I would have needed, it would have been taken care of. The champagne during check in was lovely and so was the treats left in the room. I was looking just to relax and was able to do so in the lounge which was very plush, with the complimentary canapes and 'plunder the pantry' very nice. Location is great. (For me) the cost was high and so I was hoping the experience would be worth it and it was. Would recommend for anyone looking for a more traditional, luxury hotel stay.",4,2021,09,09
137,Birthday Celebrations at Hotel 41,"Fantastic experience from the moment we arrived to celebrate husband's 60th birthday.  Amazing staff who couldn't do enough for us.  Champagne in the Executive Lounge a magic moment.
I'd highly recommend this hotel and the location is great.",5,2021,09,08
137,Fantastic hotel with amazing service.,"Amazing Hotel and staff. Now I know how royalty feel! Beautiful interior and décor, very relaxing ambiance, but what makes this place are the staff. They simply cannot do enough for you. They always look happy to see you and know who you are throughout your stay, as you don't need to sign for anything or give your room number. Best check in experience you could ever hope for. 

Take advantage of the inclusive food and snacks - the canapes were lovely. We will be back!",5,2021,09,08
137,"Phenomenal hotel - great service, location and comfort - treat you like family",This hotel was fabulous from their service prior to arrival until we checked out.  Staff are all attentive and friendly.  Rooms are clean and comfortable.  We felt like part of the Hotel 41 family and everyone just seemed to know who we were.  Location is phenomenal with so much in walking distance.  We will definitely be back!,5,2021,09,07
137,Next Level....,"We stayed at 41 for our 10th anniversary and absolutely loved every single thing about it. Despite the well deserved reviews it still exceeded every expectation. It's the benchmark of how to find the balance between attention and intrusion, feeling comfortable and relaxed whilst being basically spoiled rotten . Thankyou so much for making a special occasion feel like it mattered to you too. Can't wait for next stay ",5,2021,09,05
137,An Fabulous Stay at Hotel 41,"We stayed two nights at Hotel 41. The checking in process was extremely painless. In fact we were taken to the beautiful lounge area & offered complimentary champagne whilst our bags were taken to our room. The staff are all incredibly polite, friendly & attentive. I am gluten intolerant & was told within 5 minutes of being there that the chef was aware & that it wouldn't be a problem catering for me at all. I get quite used to being treated as an awkward customer, so this made me feel comfortable immediately. The room was large, clean & the bed very comfortable indeed. We had complimentary chocolates, teas, Nespressso, filter coffee & bottle water. We also had a turn-down service where I was left a lovely pillow spray. I worked on my laptop during the day & the wifi was quick, the desk area comfortable  & the room service lunch fabulous. I cannot fault this hotel at all (maybe at a push, the air-con is a little noisy - but if you run it for 20 mins before going to bed  it isn't an issue). The hotel is opposite Buckingham Palace so my lunchbreak was a beautiful walk around the palace estate. By the time I returned to my room, it had been cleaned & left fresh again. 
I would return to this hotel in a heart-beat & will be letting my gluten/coeliac community know it's the place to stay!",5,2021,09,03
137,One word - WOW!,"My partner and I stayed at 41 for just 1 night in August 2021 following an immensely enjoyable stay at the hotel’s sister property. Despite only staying for the night, our expectations of this beautiful hotel were far exceeded and this hotel is one that I am eager to visit again soon.

The hotel has a truly exclusive feel to it and this is something felt from the moment you enter the monochrome lobby and are swiftly escorted up to the Executive Lounge for a glass of champagne. The hotel is decorated throughout to the highest degree of elegance: monochrome accents and dark wood panelled walls adorn this gorgeous property and give it a truly chic vibe. We spent many hours in the Executive Lounge simply admiring the beauty of it.

Our hotel room was kindly upgraded at check-in to a Split-Level Junior Suite and all I can say about this room is that it is absolutely fantastic. Featuring a lounge/reception room on the main floor and a separate bedroom and bathroom upstairs, the room is absolutely ginormous. Despite being so large, however, the room has a cosy feel to it due to the decor and period furniture - a touch I absolutely love! 

Catering at 41 is exemplary of how other luxury hotels should operate. Their around-the-clock service in the Executive Lounge is a fantastic idea, with complimentary snacks being available all day as well as special light meals throughout the day and into the night. We benefitted from their ‘Plunder the Pantry’ set-up, where we were offered absolutely delicious salads, quiches, burrata, cakes and desserts, and a cheese board. Similarly, breakfast at 41 was absolute fantastic and delicious.

Service at 41 is what truly makes it a rare find that has quickly topped my list of favourite hotels. Staff at the hotel are never far away and there is always somebody on hand to deal with any request. I extend my warmest thanks to Andrew for his service throughout our stay - from arrival and check-in, right through to our departure, he was a kind and friendly face who truly knew how to excel in his role. Other staff members also deserve a shout out, but Andrew definitely topped the list!

All-in-all, this hotel is a fantastic little hideaway that I would - without a doubt - love to return to in the near future. 41 is a rare find and one that knows how to treat its guests!",5,2021,09,02
137,Simply the best,"We visited 41 for a second time during our honeymoon and yet again it didn’t disappoint. 

As soon as you arrive through the doors the beautiful signature scent hits you and you’re greeted warmly by the staff who are all absolutely amazing, so attentive and friendly. 

The check in experience is second to none. You can stay in the beautiful executive lounge as long as you want whilst enjoying a glass of champagne (there are multiple options) of your choice. Just the best way to start a holiday.

We were shown to our beautiful suite which was absolutely stunning - a bathroom and seperate shower room, massive lounge area and honestly the most comfortable bed ever. The sheets are to die for- we were both exhausted after our wedding weekend and we slept so well! We were very grateful for the black out electric blinds! 

The staff left us a lovely note in the room to congratulate us alongside some chocolates and a delicious cake- thank you so much.

We got to enjoy the roof terrace alongside some lovely cocktails and delightful canapés on the first evening, and couldn’t resist to do the same for the second evening! We had a dinner reservation on the second evening and when we came back to the room, the turndown service was so amazing! They had written ‘happy honeymoon’ on the mirror in the bathroom, lit candles and spread rose petals everywhere- so romantic! 

Breakfast was also fabulous on both mornings- such quality ingredients and an excellent start to the day.

Even on check out we were offered some care packages to travel home with- some towels in the signature 41 packaging, some sweets and our choice of fruit water in a takeaway cup. Such a thoughtful touch! 

Best hotel ever and we’ll be back- hopefully sooner rather than later!",5,2021,09,01
137,"Amazing service, simply amazing!","We had read so many fantastic reviews on this hotel and wondered whether our stay would live up to our high expectations.  Well all I can say is it exceeded all our expectations and went straight to number one of our favourite hotels in London.  

The staff are simply fantastic, professional and can't do enough for you.  Within a short time spent at the hotel we felt as if we had been coming to the hotel for years. The staff make quickly know your name and make you feel at home by being attentive with familiarity that is the right balance without you feeling uncomfortable or it being disingenuous.  

The welcome glass of bubbly as you check in, the well appointed rooms and the sumptuous executive lounge did not disappoint.  Our highlight was the fantastic breakfast served each morning in the executive lounge that was to the highest standard and the choice of freshly cooked options was incredible.  

We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and we will definitely be returning soon.",5,2021,08,31
137,Our Favourite Hotel,"Our 3rd visit to Hotel 41 and another amazing experience.  The level of service is exemplery, staff are attentive and nothing is too much trouble. We were celebrating my birthday and my partner arranged a couple of experinces on offer through the hotel which were all fantastic. I cannot find any fault with this hotel and if you are looking for first class service in a luxurious setting then this is the place to stay.",5,2021,08,31
137,"If you can, book it!","You genuinely couldn’t ask for more.
Staff were excellent and really nice.
The food from both the evening trolley and breakfast was delicious.
The rooms are fabulous and ridiculously comfy.
Bathrooms were immaculate.
The rooftop area was lovely when the weather allowed for it.
Location wise it’s perfect!",5,2021,08,31
137,"Great location, amazing staff!","Great staff, clean hotel, felt very comfortable covid protocols were in place. Great late drinks. Location ideal for shopping, dining, sight seeing! Quiet in the morning and great late night drinks. Very accommodating and helpful staff.",5,2021,08,30
137,Amazing return visit!,"This is our second visit to Hotel 41 and we will return! Nothing is too much trouble for the staff, the rooms are amazing - in the words of my 9 year old daughter - ""they feel like family"". We booked the junior suite and were upgraded to the executive suite - a lovely gesture. From the minute you arrive you feel relaxed. A drink on the rooftop bar is a must.

Hotel 41 is an experience like no other hotel experience - a truly unique and special stay!

We can't wait to our next stay!",5,2021,08,30
137,Another great stay at No 41,"Stayed one night for our Wedding Anniversary and had another great visit. The staff are so friendly and nothing is too much trouble.A nice champagne welcome in the lounge/reception area, a beautiful room. The rooms are very comfortable with all you need at hand. The position of Hotel 41 is excellent, a little out of the West End and close to restaurants in all directions and tourist attractions if you need them.
A late night bar for when you return from an evening out and breakfast until 11, perfect.
We will definitely return, for longer next time however.
you must go to No 41!",5,2021,08,26
137,Best hotel staff we’ve ever met,"A stunning hotel . The staff and management were absolutely fantastic. Wish we hadn’t only booked one night! Will definitely be back for a longer stay. Stayed in the junior suite but sure all the rooms are fantastic. All staff members we encountered were really helpful, friendly and HAPPY!!
Many thanks to everyone for making our stay so great",5,2021,08,20
137,Perfection,"This is a fantastic hotel with amazing staff; I'm so pleased we found it! It's not only dog-friendly but our special chap was treated as well as any guest and really didn't want to leave! The rooms are lovely; clean, beautifully-decorated and extremely comfortable and the location and staff are unbeatable. We can't wait to return.",5,2021,08,19
137,Absolutely fantastic hotel,"Really not much to say about hotel 41 but 'fantastic'.
On arrival we were welcomed at the front door and guided to the 5th floor for check-in.
Checking in is completely different from any other hotel we have visited, we were sat in the lounge area and given a glass of champagne. The lounge area is beautifully decorated, clean and probably the freshest smelling room ever.
Once checked in we went to our foom, our sons had a standard room with twin bed, again very clean and plenty of room for them. Our room on the other hand a split lever suit, is spacious, well lit and honest stunningly decorated. Honestly I can't use the words beautiful, gorgeous, wow and impressive enough when writing.
During our stay the staff are probably the best I've ever had the opportunity to meet in all my visits around the world. They are professional, friendly and without you noticing go out of the way to predict you future moves, for example, as we headed out for dinner, we decided to have pre cocktails in the lounge, the bartender (whom I can't recall his name and makes fantastic drinks), asked where we were going for dinner, we told him, as we walked outside of the hotel entrance the valet had a cab ready and had informed the cabby our location. I've never had this before anywhere, it was so subtle in how they arranged this. I must also note, it wasn't just this one time, in the morning going shopping, the same happened.
We had breakfast twice and again we weren't disappointed, excellent service and the food, delicious.
Overall this is definitely in out top 3 hotels we have visited and I highly recommend you stay here rather than any other hotel in London.
I can stay we are so up set that we are heading back to London in September and had previously book a 5 star chain Hotel, which unfortunately we can cancel, otherwise we be back at 41.
One thing that not many k ow about is how pet friendly they are, they can arrange dog walking and will definitely make sure your pet is well looked after.
To the management and especially staff, thank you for everything, we had a great time and will definitely (unfortunately /fortunately for you lol), well be back soon. ",5,2021,08,19
137,A hotel that undoubtedly goes above and beyond,I booked hotel41 for my partners 30th birthday. Hotel41 made it such a special experience. Thanks to all their charming staff for the best stay. I would not hesitate to recommend a stay to anyone looking for something that little bit special.,5,2021,08,19
137,"PURE HEAVEN  - TRULY 1st CLASS and 6 star, not 5.","Oh wow. Where to start. The welcome, so lovely...like coming home, but with a concierge at your front door!
All of the staff were extremely friendly and professional in equal measure. They all wear white cotton gloves. As ALL staff were so wonderful, I am reluctant to single anyone out, yet Andrew (from Greenock) was particularly warm & attentive. A great check in experience with a rose champagne. It almost felt like an honour to hand over my credit card. The room was a reasonable size and excellent. Turn down service with attention to detail, such as towel/toiletry needs, chocs on pillow. The breakfast was divine. Try everything, it is all 1st class. Lots of afternoon and early evening treats, nibbles & small bites. On our 2nd night we didn't even go out for dinner, it was that good. A generous grazing bar gives you healthy nibbles through to Lindor chocs. Even the corridors are permanently scented. Lovely cocktails too.
After 3 nights, time to leave...we were genuinely sad, only matched by my determination to visit here again. I will never bother with trying any other London hotel. THIS IS THE VERY BEST of London, I am convinced of it.",5,2021,08,16
137,A hidden gem in the heart of Victoria,"Having read all the impressive reviews of this Hotel, I was eager to see if it would live up to my very high expectations! We were greeted downstairs by a lovely girl on reception before being whisked upstairs to the executive lounge to check in. Steve (quite a character with a great sense of humour) supplied the very welcome champagne and canapés while we checked in. Our room was available immediately (a welcome surprise). Loved the gorgeous handmade chocolates which awaited us in the room with a handwritten note from the Manager welcoming us. It's these touches that I think elevate the Carnation Group above other 5 star Hotels. The room was gorgeous, the bed so comfy, the toiletries wonderful. 
Our absolute favourite part of our stay has to be the afternoon we spent up on the roof terrace in the sun. It was glorious and I loved the exclusivity of this roof top area. Only Hotel 41 residents are permitted out here so again it felt like we were in a very  secluded members club. Our drinks were superbly served first by Dean (who kindly showed us various buildings from our vantage point including the Buckingham Palace Courtyard where the Queen would exit for certain state events). The other member of staff I have to mention is David who spent most of the afternoon running up and down to/from the bar with our drinks/snacks etc. Nothing was too much trouble for him. We explained how the rooftop area was one of the reasons we had booked the Hotel and interestingly David had been instrumental in developing this space as he works in the creative design team in The Carnation Group HO! David works weekends at Hotel 41 to keep his hand in the hospitality sector. We so appreciated his time with us discussing various Hotels within the group which we will visit in the future. I have to say that David is an absolute credit to this Company - he was utterly charming, attentive and his passion for the Brand was evident to see. Thank you David for your time and apologies for making you work 20 mins over your shift! 
We had dinner in the sister Hotel next door (The Rubens) and ended the night enjoying complimentary ice cream in the lounge where other equally scrumptious treats were available. Again, the staff were so kind and attentive - nothing was too much trouble. 
Breakfast is also served in the lounge area - this was fabulous - great array of choices from continental to full English. 
So, would definitely recommend this wonderful boutique Hotel where you are made to feel like a VIP from start to finish - well worth a visit if you are staying in London - a very short stroll from Victoria Station so location is perfect for all London adventures.",5,2021,08,15
137,"Chic, Comfortable & Friendly","We enjoyed our stay at this chic and comfortable hotel. It is noteworthy how especially kind, helpful and friendly all the staff were throughout our stay, which made for a very restorative time. We appreciated the welcome glass of champagne, delightful breakfast and the late checkout.",5,2021,08,14
137,A little gem in the city,"Fantastic hotel, the staff were friendly, helpful and attentive making us feel very welcome. A drink on arrival whilst checking in was a great touch, and evening drinks on the rooftop in the sunshine was an added bonus. Will definitely be returning soon.",5,2021,08,13
137,Small is Beautiful,"If your looking for a large brash hotel, then Hotel 41 isn't for you. This is a small Hotel that occupies the 5th floor only and only has a couple of dozen rooms. It's is an intimate experience where you're made to feel at home by the hugely attentive staff. This is very much a 5 Star Hotel. The only downside to my stay and I'm clutching at straws here was the location was taxi ride away from most of the centrally based bookings we had made but that's arguably not their issue. We also chose a Split Level Suite which had a small downstairs living area which we didn't use but again, that was possibly a poor choice on my behalf. I would highly recommend this Hotel and it is highly likely we will return!",5,2021,08,12
137,"Checked in as a guest,left as a friend","What can I say, just exquisite from start to finish. Welcome champagne on arrival before going to a stunning room. Beautiful touches, delightful executive lounge with very tasty canapés. Beautiful perfume throughout, found the whole stay so relaxing. Well done to Lauren the manager but a special thanks to Dean for remembering my name when pouring me a coffee at breakfast and to the lovely lady on checking out that sorted me out with Huggi bear. The whole team are a credit. I was overwhelmed when I left with the kindness I had experienced. Just an amazing find indeed. Don’t change a thing.",5,2021,08,12
137,An experience to say the least,"This hotel is a little bit odd. Sort of surreal and probably not for everyone. But I did love it! 
Travelled here with two friends and my husband and had a wonderful time. 
You have the whole of London on your doorstep but somehow know the best service you are going to get is in this little executive lounge. 

The prices are admittedly a little ridiculous for me (£10 for a 330ml bottle of mass produced meantime beer from Asahi….!!!!!!!)
£6 for a bottle of fever tree tonic to go with your £24 gin (I cry) 
This came very very close to marking it down BUT….despite my complaining, the gin and tonic tasted better than they usually do, which harks back to it being about the circumstances that you enjoy your drinks!!

HUGE hats off for Dean & Steve who gave us fantastic service all night, and rescued a celebratory situation nearly gone dreadfully wrong (NB really wouldn’t recommend the champagne tasting at their sister hotel Rubens). They were both fantastic and the sort of team members you hope to see again because they make you feel so welcome/make you smile. 
We had a wonderful time terrifying the other guests with the art of sabreage (or however you spell it).

Excellent, undisturbed nights sleep in the super comfy bed…... Lovely dump shower…..HOW DO THEY MAKE IT SMELL SO NICE EVERYWHERE?
Overall I came away very happy and more relaxed than I had been in a while. A lot poorer but very happy at least. Oh and Breakfast was absolutely amazing and worth every penny on top. 
I’d love the hotel 41 to do a resort hotel with a similar concept where I would mooch from the pool to the Bar to the bedroom. Sign me up.",5,2021,08,11
137,10* Jewel in London’s crown ❤️,"An absolute jewel of a hotel, the service was something we had never experienced from start to finish this was a lifetime experience. Nothing to fault only to sing the praise of an amazing hotel. 10/10 on cleanliness, comfort and service can not recommend more.",5,2021,08,11
137,Like returning to see old friends,"We have been staying at Hotel 41 for nearly 10 years and it is out hotel of choice in London. This was out first stay since the pandemic and a long overdue rearrangement from previous cancelled trips. It was like seeing old friends, you felt everyone was pleased to see you and interested in how you had been through the madness of the last 18 months.
We stayed 3 nights, had a lovely room and enjoyed every moment of our stay, thank you Lauren & the team.
We chatted & laughed with every member of the team and enjoyed the roof terrace, the curry room, the bar at the Rubens and the Bbar, not to mention the executive lounge and all the wonderful staff, special thanks to Steve who has the same sense of humour as my husband.
Look forward to the next visit.",5,2021,08,07
137,Best hotel experience ever!!!,"This was, by far, the best stay in a hotel we have ever had in the world.  Impeccable service from everyone, including housekeeping staff, from the moment you step though the door. These guys have bought into a culture ""we do everything 100% right first time, without fail, no exceptions"". You could spend thousands more in some London legacy hotels and never experience this level of hospitality.  We will certainly return and will highly recommend 41.",5,2021,08,06
137,Best staff in hospitality,"Without question the most attentive and conscientious staff I've encountered.  We've stayed on a couple of occasions and the wife and I always remark on how wonderful they are.
The hotel itself is nice, and in a wonderful location for much of the city.  Highly recommend a stay",5,2021,08,05
137,Exceptional!,"From the second we stepped foot inside, until the moment we checked out (and a little bit after that as my husband has left our car keys in the safe so had to go back into the hotel) the service was impeccable. The hotel itself is stunning and in an ideal location but, make no mistake, it’s the staff that make this such a wonderful place to stay. 
We were given champagne and snacks on arrival and shown to our beautiful room. We had been told about the snack bar with crisps, chocolate and and ice creams to choose throughout the day. There were also other snack options available at different times of the day (plunder the pantry was most welcome after our theatre trip).
There is a lovely roof terrace to visit, if the weather permits. 
The room had a nespresso machine, Sky TV and everything else you may need. 
The turn down service was lovely too, they even had little cable tidies for our chargers!
We had breakfast which, again, was lovely.
We met up with my sister and brother in law for a meal and they were staying at The Langham Hotel and couldn’t believe the service we had been receiving at Hotel 41. 

Hotel 41, your staff are a credit to you.

Time to save up to visit again (and convince grandparents that they need to spend quality time with their grandkids as, alas, there are no family rooms at Hotel 41).",5,2021,08,05
137,A very special gem of a hotel,"This is quite simply the best hotel I've ever stayed in. Elegant and grand yet understated at the same time. The key to what is great about this hotel is the attention to detail in every aspect of your stay and that is down to the fantastic staff who cannot do enough for you. They make you feel at home whilst serving up many of the complimentary treats that are on offer, from champagne, to canapés, ice-cream and lovely little gifts left in the room. And the breakfasts are to die for, I particularly recommend the smoked salmon and caviar omelette.
The rooftop terrace offers fantastic views across the Buckingham palace mews, and feels almost Mary Poppins-esq sitting amongst the chimney pots! 
The executive lounge is a calm and relaxing environment, where you could easily feel like you were in a country residence rather than in central London. The position of the hotel is perfect for exploring on foot.
We chose to stay at 41 as my Mum had previously stayed and said that I must try the hotel sometime because she thought I would love it. She was right! I'm already planning future trips, and honestly don't think I'll be able to stay anywhere else in London now without being disappointed!",5,2021,08,03
137,Little luxurious gem,"Stayed pre pandemic and loved it and promised ourselves our first trip away when restrictions eased would be to return to this little luxurious gem - Hotel41. Our second visit did not disappoint,  treating ourselves to the conservatory master suite- WOW it was fabulous.  The hotel is small but perfectly formed, lots of classic black and white decor, with gentleman’s club grandeur in the executive lounge. The surroundings are amazing but it’s the staff that make this hotel exceptional- each person is dedicated to making your stay a truly wonderful experience. We can not fault it. It’s in a superb location for everything London has to offer. We’ll definitely be back and highly recommend.",5,2021,08,01
137,Top class hotel with superb staff,"A superb stay. The location of the hotel is perfect. The team are first class and make you feel very special, as if you are the only guests staying. The food is excellent and breakfast in particular is fantastic. We enjoyed raiding the pantry and having the canapés with drinks in the evening. A truly memorable trip to London.",5,2021,07,30
137,Best hotel I’ve stayed in !,"The decor is beautiful, bedroom comfortable and the lounge is superb. Very luxurious but cosy. Much time was spent enjoying drinks on the rooftop terrace !
On arrival we were greeted with a complimentary glass of champagne and thereafter there is a wealth of complimentary treats including chocolates, ice cream, scones served with jam and cream, evening canapés and sweet and savoury treats from the 
“ plunder the pantry “ trolley from 8pm.
Perhaps the best thing of all about the hotel is it’s wonderful staff. Everyone was so friendly , always addressing you by name and they were super efficient. Thank you all for making our stay so special.",5,2021,07,28
137,Exceptional staff - a very luxurious boutique stay.,"This was booked as a long post-lockdown treat, and, in line with all expectations ( in fact surpassing them considerably) we found the hotel, and staff to be truly exceptional. 
First class attentive service, from arrival to departure.  We were always made to feel special, and this was a very personal and gracious guest experience- absolut5ideal for special and romantic occasions. 
The location is superb for touring London, the west end and shows. In view of Buckingham Palace,  and minutes from Victoria Station.
Food was superb, breakfast included and this was bespoke, plentiful and exceptional every day.
In the evenings drinks are served with canapés in a small private club room.
This is a very intimate and small boutique experience,  far removed from a Marriott or Hilton - do not expect large lobbies, criwds, gyms and swimming pool.
We did get a very, very good price, most likely due to the pandemic, making the value of our stay extremely good. 
Regardless,  a fantastic stay with wonderful staff, in a superb central location.",5,2021,07,28
137,Perfect stay at Hotel 41,"Thank you so much for a fabulous overnight stay Hotel 41 for my mums 60th birthday! The little touches made our experience so memorable - the complimentary champagne and canapés, the birthday cake and chocolates in our room on arrival and the downturn in the evening to make our room really relaxing. My Mum said it was the best night sleep she has had in ages as the bed was so comfy and the room was so quiet! The staff couldn’t do enough to help us, and their friendly approach made us feel so welcome! Thank you - we will be back and we would highly recommend!",5,2021,07,28
137,Hotel 41 another gem from Red Carnation,The staff were excellent and the service was of the highest quality. The attention to detail was superb. Location was perfect only short walk to the palace. Rooms were luxurious and spacious and the lounge was fabulous for a quiet drink and some canapés Would highly recommend this hotel as excellent value for money as having stayed in pricier hotels in London with less than half the service.This is the third Red Carnation hotel have stayed in and all have been excellent value and quality.,5,2021,07,27
137,Still Brill,"Our 5th stay at Hotel 41 - which probably tells you all you need to know - and it continues to remain our favourite hotel for the reasons that virtually all other reviews have listed. It's too hot for me to rehash all of these so whilst I go off and have a Solero, why don't you do yourself a favour and book it. Promise you wont regret it.",5,2021,07,23
137,Sanctuary in the heart of London,"We’ve just spent three nights thoroughly enjoying the hospitality at Hotel 41. We stayed in one of the Executive King Suites, room 4114.

The hotel has the feel of an old fashioned private members club. The entrance is low-key almost like a speakeasy, nestled alongside the grander entrance to the Rubens.

We stayed during the summer heatwave, and the first thing we noticed on arriving was the chilled air welcoming us in, along with the signature scent that runs through all the public areas.

The room was great, compact but with everything we needed including a seating area and not one but two of the very best showers I’ve had in a hotel room. We had a lovely piece of cake in the room on arrival too which was a lovely touch.

There is a nice roof terrace offering very good cocktails in the afternoon and early evening with complimentary canapés.

The executive lounge hosts the rest of the public activity, breakfast, afternoon tea, dinner and the pantry plundering. The lounge is stunning, a real throwback to grand Georgian and Victorian London, all dark wood, leather and thick carpets. I’d have happily never left that room. The breakfast was wonderful, generous portions of superb quality food. The apple and ginger shots we were offered were a lovely extra touch. Having ice cream available whenever we wanted was a huge bonus given the scorching weather outside.

The one thing better than the executive lounge is the hotel staff. All of them were personable but wonderfully professional. Their warmth and willingness not just to help, but seemingly preempt our next need was just exceptional. To begin with the service level was almost overwhelming for us but by the end of our stay it was completely charming.

We both found the stay extremely relaxing, and in a City as busy as London is, their ability to provide a place of calm refuge to relax in was wonderful. We will happily return again favouring the intimate personal style over some of the similarly priced larger luxury competitors.",5,2021,07,21
137,"Our new favourite London hotel - super location, exceptional service and nothing is too much trouble","We stayed at Hotel 41 for a couple of nights for our 25th wedding anniversary and from the moment we were offered a complimentary glass of champagne from the lovely Steve Jones in the executive lounge while we were checking in, I knew we were going to have a great stay. Lauren on reception was super friendly and helpful, assisting us with alterations to dinner reservations and the like.

The executive lounge is just beautiful... tall mahogony panelling & bookcases, a glass ceiling, stunning chandeliers and a complimentary array of snacks, ice-cream, canapes, cheese & more at various times throughout the day. As mentioned by previous reviewers, the executive lounge does have the reception desk, comp pantry,  bar, and tables where you have drinks, breakfast or meals but it's relaxed, comfortable and really does have the feel of a private members club and is exclusive to hotel guests only so it was never too busy. 

There is also two little roof top bars and a mezzanine floor off of the executive lounge as alternative places to relax with a drink.

We stayed in one of the Executive King Rooms overlooking Buckingham Palace Mews and the room was quiet, reasonably spacious and spotlessly clean. The bed was blissfully comfortable, the remote controlled blinds were so much easier to use than the usual pull cords and the fridge was stocked daily with fresh water. There were little touches throughout our stay such as cake and chocolates on our arrival; rose petals, candles, massage oil, bath salts and choc dipped strawberries at turndown on our first night and an anniversary message on our mirror, candles, rose petals and gorgeous soaps for a luxurious bath on our second evening.

Throughout our stay, all members of staff were so friendly, knew us by name and simply couldn't do enough to make our stay as perfect as they could.

Dean, the food & beverage manager, was superb. He arranged for fresh milk to be put in our room which was much appreciated and was friendly and professional as was all of his team. 

The resident chef definitely needs a mention. Although we didn't eat a meal at the hotel as we'd made reservations elsewhere, everything we did eat during our stay was delicious including the complimentary canapes & croque monsieurs and the delightful breakfasts.

We're booked for another stay in a few days time and are in the process of booking a further stay in the next month or so as a treat for our adult kids and their partners which I think says everything you need to know about how much we enjoyed our stay.",5,2021,07,20
137,A Marvellous Experience,"We recently stayed at Hotel 41 for the first time and I can say without hesitation - we can’t wait to return!

It’s a beautiful hotel in an excellent location and overall, a marvellous experience - Thank you to the efficient, attentive and friendly staff that make it this way.",5,2021,07,19
137,Stay at Hotel 41 18th July 2021,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for the first time recently. It absolutely lives up to its reviews. You could select the attention to detail in the hotel, the exquisite rooms etc. 

You may find equally stunning hotels elsewhere. What sets Hotel 41 apart from other places is simply the people that work there. The whole team is exceptional in their service, but it isn't obsequious.  They are just so friendly, and have evident pride in the place. 

We'll certainly be back, as no doubt will others time and again. A hotel like this is difficult to replicate. It just works!",5,2021,07,19
137,Fabulous hotel with exceptional staff,"You arrive at the discreet entrance where a scarlet clad gentleman welcomes you into the gleaming and luxurious foyer, and here your visit to this elegant - but not stuffy or pretentious - hotel begins.  In the executive lounge on the fifth floor with its beautiful chandeliers and shelves of antique books you are invited to enjoy a glass of champagne whilst you check in, maybe enjoying some canapes.  How very civilised, and exemplifies the way the hotel is run, with staff ever willing to help ""whatever, whenever"".  

Do book a picnic in the park.  I felt like a princess for the day 👑",5,2021,07,17
137,London Calling part 3,"This is our third visit to London, and  our second stay at Hotel 41, it’s a superb hotel where the decor and service are spot on. Staff are  attentive to every detail of your stay, making us  feel welcomed at every point. 
The area is a great location for many attractions on foot or around the corner there is the tube to whisk you off to your destination. 
If you decide to visit check out the “Plunder the Pantry”, not going to tell you anymore about that 👨‍🍳😊!!!. 
It’s simply a great hotel, with fab staff, and those little extras that separate it from other hotels I have stayed in. 
Get booking 😊",5,2021,07,17
137,Not bad.. just awesome!👍,"From the friendly welcome at the lobby, to the final goodbye, everything was excellent 🌟.
The key to any successful business are its people/staff. #41 has definitely nailed that 1, i.e. all the staff were attentive without being intrusive.
The room was very comfortable, the food & other goodies, just yummtastic! 
Would we return ( like many have) .Oh Yes👍👍",5,2021,07,14
137,Incredible! The staff are exceptional. Still on cloud 9 from our stay.,Not sure where to begin....but from beginning to end our stay was amazing. The staff are happy to help with your every wish and stay relaxed and friendly to make you feel so welcome. The food and free flowing champagne....Plunge the Pantry....Excellent Margarita....Ice creams!! and treats are all lovely touches. Comfy bed. Truly the best time and its location as the Queen as your neighbour...what more can i say!... but THANK YOU x,5,2021,07,14
137,birthday trip,"first time at this lovely hotel, and it defiantly wont be the last. from the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty, the staff were so attentive and so very friendly. the hotel was so clean and fresh. i would highly recommend a stay there as its a great location. My son has already booked a night there on our return. I have to add that the bed was the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in. Thank you all for making my birthday very special. Thank you as well for leaving a little cake in our room, was very yummy although could not eat it all.",5,2021,07,13
137,Like having a home in central London,"A lovely hidden gem with great service, fabulous location and an array of unexpected delights such as a free glass of champagne on arrival, chocolates in your room each evening with turn down and a plunder pantry for snacks.
The rooms are a modest size but with very comfortable beds. Above all the welcome and service is exceptional. Relaxed luxury.",5,2021,07,12
137,Romantic 50th for my Husband,"Where can I begin, we went for my husbands 50th, they organised everything beautifully that I had organised, from the picnic, to the romantic turn down. Every member of the team are friendly and happy to help and willing to go the extra mile, even offering a later check out to help relax. The hotel is beautifully kept and all the small touches makes it a pleasure to stay. Thank you!",5,2021,07,11
137,Fabulous service and fantastic location- a real gem!,Absolutely loved our stay at Hotel 41. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and there were lovely touches like welcome champagne on arrival and chocolates in the room. We enjoyed cocktails on the roof and made full use of Plunder the Pantry. Room was sparkling clean and the bed was super comfy. We will be back!,5,2021,07,10
137,Our home from home!,"We have been fortunate to stay at Hotel 41 a few times and we wouldn’t want to stay anywhere else in London. 
It has the comfort of “home”  whilst maintaining the luxury feel, from the beautiful scent around the corridors; the polished interior in the lounge and excellent food quality.
The main positive is the staff; nothing is too much trouble and you are made to feel welcome. It’s lovely that they know your name and you are never asked for your room number!
We have used the valet service, which is great, park outside and they park and deliver your car for you. It was around £55 per 24 hours. 
The rooms are lovely and are high end comfort, which is what you need when walking around London all day. Our room had remote control blinds, a deep bath/shower, fridge, ironing board and iron, Sky TV (all channels), umbrella, tea/coffee facilities and water was replenished. The turn down service is also special.
The hotel has good Covid procedures; with hand sanitisers available, staff wearing masks and the room is very clean. 
There is lots of choice for breakfast; we tried different things each day.  The “pantry” offers snacks and nibbles in the evening and ice cream whenever you want. 
Location is great; opposite Buckingham Palace Mews, with eating/drinking establishments either side (The Rubens hotel and BBar); The Open top tour bus route is just outside; and Victoria tube station is about a 2 minute walk. 
We can’t wait to visit again!",5,2021,07,08
137,A Jewel in Buckingham Palace Road,"We stayed for 1 night with 2 friends to celebrate my husbands 65th Birthday . From the Champagne check in to the wonderful breakfast the next morning . The experience was fab!
The staff are excellent , to single out by name would not be fair.
Plundering the Pantry , having snacks on the roof terrace and sleeping in the most comfortable bed ever all added to a great time.
We will definitely be returning …it may seem extravagant but hey it’s worth it👍",5,2021,07,08
137,Pleasant stay but…,"Lovely location and  nice rooms which are quiet for london.
Staff have some absolute stars there who will do anything to help you, but some not so helpful.
I think perhaps they are resting on their laurels a little from the previous good feedback. 
It is very relaxed and a club atmosphere, but there is literally one main Lounge, which is comfortable , but there are no other areas to relax in. This is the same area where other guests are booked in and checked out. This means you overhear other guests being booked in or out whilst you are trying to enjoy your meal or drink. 
I also found the website a little misleading as they promise lots of included extra treats but they come with caveats. For example, canapés are complimentary but the impression from the website is that is with champagne. The champagne is not included and charged. Similarly afternoon scones and cream are complimentary,  but you have to pay £6 each for tea with it. I really do not have an issue paying for these items but it is just the impression is you are getting more than you actually are. I picked this hotel over other similarly priced hotels as I thought I would receive these complimentary items but then found you had to purchase the drinks that I had wrongly assumed were included.
It would not cost the hotel much to give free tea with the afternoon scones and the guest would be happier. Similarly, just state that canapés are complementary if you purchase a drink.
Just little niggles when you are paying a high price that left me a bit dissatisfied and not wishing to return to be honest.
Perhaps some really are not worried about these little points but my expectations were higher given the reviews.",3,2021,07,07
137,The best customer service ever!,"From the moment we checked in until the minute we left - the service we received at Hotel 41 was exceptional. It felt like every little detail had been thought about to make our stay feel as relaxed and special as possible. The hotel isn't big and the views from the rooms are nothing to write home about - but that  really doesn't matter as it is all about the experience. Every single member of staff was friendly, professional and couldn't do enough to make us feel welcome. Free champagne on arrival and free food and snacks everywhere. Certainly not the place to stay if you are on a diet :) But definitely the place to stay if you want to relax and indulge and receive the best ever customer service. Breakfast was incredible - delicious food, really punctual but not at all rushed and everything delivered with a smile and a friendly chat. Sunday breakfast was served until 1pm which says it all .. they want their guests to feel relaxed and to enjoy their stay. We were a little apprehensive about staying here as we hadn't heard of the hotel before ... but it was the best choice we could have made and I really hope we will be back one day. ",5,2021,07,06
137,Wonderful stay,"This is without doubt one of the best hotels I've ever had the pleasure of staying in. It's small for a luxury London hotel with only 30 odd rooms and suites but that adds to its charm and allows the staff to offer a more personal service.
Rooms are beautifully appointed and dressed in Hotel 41's signature monochrome. The executive lounge and rooftop bar are lovely places to have a drink and unwind with complimentary canapés.
I came away fully recharged and on a mission to get me some monogrammed bed linen in my life!",5,2021,07,06
137,Luxury on London,"My second stay in this delightful hotel and it never disapoints. Great service from the staff, the rooms are beautifully decorated and very clean. The location is prime and only a short and comfortable walk to most tourist hot spots. This hotel and all the staff give you the personal service that makes you feel more than welcome. We can wait to return.",5,2021,07,05
137,Fabulous stay - nothing too much trouble,"What a wonderful hotel, I booked this for my 40th birthday after reading all the reviews on here and it didn't disappoint. All the staff especially Steve Jones who made our stay exceptionally relaxed. We stayed in a room just off the corridor from the Executive lounge so it was like a home from home. We will be back again!",5,2021,07,04
137,Kyle's,"This hotel is exceptional, everything you could want has been thought off, the atmosphere is relaxing and friendly and the staff are a delight, nothing is too much trouble. Excellent attention to detail in the rooms which are beautiful. A real 5 star class act, super impressed.",5,2021,06,29
137,The best hotel I have ever stayed in!,"We celebrated my brother-in-law's 60th birthday at this fantastic hotel for a weekend in early June. I have stayed in many hotels but have never been treated to such  superb service as we have had from the staff at ""41"". The rooms were so comfortable, sporting the most comfortable bed we have ever slept on, with all the additions of tea and coffee facilities etc etc. The location of the hotel is within walking distance of  London Victoria BR Station and almost opposite Buckingham Palace grounds. The interior decor of the hotel is second to none. A warren of corridors regaled in interesting artworks lead you to the jewel of a reception area. Something of a 'gentlemens club' feel to the surroundings enhanced our experience to another level. We so much enjoyed the attention we were blessed with from the friendly staff. Nothing was a problem and every request was promptly reacted to with a smile. The rooftop terrace was a wonderful addition and a real bonus to afternoon drinks with a view. We cannot recommend this hotel enough. A wonderful experience. A memorable  weekend. Thank you ""41"".",5,2021,06,29
137,Best hotel in London,"My partner took me here for my birthday and we had the most incredible time. Nothing was too much for the staff, they were so attentive and friendly, the evening canapes were delicious and the breakfast was perfect. My partner proposed in the evening, and the staff made it so special (especially Andrew and Adele) and a completely unforgettable experience. I cannot wait to come back with our families. We could never stay anywhere else in London after having stayed here.",5,2021,06,23
137,Hotel 41,"This hotel is fabulous and is a secret that definitely should be shared! We had a wonderful stay and the staff, who were absolutely amazing, made us both feel very special.

We would definitely love to come and stay again.",5,2021,06,19
137,Amazing!,"Took my girlfriend for her birthday. We loved it! Fantastic room, fantastic service, the staff couldn’t do enough.  Complimentary food was such a nice touch and the breakfast was amazing! Can’t thank the staff enough!     I would recommend for anyone!",5,2021,06,19
137,"An amazing hotel, with amazing staff - Surprise Engagement","Where do I start!

I planned to stay at Hotel 41 for a surprise proposal to my partner of three years.

Firstly, I have to say a very big thank you to all the staff for making our stay extra special. An extra big thank you to the General Manager, Mr Hendry, who made it his mission to ensure everything went like clockwork!

When we arrived at Paddington Station, there was a luxury Range Rover waiting for us with chilled bottled water, which was much needed due to the sunny weather. 
When we pulled up to Hotel 41, two members of staff welcomed us opening the car doors and taking our luggage. We were then taken inside for check-in. You are then escorted up the elevator to the top floor where you are again escorted by a member of staff to the hotel’s own executive lounge.
In the lounge, we were offered a glass of champagne with nibbles, and even Penny, our Cockapoo was offered dog friendly champagne!
After another glass of champagne, we were shown to our room where we had been upgraded to a split level junior suite. The suite was amazing and had so much space.

We then went back to the lounge where a ‘Picnic in the Royal Park’ was prepared for us. We enjoyed this in St James’s Park. That evening we were offered Canapes in the lounge with cocktails.

The next day we woke up and spent the day walking around London. 
At 3pm we went for High Tea in the Executive Lounge, and then the big event!!!

At 6pm, we were escorted to the Hotel’s Cinema Room. In the Cinema Room, the hotel staff arranged for the room to be covered in rose petals, candle, sweet treats etc.  I had also arranged for a singer to preform – I would highly recommend Laura’s Paper Hearts. 
He said YES!!!
Following this we sat down to watch Rocket Man Elton John with a few glasses of champagne. 

When we went back to the room, we found the room had been turned down with petals, candles, bath salts, massage oil and an amazing chocolate cake!

Top and bottom, I really cannot thank the hotel staff enough for everything they did for us, they really did go above and beyond and no words can show my appreciation. 

We will certainly be back!

P.s. This was Penny’s first time in a 5* Hotel, after all the fussing from every member of staff we passed, she refused to leave!!! They truly do treat pets like they treat their guests",5,2021,06,19
137,Beautiful hotel ran by an exceptional team,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for my mum’s birthday and had an amazing experience.

As you walk into Hotel 41 you are instantly greeted by the wonderful scent created specially for the hotel. It certainly adds a touch of luxury to the atmosphere and both my mum and I really loved it. The hotel itself has beautiful dark academia decor that is both unique and welcoming. The Executive Lounge in particular was striking and to be honest, we didn’t want to leave! 

While checking in, we were given a choice of champagne and nibbles. The check in process was smooth and efficient and then afterwards shown to our room. The room itself was spacious, very clean and comfortable. We really appreciated the wonderful selection of teas and coffees that were made available in the room as well. I put in a request for specific teas prior to our arrival (we are avid tea drinkers) and the hotel kindly accommodated us. 

The team went above and beyond to make my mum’s birthday wonderful. I want to especially thank Lauren who was incredibly attentive and made our stay truly fantastic!! The whole team are a huge asset to the hotel as everyone we spoke to was very knowledgeable and professional. I mentioned that I had allergies/dietary requirements and this was noted and accommodated throughout our whole stay. Thank you so much for this! 

We decided to try the hotels late evening snack service “Plunder the Pantry” and that is a brilliant concept. In the evening you can visit the Executive Lounge and choose from a wide variety of savoury and sweet offerings. This was such a relaxing way to end the day! We also had breakfast at the hotel and again, just like everything else, it was perfect, with attentive service and great food. 

I would absolutely love to return to Hotel 41 and I am already planning a trip with my partner. I have been very fortunate to stay in several luxury hotels in London due to my work but Hotel 41 has exceeded every expectation. The whole experience of this stay was simply exceptional!",5,2021,06,17
137,A Much-Anticipated Return That Didn't Disappint,"Having first visited Hotel 41 last summer, my partner and I were so impressed we decided to return for my 40th later that year. The continued lockdowns scuppered these original plans, but the Hotel were superb about helping us rearrange, and keeping in contact with us as regulations changed.

We finally managed to get the booking sorted for this weekend, and it was frankly superb. We just wanted a nice, relaxing weekend, and the service and quality provided made sure that happened.

Our room was delightful, the breakfasts were outstanding and the afternoon tea was sublime - I couldn't recommend the Hotel enough to anyone.

I'd like to say thanks to Andrew, Adele, Dean, Erica, Lauren and Orsi (as well as all the other guys we didn't get a chance to chat with) for being so welcoming and making our delayed celebration so amazing. We hope to see you again soon!",5,2021,06,15
137,Delightful. ,"We were visiting London to buy our wedding rings and wanted somewhere special to stay. Hotel 41 is more than special. It is wonderful. 
A unique place and a superb team make for a delightful combination. We enjoyed every minute. 

Part of the uniqueness of Hotel 41 is the Executive Lounge which provides a hub in which to relax. Plunder the Pantry is a great feature, but the complimentary canapés are a lovely touch at cocktail time.

One of our favourite features though is Whatever Whenever. Not only a brilliant idea, but it sums up on two words the approach to delivering great service. ",5,2021,06,15
137,Brilliant Experience ,"There is not a grand palatial entrance to this hotel, but the staff treat you like royalty.

The whole experience of staying in Hotel 41 is a pleasure. The complimentary food and welcome glass of champagne make you feel very special.

The decor is muted elegance. The roof terrace is functional, but once again,the friendly staff make all the difference.

I would definitely return!

",5,2021,06,14
137,It really doesn’t get better than Hotel 41,"Where do I start?  My experience at Hotel 41 was everything I could have hoped for and more.

It is such an intimate venue on one floor with only 28 rooms.  From the moment you arrive, everyone on staff greets you by name and you feel you have stepped into a club that makes you feel at home and like family.  

They welcome you at the lounge which was my home away from home for 4 days.  
I was then escorted to my wonderful room which was impeccable.  Nothing is overlooked.  The decor is all black and white from the carpets to the linens to the lovely artwork through the hotel.  

While the room was amazing, it’s the customer service that will really make you not want to leave.  From Lauren, David, Steve, Andrew, etc.  They offer world class service that I challenge you to find better at any other five star hotel in the world.

In the evenings during turndown service they leave you lovely treats like soaps, sleep spray, cookies, etc.  The black out shades are wonderful and the bed was super comfortable.  I couldn’t have asked for any more.  

The executive lounge is such a treat.  They offer snacks throughout the day like bowls of Lindt chocolates and individual cups of Jude’s ice cream.  Who knew Black Coconut ice cream could taste so good?

A special thank you to Lauren for the popcorn to take home to my dog, Bear, and for your incredible hospitality.

Thank you so much to the entire staff (including housekeeping who are behind the scenes, but work their magic) for the getaway I so needed.  You singlehandedly restored my mental health during these challenging times and I can’t wait to return.",5,2021,06,13
137,Wonderful and much loved - The best!,"Wonderful hotel! The best! So glad to be back! 

A fabulous stay at the wonderful Hotel 41 - absolutely deserving of the number 1 spot out of all the many hotels across London. Walking into the lobby you walk into another world of luxurious calm where nothing is too much trouble.

The rooms are all in a simple but luxurious black & white theme. The king executive rooms are large. I prefer the rooms looking out on the Royal Mews - Buckingham Palace Road. There is generous complimentary fizz on arrival, a complimentary ‘Plunder the Pantry’ for supper from 8pm and breakfast is extensive delicious, there are complimentary canapés and toasties  from 6pm. You cannot be hungry here! 

Highly recommended and much loved
Thank you Hotel 41!",5,2021,06,12
137,Perfection,By far the best hotel we have ever stayed in up town (probably the world!). Absolutely faultless from start to finish. Made to feel so welcome by all of the marvellous staff and nothing was too much trouble. Planning our next return already. Thank you Hotel 41 for making my husband's 50th birthday treat so special. ,5,2021,06,09
137,2nd stay just as good as the 1st,"Hotel 41 really is an outstanding hotel, this is our 2nd stay. The service they provide is fantastic and we enjoyed our visit as much as our last. There is now the great addition of the rooftop terrace, which we enjoyed in the fabulous weather. We have been fortunate to stay in some great hotels - Hotel 41  however really does top the list, a real hidden gem.",5,2021,06,07
137,Amazing,"Me and my fiancé stayed at this hotel at the end of may. We had the most amazing time. The staff where incredible and so helpful. The hotel and room where amazing. Also the experiences the hotel offer and the restaurants are super. Would recommend to anybody 

Thank you to all the staff",5,2021,06,07
137,A midweek break to Hotel 41 over the June half term was a memorable experience for all the right reasons,"From the minute we arrived until the minute we left, our experience of Hotel 41 was a fantastic experience. The staff were always very willing to help and provided a high quality of service. What made it personal was the fact that they always referred to us by our name every time we had contact with them. The room was of a very high standard and was well equipped with everything you’d need for a luxurious stay. The  food and drink at the hotel was very good. Complimentary champagne on arrival, free canapés in the evening and free food from the restaurant available 24 hours a day, made the stay even more enjoyable. We have stayed in numerous hotels around the world and I can safely say that Hotel 41 ranks in the top 3.",5,2021,06,06
137,A second excellent stay!,"It is difficult to write a review of this hotel which contains anything but superlatives. My second stay saw me have the room I asked for and a chance to discover their terrace where I ate on my first evening. The rooms are brilliantly equipped with anything your heart  may desire, turndown service and luxurious toiletries.The breakfast menu and the quality of the food is outstanding.The service is discreet and impeccable. A real home from home ! Just go and enjoy! You would be very hard pushed indeed to find a better hotel in the whole of the UK!
I have booked to return in September.",5,2021,06,06
137,41 really is our home from home in London,"We have been visiting 41 for nearly 8 years now and we were lucky enough to squeeze in a visit last August and have just returned from another wonderful stay. 

It really is “home from home” for us and we are so happy to see that the majority of the fabulous staff are still there and providing such friendly, excellent service. We were lucky enough to have the sunshine which allowed us to go up to the rooftop and relax. Our suite was every bit as good as the last time we stayed and we can’t wait to book our next trip. Such a very special place ❤️",5,2021,06,06
137,Just sublime,"We can see why this is a world class hotel. The staff are fantastic and can't do enough. From the glass of champagne poured by the lovely Mr Jones on arrival, to check out when I was advised where to get some Lucozade nearby for my sore head!! (We had got engaged the night before so it's allowed...!) A very good excuse to visit every year. Thanks for a lovely stay. Jess & Ben ",5,2021,06,05
137,The next best thing to home!,"I call this hotel ""The next best thing to home"" but in many ways it's better than home! The service is impeccable but in a friendly way that instantly puts you at ease... it's like meeting up with old friends! We've stayed here 4 or 5 times now, the previous time was about 2 years ago but they still remembered us even though our booking history wasn't linked (that's how much they value their guests). I firmly believe the reason they are the no. 1 rated hotel in London (besides the beautiful decor, the exquisite attention to detail and the amazing culinary talents) is due to the wonderful people, especially Lauren and Steve, for whom nothing was too much trouble. We can't wait to return!",5,2021,06,05
137,An unforgettable Mini Moon,"First of all we would like to say a big thank you to all the staff at Hotel 41, Lauren, Gabriel, Dean,  Marlene, and many more staff, you’re professional standards will be remembered, from entering Hotel 41, each staff member called us by our names, wanted to know are plans for the day, and on return asked about our day out. Always on hand to help with everything.
We had asked for a standard room, and we were overwhelmed by the upgrade- thank you! We were greeted with champagne and canapés, so fresh and delicious, just what we needed after our journey, we sat in the lounge while our bags etc were delivered to our room, sipping on champagne and relaxing. Then we went to our upgraded room- wow, everything was top notch! A lovely congratulations slice of cake, and a hand written card. The room was well equipped with so much- A seated area downstairs with a TV, coffee & Tea, water, a desk with everything needed inside the draw, pen, paper, post it’s etc. Upstairs we were greeted with such a large bed, soft linen,  ( the bed was so comfortable) a large TV, with all sky channels, water on each side of our bed. The bathroom was huge! A walk in shower room (powerful shower was bliss) a very deep bath with a TV at the end. All bathroom amenities were on offer, from nail files to shower gel, to exfoliating gloves to a shaving kit.
The best was to come-
If we went out for dinner, and returned in the evening, the staff had turned down our room, pulling the bedding back, lighting a candle in the bathroom, putting fresh water by our beds, slippers placed at each side of the bed, blinds rolled down. We were truly being looked after.
The larder opened from 8-1am, and offered such a delicious variety of food, cheese boards, puddings, canapés, on top of this you could help yourself to crisps, nuts, sweets, chocolates, and cold still or sparking water, all in with the price.
Breakfast was perfect, from a full English to patisseries, toast, omelettes, fresh juices, tea, coffee, all served fresh and hot, and so tasty. It totally filled us up for the whole day!!!
We will definitely return, as yes it’s a hidden gem in a busy city! The minute you walk through the front doors it’s hard to believe you are in London. The Hotel is beautiful, from the furnishings to the rooms. The staff are first class, and make you feel first class. This was our mini moon, and after cancelling our honeymoon aboard, it was like fate, because I’m sure we would not have had this service or High standards from anywhere else, and 100% we are so happy we mini mooned in the UK at Hotel 41. Thank you all for an amazing experience and a wonderful stay, until we meet again.
Shaun and Jo Weston.",5,2021,06,04
137,Our number 1 hotel,"Still our number 1 hotel. Absolutely amazing service from the minute we arrived. Such a special place to stay to celebrate our daughter’s 18th birthday. The staff are so friendly and helpful. Nothing is too much trouble, from providing hair straighteners to blister plasters. The breakfast included was amazing, as well as the delicious canapés served with drinks, endless sweets and ice cream and the plunder the pantry was a real treat too. The new rooftop bar is beautiful with fantastic views. The perfect place to spend the evening and watch the sunset. Special thanks to Andrew who was especially attentive and took great care of us all over the weekend. 
We can’t wait to come back soon to our favourite hotel.",5,2021,06,03
137,Best hotel in London,"Very exclusive calm atmosphere. All staff members are very tentative and helpful, in particular Dean and David. Whether you have champagne on the roof terrace or executive lounge the service is second to none. We stay in london once or twice a month and Hotel 41 is our new favourite. Can't wait to go back
Pure class...",5,2021,06,02
137,A FIVE STAR STAY IN A FIVE STAR HOTEL,"Amazing hotel which deserves its Forbes rating. From the moment you check in where your suitcases disappear and then reappear in your amazing room you know your stay is going to be wonderful.
We had booked as a birthday treat for my husband and were upgraded to the Monarch suite which the attached pictures do not do justice too. 
All staff knew your name and we were treated like royalty which is apt considering the view from our window was the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace. We were even lucky enough to see the Royal carriage going out for a practice run for the Queens birthday parade.

The Executive Lounge was exceptional and the various complimentary extras are a lovely touch. The roof terrace was open as the weather was fantastic and they even provide suncream and sunglasses.
A special mention must go to Andrew who was so polite and made our stay. 
All in all 41 is the best hotel we have ever stayed in and we can't wait to return.",5,2021,06,02
137,Didn’t want to leave!,"This was a very belated 50th birthday night away - goodness me was it worth waiting for!

From the entrance right through to the rooftop bar, we felt instantly at home, very welcome and most definitely treated us like we were the only ones there.  All staff members are incredibly helpful, smiley but not over bearing which is quite a feat.

Hubby organised afternoon tea and romantic turndown  - be prepared to be blown away by exquisite service and such thoughtful touches.

We’re booking a return visit very soon to enjoy the splendour and the hidden gem that is Hotel 41 and the staff; don’t ever change as it all completely works.

Thanks again and see you all very soon xx",5,2021,06,01
137,"Fantastic service, akin to being treated like the Royalty down the road.","Amazing service, second to none.  Check in and check out are not rushed, allowing you to utilise the comfortable executive lounge.  The complimentary snacks bar and ice cream freezer were fantastic additions and breakfast was delicious, with a couple of options you wouldn't see everywhere.  Nice rooftop bar area too.

The only slight improvement I would make is, although the blinds and curtains are clearly enough for blackout purposes, just ensuring the blinds and curtains could close to minimise the amount of light coming into the room.",5,2021,06,01
137,A Little Hidden Gem! ,"I have just returned from a short weekend away with my 9 year old son in London. This was my son's first time visiting the capital, so I wanted to make it a little special.  Staying at Hotel 41 definitely contributed to making it a lovely weekend which we both enjoyed immensely. If you are looking for small intimate hotel with excellent attention to detail and service in general, I would definitely recommend 41. Both my son and I felt very looked after without any of the pretentiousness you can get in some 5 star hotels. My son is autistic so the calm and quiet of the hotel was a good contrast to the bustle of the city.  The staff are very friendly,  especially Andrew who will go above and beyond  to help, he is an absolute asset to the hotel! ",5,2021,05,31
137,Impeccable!,"How amazing to have had the most wonderful stay in London at Hotel 41. 

From the initial booking to leaving everything was taken care of with such professionalism. The team at Hotel 41 are some of the most attentive and kind individuals of their profession.  

The food was delicious from breakfast to lunch, canapés to dinner. With a vast arrange of drinks on offer along with a well thought out menu for food. My dietary restrictions were no trouble and I was very well catered for. 

The staff were superb but a special mention to Steve, Erica, Svete, Lauren and Andrew. You along with the rest of Hotel 41 took such care of us and were so attentive. You really made our stay all the more enjoyable. 
It’s not just the special touches that Hotel 41 provide (I won’t spoil it by telling you, go for yourself) it’s the staff and Hotel 41 wouldn’t be the same without these extraordinary people. 
So thank you from myself and Sam we will be back!

137,Luxury hotel with great service,A hidden Jem in London on the 5th floor. Greeted with champagne as I checked in. The staff and attention to detail is exceptional. Breakfast was first class with a range of delicious options. Looking forward to the next trip.,5,2021,05,26
137,"Fantastic stay, outstanding service!!","The reviews aren’t wrong, the service at Hotel 41 is outstanding. I stay in lots of very nice hotels, all over the world and very rarely go out of my way to write a review. I couldn’t help myself with Hotel 41!

My wife and I checked in on Thursday and stayed until Sunday without the kids for a romantic, relaxing break. The first since lockdown 3.0  

Upon check in we were helped up to the executive lounge, you are greeted with a glass of fiz. 

The staff make this hotel so special, Andrew did a great job of welcoming us and remembered us from the first time we visited 18 months ago, so did all the other staff, checking you in, showing you to your room and making you feel comfortable. The ‘whenever/whatever’ button in your room does exactly what it says..... if you need anything, they will get it for you 

Andrew, Dean and Steve in the executive room are fantastic, very personable and professional, they did an amazing job of keeping us hydrated!!!! excellent recommendations with food choices and drinks and made sure our classes were never empty.  

thank you Alex for getting me heart burn tablets in the pouring rain!

Breakfast service and food is exceptional 

The only risk of staying at this hotel is that you will not get to see much of London because you will not want to leave....",5,2021,05,24
137,Just Heaven !!,"First weekend after hotels re-opened following easing of lockdown and we we were blessed to enjoy a 2 night weekend stay at Hotel 41.
It is just ""Heaven"".
No stress. Just calm and serenity throughout our stay, and the best staff ever. Somehow amongst an incredibly warm, efficient and genuinely caring team of wonderful people , ""Andrew"" manages somehow to distinguish himself as just exceptional. 
From the moment you arrive and have a glass of complimentary  champagne pressed into you hand, to the moment you (sadly) leave, the attention to detail is just perfect throughout. 
We  especially love Breakfast served in the room which is just brilliant. Food great and staff take so much care to set up the table and to make sure everything is perfect.

Just Perfect.

137,Couldn’t recommend more,We had a night stay here with friends and it was flawless from start to finish. The staff are the best we’ve come across at any hotel and nothing is too much. The selection of snacks and extra touches were exceptional and we will definitely come back as soon as we can. The standards are so high and the staff are so professional whilst being friendly and paying so much attention to detail. Thank you to everyone for making our stay so special.

137,An Amazing Experience,"We had the pleasure of staying at this beautiful boutique hotel to celebrate our wedding.  From the very first contact from booking and arriving at the hotel, everything was seamless and no trouble.  Upon entering the hotel the smell was divine, we were greeted at the lift by the receptionist and invited to check in with a customary glass of rose champagne.  

Now that’s how you do check in !!

Our room was amazing fully appointed with the best smelling Floris toiletries.  This hotel is full of little surprises and extras.  Canapés and croque monsieurs with drinks in the evening.  The ever present and fully stocked plunder the pantry which was always different.  

Our rate included an afternoon tea and what an experience that was, they have the most amazing pastry chef.  

Breakfast in the morning was simply superb, Coconut Kombucha overnight oats.  I need the recipe !! The choice was astounding you certainly will not go hungry and it was presented with such elegance and grace by ever smiling faces. 

We absolutely loved our stay here, it felt like we were in a members club. 

Loved it so much we have already booked our next stay.  This will be our go to whenever we stay in London.

Well done all the staff at Hotel 41.",5,2021,05,21

The rooms are perfectly appointed and generously equipped. A great choice of food and drink, including a wonderful breakfast. Highly recommended for anybody looking for some unpretentious, exclusive boutique excellence....and did I mention how great the staff are!",5,2021,05,19
137,Truly the Most Magnificent Hotel in London,"I would highly recommend Hotel 41 (there is no other hotel like this one).  Where do I begin - The staff are the most customer focused, attentive individuals I have ever met - they will go over and beyond to ensure you have the best experience ever.  They will ensure your every need is met and they truly are the most genuine and caring individuals you will meet.

The check in process is amazing - always a special treat.  

The rooms are fabulous and have an individual signature touch.

The cocktails and drinks are served with a smile and  always an interesting conversation.

The breakfast is delicious and every need is met.  Pancakes are truly amazing.

The Terrace is gorgeous where you must have a cocktail or two and soak up the atmosphere.

Genuinely my second home and my Hotel 41 family.

There is no other place to book.  You will never be disappointed with Hotel 41.  

Always a pleasure to stay.  But most of all thank you to all the staff.",5,2021,04,18

137,An experience beyond words,"We stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate my birthday, and what a treat!  From the moment we arrived we were treated to the most luxurious yet relaxed experience.   Welcomed with a glass of champagne, our registration card brought to us for signature, along with snacks, and then we're taken to our room where our bags were already waiting for us.  Our room was the Balmoral Suite and it's gorgeous - looking out on the Mews.  The bathroom is dated and an unusual configuration, but doesn't take away too much from the room.   The staff are just wonderful, we were never asked for a room number, they all knew us by name and all wished me happy birthday at various stages throughout the day.   It really felt like a home from home - if my home was luxurious, had an amazing fully stocked, delicious pantry, welcoming staff and made the best chocolate martinis.   Breakfast is served in the lounge and has a fantastic selection that really sets you up for the day.

The location is fabulous, surrounded by parks, Buckingham Palace and took us just 20 mins to walk to Covent Garden.   I really can't fault Hotel 41.  In these Covid times, we felt so safe and everything is handled in a social distanced, yet polite, way.  We checked out the day before Tier 3 was introduced in London and it pains me to know that the team there, like so many in hospitality, have such an uncertain future.   When travel allows again, Hotel 41 should be on everyone's travel list - it's an experience not to be missed.",5,2020,12,23
137,Simply outstanding in the heart of London ,"We decided to stay at Hotel 41 as a treat to cheer us up after having so many plans scuppered throughout the year and what a great decision that was. 

Everything about the hotel is first class, from the location (the Queen is quite literally a neighbour) to the greeting upon arrival, the welcoming staff and the luxurious room through to the abundance of sweet treats available 24hrs, the pre-dinner canapés and of course the option to “plunder the pantry” until 1am. 

But the thing that sets this hotel apart from your usual 5 star hotel is the friendliness and approachability of all the staff. You expect professionalism at this type of hotel but it felt as if everyone went over and above and treated us as though we were old friends, which makes such a difference in making you feel welcome. 

The hotel was immaculately clean, the food deliciously scrumptious, the wine exquisitely refreshing but the service was simply outstanding in the heart of London. 

If you wish to treat yourself to the best stay in London you cannot go far wrong by choosing Hotel 41. 

Our first but definitely not our last visit. ",5,2020,12,16

137,Amazing hotel - wonderful service,"We stayed here for our wedding night in September. From the moment we arrived the service was impeccable. We were greeted by a doorman who seemed to know who we were and whisked our bags away and directed us to the lobby. There, we were offered a complimentary glass of champagne and some delicious canapes (note, this is a standard part of their service, so all guests are offered this!). We were then shown to our room - we are a fairly young couple so had booked one of the most reasonably priced rooms, but found we had been upgraded to a suite which was worth about 3x what we had paid - we also had a delicious chocolate cake and box of chocolates in the room and pairs of slippers with his and hers bags for them. The upgrade was incredible, and the extras were such a thoughtful touch. The room itself was amazing - set over two floors with a small lounge area with a fridge, TV, fireplace, and writing desk downstairs, as well as a coat cupboard also containing an ironing board! Then upstairs was a mezzanine floor with another desk, the biggest, and comfiest, bed I have ever slept in, and another TV. The bathroom had a walk in shower, as well as a beautiful bath with a third TV at the end of it. There was no end of little products such as the expected toiletries, but also bamboo toothbrushes, a nail care kit, loofahs, and some gorgeous scented lavendar sleep spray. I'm not sure which of these are standard for all rooms, or whether some were specific to the suite, but all were very appreciated! 
The hotel lobby has a constant supply of free food - they offer afternoon tea (we arrived after this as we were getting married!), During the evening they offer canapes, then later at night they have a selection of dishes like salads and little meals. I had a homemade pork pie with picallili and had a Greek salad to accompany it - both were delicious. My husband wanted something more substantial so ordered off the (not free) room service menu, and had a cheeseburger with chips - this was also delicious, and the chips were accompanied with an excellent aioli. 
There are also snacks like ice cream tubs, chocolates, and popcorn available, although we didn't try these, it was nice to know they were available!
The breakfast the following morning, we had in our room, it was also excellent, freshly squeezed juices, delicious pastries, beautiful freshly prepared cooked breakfasts, and tasty coffees adorned with chocolate sprinkles in the hotel 41 logo. 
The staff were constantly available to help, with excellent service and always a smile, we felt very welcome. We were sent away the following day with complimentary bottles of waters and sweets for the journey, as well as well wishes from the staff.
We will definitely be looking to return at some point, possibly for our wedding anniversary, we highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a hotel for a special occasion! It is a bit pricey, but for a special treat it is so worth it!!",5,2020,12,13
137,I promise that this is THE place to stay for that special trip away!!!,"Well most of what I say here simply wouldn't do Hotel 41 justice. We stayed on Sunday 6th December for just one night but I so wish it was for longer. From the moment you arrive at the ground floor reception you just know that the beautiful hallway you know that you are going somewhere very special indeed!! From the gorgeous decor and luxurious furnishings everything feels quintessentially British and these guys just get it so right. 
We arrived at 1pm and were greeted with what they describe as their tradition of a complimentary glass of champagne to help you adjust to your new surroundings. I have had worse greetings when checking in to a hotel for sure!!! We then enjoyed some afternoon nibbles in the residents lounge before being shown to our room which was a Junior Suite. We had been lucky enough to be upgraded and our room was beautiful. All furnishings were monogrammed with their logo including the towels, flannels, bed sheets and pillows. Everything just felt so sumptuous & luxurious.  I very rarely feel passionate about a hotel but here both me and my wife loved it. I would stress my warm feelings towards the hotel is just as much about the staff as it is the building itself. Whilst the service is impeccable it isnt stuffy. Its a very relaxed environment where it feels like they have thought of your every need before you knew you needed it!!! Can you find cheaper in London? Yes of course. Can you find better bang for your buck? I very much doubt it. ",5,2020,12,09
137,Amazing weekend break,"Just back from a fabulous stay at Hotel 41. 
The room was spotlessly clean and well equipped. During the turndown service the open fire was lit, a hot water bottle was placed in the bed and a candle lit in the bathroom. This made for a lovely cosy return. 
The lounge is beautifully and tastefully decorated with a complimentary snacks area which was fully stocked with individually bagged and wrapped sweets and chocolates. 
When we enjoyed our drinks by the fireside we were presented with canapés and squares of toasted sandwiches which were delicious. 
The breakfast was perfectly cooked and presented and was on until 1pm which could be a bonus to many after a late night. 
For me, the very best part of this wonderful hotel is its staff. Nothing was too much trouble for them. We received a warm and sincere welcome by all of the staff but Andrew really went out of his way to make our trip extra special. 
I will definitely stay at Hotel 41 again as it offers a far more personal service than any of the larger 5 star hotels I have stayed at.",5,2020,12,07
137,Best hotel in London,"This hotel is absolutely phenomenal - I cannot fault it at all. The customer service is exemplary. I have stayed here four times now and I will definitely be returning next year. Each time I go they put little touches in the room welcoming me back, they even gave us a room upgrade. 
Dean was absolutely fantastic. The staff are so attentive and it made my stay very memorable. 
Thank you again hotel 41, see you all soon.",5,2020,12,07
137,An absolutely gem of a hotel,"We stayed for only one night for my 50th birthday and wow this hotel is wonderful in so many ways. The staff really make this hotel a cut above the rest. They are extremely attentive, they make you feel like you are their most special guest and remember details about what you said the day before, ask after how your day was and are genuinely interested in ensuring you are having a great stay. The hotel itself is superb, love the black and white theme and the smell from their own room spray is delightful throughout. All the little touches that they offer like the complimentary glass of champagne on arrival to the nibbles constantly available and the little box of chocolates in the room are lovely. The bed was extra comfy too! Special mention to David who served us breakfast, what a lovely young man and served so impeccably too. Absolutely recommend this beautiful little gem. ",5,2020,12,06
137,Costly but lovely,Really enjoyed my stay there. Very beautiful and welcoming stay. The room was very big and beds were nicely arranged . My whole family enjoyed the stay. But the price is too much.it should be reduced .,4,2020,12,05
137,Charming Hotel in Westminster,"I traveled here pre-Covid but even if I were to go back, I would stay here as the staff were warm and very helpful and the rooms were immaculate. The hotel interior is very impressive and the rooms are modern and well-designed, retaining some period-like features that seemed original to the property.

There was an issue with my bathroom in the morning of check-out day, however, the staff were quick on their feet and allowed me to use a bathroom of an alternative room (I did not want to move rooms as I liked the room I was assigned to). 

Their amenities were also great - the slippers were so fluffy with his and hers pouches to match. 

I fell in love with their parlor-like space where breakfast was served, along with cocktails in the evenings. The cocktails were good and breakfast was great. 

The photos do not do justice, however, hope they are helpful.",5,2020,11,22
137,5 stars and more,"This is the second visit I have had to this fabulous hotel. Everything about the hotel is magnificent,  from the welcome at the door to the goodbye when you leave making you feel that you are the most cherished guests. 
Every  member of staff extols the same exemplary level of courtesy and service at every opportunity. The Executive lounge is exquisite, intimate  and comfortable.  
Our room,  an Executive King was spectacular, providing us with everything that we needed for our stay and much more including a scrumptious, chocolate celebration cake. 
Hotel 41 is a jewel, in an excellent location,  to be discovered in London.",5,2020,11,14
137,"Elegant, cosy and warm","We were lucky enough to have chosen Hotel 41 for our wedding anniversary in October.  I had stayed in Red Carnation Hotels before in South Africa so was familiar with their exceptional customer service and warm welcome.  We were not disappointed.  From the moment we arrived it was as if we were their most important guests, though I know everyone had that experience.   Our room was stunning and had everything you could possible need including some fresh milk in the fridge which we had requested prior to arrival and a little chocolate anniversary cake.  The executive lounge is very cosy and comfortable with a wonderful fire and book lined walls.  If you like a small and intimate hotel in a wonderful location then look no further than Hotel 41.  We also ate at bbar restaurant (only one open due to Covid) which was fabulous.",5,2020,11,12

137,Belmond Pullman trip,"We stayed here because it was a short walk to Victoria station for our Belmond British Pullman train trip to Bath. The hotel was lovely, rooms fantastic, comfy beds, roaring fireplace. We loved the cosy lounge/reception area. The staff were all exceptionally friendly and genuine with it. They thought of every little detail there, I cannot think of one negative. It was the best shower ever and I loved their ‘raid the pantry’ idea, for late snacks. Brilliant! ",5,2020,11,05
137,Fabulous birthday stay,"Hotel 41 is the most wonderful 5 star hotel. Everything is sheer class, rooms,atmosphere, food and above all staff. During a 3 night break for my wife’s birthday we could not have been treat better, looked after better or felt more special. From start to end everything was perfect!",5,2020,11,01
137,Quick staycation in London.,"Quick staycation in London!

My partner and I stayed at hotel 41 for the weekend. The word “stayed” in it self seems to suggest, a passing visit. And if you travel frequently like we do, a hotel can become somewhat of a lacklustre experience.  

Hotel 41, however, is in itself an experience, that should be on everyone’s bucket list at least once in your lifetime. Read on, and I’ll walk you through how this hotel has successfully encapsulated the true meaning of hospitality!

Upon arrival we were greeted by the receptionist in the private reception hall on the street level. The moment the front door closes behind you, the city noise disappears instantly. Your eye is immediately drawn in by the carved wood panelling, the striking black and white marbled floors and gleaming brass detailing. We felt like we were gliding when we were led to the elevator and whisked up to the top floor of the building. David, greeted us with a big smile (even though he wore a face mask we could tell he was smiling - strict Covid measures are adhered to effectively, but without impacting the overall experience) he led us to the executive lounge, where we sat down and forgot about the world. Quite literally forgot about all the turmoil our world is sadly going through right now. As part of the check in procedure, we were presented with the champagne trolley featuring not just one but three champagnes to choose from as our welcome refreshment. 

After spending a few minutes taking in the fabulous interiors and the calming effect this serenely atmospheric lounge offers, we were escorted by David to our room. 

As we arrived after dark, the room had been meticulously turned down, with a candle in the bathroom, welcome note from the resident manager and a little gift of handmade chocolates. Before I go on, one thing to note, is the team pay attention to the finer details. Your name is used at every exchange. Without feeling too obstructive or over the top. In fact they knew our names the moment we walked through the main entrance.  Our room was spacious and featured a fireplace. The electric Roman blinds were down and our bed pristinely prepared to welcome a good nights sleep. I need their expert advice on how to keep sheets crease-free. They looked as though they were photoshopped. We quickly changed and returned to the lounge. We were looked after by Dean and Gabriel. Gabriel chatted with us after handing us the drinks menu, and we discovered he’s a man of great passion for hotels. His career in the trade has taken him to some of London’s most iconic hotels, like the Dorchester and the ritz he tells us. He must have some fascinating stories to tell. 

At hotel 41, the hospitality is truly generous.  Our pre-dinner drinks were served on the Mezzanine level of the lounge. 

As someone that appreciates historical architecture, the mezzanine gives you a great vantage view of the original details of the building’s heritage. 

To accompany our drinks, canapés and croque-monsieurs were served with the hotels compliments. A little something to get the palate invigorated for the rest of the dining experience. We were presented with two menus, one from hotel 41, then another from the adjoining restaurant and cocktail bar, called BBAR. Bbar is themed after South Africa, and features a modern take on some of South Africa’s favourite dishes. We chose a lamb “bunny chow”, which was something of a revelation for me. And a hotel41 signature burger. My partner asked one of the managers, Dean, if we could have the burger sliced in half, so that we could share it. When it arrived, it was cleanly sliced, and each halve presented on their own plates, dressed with crispy French fries and a punchy garlic Mayonnaise. The burger featured truffle and bone marrow and was  one of the best burgers I’ve had in a while. 

The “Bunny Chow” is a traditional cape Malay dish. A luscious and warming lamb curry with generous chunks of melt in the mouth lamb pieces in a rich curry gravy. Accompanied with an array of pickles and chutneys and a cooling herbed yoghurt to cool down from the spices. 

The wine list is very well curated. We opted for a deliciously smooth bottle of CUVEE PRESIDENTE MARGUERITE, CAVE DE FLEURIE 2017/2018, a medium bodied of the Beaujolais. 

Finally we finished dinner by sharing a slice of the owners’ own recipe cheese cake. 

We continued the evening chatting while enjoying the rest of our wine.

Before heading to bed, Dean came by and explained their “Plunder the pantry”. Pre-Covid, the team would lay out a veritable spread of delicious sweet and savoury treats, that guests can help themselves to throughout the night. Since Covid regulations are in place, the menu sits on the counter and guests can select their choices to enjoy either in the lounge or in bed. As we shared the dessert earlier, I thought I’d give the cheese board a go. Moments later, it was swiftly delivered to our room. 

The beds are incredibly comfortable. Best sleep ever! In the morning, we were looked after by the lovely Erica, who took great care of us. Nothing was too much trouble and her warm nature was like being looked after by a friend. The executive chef, Ben Keliher came by our table, and we got talking about the eggs. Yolks so rich and vibrantly orange, we had to ask where he got them. Which he very kindly revealed. 

After breakfast, we packed up our suitcases, and went to check out. As we finished the check out formalities, we were offered a 41hotel branded face mask, and a small bottle of water for our onward journey. 

Those thoughtful touches are really what matters. This hotel shines brightly, and it is no wonder it is ranked amongst the best in the world. While the interiors are elegant and striking, it is the staff that make the experience complete and incomparable. 

Delivering great service is a skill. Delivering genuine warmth and personality, through a face mask, is an art form! 

And they exceeded my expectations. We will return!",5,2020,11,01
137,Amazing service ,"I recently stayed here with my girlfriend for her 21st and couldn’t have picked a better hotel.The service was amazing with all staff members wishing her a happy birthday and receiving birthday cake on arrival.
The Rooms are beautifully decorated and the location is ideal and within walking distance of many desirable locations.
Will most definitely be revisiting.",5,2020,10,31
137,"Without a doubt, the best hotel experience!","From opening the door to saying farewell this hotel is simply exceptional. The staff, the quality of the rooms and service, the attention to detail and personalised touches made this a very special place indeed. After struggling to find a safe place to dine, we decided to go back to the hotel & had a great meal in the and a relaxed, (Covid safe), environment. I would highly recommend this as a place to stay and we will be back! Thank you Hotel 41 Team! ",5,2020,10,30
137,Fantastic- highly recommend,"Just returned from a lovely two night stay at Hotel 41.
Great location, wonderful customer service and attention to detail.
The hotel has made a lot of effort to comply with government guidance and adhere to the regulations.
We were staying to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday and were not disappointed.
Champagne on arrival at check in is a lovely touch and snacks are unlimited in the lounge.
Breakfast was delightful and started the day well.
Thank you to all the staff for their attentiveness and attention to detail.
Highly recommend and will return.",5,2020,10,30
137,"good hotel , good food and very professional staff","good hotel , good food , the staff 5 ***** professional. 
the price for the rooms excellent value

i would recommend this hotel 
special mention to the cocktail bar and the Barman’s they are very good professionals.",5,2020,10,30
137,Outstanding service and hotel,"From point of booking through to departure,  our stay was outstanding. A welcome drink on arrival and the offer of snacks. Comfy rooms with extra touches, hot water bottle to warm the bed, chocolates, slippers and water. Cosy and peaceful nights sleep. So quiet! Breakfast was amazing with impeccable service from Andrew. The free judes ice cream, Lindor chocolate and sweet bags were very well received by my 10 year old daughter. Best hotel I've stayed in!",5,2020,10,29
137,Perfect!,"Can only agree with others - this is an amazing hotel, the staff are all lovely, location is ideal, can't think of anything else to say! Will definitely be back as soon as we can and so glad we found Hotel 41",5,2020,10,29
137,Unbelievably Brilliant ,"I really can not describe how wonderful this hotel is. From the minute we were greeted by the regally clad doorman, to our final delicious breakfast we were treated like royalty. Free Champagne upon check in, treats galore in the room, free snacks all day long, supper served on a tray to the room (all complementary!!) The room itself (executive King - was spacious, elegant and soooooo comfortable) The decor in the executive room is elegant, resplendent of Downton Abbey. The breakfasts are truly the best I’ve ever had with friendly, gracious waiting staff - a particular thanks to Dean, nothing was too much trouble. We spent three magnificent nights here and left, although a little downhearted, rested, energised and totally relaxed.....  I suggest anyone looking for 5 star luxury of the highest order, look no further than Hotel 41. ",5,2020,10,28
137,Don’t make us go home...,"Well it’s all been said a million times before but we may as well echo what many others have said before us... the service here is what sets it apart from other hotels. It’s warm, personable and charming from the moment you arrive and until you sadly leave. 
A special mention to Andrew who took such good care of us and to David who treated my little girl like a rockstar for the evening - she had the time of her life making her mocktail! 
This was a splurge for us and I was nervous about paying a large amount money for a 1 night stay in a hotel - but now, on the train home, I can honestly say I’m perfectly content with a the ding in my bank balance. 
Nothing was too much trouble - we arrived super early and were given champagne (a lemonade for my little girl) and with in a few minutes the room was ready! We forgot our hairbrush and within 5 minutes someone had been out to boots a comb appeared for us! 
My only note would be that the only gluten free plunder the pantry offering (apart from the snack trolley) for my daughter was cheese and gluten free crackers after being told earlier that she would have her own gluten free food set aside when she wanted it so she was a little disappointed - she enjoyed them but perhaps more than one offering next time would be nice?
Breakfast was lovely, however, whilst in the lounge, once we had our food Maddie started to feel unwell quite quickly - we went back to the room and a few minutes later our breakfast arrived on a beautiful tray to enjoy in bed - as if things couldn’t get any better. 
We will be back in February for my birthday and I think it will have to be more than 1 night next time - see you all then! 
",5,2020,10,27
137,Treated like royalty,"Was originally booked into Rubens, but due to the pandemic, we were upgraded to Hotel 41. From the minute we walked in, our suitcase and coats were taken to our room, and check in in the lounge was so leisurely. Champagne & canapes on arrival, and then shown to our room. So luxurious and comfortable, the bed and bedding made us feel like staying in bed all day. Turn down service at night , and the fire was lit. Excellent breakfast in the lounge, where we also ate dinner as we did not feel like venturing too far. Although my partner's birthday was in July, this was a treat for her as I mentioned in my e mail to the hotel, and she had a birthday cake and chocolates in the room. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Would definitely recommend and stay again if possible.",5,2020,10,26
137,Bijoux and Gorgeous,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for a family birthday (89 years old!). From booking all the way to departure, the service was excellent.
On arrival we were given Champagne and canapes to aid check in. And a wonderful birthday cake for our guest of honour.
Our rooms were lovely, spacious, elegant bathroom products, a small box of chocolates (didn't last long!).
COVID precautions were taken seriously so breakfast was served to table but the choice was excellent. 
Would highly recommend (and save room to plunder the pantry at the end of the evening! Cheese and Port is a must!).",5,2020,10,25
137,Been said before and worth saying again,"This was my first time away since lockdown so I was slightly nervous. I wanted some time to chill and relax and there could be no better place than hotel 41. I'd researched it well and felt it took covid seriously. I did feel very safe.

The staff here are lovely and it is true they all remember your name even those who have not met you before. Every single member of staff was delightful and helpful  although Andrew did particularly stand out. I have stayed in a few 5 star hotels and although the hotels were special this really was the first hotel where I was made to feel special all the time. 

Nothing seemed rushed. It was the perfect  place when travelling alone with the wonderful lounge space and its abundance of free goodies. The time I stayed it was very wet so lovely to have a fire in the room making it equally a nice place to spend time. 

The turn down service was great and the hot water bottle is a real treat. Although was a little disappointed my treat was a single hard boiled sweet.

I loved it so much I booked again whilst there for a pre Christmas visit. Just hope covid does not stop it happening.",5,2020,10,24
137,"Excellent hotel! Will certainly
Come back again!","We recent stayed at 41 for our anniversary, the hotel and staff are amazing! The rooms are excellent and lovely. We enjoyed our stay so much we added an extra night. We will be back very soon and recommend it to all. We also did the picnic in the park, which is a lovely treat for couples, highly recommend as part of your stay. Certainly the best hotel in London, and worth every penny. We can't wait to come back and stay again.",5,2020,10,23
137,Impeccable Service & Hospitality ,"
We stayed for one night for my husbands birthday celebrations.  Check in with the added bonus of complimentary champagne!  The gorgeous decor, friendly and knowledgeable staff and all the little touches.  The executive lounge was a welcome refuge after a day out in London with coffee and homemade biscuits.  The level of service is second to none.  This will be a our new base when staying in London - absolutely loved our stay and will be back next month if Boris allows ",5,2020,10,22
137,If only all hotels...,"If only all hotels were like this. Ideal location, excellent accommodation, friendly, cheerful, efficient and knowledgable staff. First class catering and excellent guest 'perks'. More like a comfortable and welcoming club. No hesitation in recommending 41 to anyone looking for somewhere well above the normal 'luxury' hotel.",5,2020,10,20
137,5* and more...,"We chose to stay in London for the weekend as COVID meant we had to cancel our wedding and decided to make it a luxury experience. Hotel 41 is a very warm welcoming hotel in which the staff make the stay very personalised. Nothing was ever too much for any of the staff. My partner loved the evening turn down where they light the fire and add a hot water bottle in the bed ready for when you want to turn in. Breakfast is outstanding and the arrival experience was great. The hotel stuck to all the COVID rules and even catered the complimentary extras to our room as we were unable to stay in the lounge after 10pm. There was hand sanitizer around the hotel and the staff were always cleaning where other had sat and eaten as soon as they left the room. The rooms are cozy, bathrooms are spacious and all the staff are exceptional with a big warm thanks to Andrew,David,Erica and Paula for making our stay so special, we will be back again for another amazing stay! Mr J and miss V",5,2020,10,19
137,Amazing!!,"We arrived at hotel 41 and from the second we arrived the service level and attention to detail was outstanding! Once we arrived we were treated to champagne and snacks. We were staying for my partners birthday and there was a birthday cake along with other little touches in the room which made it feel that little bit more special. The decor was stunning & we came back from dinner to the fireplace on in the room. I’d forgotten my hair brush and they went and bought one for me and delivered it to my room!! Amazing customer service, the little touches and extras make this hotel a hidden gem! We will definitely be booking again soon! Thank you for having us!! ",5,2020,10,18
137,Simply the best...,"If you want the best hotel, the best staff, the best service, the best food, then look no further. This hotel is the best. We've stayed in many 5 star hotels but after staying at Hotel 41, I'd say this is in fact a 5 star hotel and the others need to pull their socks up. If relaxed and friendly yet an exacting attention to detail is what you want then book here. We can't wait to return again and again.",5,2020,10,14
137,Lovely birthday treat,"An absolutely amazing hotel that puts other 5* hotels in their place.

From the “happy birthday” plate with a scrumptious cake in the suite, the tasteful decor throughout, the wonderfully polite, friendly and helpful staff, to the fantastic breakfast.....outstanding.  

Nothing seems to be too much trouble for them and we really couldn’t recommend this hotel enough.  

Thank you Lauren Hargrave and Andrew Muir and everyone who made our stay so memorable.  ",5,2020,10,12
137,Perfect refuge during difficult times,"My Wife and I have always agreed that the best hotel, in terms of service, that we have stayed at is the Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok. An opinion has not changed since we first stayed there +30 years ago.  That is until we stayed at Hotel 41. The service here is superb, from the warm greeting from all the staff on arrival and whenever you see them around the hotel,  to the fact that nobody asks for any details when you order anything but the bill is correct when you leave. No idea how they do this. The hotel itself is very cosy and has the atmosphere and decor of an exclusive London club. The Covid precautions are appropriate and reassuring and don't detract from the experience. Finally now is the time to visit London, very few people around, you can see all the sites without the crowds, and get tables at sensible times in all the best restaurants. We had a wonderful few days at this hotel.",5,2020,10,12
137,Slightly disappointed,"We were here for our 1st wedding anniversary and upon recommendation from our parents, so as you can imagine our expectations were high. We took advantage of the valet parking for £50 which although pricey saves a lot of time and hassle. One thing I would have liked, is that when we messaged the hotel to say we would like valet parking, they could have made us aware of the congestion charge now being applicable to weekends (this came into effect June 2020 apparently- how would a non-Londoner know this?) however upon checking-in, we were offered complimentary champagne and sat in front of the lovely fireplace and offered the complimentary snacks (Lindt chocs, nuts, Judes ice cream) whilst our bags were taken to our our room. 

I was asked on several occasions (prior to arriving and a couple of times during check-in) whether I had any dietary requirements. I am a vegetarian (more of that later.) We were kindly upgraded to one of the 2-floor suites which was wonderful and we were so excited to have our own fireplace and staircase. We also had some chocolates and a Happy Anniversary cake. 

The room itself was lovely- nice big bed, office area downstairs alongside the fireplace, lovely big bathroom with bath (with tv!) and shower and posh toiletries. 

We decided to take advantage of the free food on offer. 2-5 is fresh scones (careful- tea and coffee are extra) then 5-7 is canapés which we enjoyed. Bearing in mind I had been asked several times regarding dietary requirements, and the fact that the hotel is small, I expected them to remember that I was a vegetarian but nope they did not. So I had to remind them. 

We then headed out next door to B-Bar as the other bars and restaurants in the hotel were sadly closed due to Covid. We stumbled back to the hotel at 930pm in time for Covid curfew for Plunder the Pantry (I emailed ahead to check whether the 10pm curfew was Applicable to hotel guests and was informed no it was not - which was not true) basically free snacks on offer. We had the cheeseboard with bread and nuts and some desserts. All were lovely! Then we went to bed for a well earned sleep. The room had been adorned with candles, rose petals and even a hotel water bottle for bed which was a lovely touch. 

Upon walking the next morning, we went down to breakfast which is served until 1pm - incredible! Again, going back to the fact that this is a 5 star establishment and they had asked me umpteen times regarding dietary requirements, they forgot I was a vegetarian. Breakfast then turned into nothing short of a disaster. We were not seen to after we were seated, I had to flag someone down to take our order! Then our tea/coffee took 10 minutes to arrive. I ordered the vegetarian breakfast and my husband the English breakfast. Mine arrived.... with black pudding!! (See photo) I asked the waiter what the black item was and after checking he came back mortified and whisked my plate away. Bearing in mind we had waited 25 mins for our food, a further wait was not ideal aside from the fact I had been served blood on my vegetarian breakfast!!! Not acceptable, what on earth was the chef thinking??? Whilst we waited for our food, our empty cups and glasses were not removed, no-one asked if we wanted re-fills, I asked for ketchup and it was forgotten, it felt like we were forgotten about! When my breakfast #2 eventually arrived it was cold and I had lost my appetite. The waiter did apologise profusely, offered me free champagne and to remove the cost of breakfast which although appreciated was too little too late. As we left to return to our room, reception did follow us and apologise once more and offer us a free late checkout, which again was a lovely gesture. It is just a shame these errors happened. 

Regardless, we enjoyed the room facilities for an extra hour or so then checked-out. We asked valet to retrieve our car, they did so... and it was the wrong car!! So we had to wait another 20 minutes. They did give us a couple of complimentary waters and some sweets to say sorry though but again, should this be happening in a hotel of this standard??

To sum up: the hotel is lovely. Was it the best we have ever stayed in? No. The service also wasn’t the best but perhaps we were unlucky, perhaps our standards were too high, perhaps it was due to Covid? Who knows. 

Would we stay again? Unfortunately not. But we did appreciate the effort made to rectify our bad experiences. ",3,2020,10,11
137,Brilliant place,"The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, we were treated with a glass of champagne on arrival, there were loads of complimentary perks, the food was amazing, the location is great for visiting the main attractions of London.",5,2020,10,11
137,Superb Hotel,"What a hidden gem! Fantastic facilities and rooms and the best customer service I have experienced in all my years of travel. We loved the ambience of the lounge and all the complimentary goodies, a shame we didn't try all the ice cream flavours, next time!
Thank you for making our birthday stay truly memorable.",5,2020,10,11
137,Birthday Treat,This was the most amazing stay!! The staff were delightful and so lovely and could not have done more for us! ! We did not want to leave at all and was sad to go. We will definitely be back!! Thank you so much for having us!!!,5,2020,10,09
137,Sometimes its the little things...,"This hotel is superb for so many reasons but there are 2 main standouts: the outstanding service from each and every member of staff and the ""little touches"" that just set this a cut above. It starts with a glass of champagne and delicious little snacks on arrival and the five star treatment doesn't let up. From a candle being lit in your bathroom in the evening, and finding a hot water bottle has been put in your bed whilst you are at dinner.... through to a complimentary power juice shot in the mornings and Wedgewood china for in room hot beverages. I love how everything is 41 monogrammed - right down to the froth on your cappuccino. The staff were attentive, professional, polite and great fun too. Am already looking for an excuse to go back....",5,2020,10,09
137,Impeccable service and  generous hospitality,"I stayed in Hotel 41 for business purposes with fellow colleagues for two nights.

The hotel group boasts that they are renowned for impeccable service and generous hospitality and I honestly couldn't describe it any other way. So I decided to second that in my review title and description.

We work for a translation company and we are all globe trotters so we are used to travelling A LOT, and going on many executive meetings around the world. I speak for all my colleagues when I say that we have all never had an experience like we had at Hotel 41! It is one to remember and a 5 star review is the least we could do!

What is very impressive, is how every member of staff across the hotel, restaurants and bars are all trained to the same level of impeccable service. It's so consistent, everybody was 10 out of 10. The staff are formal, polite but at the same time extremely friendly and welcoming. They think about the finishing touches and going the extra mile at every step. 

It's highly recommended and I will not only return but will use their customer service  as inspiration for our business.",5,2020,10,09
137,Birthday Stay,"Stayed for one night at Hotel 41 for my Birthday.  We were upgraded to a Junior Suite and welcomed with Champagne on arrival.  The service was immaculate and the staff were excellent and friendly, making my birthday very special.",5,2020,10,09
137,Mini moon stay,My husband and I got married Last weekend and spent our mini moon in this amazing hotel. The staff were helpful and kind and the hotel beautiful. We could not fault anything and felt like royalty staying here. I could not recommend more. If you want to stay somewhere stunning with top notch service and in a fantastic location then this is the place. Thank you hotel 41 for making our weekend unforgettable.,5,2020,10,01
137,5***** service and beyond!,"Stayed 4 lovely nights at Hotel 41 in an exec twin room.  From the moment we arrived, and were welcomed with champagne and snacks, to the time we left I felt nothing was too much trouble for the staff.  Want your breakfast teapot and cup warmed?  You only have to mention it once and it's all done like magic every morning thereafter.  And not once did we have to give our room number when ordering drinks.  They just know! 

It's not pretentious, it's not stuffy - it feels very welcoming whoever you are.

Would love to return - trying to persuade him indoors that Xmas would be fab!!",5,2020,09,30
137,Wonderful luxury in the middle of a fairly miserable 2020,"As soon as travel restrictions were lifted we knew this was where we wanted to be, our favourite city centre hotel. Things have obviously changed a bit - you need to wear masks in the hall, the ""plunder the pantry"" buffet is now table service - but it is still a little oasis in the midst of the busy city, even more so now with the fantastic new rooftop terrace.

Immaculate service as always - I have no idea how they always know our names and rooms but there was no need to show a credit card or key for our entire stay - we asked for whatever we wanted, it was promptly delivered and seamlessly turned up on the bill when we left. 

We had such a perfect weekend we came back a few weeks later for another weekend.",5,2020,09,30
137,I cannot tell you enough how much I LOVE this hotel!,"If you’re looking for a great location, wonderful service and a beautiful hotel, stay here. Honestly I am blown away with how amazing the staff is here. I will definitely be coming back. The rooms are so comfortable and the lounge is stunning. We absolutely love it here.",5,2020,09,26
137,Service beyond the imagination,"Stayed as a 60th birthday gift. Didn’t know what to expect but service started before we went in the building, greeted by wonderful gentleman who Knew our name and got our bag and car parked. To a lady who took us to the lift. Up to 5th floor to be greeted by name and sat and served champagne and nibbles while they checked us in and told us the process of getting food and drink and breakfast in the morning. They took us to our room and said they upgraded us to a suite. I was overwhelmed,. A mini cake, chocolates and massive room. I was choked up. Every time we went to the lounge I felt like a princess. The service was the same for everyone. The staff here work tirelessly, we saw a number of people enter the lounge at once. They worked fast to ensure we were well looked after and everyone served promptly. I truly have never witnessed this type of service. Utterly fabulous. The breakfast by far was the best I had in ages. Their Covid policy made you feel safe at all times. The Whole experience is one to be witnessed to be believed. Just the best in London. Well done hotel 41 we will be back with our family. Thank you So much, really appreciated.",5,2020,09,26
137,Special birthday treat,"An amazing experience from start to finish. Lots of helpful communication from the hotel in advance about how they are addressing the Covid situation and regulations. Exceptionally attentive staff who immediately recognised that I am deaf and need to lipread so they discretely lowered their masks when they needed to speak to me - all very respectful and fuss-free which meant a lot. 

We had an upgrade to one of their two suites which was an extra special treat. No view from the room but we weren’t their to look out of a hotel window so it really didn’t matter. 

We loved the boutique, small and quirky style of the hotel. It was immaculately and stylishly furnished and decorated throughout. 

It truly lived up to its reputation as the best place to stay in London. We can’t recommend it highly enough. ",5,2020,09,26
137,"100% reccomend Hotel 41, 5*","Our stay at Hotel 41 was perfect. From the complimentary champagne on arrival to be made to feel very comfortable and welcomed. The complimentary snacks was a lovely touch, the staff were very helpful and polite. We stayed in the the executive King suite, was amazing. Great size room, extremely clean and tidy, in particular we loved the bathroom! We would definitely recommend and stay again!",5,2020,09,26
137,Wedding night,"One of the best hotels we have stayed in.
First class service.
Fantastic location.
Amazing rooms and design.
We stayed here for our wedding night as we wanted to stay somewhere special close to Victoria. Hotel 41 exceeded expectations. Late check-in, glasses of champagne on arrival. We were upgraded to the Conservatory Suite, which is incredible. It was a fleeting visit as we had a flight to catch the next morning - we only wish we could have stayed longer. 
Highly recommend.",5,2020,09,24
137,"So good I added two extra nights to my stay, however","Currently staying at Hotel41. I'm spending about £1000 in total here. I'm a solo female traveller and it feels like nothing is too much trouble, the staff are amazing and really friendly. I booked in for a weekend of relaxation because of a stressful home situation.

However I've just had a call to my room regarding hair dye on towels.

My hair is bright red and has been since I was 19, getting on for 10 years. Its notorious for washing out quickly, and when I wash my hair it shows in the water. If towels are white, it shows on them in  pale pink. 

In all the time I've had red hair, I've stayed in probably 100 hotels, all 4* up. I've never, ever had anyone call my room about my hair. 

Not once, in almost a decade. Generally these hotels all use white towels. My hair dye isn't permanent colour and washes off linens. Its never phased anyone and considering its just a towel I can't imagine they're that concerned if there is or isn't stains on it. There is shrinkage in these businesses. But then no one has contacted me at a later time to tell me I am being charged for stained linens, so either the hotels don't care or its washed out. 

The guy on the phone called to tell me that housekeeping had tried to wash it off several times and couldn't get it off. I found it bizarre this was even worth calling me for. I said I've never had anyone mention it to me wherever I've stayed. I asked if he wanted me to pay for them, he said no but housekeeping asked I be more careful. 

Be more careful using towels after washing my hair. I'm so so confused. I've never ever had this problem. I feel like I've been treated different to other guests as I absolutely cannot imagine the same call being made to an older upper-class couple. It was very condescending. 

Its actually left me feeling really upset. I feel like I've been told off and its really belittling. I don't get why something so trivial would be brought up at all. I stayed at the St James Hotel and Club last month and they didn't mention it. Still trying to wrap my head around this situation really. 

I have 2 nights left and I'm genuinely considering not bothering. This is a 5* hotel and number one rated in London. People here have offered to carry my shopping, have been attentive and added lovely little details to my room like a foot spa. But apparently a towel is where they draw the line.",2,2020,09,21
137,Are you kidding?? Wow!!,"I want to preface this review by saying that I am not a fancy person, nor do I know how to act in fancy ways. Haha. I've worked in restaurants and get a little uncomfortable when I'm on the other side of the table in a nice place, but let me tell you, right from the get go, you are floored by the service!! Ahhhhhhhh! 

My partner had booked us in, and he spoke to Maria through email about a few things to customise our stay. She was polite and kind. Even with last minute requests.

When we arrived, Maria greeted us and we were guided to floor 5 where we went straight to the executive lounge. I believe it was Marlen that greeted us and Adele who was working at the desk. Mohan tended to our table and we were greeted with rose champagne and little snacks. We decided to stay for another cocktail before getting to our room. 

I need to note that the hotel pumps their perfume through their vents but it's at the perfect level and you kind of just want to bathe in it. 

We had booked a king exec room and that was luxurious enough for us. But as we spoke to Mohan and also Andrew about why were celebrating in style, we noticed that they seemed to be setting up something. We didnt know it was for us, though. Very professional.

We got taken to our room. Turns out they decided to kick it up a notch and give us a junior exec suite. WHO NEEDS A SUITE?! Apparently we did. We didn't know what to say but thank you. Haha. Then we got upstairs to the bathroom, and there was a sweet message written on the mirror regarding why we were celebrating. I think they said Adele was responsible for that... thank you so much. 

We had to quickly get ready for our night out but when we came back, our room was done up again. We were only in the room for 2 hours (we did throw our clothes everywhere though haha) but really lovely to come back to a tidy surprise. Also, they left a little moisturising treat for eyes and lips! They also left it on my side of the bed which was like, a little creepy but so cool how they knew. I'm sure my side looked more ""girly"" but after so many cocktails, I prefer to think that they're geniuses.

We ordered off the complimentary menu bc it was midnight so we didnt know how it worked. So I went into the lounge and Dragosh (sorry about the spelling), took my order and took it to our room. The food was amazing. We had a seafood jar, noodle jar, and a cheeseboard. Great job, Kitchen! 

The next day, we made some espresso in our room. I just need to paint this picture for you. I put my really nice bathrobe on, put on the comfiest slippers, I made my way downstairs and realised that there was no water in the nespresso tank. Because at this point, I had gotten used to the fancy life, I couldn't be asked to go upstairs to fill it up. I took a bottle of still water, and filled the tank up and made my espresso. Never in my life will I do that again, but in that moment, it felt like the right thing to do. Haha.

We had a slow morning and had plans to see a friend then come back for dinner in bed. My partner had ordered a lavender bubble bath for me because I love baths. It was set for 8pm. We were having such a good time out, we had to move the bath, last minute, to 9:30pm. I felt so bad but when we got there, the water was nice and hot, and there were brownies. My bath... came with brownies. It was perfect and I had to take the lavender bar of soap with me bc it smelt amazing. 

We ordered food and wine. Pasta, fish and chips, cute little miniature sauce pots. And some mini starters. We didnt know how to act when our food arrived. Two lovely waiters came in with masks and gloves set everything down for us. We did notice some champagne glasses but we didnt order champagne. And a few minutes later, we heard a knock and one of our friends had ordered us a bottle of LPR to the room just as we left him earlier that evening. So lovely!!

We ate and watched sister act 1 and 2. And really loved our evening. 

The next morning, I had to order an eggs benny and a coffee, again, perfection.

We then had to check out, sad to leave the perfumed walls of luxury. I need to say, as someone that is not used to this life, you get used to it very quickly haha. There's a lot of sadness in the world but if you are in a good enough space to spend a bit more on a hotel experience, go to Hotel 41. I don't think I'll ever see hotel service the same again. They do everything with so much care and attention to detail. They listen to you when you're speaking to make sure that your stay is catered to you. The covid safety measures are great. And the fanciness is not over the top. We both felt well taken care of and the warmth from the staff left us wondering if we should have booked for an extra night haha.

I could go on, but I need to get on with my day. Thank you so much, Hotel 41. It was an absolutely incredible time with you.",5,2020,09,17
137,Birthday weekend away. ,"Hotel 41 has been by far the best hotel I have stayed at in the UK, and beyond. The service was impeccable. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, the personal touches could not be faulted. From the moment we arrived the staff were welcoming, and made us feel as though we were the most important people around. The food was great, cocktails were amazing, the architecture was incredible, all the little extras were of the highest quality. Andrew took care of us and went above and beyond what I'd expect. The rest of the staff were just as amazing and made our stay the most memorable and it was a pleasure to stay here. We will certainly be returning and cannot wait to stay at this venue again. ",5,2020,09,16
137,The Highlight of our Year,"To celebrate our Diamond Wedding Anniversary and my Wife's 80th Birthday we originally booked to stay at The Rubens at the Palace in April but Covid spoiled all that. 
We subsequently rebooked for early September but were informed prior to our visit that we had been upgraded to a sister hotel, namely Hotel 41, which just happens to occupy the entire 5th. floor of The Rubens building with it's own entrance and direct access lift. This resulted in our experiencing a 3 night break in a fabulous location. To add further to our pleasure on arrival we found that we had been further uprated to an Executive King room. Bliss !!
From the time we arrived to our departure we were in receipt of the highest service levels from an exemplary Staff who really got to know us personally, we were never even asked for our Room No. during our stay. It would be churlish to select any member for particular mention, everyone to the same high standard.
The whole experience was unexpected and truly memorable, the complimentary extras Afternoon Scones, Evening Canapes and the very original 'Plunder the Pantry' putting the icing on the cake.
An unexpected experience but one we would thoroughly recommend to anyone wanting a Luxury stay in London.",5,2020,09,15
137,A hidden jewel,"We unexpectedly stayed here on route home for one night and cannot recommend this hidden jewel highly enough. We had been upgraded from their sister hotel and we had been slightly concerned that a hotel with such high credentials would feel uncomfortable and potentially pretentious but this was absolutely not the case. The serrvice, rooms and foid were a treat although we couldn't do the 24hour grazing pantry justice. We will definitely return...for a treat.",5,2020,09,15
137,Wow! What a stay,"We booked a stay here for our Wedding Anniversary.  Well i read the reviews, before making a choice of where we would stay. We come to London very often and have stayed in many hotels over the last 20 years. I have to say that our stay here was very different and very refreshing.  Great location and to say the service is fantastic is an understatement. Genuinely friendly service, from all staff. The hotel is very comfortable and has thought of it all.  We only stayed one night which was far too short, but we will definitely stay again. Andrew was a member of staff that really added a special touch to our stay, friendly and helpful where nothing was too much trouble.  What a fantastic hotel!",5,2020,09,13
137,Amazing stay at Hotel 41,"Stayed here for anniversary weekend and had such a relaxing enjoyable stay. The staff are attentive but not in your face, they are very polite and always know what you want before you do! I would absolutely recommend this hotel, great location, will definitely return. For a completely flawless stay in London this has to be the place to stay, the reason they are the No.1 of Trip Advisor is very easy to see. Thank you Hotel 41 for an amazing weekend!",5,2020,09,13
137,Great Staff make the difference,"Great location for trip to London, the service is excellent from arrival to departure we could not fault the service, the attitude of the staff and atmosphere of the hotel.

The break was very relaxing, with drinks on roof top bar, snacks in the lounge, every detail has been though through and execute to extremely high standard - we will be back and would highly recommend",5,2020,09,13
137,Simon Harrap,"Hotel 41 lived up to its review status. From the moment you arrive at the door the service is 100% and more. On arrival they welcomed us with our names and were shown to the executive suite for welcome drinks and to register. Our room was ready but we were welcomed with champagne and food. This is how the whole experience carried on until we left. It was just one magical friendly hotel and felt like we were the only people that mattered. Nothing was ever wrong and nothing was a hassle for the colleagues or for us In the hotel. 
This is clearly the best hotel our family have stayed in over many hotels in this country or abroad we have stayed in. 
Thank you for an amazing experience ",5,2020,09,11
137,Exceeding expectations,Stayed for 3 nights in conservatory suite.This is a beautiful large room on two levels a haven in the centre of London. This is a great hotel for a luxury break with so many complimentary treats a quiet main bar/dining area but top of the list has to be the staff who cannot do enough to make the stay whatever you request is made possible & they are simply the best you could find anywhere. We will return soon to our home from home,5,2020,09,11
137,A superb few nights,"My partner and I stayed for 2 nights and were made to feel very welcome. A complimentary glass of champagne whilst you are checking in and a variety of nibbles were a lovely touch. The staff are great, very attentive but not gushing. The room was comfortable and had lots of nice touches that were appreciated. We have both stayed in lots of hotels in London and would rank this in our top 5.",5,2020,09,07
137,Very Nice,"We visited Hotel 41 for 3 nights. We originally should have stayed at Rubens next door but sadly that closed temporarily ( however it does look lovely and we would still like to stay there eventually) we were allocated The Balmoral suite which was amazing, beautifully decorated and very comfortable beds and pillows. The turn down service was an added bonus. All members of staff were helpful and friendly. The Plunder pantry was a nice touch, I imagine pre COVID as a buffet it was spectacular. We used the roof top terrace one afternoon and it is a lovely sun trap, nice to relax with a glass of wine. Upon arrival everyone is offered complimentary champagne, a lovely welcome. Champagne was continued to be offered which we accepted, maybe a polite word informing us that these further drinks were being added to our room account would have been helpful, no one’s particular error but just to make others aware further drinks offered are not complimentary.  Near to Buckingham Palace and a walk through Green Park makes Hotel 41 a very convenient location. Would love to re-visit again, I’m sure Christmas time at 41 would be fabulous .",4,2020,09,07
137,6 star staff,"6 star staff customer service is excellent here we arrived to Landon champagne doors opened and closed for us our room set up with just what we asked for inside it the bedding and best best beds in London luxury linen and carpets and drapes, their was a few cleaning issues which I only wrote on a questionnaire because they were so good shower door dirty at the bottom and on one of the draws other than that they make u feel more than at home , after returning to the hotel after a day in London we went to the executive lounge to have toastier and canapés which is brilliant though I thought as it was an executive lounge you’d get lattes into the price but no do be careful as we ran a bar bill which we should of asked about as I assumed wrongly the lounge is lit with candle light and sweet smells and exceptional service. We then went to bed to a hotel turn down with Elemis treats on the beds fabulous slippers a candle in the bathroom which was all a amazing touch.
Morning comes we had a fab breakfast a newspaper and went to enjoy what we had left of the morning before returning home check was 12 then we went to check out the try and help so much with baggage which makes u feel like a princess we were alarmed at the bar bill as it wasn’t shown properly of what we’d had once it was explained in a detailed invoice we saw that the pumps we had the night before were 20 pound each which on one side it was my fault I didn’t ask how much they was but they could have a bar menu on the table to show how much they are so it’s not a shock but even with it all added to the room rate it still was worth every penny and we can’t wait to return thankyou",5,2020,09,07
137,Fantastic place and staff,Can’t praise our stay with Hotel 41 highly enough.  This was like no other hotel stay. It was such a great experience and we felt so well looked after by the friendly staff with such thoughtful little details added in too. There were 5 of us in our group staying in 3 rooms and we all loved it!!,5,2020,09,07
137,Amazing Hotel,"I had booked to stay at the Rubens hotel but we were upgraded to Hotel 41. We stayed for 2 nights as had a day trip booked on the British Pullman. 
This is an absolute gem of a hotel and we could not a fault anything. The staff were extremely friendly and could not do enough for you. 
We were travelling with friends and I would personally like to thank them for upgrading them on their second night to the Conservatory Suite as a special treat due to personal reasons that I had informed them of before we had arrived. This made our stay even more special and we shall cherish these memories forever.
",5,2020,09,06
137,The most fabulous hotel.,"We can honestly say that this was a faultless stay. The hotel was perfectly situated, the building and facilities were immaculate, the breakfast was of the highest standard. But what made our stay so good, was the attentiveness of the staff. All the staff took the trouble to learn our names, chat to us about our stay, understand why we came to London and then went out of their way to help in any way possible. It’s only a little think, but that extra effort made it feel like a very special stay. 

We believe this hotel sets a benchmark in hospitality that we have not seen anywhere else.",5,2020,09,06
137,Excellent Hotel,"I have been visit London 6 times in different Hotels and this was the best one. Very friendly and professional staff. 
They have an eye for details. Everything was excellent and the hotel is a jewel in London. 
This was my best stay in the city. I will come back as soon as possible.",5,2020,09,05
137,Just as good the 2nd time,"We first stayed at Hotel 41 about 5 years ago and loved it. Wanting a brief staycation - we live in the East End of London - we booked 2 nights over the recent bank holiday weekend. This was our first time in a hotel in the COVID19 world and we were expecting it to feel pretty weird. The greatest credit to the team at Hotel 41 is it didn't feel weird at all. Apart from the requirement to wear facemasks in public areas, it felt normal. More than that though, it felt safe. It was clear precautions were being taken (for example, staff wore masks when they came close to you) and the lounge was set up for safer distancing.

And, onto the room. Just beautiful. Spotless. A really comfortable bed. Nice coffee and tea. Great bathroom. Penhaligons toiletries. And, as a same sex couple, the slipper bags were marked 'His' and 'His'. What's not to like when you've got that attention to detail?

Breakfast was delicious. Plenty of choice and high quality produce. The fruit salad (something too many hotels skimp on) was exceptional. The full English breakfast equally good.

However, no matter how good the room or the food, it's the service that makes a good hotel great and literally every single member of the Hotel 41 team that we met was a master of their art. Nothing was a trouble. Conversation was relaxed and not horribly deferential (which shows real confidence in the staff, they know they're good). And we got a guided tour of the new roof terrace when it wasn't officially open, which was kind. But it was also respectful of other guests, as we were told that this could only happen because they knew rooms that would have been impacted by us visiting the roof at that time were either empty or the guests concerned were at breakfast.

Finally, and again this shows exceptional service, we never signed a bill for anything we ate or drank, we were not even asked our room number, yet the final account was 100% correct. I don't know how they did this magic, but they did. They know their guests. How many hotels can say that?

I don't think we'll be leaving it another 5 years before we return.",5,2020,09,03
137,This hotel is a gem! ,"This hotel is an absolute gem! We arrived for a one night stay to celebrate our anniversary.  Upon arrival we knew we had found something very, very special.  The staff were so welcoming and our car was promptly valet parked without a hassle. 
One person who should receive a massive amount of credit is Andrew.   All the staff went over and above to make our stay special but Andrew really did go that extra mile.  His professionalism knows no bounds and we have never received service like this any any hotel we have stayed in around the world!
The rooms were stunning and extremely comfortable.  The bar area was so special as it was for guests only and every whim was catered for! A lovely snack menu, a sweet buffet and endless supply of ice cream.  What a treat! 
If you want to be made to feel extra special then this is definitely the place to stay.  Stunning hotel with impeccable service! ",5,2020,09,03
137,Simply wonderful ,"My husband and I were celebrating his birthday and our belated anniversary.
We couldn’t have ask for a better surprise as we were upgraded to an amazing suite. 
The staff here were just lovely and attentive and nothing was too much trouble.
we decided just to stayed at the hotel as it was just perfect to relax and do nothing.
I honestly think it’s was one of the best hotels we’ve had the pleasure to stay at and I’m sure that I would love to stay again for another very special occasion. ",5,2020,09,03
137,Great place to stay (with or without dogs),"This hotel cannot be faulted. 
We were greeted by all members of staff that we saw on our way in and treated to some lovely canapes and glass of bubbly whilst checking in.
We had a great room that accommodated myself, husband and our 2 labradors.
The dogs were left some treats, beds to use and bowls. 
Room very well appointed and seemed easy to request anything, if necessary..

Food was very enjoyable. A great choice at breakfast and the evening meal was lovely ( a good variety of dishes to choose from)
Would stay again.",5,2020,09,02
137,"Birthday staycation , amazing hotel","We had actually booked to stay at the Rubens hotel , we had 2 rooms to celebrate 2 50th birthdays. Unfortunately due to the impact of Covid the hotel was not open and so we were contacted in advance and switched to hotel 41. Having walked passed the Ruben many times when visiting London I had never even noticed hotel 41. What an amazing place to stay , the staff cannot do enough for you, they contact you in advance to take care of any request, and the complimentary champagne on arrival was a real treat. 

There are some things they needing to do differently due to Covid , which means all the treats in the pantry are pre bagged, but that's probably a good thing as otherwise you may have too many treats. 

The rooms were lovely , with special touches to make the stay even more comfortable. 

The smell around the corridors was so nice that one of us ending up buying the 41 room spray. 

Breakfast was Al la carte and service impeccable and the food delicious. 

It was such a shame we only had one night and would love to return, thank you to all the staff for making our stay so special",5,2020,09,01
137,A birthday staycation done right!,"What is extraordinary with this hotel, which has been echoed in many reviews, is the level of service. Soon as the booking was made, the hotel got in contact, fussing over every detail for my visit. And they delivered! (I stated my dietary preference and they managed to source halal chicken for my stay). Nothing was any trouble to the team! The room is spacious, perhaps one of the biggest ones in London and well equipped. The Executive Lounge, which also serves as the reception area, is gorgeous and cozy. There is also access to the rooftop, weather permitting. And whoever came up with the idea of 'Plunder the Pantry' should win an award or a few. A special shoutout to Emma, Maria, Andrew, and David who made me feel welcomed here. Repeat visits are necessary!",5,2020,09,01
137,A wedding anniversary stay at a wonderfully charming hotel,"From start to finish, the staff at Hotel 41 could not have made this occasion any more special and so very memorable. We were so well looked after by all the staff, and this establishment is a true gem in the heart of London. We were totally smitten with the decor and the finer details, particularly the Monarch suite we were upgraded to for our anniversary stay. We will definitely be coming back to stay again at this wonderful and charming hotel. Our anniversary meal at the Bbar restaurant next door to the hotel was delicious and we highly recommend it. A special thank you to Joanna, Maria and Sarah who went out of their way to ensure every request was taken care of at the highest standard - their communication in the week up to our stay was outstanding and very efficient.",5,2020,08,31
137,Special Anniversary at Hotel 41,"Some hotels have to  boast about their staff, faciities and service. Hotel 41 speaks volumes in its class, distinction and unreserved attention to detail. Us mere mortals on an anniversary stayover in London, could not believe our luck. We were shown consideration from the time we made the booking, care had been taken in keeping us informed of changes and  details; although the surprise to us was the luxurious upgrade and compliments  from the hotel and staff when we got there!

Hotel 41, is situtaed in a delighful part of London, we giggled in the tube station at the sign that said Buckingham Palace this way, as we headed home to it for the  evening so near to the hotel.
The hotel gives you all the comfort and luxury worthy of the jewel in the 5 star crown that it is. 
Other 5 star hotels are not as comfortable, welcoming or provide such a personalised stay. The comparison is Hotel 41 doesnt appear to provide a 5 star service, its more like long standing friendship with people who go out of their way to know you and welcome you.    
We would like to say a huge thank you to all the staff that were there this bank holiday weekend, we most definitely will see you again.",5,2020,08,31
137,41. It’s what a ‘5’ really looks like!,Hard to imagine how you could find a better hotel in London. Absolutely perfect in all respects. Every single member of staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome. We chose 41 because it was the top-rated hotel on Trip Adviser and it’s a well deserved title. Like other reviewers it’s beginning to sound like I’ve been paid to say this but I genuinely have not! Never reviewed a hotel in my life but I’m moved to do it this time. Thanks to everyone at 41 for making our weekend so memorable.,5,2020,08,30
137,Anniversary weekend ,"Has to be the best customer service hotel I have ever stayed at. Hands down the best experience we have ever had. The food was awesome, breakfast snacks and desserts. Whilst the food options are served rather than help yourself at the moment to ensure good social distancing. Bottomless ice cream was available but the rest of the food was so good I did not leave much space. The room we had was a split level junior suite which was very well equipped. The turn down option was well done with fresh flowers and slippers and sweets. Bottled water in the fridge and a Nespresso machine topped up on request. I had about 6 coffees a day . The bathroom was the same size as a double bedroom. Fantastic water pressure from the shower and the bath filled in about 2 minutes. 3 TVs 1 in the bathroom all with separate Sky boxes so you could watch 3 different channels in 3 separate rooms if required. Oh and the champagne on arrival helped to set the scene. The level of detail in the service was outstanding with all staff remembering your names throughout your stay at all points of the hotel. This is the gold standard hotel which every other hotel needs to match which will be exceptionally difficult. Thanks to Gabriel who looked after us during our stay and attended to all our food and beverage needs. ",5,2020,08,30
137,Amazing,"What a fabulous place to stay, easy to get to, fabulous staff, amazing food and everything else you would want for a stay in London. The staff go all out to make sure you have everything you would like, anytime and nothing is too much trouble. Would recommend this experience to everyone. Ive already booked the next visit. Thank you to everyone at the hotel who made our stay very very special.",5,2020,08,29
137,Excellent hotel,We have just spent a couple of nights at Hotel 41 for a birthday celebration. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Staff extremely helpful and attentive. We really enjoyed the atmosphere and location of the hotel. We would definitely recommend and hope to return: it’s an excellent hotel.,5,2020,08,29
137,Another great stay.,"Second time at Hotel 41. Again, first class all the way. Thank you to all the staff, from cocktails to turn down, we loved it all.

The Covid arrangements were fine for us. Didn’t spoil our stay at all.

We will be back.",5,2020,08,28
137,5* for a reason - amazing stay!,"I stayed here last weekend as a weekend break. From the moment I arrived and the lovely woman at the reception knew exactly who I was before I spoke, I knew I would be in for a treat. The service is absolutely incredible, every single person is made to feel welcome and special. 

I was taken in to wait in the Executive Lounge, which is an elegant room.  I was given the choice to have a complimentary glass of champagne or a soft drink. The executive lounge is also where the complimentary food is provided; this includes an array of snacks, a variety of different flavours of ice cream and a menu of food to order! The complimentary food is available from 8 pm - 1am (which is perfect for the midnight munchies!). 

My room was spotless and the bed was incredibly comfortable! COVID procedures were also implemented which made me feel more than comfortable. 

The warmth and friendliness of all the staff is second to none. Their attentiveness without being overbearing is spot on. The hotel had such a homely warm feel to it and it was the perfect break from everything that is happening in our world. I did not want to leave!

I would not hesitate to book another stay, it was worth every penny.

Thank you Hotel 41 for such an amazing experience and stay.",5,2020,08,27
137,Luxury Hotel,"Hotel 41 is a luxury hotel on the doorstep of Buckingham Palace. The staff are extremely attentive and do everything they can to make you welcome and ensure your stay is enjoyable. The rooms are very clean, comfortable and have all the luxurious finishing touches you would expect. Drinks are reasonably priced and treats offered during the day are delightful, the croque monsiuer is superb and the breakfast is the best I have ever had. I highly recommend Hotel 41 and can’t praise the staff that made our stay so enjoyable highly enough, a wonderful experience!",5,2020,08,27
137,Fantastic Hotel and Service,"We stayed here for 1 night and we had royal afternoon tea included which was wonderful, the staff even opened up The Rubens tea room for us to sit opposite the Royal Mews. The staff were so lovely and friendly and we also ate in BBar next door which was great too. We would love to come back and stay again soon",5,2020,08,25
137,41,"The epitome of taste.
Classy yet friendly.
Pricey but well worth the tariff.
Curry room is quiet the best Indian in London.
Bar Guy went out of his way to make (mock) cocktails when I let slip I was a professional teetotaler.",5,2020,08,20
137,Amazing ,"We stayed here last weekend for our wedding anniversary. We wanted a change of scenery and a small hotel ideally. The hotel is beautiful and the staff are outstanding. We were treated like royalty, well we were on Buckingham Palace Road!!! We decided to drive, we normally use the train and tube when staying in London but used the hotels valet parking for £55 (24hrs). We were greeted at the door, bags out, simple as that... well worth the money. 
We were kindly upgraded to a junior suite, located next door to the executive lounge/reception area, our room was fantastic as is the lounge area. We had a glass each of complimentary Lanson champagne upon arrival which is also a very nice touch. 
There’s ice cream, sweets and chocolate along with more savoury produce in the evenings to be had in the lounge area and an extensive drinks menu (only the snacks are included may I add, drinks are charged to the room).
We paid for breakfast the following morning which was outstanding, the continental is usually buffet but for obvious reasons is now al la Carte. The full English to follow was cooked to perfection... Check out was quick and easy and the car is brought back to you, which takes approx 10-15 mins. In summary, having stayed at many central London hotels, this has to be the best by far! It’s not just the hotel that makes it, it’s the wonderful staff. 
We will definitely return one day, hopefully when there is a bit more normality and more to do itself in London.",5,2020,08,20
137,"Perfect Birthday Celebrations, Thank You.","We visited  Hotel 41 for the first time on the 4th July 2020 for my Birthday, It was the day of opening up after Lock down and we were chuffed to be greeted with a Wonderful glass of champagne and Superb staff who made us feel at ease.
We were upgraded to a Suite which was absolutely wonderful.
Afternoon Tea was the best as was breakfast and we had dinner in the restaurant next door to the hotel which was also fantastic, this organised by the hotel for us as we wasn't sure what was available in the area.
Cannot recommend enough, Wonderful staff, Lovely quiet relaxing rooms and lovely location.  We look forward to seeing you next year for our Wedding Anniversary.",5,2020,08,20
137,Simply the Best,"We have stayed at The Rubens on a number of occasions but have always wanted to experience Hotel 41 and we was lucky enough to do so this month as The Rubens closed due to low visitor numbers.

This truly was an amazing treat and words would never do this hotel justice.

We was welcomed by the most courteous staff who swiftly brought out a champagne trolley for us to enjoy a glass from, which clearly was a sign of things to come.

We was booked in for afternoon tea as part of our package which was as exquisite as ever. The whole experience was out of this world with the most scrumptious sandwiches and treats. All served on a truly royal stand 

On checking in to our room we was upgraded to the Balmoral Suite which is like a room that we have never experienced before. The size was huge with no less than 3 bathrooms, a seating area, dining area and working space along with a walk in wardrobe. The room was immaculate and truly stocked with all toiletries you could imagine.

We can not write a review without mentioning the ‘Plunder the Pantry’. This is a marvellous complimentary treat that Hotel 41 offers where you could literally graze all day with sweets, snacks, freshly peppered bites to eat and my favourite Judes Ice Cream. This whole experience would be worth the stay itself.

I can not praise this hotel enough for it being a truly luxurious experience but the thing that is the cherry on the cake is the staff. Every member we met during our stay was of the highest standard. Courteous, polite and treated everybody as an individual. They was on hand in a split second without being too intrusive or making you feel uncomfortable.

We certainly did not want to leave and are forever thankful for Lauren and Malcolm allowing us to experience this hotel. We hope to return the next time we get a babysitting offer from parents. Hope to see you soon ",5,2020,08,18
137,Believe the hype!,"We stayed at Hotel 41 as a birthday get away, we were blown away by the reviews and had to try for ourselves.

From the second we arrived to the second we left we were treated to the most excellent, friendly customer service. The team at the hotel could not do enough for their guests and make you feel very welcome, very comfortable and very special. Their attention to detail and desire to tailor everyone’s experience is something I have never seen in any other hotel. An example was my wife being asked if she had enjoyed her birthday by a member of the team as we left when we’d not met that lady during our stay at any point, it was just the culture of the who team to treat everyone individually.

The room was well equipped and extremely comfortable with all the extras you’d expect from a top class hotel. Some of the unique things the hotel offers are what makes it so special with the ‘Plunder the Pantry’ delicious evening spread being the cherry on top of the already exquisite cake!

There are some famous hotels in London, but this is the best. 
",5,2020,08,15
137,An incredible example of customer service,"Our stay at hotel 41 was an incredible experience from start to finish. The staff are very attentive, without being overbearing and catered for our every need and want. It is always lovely to be greeted with a champagne welcome and we were thoroughly spoilt throughout our stay. The accommodation is beautiful, the food superb and the choice of quality drinks is also a great bonus. I'm not usually a review leaver but this place absolutely deserves a little something back. We are both key workers and were ready for some rest and relaxation, and that's exactly what we got. Thankyou, we will be back.",5,2020,08,14
137,Superb Relaxing Weekend At Wonderful Hotel,"Wanted to take my partner away for a nice weekend break post-lockdown, and couldn't have chosen a better place. From the warm welcome, with the lovely touch of  a glass of champagne, to the friendly, helpful staff, to the excellent room and the charming executive lounge area (with mouthwatering canapes and treats), everything about the weekend was first rate. Couldn't find a single fault even if I try really hard. Would recommend to anyone! Can't wait to book again later in the year!",5,2020,08,12
137,A big birthday to treasure.....,"Originally we had booked to spend my 50th birthday in New York..... COVID put paid to that and when booked into the Egerton and subsequently moved to 41, I was firmly thinking 'Woe is me'.............. I could not have been more wrong!

From the stress free valet parking as we arrived and onward; the hotel is a little oasis of calm and elegance - reminiscent of the understated opulence of a library in My Fair Lady - the decor is just sumptuous and stunning. The food is very tasty and plundering the pantry is a definite must! even the experience of checking in was the most pleasurable I've ever known (whilst sipping a glass of complementary pink fizz). 

What made it really outstanding though, is that - despite the potential for somewhere so glamorous to make for discomfort - it was actually just the opposite. It was welcoming, friendly and completely unpretentious. The staff were warm, with just the right touch of humorous and attentiveness and I (and my family) felt very special. Who needs New York eh?! 

Thank you for such a memorable birthday x",5,2020,08,12
137,Mother and daughter weekend away,"The hotel is the best hotel I’ve stayed in, in London. Really welcoming and attentive staff, great personal service, beautiful decor, fantastic and very comfortable bed. The roof top terrace with cocktails is a ‘must’. There is absolutely nothing I could offer to improve our experience from start to finish. Well done to all the staff involved in making our stay such a wonderful experience. ",5,2020,08,10
137,"Fabulous hotel, generous hospitality which far surpassed our exceptions","We were transferred to this hotel when the Milestone (sister hotel) had to postpone its opening. We stay at the Milestone because it's located near to family. It has reviews similar to Hotel 41, but we've never really been 'wowed' by the Milestone, so we entered Hotel with fairly modest expectations.  I very rarely write gushing reviews but Hotel 41 knocked our socks off! 
We received a very warm welcome from the doorman and were met at the elevator by friendly reception staff. From there we were served complimentary welcome drinks in the beautiful lounge where the check in process was seamless. 
The upgraded room was extremely well appointed, very clean, it had plenty of towels and toiletries. We didn't get a turn down service because I think the hotel was at full capacity, but we weren't too bothered. 
The hospitality is extremely generous, we really appreciated the extra mile that Hotel 41 went to, providing complementary sunglasses and sun cream in the rooftop bar. We loved the snacks available in the evening and throughout the day. We made a couple of additional requests, including late check out that the hotel were extremely generous about. 
Highly recommended, we'll most certainly be back.",5,2020,08,10
137,Birthday celebration that I will always treasure,"Myself and my mum stayed at hotel 41 for my birthday celebrations. We couldn’t have been more blown away by the standards of service we received whilst staying there. They provide you with so many extra touches to make the experience of staying there very special, which does not compare to any other hotel we have stayed in. From the measures put in place that ensured we felt safe due to covid restrictions to meeting all of my dietary requirements with the little treats which added to the experience. We could not recommend this hotel high enough and no longer want to stay anywhere else when we visit London. Thank you so much to all at hotel 41 for making my birthday so magical!",5,2020,08,10
137,Amazing Place,"Where do I start, well from the time I arrived. The bell man was there as soon as my cab pulled up, he was ready and waiting to greet me and my partner. 

The excutive lounge was beautiful, made me feel like a princess in a castle. The staff on a whole where very friendly and  helpful and alsways had a smile and a hello when they saw you. The room was amazing with the black and white decor, the bed was so big and comfy. The breakfast well this was on point, very nice and served with a smile. 

The rooftop garden is a must if your there in the summer. 

The plsce makes you feel very special within its enviroment and the staff make you that much more extra special. 

Fabulous place to stay in London,  41 Hotel will always have a place in my heart and my 1st choice of somewhere to stay in London. 

Thank you 41 Hotel for making my 1 night stay so special",5,2020,08,07
137,Mother and Daughter Shopping Trip,"WOW, this hotel is incredible, if I could give it 10 stars I would.  The staff are amazing from Trisha in reservations and Adele on Reception, everyone was so helpful. The service and attention detail cannot be faulted. The room we had was absolutely stunning and the location is perfect. We shopped till we dropped and the beds are very comfortable and the hotel is lovely and quiet.  The rooftop bar is lovely and the snacking station was very welcoming. Very organised for Covid, we felt very safe and will definitely be back.",5,2020,08,06
137,Mr Smith,"Stayed at Hotel 41 and forgot we were in London, Best hotel staff we have encountered, our room was emaculate and the Executive Lounge and roof bar was the icing on the 🎂 the whole building has character and a special feeling. 
Definitely coming back!! ☺",5,2020,08,05
137,"nice exclusive hotel, hidden gem with great service",We normally visit Rubens but as it is closed we thought we would try 41. The staff are excellent and very accommodating. The setup is slightly different to most hotels with the reception also being an exec lounge with complementary snacks. We hope to visit again in a few weeks time.,5,2020,08,03
137,Fiancé’s 50th Birthday,"This hotel was amazing! Everything about it was perfect. It was comfortable, cosy, classy and luxurious all at the same time. The staff were wonderful and ensured that our stay was a survival one! Special thanks to John (Head Concierge), Steve who served us lovely drinks in the bar, Dean who looked after us on the rooftop and Orci for making us feel at home. Also, the turndown service was impeccable, so special thanks to Adele and housekeeping for not only keeping our room lovely and clean and tidy, but for all the little finishing touches, such as a mini Birthday cake, chocolates, red petals, lip balms, little cord ties for our electrical items and many other little personal touches. 

We were sad to leave you’d beautiful hotel and return to normality. We shall definitely be back for more scrumptious breakfasts, gorgeous little canapés and glasses of champagne in a warm, friendly atmosphere with amazing staff! 

Thank you Hotel 41 ❤️🥂🥰",5,2020,08,03
137,An amazing staycation in the heart of London,We snuck away to Hotel 41 for an overnight in London during a heatwave. The hotel was tucked away in plain site - it was extremely quiet and yet right next to Buckingham palace and near many of the great nearby attractions. It was very luxurious and easily one of our top hotels anywhere we have stayed. The small complimentary touches and gifts given throughout the stay were wonderful little surprises. The service was second to none. Highly recommend for those traveling to London for vacation or those within London looking to get away from their routine for a night or two.,5,2020,08,03
137,Birthday,"The most beautiful hotel i have ever stayed in, all of the staff are a credit to the hotel, friendly, kind and extremely helpful, will definitely be going back next year !! The executive lounge was perfect at the end of a long day",5,2020,08,02
137,FABULOUS in every way ,"There really is nothing negative to say about this establishment. I’ve stayed at other Red Carnation Hotels and they are all wonderful and this one is just the cherry on the cake. Privacy, quiet, exclusive, beyond comfortable and the staff is thoughtful in ways you wouldn’t ever imagine. Alex Tollman was instrumental in ensuring our stay exceeded all of our possible expectations and I will definitely reach out to her anytime I stay in London. Also, the 24 hour honesty bar, snacks and food are great! The location cannot be beat. ",5,2020,07,30
137,A bit of perspective....,"We had a very pleasant stay here- but I really can't fathom the gushing reviews.  The rooms are small (even the suites are small); they are well appointed but they are not spacious.  Staff perfectly nice, but exactly as one would expect from a hotel.  There are no facilities other than the communal lounge ie no pool, spa etc.  Small roof terrace with restricted views.  Location wise it's off the main drag for hotels (ie if you are visiting London, the areas around Picadilly Circus etc are more central) but this is nice for access to St James's Park, which is one of the best parks in London in my opinion.  Overall, it's perfectly nice but really not the great fanfare that other visitors have written- I can only wonder how well travelled some of them are!",3,2020,07,30
137,"Superb stay, beautiful hotel","
We had the most perfect stay, from the moment we drove up to have our car valet parked to the welcome we received.
We loved having some time up on the roof terrace and enjoying the moment.  Every member of staff went above and beyond any expectation we had.  We also felt very safe after lockdown as the hotel has taken every measure with hand sanitisers, distancing and masks., nothing was too much trouble.  It was my husband’s 60th and you had gone to the trouble of upgrading us to a suite which was a lovely  and such a beautiful room.
The loved the breakfast room and yet again the service was superb and delicious selection.
We will definitely recommend the hotel and will be back. Their attention to detail was exceptional. Thank you.
",5,2020,07,27
137,Excellent from the second we stepped through the door.,"Hotel 41 far exceeded our expectations. We had seen the reviews and booked a single night there for a birthday getaway. From the moment we walked in the door there was a sense of calm and friendliness all around. 

The check-in was wonderful with a brief chat and some champagne and nibbles. The room was lovely and the roof terrace a great place to enjoy a quick glass and some aperitifs.

The world's best cup of tea welcomed us back after a nice meal out in Knightsbridge.

We would love to revisit Hotel 41 again, after a single night it felt like we were saying au-revoir to some good friends.",5,2020,07,27
137,Anniversary Break,"We cannot fault this wonderful hotel and staff. We previously stayed in the Red Carnations’ Milestone and it was fab, but 41 exceeded our expectations, and more. 

Expensive, yes but value for money? And more! 

We felt very well looked after, some personable touches including a celebratory slice of cake and chocolates.

Steve and Lauren were wonderful hosts, also another worker (we missed his name) was also very hospitable! 

We spent the entire weekend in the hotel bar drinking, we never felt the need to go elsewhere for a much over-due break from the hustle of life! 

Thanks to all and we will be back again soon! 

Scott and Stephanie Jarvie",5,2020,07,26
137,1 night stay for our engagement,"I was speaking to the hotel weeks if not months in advance to try and plan everything so I could propose to my girlfriend of 8 years. I had high expectations after seeing other reviews but am happy to say they where all exceeded by a country mile. 
The hotel its self was luxurious clean and beautifully laid out. The staff where what made it for us they where so attentive friendly and welcoming. we where lucky enough to be upgraded to the balmoral suite that was amazing. 
We got engaged on the roof terrace and celebrated with complementary Champaign. 
We are both already exited to plan our next stay. 
Could not fault anything and looking forward to",5,2020,07,20
137,Luxurious central London sanctuary,"We enjoyed a superb stay at Hotel 41 this weekend to celebrate my husband’s birthday. From start to finish staff did their utmost to offer friendly but professional service. Doors open magically with staff anticipating your next move. Hotel 41 benefits from a glorious roof top bar with spectacular views across London and the executive lounge offers a huge array of complimentary treats and a wonderful champagne trolley.  The location is perfect as there is so much within walking distance there is no need to worry about cabs or the underground at the moment.

With just 33 rooms and not open to non-residents the hotel has the feel of a private members club but without being stuffy.  Highly recommended if you are looking for a special and intimate hotel in central London for a post lockdown escape. ",5,2020,07,15
137,A real discovery,Got transferred from the Milestone to Hotel 41 - what a pleasant surprise! Friendly staff with excellent suggestions for things to do and places to go. The room was perfect (got a free upgrade to their junior suite) and the rooftop bar is amazing. Snacks available throughout the day (ice cream as well:) and the best vodka martini I ever had. 10 out of 10 would recommend.,5,2020,07,13
137,Probably the best boutique hotel in London ,"
The hotel's English butler service is phenomenal. The room is a historic British style. The Executive Lounge offers all-day food and beverages in addition to breakfast. In addition to the charge, the wine is free, and a delicious hot dish is served during dinner. It’s a bit pricey, but definitely worth the money. ",5,2020,04,21
137,Treasured Memories at Hotel 41,"Unfortunately, the virus forced us to miss another special stay at 41 as we planned for early May 2020. 41 is truly is a home away from home. The people, the service, the ambiance, the special touches and treatments, the list goes on and on. 

On our first visit, our honeymoon, we were offered the two level Conservatory suite and all the amazing extras that come along with the suite (including a glass ceiling to watch the stars at night). Champagne, chocolate covered strawberries, red roses, and romantic bubbles all truly delighted the senses.

We have been back many times since, but never managed to stay in such an elaborate and spectacular suite, but fingers crossed it will be available on one of our future visits. Since it is a very small boutique hotel, booking in advance is a must. We have stayed in many of their rooms, for example, a split two level junior suite with fireplace and on occasion in an executive king room. Both are wonderful retreats with all the trimmings.

Their hospitality and friendliness shows every day, and every request is never too small. On one occasion, we were passing through London from Heathrow to Gatwick and wanted to see our relatives in central London during the transit. We emailed the resident manager (Lauren Hargrave) at 41 asking if we could drop our luggage while we have lunch with them. Without hesitation, we were welcomed with open arms.  Even personally greeted when we arrived!

The staff at 41 has welcomed our family on many occasions. Once when we were meeting them for dinner, they arrived early and were welcomed into the lounge with drinks, while waiting for us to get ready. It feels like the lounge is like our private living room.

We have many other stories and special memories with 41 and can’t wait to return on our next visit to London and experience much more what this fabulous hotel has to offer. We wish them all the best during these troubled times.",5,2020,04,12
137,Your own personal palace.,"If you want to go somewhere special and really be looked after, there's nowhere better to go. It's like staying in your own personal palace full of lovely staff. Nothing is too much trouble and it's a little secret so great we don't really want to tell you about it.",5,2020,03,24
137,Excellent service in difficult times,"I have had to cancel my UK trip and stay at Hotel 41 due to the coronavirus and the travel advisory from the Canadian government. I had already prepaid a non-refundable fare for four nights through Expedia. I must command the utmost professionalism of the team at the hotel during this difficult time. Due to the rapidly evolving situation, there was some confusion and misunderstanding (I didn’t realize I was eligible for cancellation insurance until the government officially advised against travel, etc), and truth be told I was feeling quite stressed having to handle all the cancellations for the trip. They were amazingly patient and helped me with what I needed without having to go back to Expedia again. I imagine this is an incredibly difficult time for the hotel and the staff there. I sincerely hope they can weather the storm and look forward to visiting again.",5,2020,03,19
137,Remembering the best of times,"One of my fail proof strategies for a pick-me-up is to daydream about the wonderful experiences I have been fortunate to have.  Like most people around the world I have had to change my plans - perspective and reality check.  I should have been packing for myself and my son to travel to the UK for a very very special birthday party (think 50yrs of life, 18months of planning), instead I am preparing to be on the medical front line in Australia.  So I am daydreaming about where I would have been instead.
About now I would be burning up the last of my adrenaline after our 26 hour commute and about to have the doors opened for me at Hotel 41, where we would have been greeted with helping hands, warm smiles and open hearts.  The foyer would have smells of fresh bread and coffee, a bright bunch of red carnations wouldn’t be far away.  We would be whisked up to check in - which can only take place within the embrace of an oversized arm chair and with a glass of champagne (yes, champagne at any hour) and probably a freshly squeezed OJ for Master 11.  Even if we’ve arrived on a ridiculously early flight a room is available for a wash and a lie down if needed, and breakfast is encouraged to get you through the day.  It’s hard to find room for more food after an international flight but somehow the combination of the natural-light filled dining room and the dizzyingly good smells convince me to at least ‘have a look at the menu’ - of course this is all a show, they know as well as I do that I cannot say no to a Hotel 41 breakfast offering.
After a long day of drizzle and occasional sunpatches, dodging puddles and pedestrians, visiting parks, canals and museums (we have our own Paddington Walking Tour planned - next time) our step would quicken as we approach those glass panes doors to be welcomed all over again, and this time shown to Our Room.  I can picture it so clearly - all the striking blacks and whites, the shine and the polish, the soft music from the sound system, more fresh flowers, two ridiculously comfortable beds (screaming to be bounced on - no Master 11!), the magically soft lighting of the bathroom with warm fluffy fluffy towels and a huge soaking bath......",5,2020,03,19
137,Perhaps my favorite hotel yet,"This is absolutely one of the finest hotel experiences we have ever had and we have had some fabulous experiences.  The staff goes above and beyond to exceed all expectations.  Our room was lovely with all the appointments with one could need.  It would be difficult to name one staff member as every single staff member was beyond warm and helpful.  they made me coffee at 3 AM and helped us rearrange our travel when the coronavirus created havoc on a global level. They made a cozy fire in our room and brought a toasty hot water bottle that my daughter clung to in this uncertain time.  Sadly, we had to cut our trip short but the staff listened to our woes, made my daughter hot cocoa while Mommy was on the phone for hours trying to get us out of the country, and rearranged dinner reservations and car transport.  Front staff spent hours trying to call British Airways to try and help rearrange our trip and one gentleman even texted one of his friends who had some connections at British Airways to get more information on what exactly was the best decision.  We made the most of the time we did have there and had a lovely tea service complete with a little princess menu for my 8 year old.  There is a constant array of tasty treats and drinks readily available which is so nice when you are traveling with a child and keep a little bit of odd hours.  We had to leave emergently to get back to the States but there was Drago with the bellman, croissants, and coffee to go.  We will be back",5,2020,03,19
137,Superb Service,Had a fabulous stay in hotel 41. It is a small boutique hotel in a wonderful location. From the moment we arrived we were made feel so welcome by every staff member. The service from everyone was superb nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was delicious and all the nibbles supplied all day was a wonderful treat. Highly recommend and we will definitely be back!,5,2020,03,08
137,Best hotel in London,I’ve stayed in many hotels in my time but none were as special as 41. From the moment we arrived we were well cared for. Everyone was really pleasant and all went the extra mile. A gem of a hotel in a mediocre world,5,2020,03,08
137,Exemplary hotel experience,"All aspects of the Hotel 41 experience were beyond our expectations.   The staff is warm, accommodating and skilled.  Every possible contingency was  attended to and anticipated beforehand.  Rooms are beautifully decorated, impeccably clean and perfectly appointed.  The room's  fireplace added a special warmth to the setting.   In house dining with delicious breakfasts, wonderful snacks, and fabulous evening buffet complimented the hotel experience.  This hotel should be on anyone's list if service, luxury and location are priorities.  Looking forward to a return visit in the near future.  Thanks to all.   
Best regards,

137,Best hotel in London,"A wonderful hotel with big rooms, but feels like a home. The staff is amazing, extremely services minded and friendly. They did little things, like preparing your room for night by lightning some (fake) candles and putting on relaxing music, even giving you a weather prognosis for the next day.",5,2020,03,02
137,A magical stay !,"We read a lot of reviews about the 41 before booking a room. A lot of them were pretty nice. We were scared by a few ones which were saying it was a not so perfect experience and kind a waste of money. Being a long time faithful guests of red carnation properties, we trusted our guts and we tried it anyway.
Let us just say this: the 41 is incredible and will fullfil all your expectations and beyond.

The staff was helpful without being intrusive. Always with a smile, they are quickly catching on all your needs and habits, even after only one day.
The lounge was truly wonderful, classy chic, cozy, with delicious food (canapés to die for, a different buffet every day, with a high level of quality and savoir-faire. The label tags were missing one day, but you got to have the surprise with the dishes so, why not?).
The room was gorgeous. They sent me a surprise for my birthday, which was a pretty great gesture. The cleaning room staff was almost perfect - a négative point: couldn t find a sewing kit. They provided a great service anyway: a teeth kit- shaver kit, salt bath kit and they reordered my charging cables or my beauty products on a small cotton towel. The classical music on after the turn down is to be mentioned too.
The bed was so confortable you just got the impression of sleeping on a cloud.
Just don’t skip breakfast! The ordered cooked food is magical! Don’t skip the dinner lounge neither... don’t skip anything there: the experience is the hotel, not London...
Yes the room is not cheap, but the experience and wellbeing are totally worth it. The best Home away from home!",5,2020,03,01
137,Just outstanding!,"A life spent in hotels has allowed me to define the perfect hotel = and 41 is it. From the moment we arrived the personal attention to detail started - and even learnt and used our names - Wow! The standard of service, the amazing staff, the food and drinks in the lounge and a really comfortable bed and quiet room. This hotel defines what a 5 star hotel should be and how it is done. You must try it and see for yourself, and its in a great location and very well served by Victoria for the Tube.",5,2020,02,26
137,Superb! 100% Perfect ,"So I was looking for a supremely comfortable hotel in central London following the change of The Arch - my long term favourite - to another style after a huge refurb. I came across this hotel on Trip Advisor and it seemed to be consistently number 1 in London 

Surely not? Oh yes! 

Everything about this hotel is completely perfect - the location, the comfort level of the rooms, the staff, the complimentary food in the Executive lounge, the hot water bottle you find in your bed at night, (with lavender pillow spray) the candlelit bathroom on your return at night the luxury toiletries and the superbly comfortable beds. 

It is  supremely comfortable without being ‘over the top.’ Every single member of staff is a credit to the hotel, Having found Hotel 41 - that’s it - I won’t be going anywhere else. 

The photos show the complimentary ice cream fridge, my bed, the lovely toiletries, the fully stocked desk drawer with everything you’d need stationary wise to sit and work, and the 2 bathrooms in my room.

I’m completely in love with Hotel 41 and look forward hugely  to my next stay ",5,2020,02,23
137,Luxury = Hotel 41,"We have stayed at Hotel 41 on numerous occasions and like with our previous stays, the hotel did not disappoint.  For us, when in London our address will always be 41 Buckingham Palace Road @ Hotel 41.  The level of service of the staff along with the their personal touch is second to none.  The staff in the executive lounge are there to pamper you and provide for your every need, and they did not disappoint.  The food is exceptional, the accommodations are first class and the service is second to none. 
 What else could you possibly ask for?  My wife and I already cannot wait until our next stay.",5,2020,02,21
137,Luxurious Oasis in London ,We were delighted to return to Hotel41 for our annual February stay and enjoy once again this amazing oasis in the heart of London . From the moment you walk through the door you feel calm and relaxed as Malcolm and his fantastic staff make you feel so welcome and do everything possible to ensure you have a marvellous stay ! We were extremely fortunate to be upgraded to a suite which we so appreciated and it just put the icing on the cake as it were ! I won’t go into details of what great service is available as it’s well documented in other reviews but just like to say if you are ever in London and want to have a unique luxury hotel experience look no further than Hotel 41 its the best !! Thank you everyone for making our stay so memorable and we are looking forward to next year already ! ,5,2020,02,21
137,I am in love with this hotel,"I booked two rooms in this hotel.  One for my husband and I, and another for my daughter coming in from Ireland.  This hotel has to be one of my favourites.  From the outset, the reception and staff are excellent.  At check in, you are greeted with champagne and the process is seamless.  In the executive lounge, there are always drinks and snacks available.  The room is cozy.  Lots of outlets and the bathroom appears small, but there is plenty of room for storage of your toiletries.  Turn-down service is heavenly.  A hot water bottle is placed in your bed every evening.  I cannot say enough good things about this hotel.  I have stayed at Waldorfs, Fairmonts, St. Regis, Belmonds, etc., but this is one of my preferred hotels.",5,2020,02,18
137,Outstanding and exceptional Property!!!,"The food is amazing both at breakfast and in the evening at both of their restaurants.
From the first salute of the security guards to the excellent service by the pool
This is an amazing hotel I have ever stay.",5,2020,02,16
137,Best in London? ,"Now I have not stayed in every hotel in London, so I can't definitively say that Hotel 41 is the best in London. But what I can say is when it comes to personal service, attention to detail and the feeling of exclusivity I can't see how any other hotel could possibly do it better. I won't go. Into every detail of my stay. Just know that if you are thinking of booking but worry that it couldn't possibly live up to the hype and all the glowing reviews you have read, trust me it will live up to and exceed your expectations. Couldn't have had a nicer stay. ",5,2020,02,14
137,Perfectly perfect,"So where do I start... at the beginning. Hidden away in plain view, you suddenly see the simplistic beauty of Hotel 41’s black flag waving in the wind. As the taxi pulls up, the beautiful doors are opened and you step into the old world glamour of days gone by. Beautiful black & white tiling  leads you past the reception with its leather armchairs and welcome drinks. The wooden panelling and brass railings shining as you climb the steps and enter the perfectly polished brass lift. Not a finger print in sight. The welcoming receptionist phones up to the fifth floor as you’re whisked seamlessly up into the hushed depths of the hotel. As the doors glide open the air of quiet elegance envelopes you in warmth and you just know that this is going to be an incredible stay. The black and white artwork enhances the beautifully striped wall fabric. And you find yourself in a serene maze of corridors and faultless wooden doors. Behind which each and every room is hushed, waiting to welcome it’s next guest. As the door into the executive lounge opens you get your first glimpse of your home from home. Smiling staff seat you down with a glass of champagne; they’ve been looking forward to welcoming you into their beautiful surroundings. The pleasure they get from watching your face as you take in the elegance of their lounge. With its light filled atrium in which hang two of the most impressive brass chandeliers I’ve ever seen, to the welcoming fireplace and leather sofa. Tables discreetly placed so no guest feels intruded upon. Fresh carnations and cocktails to tease your senses. Canapés and croque monsieur to soften the hunger pangs before dinner. Soft lighting and even softer spoken staff who know your name as soon as they first welcome you and within a few short minutes will know your favourite tipple, what your plans are for your stay and are already looking forward to seeing you again. Your room is like no other you’ve stayed in. Simple luxury at its very best. Freshly made chocolates waiting for your arrival. A turndown service in the evenings that make snuggling into the softest bed an absolute delight; a hot water bottle to warm your aching feet after traipsing the streets of London. A musical still humming in your head. Oh and the breakfasts, such a perfect way to start your day. Nothing is ever too much and everything is exactly as it should be. If you stay in London only once in your life then I highly recommend that you look no further than this secret boutique hotel nestled next to its sister hotel. Don’t overlook it in your search;You’ll regret it. What you don’t regret is the happiness that comes from within from the moment you arrive to the minute you leave. Enjoy your visit; we did.",5,2020,02,11
137,The hotel where nothing is too much trouble,"My wife and I had been given an experience voucher for lunch at The Ritz so we decided to turn it into a couple of days break away in London. Hotel 41 seemed to offer everything we were looking for to make it a memorable trip and so booked direct.

The hotel surpassed all expectations and it is fair to say that they couldn't do enough for you as a guest. Thought has gone into every aspect of making your stay as memorable as possible, from having a 'grazing bar' available throughout the day to a turndown service where they even pop a hot water bottle in your bed! The staff were so helpful and always ready to stop and have a chat about the hotel, London, whatever - nothing was too much trouble.

One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.",5,2020,02,10
137,40th birthday surprise treat.....did not disappoint,"What an amazing hotel!!! From booking, to checking in, to the meal, nothing was too much trouble. We enjoyed a lovely meal in the English Grill and the breakfast was delicious! The hotel really does feel very intimate and luxurious. I booked it as a surprise for my husbands birthday and the little touches provided by the amazing staff really did make our trip!! Thank you xxxx",5,2020,02,08
137,Never Fails to Impress,"Once again Hotel 41 comes up trump's, my girlfriend and I were in London for a theater visit and without hesitation chose to stay at our favourite London hotel, hotel 41. We were really fortunate, as on arrival we were told we had been upgraded to a suite, which was just magnificent. As always the service at 41 was impeccable from the moment we walked through the door to the moment we left. Nothing is too much trouble and every little detail has been thought about to make your stay a great experience. The pantry is great, its stocked with all sorts of nibbles and snacks which you can help yourself to any time night or day whilst relaxing by the fire in the beautiful lounge. One real nice and special touch I like is that the staff actually remember your name which really adds to the personal homely feel. If you prefer the smaller more intimate type hotels that offer 5 star quality and a truly personal experience, then hotel 41 is just the best.",5,2020,02,07
137,An oasis in London,"My wife and I had the pleasure of spending an amazing night at this unique hotel. It was a milestone birthday celebration and we wanted to spend somewhere special. We took our time looking and found, what I can only describe as, the perfect hotel. Our experience from the initial booking to the final checkout was amazing, with the staff and management deserving most of the praise for the way we were dealt with throughout. It felt more like a private club than a hotel. I have travelled all over the world with my job and have stayed in some wonderful hotels but, if I’m honest, this tops the lot. We’ll definitely be back.",5,2020,02,03
137,Oodles of Charm,"Hotel 41 is a lovely and welcome throwback from the stale modernism that has become the signature of many a boutique hotel.  It’s an elegant and romantic little spot that enchants from the moment you enter.  The décor is a celebration of old-fashioned traditional English design, with a tasteful black and white color scheme.  The walls contain prints featuring a cast of characters straight out of English Lit 101.  Our spacious room had a gas-burning fireplace and a bathroom which contained both an old-fashioned tub and a shower.  The hotel itself is a quiet oasis, as it only contains rooms on the top of its 5 floors (41 is the sister hotel of the larger The Rubens at the Palace Hotel next door). It’s conveniently located within walking distance of Buckingham Palace, Victoria Station and Cardinal Place shopping center.

A delightful feature is the guest lounge, a 2-level airy space resembling an old-fashioned library that contains a wood-burning fireplace and several quiet corner tables for relaxing during the day and at night, with a daily afternoon tea-traditional English style, of course, with scones and clotted cream.  It’s a space restricted to guests and their acquaintances, so it is the perfect place to relax after a day of sightseeing.  We had a 1-night layover in London after a couple of weeks in Paris, and the staff at Hotel 41 made us feel right at home, going out of their way to find us a restaurant that served a particular dish that my husband had taken a fancy to during our travels.  In a word, Hotel 41 is fantastic; we cannot wait to return and have a longer stay.",5,2020,02,01
137,"Overrated, disappointing, once is enough!","I have been to many places and choosing the hotel based on TripAdvisor ranking. Every time it goes well except this hotel. First, a woman who brought us to the room is not friendly and made us feel that it was an “look down service”. We had a Balmoral suite which I expected that it was going to be a wonderful room for us. Unfortunately, it was not. Worth almost 800 GBP I paid to see that 2 of the 3 bathrooms had problems with water drainage and cleanliness. Imagine, while you are taking a bath, you are almost flooding the room with water mixing with shampoo and shower gel!! Breakfast was just okay, but not worthy of it’s price . No one knew that my kids will get complimentary continental breakfast. I had to prove by showing the email I got from the hotel that if I booked directly with the hotel, children under 12 stay free with complimentary breakfast. Not professional!! Moreover, I was not acknowledged that all the drinks except water (including coffee and tea) will be charged extra of the Full English Breakfast. This is the first hotel I have been staying and doing things like this. Things were charged and things weren’t charged are not clearly noted. They should separate and not keep them together to making anyone get confuse. Anyhow, guys who served us the breakfast are pretty nice as well as the bellboy. Ladies at the front are also kindness to give us a small room for relaxing before our departure which I appreciate it.
In summary, once is enough for us!",1,2020,01,31
137,Celeste,"This hotel is nothing short of absolutely, insanely spectacular. It deserves every ounce of praise it has received and more. I stayed here with my father, whilst on business, in September last year and have raved about it since. The service is out of this world, and the environment simply breathtaking. As a result, I instantly reserved a further 5 nights for a return visit next week. 

My Dad is the most well traveled person I have ever encountered, and even he can’t stop talking about how special it is.

I will be back MANY times again for sure!",5,2020,01,28
137,Perfect Stay and AMAZING customer service!,"This place is such a gem!! It is not only the most luxurious hotel we have stayed in, the attention to detail and making a memorable stay for each guest was so apparent. We are by no means fancy people but were excited to splurge for our 10 year anniversary. They were so incredible at making us feel welcome, excited for us to celebrate there (champagne and dessert in the room!!), and were attentive to everything. What I appreciated I think the most was that while we were of course splurging on some things, we were definitely not the fanciest/highest dollar people staying there and I never felt like they treated us any differently or wanted to help us any less. Such a treat through and through!!
 
In addition to all of the amazing things while we were staying there, I left my phone in a cab on our last night and the front desk that team was AMAZING. They connected with the cab for me, arranged a pick up, and then arranged mailing it to us for the following day. I woke up to a handwritten note to stop by the desk to go over the news. I was blown away! 

If you want to stay somewhere incredibly classy, feel totally pampered, and receive top notch service, BOOK THIS HOTEL!! Thank you again and again for helping make our stay wonderful Hotel 41!",5,2020,01,26
137,A Wood Panelled Oasis of Peace,"This is our 4th visit to Hotel 41 and every time we underestimate the impact of its charm, staff and atmosphere. I challenge anyone to remain stressed for too long ( I usually last 5 minutes!). The high ratio of staff to guest and informal atmosphere helps shed the worries of the outside world ( which seem part of another planet entirely). Add to that the luxurious rooms, a sumptuous bed and good nights sleep you leave refreshed and relaxed.

The executive lounge is a set out of a Jules Verne movie with globe, open fire, library (office if needs must), open pantry and attentive staff.

A great location overlooking part of Buckingham Palace grounds and close to so theatres and fine dining. Twenty minutes walk to Bond Street and Picadilly across Green Park.

Fantastic! ",5,2020,01,25
137,The BEST in London,"Stellar service and amenities. Every time we had a “wow” moment and thought it couldn’t get any better, they surprised us with even more amazing things. We didn’t want for anything. I’ve stayed in many London hotels, and this is the zenith! Can’t wait to come back.",5,2020,01,24
137,Just as everyone says,"The quality and amenities were every bit as good as advertised and reviewed. We have stayed at their sister hotel, Rubens, just about every year for there last few and love that. We decided to stay at the 41 for a special occasion. We used it as out ""home."" We have been out to dinner many times in London and don't eat a lot at dinner, so we just stayed there for the things they put out in the evening and had drinks. We feel like we got to know their friendly staff, and that made it even more comfortable each evening. 
Since we didn't go out, we declined the turndown service except for one night. Should have got it every night because that was the BEST. Allow it to be done...
The only negative, and this is personal to us, is how much they want to help. We don't need much attention and that could have gotten uncomfortable, except that they figured it out quickly and allowed us to just ask for help. Which we did.",5,2020,01,22
137,"Hidden Gem, Outstanding service","Outstanding service from the moment you make a reservation to when you walk in the door staff make you feel welcome and try accommodate your every need.

It's a smallish hotel (40 rooms) and no real signage on the exterior.  They keep a receptionist in the lobby to direct you to the upper floors where rooms are and check in occurs.  There is an executive suite available for guests to access a light breakfast, quick snacks and water, coffee or tea during the day (tea and small canapes are offered early evening as well), drinks and other food are available as well.  Rooms are tastefully decorated in black and whites with all the amenities you would come to expect in any hotel.  They are good sized and comfortable.  Wake up calls are personally done with a knock on the door and fresh coffee delivered at the same time.  

The location is right across from Buckingham Palace, St James park and close to several restaurants and shops.  It is also close to the Victoria Tube station and Bus transfer station.  Its an easy walk through Saint James Park to Piccadilly, Mayfair, or walking the other way (about 15 minutes walk) you can reach the Churchill Museum and War Rooms,  Downing street, Big Ben, Houses of Parliament and Westminster Abbey ",5,2020,01,22
137,We just love this place!,"Hotel 41 has fortunately become our home away from home. We love their philosophy of service and the attention to detail. Even the smell of the hotel is great!!! The staff are so friendly helpful and attentive. The evening pantry is fab, although never really needed....it has to be done!
Best place to stay in London 
",5,2020,01,22
137,Absolutely fantastic,"Incredible hotel with amazing staff. This was our third visit and the standard is higher than ever. The staff are quite exceptional, the care and attention we received makes other hotels look poor. We arrived for my wife’s birthday and we had a cake in the room which had been upgraded to a suite!
We had a lunch in b bar which is part of the Rubin’s and again exemplary service.
We’re already considering staying in the summer and will defiantly return next January.",5,2020,01,20
137,Impeccable Service!,"Actually stayed her on our first trip to London in 2017 and we loved it. It was a Last minute trip, so we booked our room as we boarded the plane. Hotel 41 held our room without even taking a credit card to hold it, staff was soooo nice. Close to buckingham palace and some good restaurants. ",5,2020,01,19
137,Fantastic,Definitely the best hotel I have ever stayed in. Once again our stay surpassed our expectations.  The hotel is amazing. It's like a tranquil oasis in the middle of london. It's so nice we ended up spending most of the day relaxing in the beautiful lounge. Thanks so much to all the staff for making my husbands birthday extra special. We just can't wait to come back.,5,2020,01,19

We stayed in many hotel but I would give hotel41 the best of the hotel !!many five star hotel should have learn this kind of hospitality but many place still act like robots 
We stayed for 2 night accually I should decide to stay here the whole trip we were in UK anyway we will surely come back for the special room that have roof glass can see the stars that what the staff told us !! By the way we got upgraded to the room the have 2 stories ♥️👍",5,2020,01,18
137,Customer service experience,"I am soon to be staying at Hotel 41. 
Positive feedback online led me to call to make an enquiry which turned into a booking. 
Reason for my review is that the customer service experience delivered by Kirsty, the hotel's Reservations Manager, was first class. Working in management myself, I know it can be an arduous role sometimes, but the phone call to make my booking was informative, swiftly handled and a smooth process. 
Already excited to for my visit to this hotel. 
Thank you Kirsty & Hotel 41!",5,2020,01,13
137,Brilliant stay for our wedding anniversary,"Cannot leave a high enough review. What a gem of a hotel. Absolutely fabulously appointed small boutique hotel, wonderful staff so accommodating and friendly. We stayed overnight for our wedding anniversary and the staff and hotel spoilt us beyond any expectation, upgraded our room, special anniversary cake and congratulations but even had it not been our anniversary the staff were amazing and the room lovely. Perfectly situated to walk into LONDON. Will be recommending to my friends as know they will love it. Thank you hotel 41",5,2020,01,12
137,Another visit to 41 and just as fantastic as usual!,"The hotel is not big which is perfect.  The service is fantastic with lovely staff, always attentive, friendly and prepared to do the utmost to make you feel welcome and important. 
The room is elegant, contains all that you need and a little bit more. 
The hotel is situated close to Buckingham Palace, ie very central.
And finally an amazing and generous breakfast!

137,Remains special!,"Once again, we enjoyed our stay at 41 really much. This time we went to London as a gift for my sons' graduation. When we arrived in the room there was a surprise cake for him. That was amazing!! Apart from that the hotel was perfect in all aspects and the staff was wonderful!",5,2020,01,08

137,My new favorite hotel in London,"I fell in love with this boutique hotel! I came with my son Hugo for Halloween and the whole team was ever so friendly with us! The room we had was cosy, with a fireplace that was lit every evening: what à delight! My son was thrilled to find chocolates and Halloween goodies in the room: thanks again! We enjoyed playing games in the evening in the main room by the fireplace while enjoying snacks from the buffet. The hotel is perfectly located right next to thé royal mews / Buckingham and St James Park. We will definitely come back soon! Thanks again for a great stay!",5,2020,01,03
137,Amazing as always,"Another amazing stay, thanks to all the team who work so hard to ensure you have a great time. Really nothing is to much trouble.
Stayed for 4 nights over New Year and everything was perfect, shame to leave and come back to reality.",5,2020,01,02
137,Classic Elegance,"We stayed here for 5 nights in December.  If you want to feel like you are a guest at someone's private estate, this is the place for you.  Their hospitality surpasses any 5-star hotel we've visited.  Their friendliness and concern for any need you may have is truly genuine.",5,2019,12,21
137,A hotel that goes above and beyond ,Always a joy to return to Hotel 41. The staff are fantastic and the attention to detail above and beyond. A stressful stay for me due to some business requirements and a special thanks to Marlen who was incredibly helpful.  Thank you guys... wouldn’t dream of staying anywhere else when we visit London.,5,2019,12,21
137,Home from home,"We’ve had two recent trips to 41 and the first of these reminded me why we love this hotel so much.

There really is nowhere else quite like it. The real key is the service level. Staff take care to know you by name and understand and note carefully your habits and needs. 

For me it represents excellent value for money. This does not mean it is cheap but it does mean that we get a service which reflects what we’ve paid.

The ‘plunder the pantry’ is, as far as I know, unique and is, quite simply, superb for an inveterate ‘snacker’ such as myself. It’s what I would do at home! 

The executive lounge is a great place to relax and take a drink, and is a welcome break from the frenetic pace of London. The drinks prices are no different from any other London location but the ambience is so much calmer. It’s like being in your own front room. 

There can’t be many hotels where breakfast is such a leisurely affair and you really can just kick back and let the day start slowly. 

This hotel gets it right for us. We’ll doubtless return. ",5,2019,12,16
137,Perfect for Birthday night out in London,"What a gem. Booked for a nice place to stay as part of a birthday night out. Lovely hotel - great rooms, decor, bar lounge area beautiful and relaxing, service exceptional. With all the bars and restaurants nearby there are lots of options - will have to come again to try bbar which was closed on Sunday. Central to tourist sites if that’s what you want - Westminster, Buckingham Palace, parks and so on, but also perfect for a relaxing place to stay as part of a good night out. Loved it, will stay again. ",5,2019,12,16
137,As wonderful as always,"Another pre Christmas stay at 41 and again it was wonderful.

This hotel is magnificent, greeted as warmly as ever, champagne by the fire and a cozy and comfortable room.

The honesty bar was stocked as well as usual.

We’ll be back next year and already can’t wait.",5,2019,12,13
137,This is England ,"This hotel is just amazing! Staff is so so nice, it is the people who make experience amazing! I travel a lot for work and Im sure I will come back! 👌 Everything is just perfect in there. I highly recommend Hotel 41, it is so England and so must see 👌",5,2019,12,12
137,Running out of superlatives ,"It was our first visit back to Hotel 41 since I had my stroke last year,  so it was a well anticipated treat. It did not disappoint. The visit included a chance to see Le Mis in Concert and a catch up with family. 
From the moment we arrived it was total chill and comfort. From being welcomed by name and the eagerly awaited glass of champagne through to the perfect service at all times. How many hotels would remember I asked for the Scotsman newspaper on our previous visit, far less go to the effort of having one printed off. It was much appreciated. 
On behalf of Rachel and I would like to say thanks for the very warm welcome shown to her brother, sister in law and niece when they visited us. I am still managing my post stroke energy level so the the Executive Lounge was the ideal place for a catch up.
Our room was as luxurious as I recalled and the bed so comfortable I went out like the proverbial light. I am delighted that we over indulged as usual at breakfast and took full advantage of ‘plunder the pantry’. 
The location, the decor and the ambience are obviously factors which contribute to the esteem in which the Hotel is held, however for us, the key element is undoubtedly the staff. Friendly, professional, always smiling, attentive, efficient and they genuinely care about you as a guest.
We hope to return ere long.",5,2019,12,10
137,Unique piece of experience,"We have been visiting Hotel 41 as a guest for a few years now and every time it feels more like coming home. For example, the ""turn down"" service makes it a party to go back to your hotel after a great evening out. The excellent bed and bed linen ensure that getting up is a challenge, far too comfortable to lie down! Having breakfast in the library is cool every day, delicious treats. All in all a very nice welcoming atmosphere, truly a unique piece of experience in London.",5,2019,12,10
137,Needs a Few Improvements,"Hotel 41 is one of the best hotels in London. This month I stayed two different times, in two different rooms, for a total stay of 9 nights. Starting at the greeting at the door the staff strives to do their best to make guests feel welcomed. Two of the hallmarks of the hotel are its unique rooms (no two alike except the black-and-white decor) and the raid-the-pantry nightly spread.  I have always been quite pleased with my stays.

On these stays, however, I noticed serval things that didn’t seem up to the standards that Hotel 41 espouses. Although I enjoy differences between rooms, not all are created equal. Although both rooms were in the same category, one room had a fireplace and spacious bathroom while the other was cramped.  The smaller room had a television mounted on the wall that protruded enough to be dangerous to those trying to walk past the bottom of the bed. Taller people could hit their head. The bathroom room was up a half step. The sink was mounted shallowly on the wall, so that one had to be careful not to run into the glass scale on the floor.

The smaller room had a “view” of the inner parts of the building. Directly across from the window was a light that was on all night. Fortunately the black-out curtains shielded the lights. The larger room had a view of London rooftops, with two windows in the main room and one window in the bathroom. 

The large room had a very large water flow. The two rainfall showers (one in the tub and another in the shower) were a bit overpowering in their flow. One can’t help to be concerned for the planet using these. They obviously had no flow restriction. Further, between the misfitted gasket for the bathtub shower and the overly large shower head in the small shower, it was impossible not to get water all over the floor. The smaller room, on the other hand, had flow so low in the sink that I thought the water had been turned off. (This, to me, was preferable.) The combined tub/shower had an acceptable (and not too much) flow, but the shower ceiling fixture was starting to show corrosion. 

Housekeeping did an acceptable job except the day they left the dirty rag in my room. But one can’t help to wonder how many Elemis products  in tiny bottles one needs to be left on the bed at night. Tiny plastic bottles are on their way out. I would prefer chocolate to Elemis. 

Hotel 41 boasts and “on your honor” bar, but I’ve never been there when I’ve had to make my own drink. That’s fine, as I happy to leave that to the professionals as long as they truly know how to mix a drink. One of the bartenders substituted a low-quality vermouth for a higher quality ingredient that was listed on the drinks menu. He was happy enough to remake the drink with the advertised ingredients, but I really don’t expect this sort of service in an establishment as highly regarded as Hotel 41. 

The lobby/library is a wonderful area to relax and is where they serve breakfast. It is one of the more highly priced breakfasts in the area, so it’s best to reserve the room with breakfast. The menu has quite a variety from small portioned, health conscious choices to the healthier full English. Each is 27 pounds. I was disappointed that on at least three occasions my hot breakfast arrived cold and the cappuccino was lukewarm. 

You might be wondering why 4 stars? Overall the experience was good and I do think Hotel 41 can improve its standards. But right now, given its price category and the competition in this category, a few changes are needed.",4,2019,12,09
137,A truly magical stay,"I would firstly like to start by saying a huge and very big thank you.

I can absolutely see why your establishment is the number 1 boutique hotel in London.

We had a fantastic stay.  I wish I could remember all the names of every staff member who showed kindness and amazing hospitality, they all did:- 

We were checked in by Magdalena and Andrew my partner was very impressed with his knowledge about absolutely everything!
We were served breakfast in our suite by two very accommodating staff members.
We were poured drinks and assisted by another staff member at the hospitality bar during the evening.
Our bags were moved to a hospitality room where we were able to stay for a further couple of hours until our travel time came.

I had booked surprise massages in our room and Magdelena was very discreet in arranging this. The massages were excellent and left us feeling relaxed and refreshed for the evening.

We were surprised to be given an upgrade to a Suite – We have never stayed anywhere so luxurious and so beautiful in every way.  

The personal touches of a warm fire, the hot water bottle and the lit candle etc. made everything so magical.

The food is of the finest quality from the little welcome anniversary cake and sweet treats in our room to the delicious wonderful breakfast.

Once again, thank you for making our Year!  We will definitely return for another special occasion.",5,2019,12,09
137,Amazing stay for our wedding anniversary,"Reaching our 10th wedding anniversary, we wanted to do something special, but with young children, we were a little limited in how far and how long we could stay away.

Having seen previously that Hotel 41 has always been highly rated we decided to treat ourselves to a night there. We booked a few months in advance and was contacted by the hotel directly to ask if we required anything special during our stay.

I liaised with the hotel a few times before our reservation and the hotel was always swift to respond and were very accommodating of any requests I had. We were asked to complete a form a few days before our stay making sure that all our needs would be met. 

On arrival, we were greeted by very friendly staff and shown upstairs to the check-in desk. We were offered complimentary champagne and were made to feel very relaxed and welcome. 

We checked our bags in and headed out for the day before returning to freshen up in our room. We were shown the executive lounge and all the goodies and treats that are available to all guests (it was amazing!) and then we were taken to our room. We were shown down the corridor and told that as we were visiting for our anniversary we had been upgraded to the Balmoral Suite! This was a huge surprise and we are so very grateful for the gesture as it did make our weekend so very memorable. 
The room was beautifully decorated, immaculately clean and the bed was massive! We had such a good night sleep, the mattress and all the bedding was so luxurious that we were loath to get up the next day.

After freshening up we visited the lounge and enjoyed some delicious canapes with some of the best table service we've ever had and after a walk around the city, we returned to ""plunder the pantry"" again. We enjoyed cold meats, cheese, bread, individual tarts, salads and ice cream. It was a great end to the evening. 

The next morning we had breakfast served in our room and again the service and food were amazing and next to none. 

On checking out the staff were very kind and courteous, even providing us with a bag of drinks and lots of snacks and sweets to take home to the kids. 

We had the most memorable night at Hotel 41, it was a very special occasion for us to blow our normal budget, but we are very glad we did and can't recommend the hotel and it's staff highly enough.",5,2019,12,09
137,Consistently brilliant,"We've been staying at 41 once or twice a year for the past 6 years or so. And it never fails to disappoint.

It's a boutique hotel beautifully decorated and maintained. The rooms and executive lounge are always impeccable - food is universally good. It's classy old school decor but with lots of different, thoughtful touches.

But what makes 41 stand out is the brilliant staff - many of whom have worked their for years. It's always a pleasure to see Magdalena who is always so wonderfully helpful. This time we met Andrew who astonished me with some little touches. But all members of staff give brilliant service so it's always a pleasure to return.

I'm already planning a few trips for next year. I was wondering whether to review because I don't want others to go there !",5,2019,12,07
137,Simply....WOW!!,"What a hotel, what an amazing experience, what wonderful service! My partner and I decided to stay here recently as were in London to celebrate our anniversary and are glad that this was the place we choose.

Everything about the stay was amazing! We was even upgraded to the conservatory suite which was stunning and like nothing we'd ever stayed in before.

My one minor tiny complain is that there was no salt or pepper in the shakers we were given with our breakfast in the morning and feel this should have been checked first however like i said, tiny, minor complaint.

Now that we have stayed at 41, the bar has well and truly been set and will certainly be returning next time we are in London to our now favourite hotel.

Keep up the good work!!",5,2019,12,05
137,Small hotel with a big heart,An exceptional small hotel with a big heart. From arrival to departure we were greeted by name and with wonderful service from every staff member that we met. There was lots of little treats and surprises throughout our stay. We enjoyed a great big breakfast that kept us going all day until returning back to the hotel and the snack bar! Then some lovely canapes with a cocktail before heading off for dinner. The bedroom had everything that we required and more. Our two night stay was not long enough to enjoy all that the hotel has to offer.,5,2019,12,03
137,A perfect 10! 100% Simply the best,"This wonderful hotel consistently gets the most wonderful reviews and every one of them
Is deserved. It’s difficult to know where to start. There are so many lovely touches. Check in is done with a glass of complimentary champagne to hand. 

The rooms in their signature blend of black and white are stunning, elegant and comfortable. There are lovely toiletries in generous quantities. The Executive lounge is a beautiful place to sit with a wide range of complimentary food throughout the day / evening. The staff are all wonderful!!!

Everything is thought of and everything is perfect. I came back after an evening meeting to find my bathroom candle lit and a hot water bottle in my bed. From a business perspective- my desk drawer was fully stocked. Little things mean a lot. I’ve already booked my next stay.",5,2019,12,01
137,Where everybody knows your name 🎶,The London Series! Could not have picked a more appropriate Hotel for a hospitable stay in London. The moment you enter - the greeting is amiable and professional. Followed by a personal check-in with champagne service. All very nice - but what is more impressive is the personal attention to detail that is afforded each guest by each member of the staff. This type of service encourages a friendly atmosphere that makes one want to revisit! So I am planning another trip with my husband so he can experience “plunder the pantry “ at midnight! PS the location is fabulous.,5,2019,12,01
137,"Distinguished Service, Exceptional Accommodations and Historic Location","We made our yearly pilgrimage to London to celebrate our 30th anniversary and wanted an exceptional hotel. We have stayed with the Red Carnation family before and wanted to have a special experience for this trip so Hotel 41 was our choice. Hotel 41 exceeded our expectations. The location across from Royal Mews, Buckingham Palace and short walk to Victoria Tube and Train station was convenient to numerous historical and tourist spots as well as many dinning options.
The breakfast at the hotel offered many options and the kitchen was very accommodating to our request. The afternoon scone and snack bar provide a quick pick me up and the English tea choice made for a nice afternoon break. 
The room accommodation where truly 5 star. From the plush bedding, heated bath towels, fire place lit every evening for us and hot water bottle placed in the bed before we retired for the night made our stay exceptional.

The service from the entire staff was at an exceptional level. They even made a special booklet for my wife on antiques shops around London.",5,2019,11,30

F&B including IRD : 2.5/5
Housekeeping of Hotel: 5/5

Amenities: 

Love the entrance to this hotel, very discreet. Really comfortable rooms with a lot of amenities of offer. What set them apart was their service, thoroughly consistent throughout our stay. Room for improvement in f&b though. Again very good location.",5,2019,11,29
137,Truly amazing experience,"We stayed at hotel 41 for an extended weekend and it is simply the best hotel I have ever stayed at. Their service, kindness and willingness to make our stay just perfect was top notch. I have never experienced anything like it. We will definitely be back again next year. Many thanks to the entire staff for a truly amazing experience.",5,2019,11,27
137,Very special! In a positive way... ,"Stayed here for a weekend. Kind of discreet entrance. You take the elevator to the fifth floor, where all rooms and a wonderfully traditional lounge, including reception desk, bar and snack buffet, are located. Very attentive and friendly staff everywhere. It feels like being at somebody’s home, in a very positive sense. We had a junior suite, mezzanine style, which we really liked. Traditional interiors with a quirky touch. Well equipped in all aspects. Impeccable service. Only reason for rating 4/5 and not 5/5, is that the price level is high, also with London standards... Guess we would stay here again though... ",4,2019,11,27
137,Weekend in London,"Because of extremely high ratings on TA my sister and I decided to stay in hotel 41 during a recent weekend in London.
Location of the hotel is convenient, close to a tube station. First welcome was very pleasant, and introduction to the hotel facilities was informative completed with a glass of champane.
A room was comfortable, with everything you can wish including a plate of frutes  and sweets.
Breakfast had a great variety of hot choices but we missed fresh vegetables on cold meniu. Keeping in mind that it is a 5 star hotel, a glass of proseco or champane would be a must during a breakfast.
I would not consider very professional to serve toast with eggs and pancakes by breakfast staff at the same time because a second dish became cold until I start eating it.
Staff of tha hotel in general was rather formal especially during evening meals.
In general we had nice stay but not that much better than in another lower class hotels where we stayed in London before (Montague on the Gardens etc). 
I would not choose this hotel for my next visits to London.",3,2019,11,22
137,The best,"We have traveled to many hotels and thought we had great service and amenities. But Hotel 41 has topped them all. The staff is considerate and helpful and welcoming, every. day. Not a day went by without them doing a multitude of things that made our stay even more perfect. They go 100% on anything and everything.  We cannot wait to return there. I wouldn’t consider staying at any other hotel in London.",5,2019,11,22
137,Great Hotel,Very special boutique hotel... terrific location for most activities.. staff couldn't be more helpful and welcoming... we stayed here a number of years ago and it was wonderful then and has not changed! Would highly recommend!,5,2019,11,19
137,Attention to detail ,"This hotel’s attention to detail is impeccable. On entering you are met by a lovely smell as well as a friendly person at the desk. 
You’re introduced to the reception area & a welcoming glass of champagne. 
Our room was beautiful! They have thought  of everything you may need (I won’t ruin your lovely surprise) 
The bath & shower - could’ve stayed in their for hours. 
The bed - stunning & so comfy and were turned down (won’t ruin surprise number 2) 
In the evening there’s delicious food available ....
I only have one criticism & that is with the reception being on the 5th floor, this is where you eat. I felt I was imposing on people eating their breakfast and when it was our turn to eat, we felt we were being ‘watched’.
Would I stay here again? Absolutely! 

",5,2019,11,17
137,WOW! This is just a fantastic and special hotel,"Firstly the location is ideal for London Eye, Westminster etc but as soon as you walk through the door you enter somewhere very unique and charming.  Staff so helpful and genuine, rooms the most comfortable we have every stayed in, and the fire burning blissfully away when you come in from the cold was very welcoming. The only hotel I have been in where a hot water bottle is put in the bed with his/her slippers by the side.The executive lounge offers a very fine choice of wine and spirits as well as beers and soft drinks.  The ambience of the room encourages you to just wind down and relax, horderves and snacks in abundance throughout the day and evening.  Breakfast menu offered something for everyone and you could even add your choice of what you wanted.  The standard of food, presentation, taste was faultless, we were never rushed but all our needs and requests were covered.  I could go on and on but suffice to say this hotel is a gem and we will definitely return as soon as we can.  You are made to feel special and welcomed, hats off to all the staff and management.  10/10 from us.",5,2019,11,16
137,We enjoyed a three night stay at the 41,"It is a unique botique hotel that has a great location accross from Buckingham Palace. It is within walking distance to many of the historical sites in London. The Hotel itself is very comfortable and we had a two level suite, sitting room below and bedroom above. Plenty of space for the two of us. 'There was an executive room for snacks and drinks. The staff was excellent and provided friendly and fast service. It was a great stay.",5,2019,11,16
137,Fantastic,As this hotel won best hotel in London we booked it for our anniversary as a treat.   But with such great reviews I had high expectations and I was not disappointed.  It is the best hotel we have ever stayed in.  Yes it’s a considered purchase but omg it’s worth it.  Small things like a hot water bottle in your bed make such an enjoyable stay.  We are looking to make this our annual anniversary celebration,5,2019,11,14
137,Exceptional!,"The service was simply exceptional. 

Friendly, attentive, proactive, generous, warm, welcoming and with great attention to details. The executive lounge has an amazing vibe, warm yet luxurious, rich but not overwhelming, intimate though you still feel part of the scene. And the treats... they just keep flowing in. In 3 words - above and beyond!

The room is great. Filled with all the amenities one might want. Super comfortable bed and pillows, slippers, good A/C, sound proof, separate bath and shower, big and soft towels, robes, very dark when your turn off the lights, choice of morning papers, sweet treats, espresso machine and water (still and sparkling). Seriously, not much can be improved.

Well done.",5,2019,11,12
137,Anniversary ,"We stayed here for two nights on this occasion because one didn’t feel enough last time, on our next visit we hope to stay for three!

We can not recommend this hotel enough from the glorious decor to the wonderfully friendly, helpful and attentive team of professionals who work here to make your every moment as relaxing and enjoyable as humanly possible.

From the welcome glass of champagne at check in to the delicious complimentary range of food offered at various times of the day, Hotel 41 try to make you feel at home (if you lived in such a beautiful place!) and with all the effort put in by the fabulous team they certainly succeed! We couldn’t dream of living a real everyday life like this although I’m sure some of their guests are this lucky but the main reason it works so well is how unpretentious it is - everyone is treated with equal importance and in such a friendly way that it really makes your visit an absolute joy! 

We love it! Enough said!!",5,2019,11,12
137,Birthday celebrations,"Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic - says it all. This hotel goes above and beyond. Cannot recommend this hotel enough for service, attention to detail, comfort and style. The hotel went out of its way to make our stay for birthday celebrations so special. A particular mention to Andrew & Steven for their attentiveness and enjoyable company. I particularly liked my hot water bottle in my bed when we arrived back from the theatre -little touches like these make this such a stand out hotel.  Thank you again everyone at hotel 41.",5,2019,11,11
137,"Super friendly , highly professional oasis in central London","This property is superbly situated near theatre and Buckingham palace and although is in the heart of the city is very calm and quiet.
The staff are amazing , warm and friendly but impeccable service and great attention to detail.  Taking time to find out special requests like transportation , bar service to the room etc . Everything arrived on time and in good order and they were lovely touches to like and honesty bar snack buffet and even hot water bottle in your bed when you arrive back at the end of the night. All in all great service and would definitely stay here again if I was needing to stay in central London!",5,2019,11,07
137,Amazing stay from start to finish,We have stayed in some amazing hotels all over the world. Not only is this hotel a beautiful find not to be missed with great food and complimentary snacks. I can honestly say this the customer service and overall standard of service in general for this hotel was the best I have ever experienced not only in 5 star hotels in the uk . (We usually stay in the savoy or the shard) But I would go as far as to say the best on a overall all international level. From the second we arrived to the second we left. We had 24/7 service of the highest standard from everyone we met. Special mention to Andrew who went above and beyond to make our stay extra special and his professionalism along with his people skills was one of the main reasons I am writing this review. I can not recommend this place enough and must say it’s the amazing team that are priceless to this hotel. Thank you all we will be back :),5,2019,11,05
137,Delightful,Staying at this hotel is like surrendering yourself to the ministrations of an attentive Nanny. You feel cosseted and cared for without being smothered. Just lovely. The staff are uniformly kind and intuitive and I can not recommend more highly,5,2019,11,05
137,The best home from home.,"Decided to break our “stay at the Savoy” tradition and try a new establishment ...

I’m not one who leaves reviews often, stayed at many five starts throughout the world...  this one deserves my comment.

From the friendly greeting to the hospitality from start to finish. The staff could not do enough.

We had the conservatory suite... beautiful duplex arrangement more than satisfied me. 

The “executive lounge” sat by the fire with tip top service and array of canapés, drinks and friendly conversation in the most beautifully ambience ...

Particular mention to Andrew, he was an amazing host and the most engaging conversationalist.

I know where I am staying from now on each time I am in town... 

Can not recommend enough. 

It is also worth a mention that I have unwittingly stayed in a Red Carnation property before... Ashford Castle.

For me it would seem that the brand in itself screams luxury and “going the extra mile”... from now on I will look for red carnation properties wherever I may be visiting in future.

137,Narnia is Hiding in London,"Behind a door on Buckingham Palace Road is a hidden world of calm, sophisticated luxury. Part of me wants to tell you about it, and part of me would like it to remain a secret! Hotel 41 is as wonderful as everyone says it is: a place to hide away from the busy noise of the city; a place where the service is unparalleled; a place where nothing is too much trouble; a place to tell your friends about (especially friends who you think deserve to have a wonderful few days in a magical world tucked away behind a simple glass panelled door).",5,2019,10,27
137,Simple amazing. Simple perfect. Amazing perfect hotel. Must see,"Not sure how I can express in words how amazing this hotel is in London. Of course I found it on Trip Advisor. And they have rarely steered me wrong. From the moment we walked in, we knew it would be magical. Greeted with a glass of champagne. Exceptional service. Amazing location. Simply perfect. They were on point from the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out. The person checking us in (forgot his name, young male) made us feel at home, took extensive time to explain London and where to go and even gave his own point of few. We have the privilege of staying in the Master Suite. If you can do that, do it! Two story suite with a glass roof. Perfect. Thank you for making this London experience unforgettable. ",5,2019,10,25
137,A hidden gem,"Hotel 41 was recommended by a very good friend Eddie and I can’t thank him enough. 
We were greeted with smiles and excellent hospitality throughout our stay for our anniversary. On arrival glasses of rose champagne were offered and thankfully consumed. A delicious cake and sweets were awaiting along with a card from management. There are many good restaurants around too and when we returned back from a delicious Lebanese dinner nearby, the fireplace was on, nicely heating the room and a hot water bottle ready, making the homely feel even more enjoyable.
The continental breakfast in the morning was delicious with lots of choices on offer. Staff in the lounge were always nearby ensuring that everything was impeccable. 
This is a must stay hotel for couples looking for relaxed atmosphere, with very helpful staff members, in a great central location. It was a wonderful stay and exceeded our expectations. A must see gem of London...",5,2019,10,23
137,Sublime hospitality!,"I must admit that as far as a boutique hotel is concerned I don't think you can do much to improve this hotel.  The service from the time of check in is simply sublime from start to finish.   

We were upgraded to a suite as a start and the value-add's just do not end, another dimension which makes it no surprise for their #1 rating on Trip Advisor.  From the executive lounge greeting with some bubbly, the whenever/whatever button in your room, the 24/7 treat room, to the handpicked list of whisky bars left in our room there is simply no end to the staff going the extra mile for guests.  The guest services team at the desks in the lounge are remarkable.

Truly at the top of the top when it comes to guest services and warm hospitality. 

My only criticism would be the concierge services / street side front of house for Hotel 41.  They could learn a lot from their sister hotel, The Milestone, different league all together.   

Absolute respect for the Group passing on the information from one hotel to the next that I was a whisky lover.  Well done Red Carnation!",5,2019,10,22
137,"Fantastic stay, outstanding service!!","The reviews aren’t wrong, the service at Hotel 41 is outstanding. I stay in lots of very nice hotels throughout the year, all over the world and very rarely go out of my way to write a review. I couldn’t help myself with Hotel 41!

My wife and I checked in on Thursday and stayed until Sunday without the kids for a romantic, relaxing break. 

The hotel is located near Buckingham palace which is close enough to most things.

Upon check in we were helped up to the executive lounge, you are greeted with a glass of fiz ( so nice we have order a crate full! )

The staff make this hotel so special, David did a great job of welcoming you, checking you in, showing you to your room and making you feel comfortable. The ‘whenever/whatever’ button in your room does exactly what it says..... if you need anything, they will get it for you ( unless they have not already thought about it for you )

Steve, Dean and Andrew in the executive room are fantastic, very personable and professional, they did an amazing job of keeping us hydrated!!!! excellent recommendations with food choices and drinks and made sure our classes were never empty.  

Breakfast service and food is exceptional 

Sadly I didn’t catch the name of the person who kept our room looking so tidy, ( room 4127 ) every night candles were lit, hot water bottles left in the bed and wine put on ice. What more could you ask for after a hard day....

The only risk of staying at this hotel is that you will not get to see much of London because you will not want to leave....  ",5,2019,10,20
137,"Hotel is truly a gem, but the location may hinder us staying there again","Full disclosure - London is my favourite city in the world to visit, and I travel there a few times a year both on business and pleasure.

We decided to stay at Hotel 41 as I was intrigued by its high rating, and I have stayed in one of its ""sister hotels"" in Geneva which was spectacular.  Typically I stay at the Langham due to service, rooms and location.

The pros:
- small hotel with personalized highly attentive service
- seems to have high staff to guest ratio
- for London, the guest rooms, including the bathrooms were generous in size
- the room itself had great linens, etc.
- we were always greeted with a warm smile; I find that in many luxury hotels in London the staff is more sterile, even if pleasant
- in advance of your stay you are sent a form so that they know how to make up your room to your personal preferences
- the 24/7 treat room was great.  Every night I popped in there to get some vanilla gelato which was wonderful

The cons
- the location is on a main road literally right across from the Buckingham Palace mews.   So the location wasn't great.  But I think in this case, beauty would be in the eye of the beholder.  I like staying in Mayfair, Marylebone and Belgravia, and the immediate area surrounding the hotel did not have a nice ""neighborhood feel"".
- I walked in front of Buckingham Palace every day and then through Green Park to get to a gym.  It sounds wonderful, but there were multiple events going on, including the Queen needing to go to Westminster, so roads ended up being blocked here there and everywhere.  And if you were trying to get back to the hotel close to 11:00 am at the changing of the guard - forget it - you will need to take the long way around.
- I was travelling for pleasure that weekend, so I didn't need to ""test this"", but I don't get the impression they would be able to cater to the needs of business travellers as well as some of the other high end hotels in the city.

All in all we had a very pleasant stay and the staff - particularly Maria and Helena - were beyond wonderful.   I just wish that this hotel was located a bit further west or a tad further north.",5,2019,10,19
137,Hotel 41 is Amazing,"We stayed at Hotel 41 in October 2019 in London and it was fantastic.  The rooms and Executive Lounge are beautiful.
But the best thing about Hotel 41 is the wonderful employees - they made our stay fantastic.  We asked them at the last minute to see if they could locate a wheelchair for my mom on a Sunday morning.  Initially they had no luck since all the places were either already rented out or closed since it was Sunday.  But they kept trying and the called our room  about 15 minutes later saying they had located a wheelchair at one of their sister properties and they were going to have it sent over in a taxi!
This made our stay in London that much more special.
We will definitely stay at Hotel 41 on our next visit to London.",5,2019,10,18
137,Exquisite Hotel,"This is an excellent Boutique Hotel. From the moment I was checked in until I left, everyone tried their best to make my stay memorable. I truly enjoyed my stay at Hotel 41. Magdalena at the welcome desk was very helpful and friendly. A bubbly upon check in was a nice touch.

Will I come back, you bet!",5,2019,10,18
137,Best Hotel in London,"We stay at Hotel 41 every time we visit London and it's clear why the instant we enter the hotel. The service is impeccable - from the champagne arrival to the personal touches on the turndown service to the fact that every staff member knows your name. On this trip we want to personally thank Steve Jones, Alex, Mitchell, and the Night Manager Vladis who helped make this stay as incredible as every other one we've had at the hotel.",5,2019,10,18
137,SIMPLY THE BEST!,"The title of my review speaks for itself - Hotel 41 is Simply the Best.  Of all the places we have stayed in the world Hotel 41 still rates as the best for service, beautifully appointed rooms, very friendly staff, fantastic breakfasts, plunder-the-pantry treats and overall such a wonderful place to stay.  This is our fifth stay with Hotel 41 and every time we arrive here it is like a haven to us.  The hotel is close to Victoria Station, Buckingham Palace, the Mall and overall it is such a great place to stay and be within walking distance of a lot of attractions in London.  We must thank Magdalena once again for her thoughtfulness & kindness - she is an asset to Hotel 41. It is the small things that make a difference like acknowledging special occasions that make Hotel 41 so special. The High Tea we experienced was amazing - we all loved it.  Thank you once again - we will be back when next in London.",5,2019,10,12
137,Best Hotel Stave Ever!,"We arrived and were greeted downstairs warmly even though we were a bit early for check in.  Everyone was so attentive, it was better than any service we have had, and we have stayed at some very nice places.  I think the small size of the hotel adds to the ambiance and the staff was absolutely amazing! My wife had a bit of a cold and they offered cough sweets/drops and brought a humidifier to the room.  The best feature of the hotel is the button on your phone which reads, ""Whatever/Whenever"".  Meaning the staff are on call for you all the time.  Great stay!",5,2019,10,12
137,Hotel 41 A Step Above the Rest,"It starts from the moment you walk through the doors and are greeted by the recptionist. You ae then personaly escorted to the private elevator to the 5th floor. A glass of champagne awaits you and you are given a tour of their outstanding lounge. Complimentary snacks and water are provided during the day and thoughout the day. Complimentary hot food snacks are provided during the evening. The rooms have everything you can imagine and are beautifully decorated. The staff of the entire hotel must have been trained by the best because they go way beyond in seeing that your every wish is granted. We had snacks in the Leopard Lounge and that is definitely worth a visit. Angelo does a superb job as host and server. We had the Champagne Saber Presentation and it was quite entertaining. The Red Carnation also owns the pub/restaurant, ""bbar"", next door and we sat at a window seat and had drinks for two hours. We were fortunate to see the owners of Red Carnation, Mr. and Mrs. Tollman, having lunch at the same pub. Hotle 41 is rather pricey but if you can afford it, it is well worth the price.",5,2019,10,10
137,The perfect Hotel,"We stayed here for one night and were treated like royalty the entire time. 

The staff went beyond what is expected at even a luxury hotel like this. 

The pantry is fantastic,  great selection of a variety of food.

5 star all the way. ",5,2019,10,08
137,Hotel 41... ..Not living up to expectations or reviews,". This hotel had been on my to do bucket list for years !The first evening we received the much reviewed Executive Lounge service with appetizers and evening canape's. We also got the tea service and were looked after there as well.  
 . The Executive Lounge service ended after the first evening. We got the tea again both of the other nights and our table was never cleared nor did anyone come back to our table for anything. We noticed that everyone in the lounge was offered appetizers and canape's but us. The attendant seemed to be watching us and we felt somewhat uncomfortable.  I had to go to the station and ask if I could order a champagne. When the attendant came to our table with the glass of champagne he walked off and left all the dishes which had been there over an hour . He never asked us if we wanted anything else at all. I thought that the morning offerings on the station were part of the 41 complimentary spread. I spent 22 GBP for a sliver of ham and found out that it was all a charge. The website should be clear that everything in the morning is for charge. The only morning that we dined there the attendant never came back to the table and I only got one cup of coffee...never asked if I wanted a refill . Much much better service at the Club Intercontinental and I cannot even compare the two. 
All in all the hotel was okay but did not live up to expectations and I would choose another venue on the next trip to London. As they say "" Been there and done that .""",3,2019,10,04
137,We didn’t want to leave,"This was our first trip to London and definitely not the last. Hotel 41 was a big part of why we enjoyed our trip so much. The service was outstanding and everyone we encountered was pleasant and professional. The hotel was spotlessly clean. We stayed in both a junior suite and an executive king suite and both were wonderful. The nights we spent at Hotel 41 were the best night’s sleep we had while on our European vacation. The hotel is quiet and posh.

The Executive Lounge was the stuff dreams are made of. Imagine the library of a very classy British millionaire, then staff it with wonderful employees and add a rotating selection of delicious complimentary foods. It was my dream and my happy place. 

It is more pricey than what you could pay, but for the quality of sleep and service, I actually feel like you get a lot for your money here. If you’re in London, this place is worth a stay. 

Thank you everyone at Hotel 41! We’ll be back, just not soon enough.",5,2019,10,02
137,Deserves to be #1!,"My husband an me stayed for 5 nights in the hotel and it was one the best experiences of our  lives! 
The Observatory room  was the loviest with obsessive attention for details: a nice fireplace, an incredible glass roof, and amazing bathroom with the best amenities. Every night a special surprise was waiting for us on the bed (cookies, eyecream, home spray, etc)
The Executive lounge was fantastic, 24 hour first class service, with elaborates Cold and Hot dishes. 
And the staff was simply the best, we have no words to thank the attention of David, Magdalen, Enric and also Malcolm for all the caring. 
The location is very good with tube and buses stops nearby.
We’ve been in London several times, but Hotel 41 is our definitive address for now on!",5,2019,10,01
137,Ridiculously impeccable,"Service, service, service.  It's like having your own apartment near Buckingham Palace.  The rooms are small, but very well-appointed, and having Stefan to greet you in the evening is like having your own personal Jeeves.  ",5,2019,10,01
137,"Exceeded expectations, a truly magical place to stay !","Of our entire 4 week holiday throughout the UK and France, Hotel 41 was by far our favourite place to stay. Considering this was not the most expensive of the hotels we stayed in, it far exceeded any of the others in superior service and friendliness. At all times we felt completely at home, looked after and treated to a level of thoughtfulness and personalised attention that is unfaultable. We look forward to our return to this wonderful place!",5,2019,09,26
137,Exquisite hotel with outstanding service!,This was our first trip to London and we will definitely come back to stay at Hotel 41.  We were treated like royalty from the moment we arrived after an overnight flight.    Staff greet you by name and take every opportunity to make your stay unforgettable. Our room was clean and made-up every evening just like on a cruise ship.  The breakfast was amazing and the evening free canapes and sandwiches in the lounge still inspire cravings!  We loved this hotel and its great location.,5,2019,09,22
137,Even better than I expected!,"I’ve read a lot about this hotel and have wanted to stay for a while, It surpassed all my expectations, beautiful hotel and as all the other reviews say, first class staff. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. We loved it.",5,2019,09,22
137,My Husband is Now a Believer ,"I read hundreds of Hotel 41 reviews when we were planning our London vacation. Trip Advisor has never steered us wrong...so I proposed this 5 star hotel.  My husband was reluctant. Was the expense truly worth it? It’s a fantastic area of London (quick walk to Victoria station transportation hub), but there were cheaper options. We booked and hoped it was the right decision. They won my husband over the moment we arrived.  Very tired after 10+ hours of travel - there was no long check-in line at a counter. We were escorted to a comfortable sofa and served champagne and gorgeous snacks. Paperwork was brought to us.  During our entire stay this same caring, superior service was evident. The staff are amazing and truly do treat you like royalty.  The Executive Lounge became a little second home after long days of touring the city. Yes the ‘plunder the pantry’ is as fantastic as it sounds. A family member who saw one of my social media posts said it looked like we were staying in a mystery novel drawing room. At the end of our 6 night stay my husband asked for a list of all the Red Carnation properties. We definitely plan on returning and visiting some of their other hotels.  ",5,2019,09,22
137,THE place to stay in London,"Small, charming, friendly and just down the street from Buckingham palace. Enough free buffets that you don't need to leave the hotel for meals. Rooms are decent size for Europe and kept spotless. They will pick you up and deliver you to LHR in a most comfortable S class Mercedes for a reasonable fee.",5,2019,09,18
137,Best ever hotel ,"Stayed in the conservatory suite for three nights on there stay one night free offer.as has been said by so many people this place is amazing.the suite is lovely on two levels and with everything you could possibly want and luxury toiletries.you feel at home from the moment you arrive sipping complimentary champagne and snacks while the staff take the time to engage with you and get to know your likes and needs,love everything about it as it is a peaceful haven amongst the business of central London.the Leopard Bar next door is also worth a mention with a great champagne menu and a lovely female jazz singer.back to the hotel though it is so good that i have cancelled a November booking i had at another top hotel & am returning here instead.thanks for looking after my wife and i so brilliantly you are a great hotel and deserving of your number one status",5,2019,09,14
137,A gem.,"There are not enough superlatives to describe this gem just a few blocks from Buckingham Palace.  The room decor and attention to detail are outstanding.  Food quality and variety in the lounge is excellent.  But what really sets Hotel 41 apart is the warm personal service.  You know when hospitality staff is faking it, and they definitely are not faking it here.  The smiles are genuine and the warmth radiates from everyone.  They are like a family taking care of family.  By day 2, everyone knew our names.  This is the best hotel my wife and I have ever visited, and we will definitely be returning.",5,2019,09,14
137,Second time but hopefully not the last.,"I really love this hotel. I visited them for the first timed in May 2018 and also last week. This hotel really made serious damage, because when I stay at other hotels, can not help but compare. The 41 has set the benchmark very high. I was very happy to see that the same staff was present since my first visit. This alone tells me that is very likely that the staff are happy to work there and there is no personal turnover like most places. The hotel is great, the location too, but the staff it what really makes the difference. I enjoyed talking to everyone of them, part of this trips is about meeting people and see their work. I always learn a little something from everyone. That is why traveling is an enriching experience. I want to thank all of those who were involved during our stay, I know I did not get to learn everyone by their names. I enjoyed talking with Lauren and David. Also Gabriel took very good care of me and wife when we were at the lounge and enjoyed meeting him. Paula and Marlen where very kind too. I convinced my wife to return to England only to be able to purchase the hotel scent that was not available for purchase during 2018 and can not be mailed because of the restrictions. I am sure that when I run out of aroma sprays will return to buy some more. What they do there is great and thank you again for such a great experience and setting the benchmark for greatness so high. Nandor",5,2019,09,10
137,Superb boutique hotel,"There is a reason this has been the #1 hotel in London for so many years.  I think the staff has a lot do do with it, particularly the younger staff and the concierge help.

We enjoyed Maria and Mateo!  There was an older gentleman in charge of the afternoon lounge service that was more than a bit stuffy and just did not seen to fit in with the rest of the smiling faces that we saw there.

It is VERY quiet, rooms have great air conditioning, the bed was extremely comfortable, the breakfast buffet was excellent.

For a peaceful, high service stay I am not sure you could do much better.",5,2019,09,09
137,These are a few of my favourite things,"I  have stayed at the Burj in Dubai & the Versace in Australia but hotels in London have been commonplace TILL NOW.
Why should U stay at Hotel 41?
It depends on yr priorities. If u want to beuh treated  like a queen or king & staff who are eager to indulge yr every whim come here.Let me elucidate.

My husband was seriously I'll & was only able to eat normally since March.When I told  the hotel  he loved cornbeef they incorporated it in the canapes. .U get a glass of champagne on arrival.There are canapes at 5pm  snacks available all day.
A hot meal salad & dessert  in plunder the pantry from 8.30 to 1am.
When our transfer failed to materialize a staff member rang the company & then went round the back to find the transfer driver asleep.

Another staff member organized our hop on hop off tickets for Edinburgh
I got the impression if I wanted the moon some member of staff wd travel in a space module & get it for me!
I come from a service industry & my standards are high & my tongue quite barbed. However here there is nothing to criticize!. Iam a dessert fan & I can say yr customer service is pavlova  bannoffee & eton's mess all rolled into one.
As a result of this dream experience we have decided  to forego a party for my 60th next yr & return to hotel 41 for 2 nights.
Thank you seems so inadequate.Suffice to say I hope the joy u bring others boomerangs back to you.

137,Husband and wife,Was absolutely fabulous. Great room decor top notch staff impeccable and food pantry fun to raid. Will return again in future location handy to central London restaurants at sister properties excellent and Gabriel made great kahlaha coffee according to wife,5,2019,09,05
137,It Doesn't Get Any Better Than 41,"Spent 3 nights here before a four week North Atlantic cruise.  I have stayed at a lot of hotels in my lifetime.  Without a doubt, this was the VERY BEST.  If you need a hotel in London, stay here.  Stayed at the Jefferson Hotel in Washington DC a few years ago.  That was great, 41 was way above that.  Very small hotel, everyone knows your name, not stuffy at all.  Totally excellent customer service from the entire staff.  Super clean and plenty of room in Room 1.  If I ever make it back to London, I will not have to look at any other websites, other than 41.  London was a blast, 41 was in a great location and even booked events and transportation, including picking up at LHR.",5,2019,09,05
137,Wonderful Hotel Amazing Staff,"Beautiful hotel, the staff is incredibly helpful- our driver the hotel arranged Eddie was amazing, he took us everywhere in the English countryside we wanted to get to and we were so comfortable in the beautiful Mercedes car we rode in, and he was very friendly.",5,2019,09,04
137,Exception Luxury & Service,"My husband and I spent Labor Day Weekend at Hotel 41 and could not have been more pleased! Every detail was carefully orchestrated, from champagne upon arrival (or mimosas in our case as it was 8AM :-), to a luxurious pillow menu, to unique goodies left on our bed at turndown service. The staff were lovely and incredibly accommodating and we could not get enough of the lounge/pantry. As is clearly a theme throughout all reviews, the hotel prides itself on offering delicious bites and an extensive wine/cocktail list throughout the day and late into the night - which we found ourselves enjoying post midnight more than once! It was such a treat to return to the hotel and feel right at home and this speaks to the lack of pretension associated with such high standards and such well regarded service. 

The location cannot be beat and was a perfect jumping off point to walk to different sites around London. Whether it be a walk through St. James Park, a quick jaunt to Buckingham Palace, a leisurely stroll along the birdcage walk....the options are endless.

With its stunning interior, delightful toiletry products, charming in-room touches (like a whatever, whenever button on the telephone) this is a top notch hotel and one we can't wait to return to on our next trip to London!

Pro Tip -- in the warmer months, they have an incredible roof deck/bar. I only wish we'd had more time to enjoy it!",5,2019,09,04
137,Exceptional Experience,Upon check in we were greeted with a variety of Champagnes to choose a glass from.  This set the tone for our entire stay.  Everyone there gave us spectacular service!There was fruit and chocolates in the room.  The cocktails in the afternoon were unique and delicious. The accompanying appetizers were wonderful.  This was the best service we've experienced in over 40 years of traveling!,5,2019,09,03
137,Best hotel experience of my life,"I stayed at Hotel 41 for four nights in August and let me tell you, Hotel 41 has it all. Perfect location, wonderful staff, great food, and the hotel itself has a luxurious vibe that makes you miss it when you’re away. And I’m accustomed to staying at 5 star locales like The Palace in St. Moritz, the Four Seasons, and the Mandarin Oriental. 

I usually don’t enjoy hanging out at my hotel but the lobby is so inviting, I found myself hanging out there instead of the local restaurants or pubs. They have tasty free snacks at all hours and after 8 they have dinner (also free). When I stayed they had this delicious chicken curry that I would have gladly paid for. They also had a fantastic breakfast which was included in my stay. You can get a traditional English Breakfast that is fairly substantial. I ordered it twice during my stay and could never finish it. 

And don’t even get me started on the their Afternoon Tea. I’ve had Afternoon Tea before at The Plaza in New York and Hotel 41 is far better, not only in quality but attention to detail and a personal touch you will only get from quality boutique hotels. Did I mention that Afternoon Tea service was was also included in my stay? Hotel 41 is truly and absolutely deserving of their #1 rating in the London. I can’t wait to stay their again. I’d like to quickly thank Stefan, Paula, Victoria, Erica, and the rest of the staff for making my stay so perfect. You guys are awesome!",5,2019,08,29
137,My second stay even better than the first!,"I was here 5 years ago and wrote  glowing review. Since then it is even better! The staff is still over the top amazing! Everyone knows your name within minutes arrival! Order once and they know your coffee and wine desires and anticipate your needs. 
The hotel is beautiful and QUIET! the rooms are the quietest city hotel rooms I have ever experienced.
My husband had a back injury and they did everything in their power to make him more comfortable.
This is the ONLY place I will ever stay in London. Wow!!
For USA travelers, you can book through Costco travel and get tour credits, hotel transfers, a dinner, etc. I think next time I will book straight with the hotel. The tour company is not very good... and Uber is available from LHR now. I would avoid 'Golden Tours'
Also location is ideal, as mentioned by everyone else!",5,2019,08,27
137,Best hotel in london!!,"Visited Hotel 41 in a Junior Suite for two nights in Feb and loved every single part of the stay. The pantry, attention to detail, friendly staff and general atmosphere in the hotel is unrivalled. Can’t wait to stay again!",5,2019,08,27
137,Wonderful hotel and staff,"The hotel is great. Location right across from Buckingham Palace and the theater.  Underground station right nearby.  The best thing about the hotel for my wife and I was the staff!  Every single one of the staff made it their goal to make our stay the best they could!  We have never stayed in a hotel, and have traveled the world, that had staff accomplish this so successfully. Any return to London, we will be staying there. ",5,2019,08,24
137,Consistently Lovely!,"After many visits, I continue to be impressed by this hotel and its staff! The hotel and my room were beautiful and comfortable, as always. I also appreciate the location and how conveniently located it is to all of the attractions and locations that I love to explore. However, I call this my home away from home while in London because of the staff. They are such a welcoming, professional, and caring group. I truly appreciate being welcomed in such a warm manner during my stay. The staff goes out of their way to accommodate any requests. Maria and the team were very helpful in fulfilling a unique food request that I had and worked to figure out the best option for the food items I needed to carry with me back on my flight for a work event. They truly went above and beyond their already impeccable level of service and I cannot wait to return during my next trip to London!
",5,2019,08,19
137,Wonderful,"No reason to be sceptical about this Trip Advisor recommendation. Hotel 41 is every bit as nice as you would hope. The location isn't even the best part, although who could mind living meters away from The Royals. The Staff is the reason 41 gets its well-deserved rave. From the first greeting at street level, through your final farewell, the personnel know your needs, and anticipate your desires. We had a most delicious slice of chocolate cake, in recognition of our recent anniversary,  awaiting our room arrival, as well as tickets to that night's Proms at The Royal Albert Hall (all pre-arranged by The Hotel.)
Our room and bath, away from the bustle below, were extremely comfortable. Our breakfast was first class. Kudos to Magdelena at Reception and Paula for their personalized attention. We hope to return.",5,2019,08,17
137,My all-time favorite hotel,"I’d been fortunate enough to stay at Hotel 41 15 years ago on a mother-daughter trip with my 23 year old daughter. I knew if I ever returned to London, I’d be staying at 41. My husband and I visited in early July, 2019 and both loved every minute. The staff become like friends if you choose to spend time with them. We did. We enjoyed breakfasts, afternoon tea, drinks on the rooftop and plundering the pantry and many a fascinating conversation. Although all the staff was terrific, we especially want to mention Stefan, Osi, David and Mitch. 
Our room was so comfortable and chic. I did not want to leave. Don’t walk, run to this hotel. ",5,2019,08,13
137,Wow!  This is the place to stay!,"From the moment you walk into Hotel 41 you will be impressed.  The decor, service and accommodations will not disappoint.  With only 28 rooms you feel like you are in your own private club.  This was one of the highlights of my trip.",5,2019,08,11
137,Fabulous experience overall- Staff was amazing and Location was perfect,"From the moment we arrived we were treated  like valued guests. The location is ideal... walking distance to everything we wanted to do and the staff were amazing, gracious and professional. We will definitely return . A special thank you to Stefan- we look forward to seeing you again soon",5,2019,08,08
137,Incredible customer service,"This boutique luxury hotel is uniquely situated on the 5th floor of an older building across the street from Buckingham palace.  The staff welcomes guests with champagne at check-in.  We celebrated our 25th anniversary during our stay, and were surprised to find a cake in our room for the occasion.  The hotel recommendation of Rules restaurant for our anniversary dinner was perfect.  You can’t beat the personal service you receive at Hotel 41.",5,2019,08,06
137,Perfect place to stay in London,"We were fortunate to celebrate our 40th Anniversary at Hotel 41, and it was worthy of the occasion; from the nicely appointed room, to the attentive staff at every turn, and finally to the wonderful breakfasts, tea, and evening spreads, it is a hotel unmatched in our lifetimes. Especially enjoyed the interactions with Steve and Stefan, who made us feel like family and not guests. The hotel is located in a great part of London, with easy access to most of the city's attractions, but really, why would you want to leave? We will be back!",5,2019,08,06
137,Simply Wonderful,"We wanted somewhere special for our wedding night, the photos and reviews were so good we treated ourselves for our special day, albeit booking a regular room.
From the second we arrived, we were treated like royalty, from the doorman taking our bags, to the complimentary champagne when signing in and for every single moment during our stay, every single member of staff very politely greeted us by name.
Arriving at our room we were told that they had upgraded our room to the Conservatory suite, which was beyond our wildest dreams, it was utterly perfect, down to every tiny detail.

We had dinner in the English grill (again with a complimentary bottle of champagne) which was delightful. 

Finally returning to our room, to be greeted with scattered rose petals, candles, soft music in the background and even a cake with congratulations written on it, was such a lovely surprise.

After a lovely breakfast sadly it was time to check out, we really did not want this wonderful experience to end.

We would like to thank every single member of staff, for making our special day so utterly fantastic. The memory will stay in our hearts forever.

Mr and Mrs Carr.",5,2019,08,05
137,If You Like Horses and Alice in Wonderland,"This private hotel is pricy but worth it.  When we first arrived,,, kind of strange, the lobby decor reminded me of Alice in Wonderland. Got lost several times trying to find our room, the hallways being narrow, color scheme, felt like a maze, hard to explain, but cool.  It's not your ordinary hotel, that's for sure but lots of amenities. The top floor restaurant with a big skylight is always open for free snacks and deserts. You must pay for meals and room service but the staff is terrific and goes the extra mile. We stayed in a couple of their rooms, very cozy and warm decor. If you can stay on the top floor, I'd advise that as you can hear the cleaning of the rooms and walking back and forth, building structure is old.  Now, to the horses. Right across the street is the Royal Mews and museum. This is one of the stables where the horses stay for Buckingham Palace and Royal events. Then right up the street is the Palace, Hyde Park, everything is walkable. I highly recommend staying at this hotel for a least one night to get the vibe.",5,2019,08,05
137,Wonderful stay at our new favorite hotel!,"Have to admit that we were a little skeptical about whether Hotel 41 could live up to all the great Trip Advisor reviews, but it so deserves them!  First of all, the service was absolutely outstanding- usually you might note one or two people that stand out, but in this case every single staff person we interacted with made us feel welcome and like valued guests. The hotel is small, only about 30 rooms, so it has the wonderful feel of an intimate, luxurious inn, but it has all the amenities of a full size luxury hotel (in part due to it connecting through a discrete door in the lobby to a sister larger hotel property-The Rubens at the Palace-next door). In terms of the room, we booked the only room that was available at the time, an Executive King Room, and were pleasantly surprised as it was much more spacious than the pictures on the website made it look.  The room was beautiful with absolutely everything we needed or would have wanted, extremely comfortable bed, lovely sitting area and desk, and plenty of closet and drawer space for both of us.  The bathroom was just the right size, neither small or too large, with great water pressure and my favorite toiletries from Penhaligons.  They also leave welcome treats for you in the room when you check in and a different little treat every night at turn down. Housekeeping staff was phenomenal also, besides the standard stuff, some little examples - they would tie up our charging cords for us every time, and when I left my glasses out one day, came back to find they had left a cleaning cloth for them on top of the glasses case. In terms of food, there are a few full service restaurants at Rubens next door, but the real treat here is Hotel 41's lounge (beautiful room that looks like an old English library with skylights and a rooftop terrace).  The lounge is constantly stocked with complimentary treats (complimentary water and non-alcoholic drinks all day), crisps, popcorn, candy and other treats during day, warm scones in afternoon, and canapés, cheese, fruit and desserts in evening (until 1:30am).  For a reasonable fee, breakfast is also served in the lounge in the morning (both buffet and hot entree options) and an honor bar is available all day for any drinks.  And finally a great location in the heart of it all (right outside the walls of Buckingham Palace), and less than a 5 minute walk to Victoria Tube station to connect everywhere (we barely used it as we loved walking everywhere).  I loved this location as we could walk to all the sites easily, yet not anywhere as crazy as the area near Piccadilly and Trafalgar.  We hope to return for another stay in the future - this will be the new standard by which we judge all our future hotel stays.",5,2019,08,01
137,An absolute gem!,"I have been going on an annual trip with five of my high school buddies for more than 30 years now.  Typically, we stay at the club level at Ritz-Carlton hotels or at the closest thing we can find to that level of service.
This year was our first foray to Europe.  My neighbor and travel agent recommended that we stay at Hotel 41 in London.  He has created a bit of a problem for himself, however, as I don't see how he can top Hotel 41.  What a hidden gem.  The executive lounge is exactly the set-up that we love, a warm and welcoming gathering place for us to hang out in between the day's activities.  The rooms were superb.  But most importantly, the staff was amazing.   Stefan, Patricia and Magdalena in particular were so warm, welcoming and personable that they became an integral part of our trip.  We will remember them always.  I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.  (Not to mention it is in a great location).",5,2019,08,01
137,Double visit!,"My favourite hotel in London and I got to visit it twice in a month. My husband and I enjoyed a fabulous weekend in June when we were so excited to see the beautifully refurbished roof terrace. A beautiful sunny day in a beautiful spot. 

A few weeks later, I returned to 41 to meet up with my cousin and goddaughter who were over from the US. We started on the roof, where Stefan allowed Meaghan, my goddaughter, to perform the sabrage - opening our champagne bottle with a sabre. A really special ambition fulfilled.  We then went back downstairs for a delicious afternoon tea where both Stefan and Steve looked after us so well.

Thank you to Lauren for making all the arrangements and for making both occasions so memorable. The team at 41 are unique!",5,2019,07,30
137,The best Boutique Hotel in London,"I’ve been staying in London hotels for the last 14 years and have never experienced such fantastic staff and service. The hotel itself is gorgeous and the location perfect for all the best London attractions but what stood out for me was the attention to detail and individual attention this hotel offers. It’s an absolute gem and would give it 6 stars if I could.  Thank you for a brilliant stay.
Kate, Meg and 🐶",5,2019,07,28
137,Par Excellence ,"      I can’t believe that it had been 15 yrs since we last stayed at this wonderful hotel. What a mistake and from now on, it will be our London home whenever we visit. The hotel is in a perfect location adjacent to Buckingham Palace so it is centrally located to many of the London districts. Boutique in style, this hotel is very classy, very comfortable. The rooms are extremely comfortable and fully appointed. You will not want for anything and if you happen to require anything else there is always the “whatever, whenever” hotline. The service at this hotel really is unparalleled and they always make one feel so welcomed and taken care of. The library which also serves as the lounge and breakfast area (and the breakfasts are delicious )is comfortable and serves all the snacks and drinks that one may require, and more. Superlatives are not enough to describe this hotel so if you ever get the chance to stay here, DO!",5,2019,07,27
137,An absolute gem...,"I cannot think of enough superlatives to describe this absolute gem but I will try.  First of all the location is fantastic.  You are literally around the corner from Buckingham Palace in one direction and Victoria Station in the other.  The gorgeous St. James Park is right down the road.  The hotel staff couldn't have been more lovely or welcoming from the moment we stepped through the door.  All rooms as well as the Executive Lounge are on the 5th floor.  The Executive Lounge is basically where everything takes place--reception, breakfast, afternoon tea and evening snacks.  The lounge must be experienced to believe it.  The food is delectable.  Afternoon tea is so enjoyable and eloquent.  After a long day of touring, you must stop into the lounge for the most delightful evening buffet.  It was truly a highlight.  We really felt like we had been transported back in time.  We were also fortunate enough to have booked the conservatory room.  The entire ceiling is an actual skylight (with automatic shades) although we didn't close them once at night.  Such a lovely way to fall asleep.  Last but not least, is the outstanding staff.  First class, friendly, professional.  They made our stay one of the most memorable we have ever had.  We must also give a special shout-out to Stefan.  We so thoroughly enjoyed our breakfast conversations!  If you have an opportunity to stay at this enchanting hotel, you will not be disappointed.  It is truly one of the greats!",5,2019,07,26
137,The Best.Period.,"This was absolutely the best hotel we have ever stayed at EVER. We have stayed at Four Season properties, Mandarin Orientals, etc so we know 5 star, and Hotel 41 is on another stratosphere from even those brands and experiences. There is no where else I would stay if I was in London again.

The layout of the property very much lends itself to a VIP feel. The entrance is an unassuming set of double doors next to the more obvious hotel entrance to the Rubens property. You can really only tell you’re at Hotel 41 from its banner flying above and it requires a hotel key card to even access the building. Once inside, you are whisked up to the fifth floor. The entire boutique hotel takes up only this floor so its very easy to navigate and also very intimate. 

The lobby and restaurant of the hotel called the Executive Lounge is where the staff will bring you for check in, complete with some Rosé or champagne and a tour of the property and your room. This is where you’ll get your intro to how fabulous the staff are. Initially there was some confusion about who we were. They thought we were some couple when we entered the hotel and then “the Parkers” when we were taken to the lounge. Only one other instance when a note was sent to our room for the “Bubs” were we mis-labeled but I really can’t fault them for that because other then these 3 instances, every single staff member knew our names and would greet us instantly by those names. HOW are you guys this good! I understand if staff we came in contact with previously would know our names and that its a smaller hotel but the fact that ALL the staff, even people we hadn’t met yet knew our names! Get outta town; THAT is service!

Then there are the amentities which we took full advantage of. Get yourself well acquinted with the Executive Lounge because you don’t want to miss out on this gem. The plunder pantry here is such a treat with all the quality hot and cold free food you can get anytime of day. We loved ending the night here grabbing some free ice cream to take to our rooms as a night cap or getting some free sparkling or still water. Also don’t miss having breakfast here. I can say that there was nothing quite like cozying up on a comfy couch during a rainy morning with the water tapping on the skylight above, enjoying some warm tea and delicious food around the rich mahagony and books of the study. Its the best way to start the day! I miss that room so much even now writing this.

Our room was also a quiet, great retreat to come back to after a long day of siteseeing. We were located near the elevators but surprisingly never heard a peep from them or any guests. Our windows had views of the Royal Mews though its a bit hindered by the concrete railing of the building. When we arrived there was a tray of mini desserts to welcome us (all delish!). The bed was super comfortable and I thought the room was pretty spacious. I also loved the number of outlets available for charging pretty much everywhere; we didn’t even need to bring our global chargers!

The only things we didn’t like about our room was probably more toward us not being big international travellers and not knowing the way of things. We were really confused with how the lights worked. It seemed like you couldn’t turn all the lights off unless you flicked off the master switch. I know there must have been a way to turn on/off different light combinations because of how the turn down staff would set up the room (rose petals and candles!) but we never got the hang of it. We also weren’t fans of the rainfall shower heads. You get a shower and a bath/shower combo in the bathroom but we used the bath/shower combo because we kept making a slippery mess trying to keep the water from spilling out of the tub; I could see myself making an even bigger mess from the shower. The tub was also super tall to climb in and out of so you pretty much had to use the hand rail to even attempt to get in or out without slipping. 

Regardless of all that, it didn’t put a damper on our thoughts on the property at all. The staff would leave various turn down goodies each night and one day we even came back to find a decorative tin of shortbread cookies from Buckingham Palace. The very same tin, I might add, that I had wanted to buy and had decided against because I’d already purchased a bunch of other decorative tins full of teas at other tourist sites. I never told the staff this so they must be psychic. I really can’t wrap my mind around this level of service. This hotel is the end all be all of 5 star luxury hotels. It’s location is steps from Buckingham Palace, many other tourist sites, and prime underground and coach stations as well as a quick walk to the West End for shows. If you are going to London do not consider anything else. You will have the best possible trip if you pick this place; I guarentee it.",5,2019,07,24
137,Best Hotel Ever,We have never experienced this level of service and attention. It is quite an extraordinary hotel and we loved everything about it. We had a really hard time getting motivated to get out and explore London because we just wanted to stay at the hotel and enjoy the pampering.,5,2019,07,24
137,A truly memorable stay!!!!!,"Having never been to London, my wife and I embarked on a search for the perfect place to stay to enable us to best enjoy our trip, During a search of places to stay we discovered Hotel 41, which claimed to be a small boutique hotel centrally located in close proximity to Buckingham Palace. It truly did not disappoint in any way. I had let the hotel know that we were celebrating our anniversary. Well, upon our arrival, the room which was beautifully appointed in all respects had a large bed pillow reading Happy Anniversary, a large bouquet of flowers and a delicious cake - none of which was expected.  The room and the entire hotel were spotless throughout our stay. However, I have missed the best part. and it is the staff. They were each extraordinarily friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and truly made us feel important, yet at home. At no time were they intrusive and they were quick to attend to our requests.  A few names that we recall that must be mentioned are Jean Nicolus, Stefan, Magdalena, Lauren and Gabriel. We regret not having the names of the others as they all deserve being mentioned!!!
We have travelled to many places in Europe and the United States and can say that none can compare to Hotel 41.  When we return, there is no other place we would even consider staying.",5,2019,07,22
137,Fabulous hotel and fabulous staff,"We chose this hotel because of the good reviews and we were not disappointed. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, we were made to feel special. The staff was very attentive, friendly and professional at all times. We were upgraded to the Balmoral suite which was very nice as there was 2 bathrooms for 3 of us.
The executive lounge was nice and so was the rooftop.
Special thanks to Dean, Jean Nicolas, Patricia (the lady at breakfast) and John who welcomed us with a nice glass of champagne for looking after us so well.
From now on, hotel 41 will be our hotel of choice for our week ends in London",5,2019,07,21
137,"Great Service, Superb Staff","Great intimate boutique hotel well located, rooms and decor lovely and quiet, the beds super comfortable everything luxurious. The service and staff are exceptional and meticulous, helpful in every way possible. A rare find!!",5,2019,07,20
137,Wonderful property!!,"One of my all time favorite hotels. This is a small boutique hotel not far from Victoria Station.  I stayed in the Conservatory suite and it was magnificent! There is a sitting room downstairs with bathroom.  Upstairs over the bed is a glass ceiling - you can remotely open the blinds so that you can see the sky. Beautiful!!!  There is also a double jacuzzi tub upstairs in the large master bath.  The service at the hotel is amazing - they make you feel so welcome and tend to your every need.  There is a great breakfast spread - also food served throughout the day and a ""raid the pantry"" option for late night.   Simply delightful!!!",5,2019,07,19
137,Wonderful,"We stayed at Hotel 41 to celebrate our silver wedding anniversary. It was a fantastic experience which exceeded our already high expectations. Nothing was too much trouble for the excellent team who made us feel so welcome. Located in the heart of Victoria, this guest only hotel has the feel of an exclusive club with attentive service to match. If you are celebrating a special occasion or looking for something a little different then we would throughly recommend this gem of a hotel.",5,2019,07,19
137,Unbeatable Charm with Great Service!,"This is a boutique, boutique hotel.   Hotel 41 has 28 rooms and occupies a single floor. Talk about intimate! In typical European fashion, the rooms are on the smaller size. However, the decor and attention to scale allows me to confidently call the rooms “charming” or “romantic”; take your pick.

While the hotel is small, it’s service stature is tremendous. They anticipate your needs which makes the experience stand out. The entire staff quickly knows you by name and are at the ready to assist with any request large or small. A package delivered to the hotel days in advance was in our room upon arrival. I casually mentioned having the fireplace lit and it was roaring upon our return from dinner. While checking out at 7:30a we mentioned we were heading to the airport. The staff promptly create a “to go” breakfast box for us.  

Hotel 41 recently opened a private rooftop lounge that should not be missed. Unlike some complimentary breakfasts; the offering here was robust. In addition, complimentary canapés and toasties are available throughout the day. 

The size of the property does not limit the amenities. Those wanting a workout can use a nearby fitness club. There is a sister property next door that has a lounge with live music (The Leopard Lounge).  Hotel 41 also has a relationship with the neighboring restaurant, The B Bar. The B Bar serves casual food with a South African twist. The outstanding service at Hotel 41 extends to the B Bar. On our second trip to their patio, the server promptly gave me a lap blanket upon remembering that I had brought my own on my first visit. 

Alas, nothing is perfect and that includes Hotel 41. Their was a problem with the HVAC system in our room which made for an uncomfortable sleep on our last evening. The person dispatched was not able to figure out the problem.",5,2019,07,19
137,This is my bench mark hotel!,"My daughter and I spent a week here. The service was truly outstanding, as was our room. The staff was attentive and remembered our orders for breakfast after the second morning. The treats left for us with our turn down service were always delightful - sometimes fresh fruit and other times a sample size of one of their branded beauty products.  The day we saw Hamilton, our treat was fresh fruit and macaroons bearing the Hamilton logo.  ",5,2019,07,18
137,Amazing place,"A different world from a regular luxury hotel stay. Enjoyed everything from the greeting at the door, the champagne at check in and raiding the pantry. It was so lovely to sit in the lounge and chat and it felt so comfortable that we sometimes forgot we were at a hotel. Breakfast was delicious and atmosphere relaxed but still felt luxurious. I want to stay here every time I go to London. Two nights but felt like we had a long holiday. Loved the chance to raid the pantry, no low blood sugar rage in sight before dinner. Great when we have had dinner and a show and you have craving for a small snack before bed.",5,2019,07,16
137,A London Gem! ,"As regulars of the Oyster Box in South Africa, we were so happy to be staying at Hotel 41 which is a sister hotel. The hotel is so well located and in the heart of London but the shining light was the incredible service throughout our stay. We felt at home and so well looked after. The breakfast was delicious and the never ending snacks table was amazing. I would go back in a heartbeat! ",5,2019,07,15
137,Outstanding visit to Hotel 41,I took my wife to 41 and it exceeded our expectations as a luxurious hotel whom would do anything to ensure your stay is out of this world!! 5 star throughout from food to the room.... Please visit....,5,2019,07,14
137,Celebration,"We couldn't have asked for more to help us celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. Stefan & all the staff took every opportunity to make our stay a wonderful experience.  A beautiful, central hotel with fabulous staff. Every possible opportunity was taken to exceed our expectations! Thank you. ",5,2019,07,11
137,Amazing hotel,The attention to detail in this hotel  is superb. The roof top bar has a lovely view over the Royal Mews. Staff very friendly and they couldn't do enough for you. The food was excellently prepared and presented and tasted delicious. There is nothing about this hotel that we could fault. We were only there for one night as we were travelling on the Orient Express to Venice the following day. Chose this hotel as we thought it was in keeping with the rest of our trip and it certainly was. We would definitelyreturn.,5,2019,07,11
137,Everything a hotel should be..,"Having stayed for both business and pleasure now, I can honestly say this is my favourite hotel anywhere in the world. Whilst the decor, layout and style are exemplary, the service is better still, faultless. 

Reviewers far more eloquent than I have waxed lyrical about how wonderful this place is, all I'll add is that none of them do it justice, you simply have to stay here.",5,2019,07,08
137,A little 5* star gem in the heart of London,"We booked Hotel 41 after reading the reviews online and hearing from some friends how amazing this place was and what can I say, it excelled in every possible way! From the moment we arrived and checked in to the moment we left the staff were so polite and attentive, nothing was too much trouble. We couldn’t fault anyone but I must say a big thank you to Stefan who made us feel so welcome. The rooftop bar was another added touch we didn’t expect but just made it that much more special. The best thing about Hotel 41 is the size, it’s such a personal hotel and everything is done to such a high standard. Best hotel I have ever stayed at and will 100% be returning. Thank you everyone at Hotel 41!!!",5,2019,07,07
137,London Series 2019,"Beautiful quaint boutique hotel near Victoria Station. Exceptional staff and service. If the weather is nice check out out the roof top bar. Very British!!! We loved it.

Pleasantly surprised to find out it belongs to same hotel group as Ashford Castle (Red Carnation Hotel Collection), in Ireland. Look forward to the opportunity to see more of their properties...",5,2019,07,07
137,"3rd visit, still excellent","We stayed here for one night as part of my wife's birthday celebrations, and it was as excellent as our previous two visits. As always, the staff are incredibly helpful before arrival in checking if anything is required (in our case, a little something I arranged which was exactly as I hoped it would be) and during one's stay. Our suite was excellent and exactly as we remembered it from a previous visit.

This hotel continues to be the height of luxury - expensive but worth it for the service.",5,2019,07,07
137,Amazing hotel,"Only had a one night stay but wished it had been longer. The hotel is only small but very beautiful. The staff are beyond exceptional,  you feel completely spoilt from the minute you walk through the door. A complementary glass of champagne on check in was lovely. I had mentioned it was my husbands birthday and when we were shown to.our room we had been upgraded to one of their suites overlooking the Palace mews!!
The staff are so attentive addressing you personally by name whenever they see you....they make this hotel very special.
They offer complementary canapes, snacks and 'plunder the pantry'...which was great after coming back from a show to a hot pie!!!",5,2019,07,06
137,The Reason 41 is #1 - Best Staff Ever,"Well, there are actually more reasons, but the friendliness, attentiveness and professionalism of the staff is the most important reason. From your first contact with them, they make you feel welcomed and cared for.  

Another significant reason that we loved the hotel is its intimacy – we were greeted by name by every staff member we had contact with, throughout our visit. Because of the intimacy, you get to know the staff and your fellow guests.  Every room is on the fifth floor of its sister hotel, the Rubens. You enter through a separate entrance, which always has someone at the desk ready to help, and you take the elevator up. They have a stunning and cozy executive lounge which is available only to the few guests of 41, and is open 24/7. It feels like an old-fashioned club, with a combination of tables for diners, as well as comfy couches for couples.  The lounge also has a ""raid the pantry"" feature. Depending on the time of day, they have snacks or more substantial food items available. If you want a meal or alcoholic drinks, you can also order from the menu.  

After you book with them, they send a ""guest preference form,"" in order to provide you with anything you could need for your stay, over and above the normal ""extra pillows"" -- they can provide things like a Bose audio station, electrical adaptors, and yoga mats, just to name a few things.  You can also arrange to have champagne, flowers, chocolates and more in your room upon your arrival.

Speaking of arriving, we got to the hotel earlier than check-in, which was actually great, because they greet you with champagne and canapes to enjoy in the executive lounge. We were there celebrating our daughter's college graduation, and they had delicious pastries and a cake with ""Congratulations"" written on it waiting for us in our room.

There is always someone available at the concierge desk in the lounge, and they can seemingly do anything! Before leaving for our trip we had been unable to get tickets to a sold-out event, but they were able to procure them for us. They made restaurant recommendations and reservations, procured tour tickets, and arranged travel -- all effortlessly. 

The hotel is located down the street from Buckingham Palace and across from the Royal Mews. It is in a beautiful section of London; we felt safe walking to local restaurants, shops and parks. 

The decor of the hotel is black and white, carried through to the comfortable, well-appointed rooms, and the roof-top ""zebra bar."" On a sunny evening, we sipped Pimms and lemonade, and even were treated to a sabrage demonstration (our daughter had the honors), which capped off our trip!

I am so grateful that we found Hotel 41. The treatment we received, the quality of everything we ate and drank, the comfort of our accommodations, and the perfect location made it everything we could hope for, and more. We were sad to leave, but look forward to staying at this wonderful hotel for our next trip to London.

P.S. I cannot overstate the impact that the staff had on our visit. They were so attentive and accommodated every request we had. They are the difference that makes the difference!",5,2019,07,06
137,nice,“A great selection for a continental breakfast; more than I have experienced in other establishments. A very quiet room with a large and comfy bed. Lovely shower. Helpful and kind staff. Very good value for money.”,5,2019,07,04
137,Amazing hotel!,"I had high expectations for this hotel given the great reviews I read before travelling.  Here are the highlights of our 6-night stay:
- lots of thick, high quality towels, excellent water pressure and terrific toiletries in the bathroom
- friendly, approachable and helpful staff
- excellent food and service at breakfast
- the most amazing bed I've ever slept in (at the end of our stay I had to ask the brand; it's a Savoy)
- very clean and pristine condition common areas and room
- check-in and check-out were extremely efficient (check-in was accompanied by a glass of champagne)
We also had the afternoon tea at the hotel one afternoon.  It was a wonderful; lovely sandwiches, scones and pastries accompanied by a wide selection of teas.",5,2019,07,02
137,Very British Hotel with Personalized Service,This is indeed a top class hotel with top level service! The lounge and the food were also amazing. We had a wonderful stay for our girl’s birthday celebration! Thanks all the friendly staff in hotel 41 and we strongly recommend this hotel!!,5,2019,07,01
137,Amazing Hotel and Amazing staff and fabulous location,We stayed at this beautiful hotel just over a week ago. I read all the write ups on tripadvisor and thought can it be this good ! Well it was and more !!  all staff from front desk on antry to check in to welcome drink  - everything. Room was amazing Staff super super friendly and helpful.Too many names to mention and dont want to miss anyone out.  I think we spoke to most of them at some time during our 24 hour stay.We will be going back for sure Would highly recommend.,5,2019,07,01
137,Deserves 6 out of 5,"Hotel 41 continues to be our most favorite place to stay in London.

It takes service and quality to the highest level and never disappoints.

This time it was a 2 night stay for a trip to Royal Ascot and we were given an upgrade to a room on 2 levels which was very charming and very comfortable.

As always we received the lovely warm welcome and champagne from Steve, who also gave us an excellent recommendation for dinner near Sloane Square.

The library lounge remains as comfortable as ever and the generous buffet bar was loaded up once again with lots of goodies.

But, the main stand out is always the staff.  Genuinely friendly, helpful and attentive but never intrusive.  Simply brilliant.

We just love it here.  See you again soon 👍",5,2019,06,26
137,Feels like an English Country Home with an excellent Staff in the heart of London,"Hotel 41 is a hidden gem with only 30 rooms, it' s as if you have your own private home with an attentive staff. The location is directly across from the Buckingham Palace's Royal Mews where the Queen keeps her horses. An easy walk to see the changing of the Palace Guard and stroll through St James Park. Victoria Station tube is close by and it's also easy walking to many of London's best sites. It's intimate, personal, sophisticated yet cozy and comfortable.",5,2019,06,21
137,Wonderful service,Lovely boutique hotel and a great location for visiting Buckingham Palace. The service was perfect. Everyone knew our name and bent over backward for any request. It is a very small hotel and though beautifully appointed our room was small too. I would say the hotel was a little too sedate for my thirty something daughter. I thoroughly enjoyed it however.,5,2019,06,20
137,Fantastic Hotel ,"This hotel is a different gravy ! I can see why it is rated number 1 hotel on trip advisor.
Staff are exceptional and customer service is flawless.
Free upgrade on arrival to a suite and the pantry in the lounge is a very unique idea.

We will be back  ",5,2019,06,19
137,The best there is!!!! ,"What an incredible hotel. The level of service is the best I have ever encountered. And the concept of the all-day pantry is a wonderful touch. Beautifully decorated rooms. The “whatever whenever” button on the phone is a piece of brilliance. 
Bravo to all the staff for making this hotel stand head and shoulders above the rest. 
",5,2019,06,16
137,One of the Best Hotels I've Ever Visited,"I'll just keep to bullet points to avoid rambling about this terrific hotel.
- We booked the Junior suite and it looked even nicer in person and had so much more amenities in the room than a person would ever expect. My husband thought it was funny that I got excited over all the small things they thought of to provide for people. For example; They have a ""pillow"" menu with 10 options for pillows if you prefer something different than than the standard pillows on the bed (see my photos)
- You are greeted in their main reception room upon arrival with a champagne cart to greet you with a glass of champagne while they check you into the hotel
- Customer service is phenomenal, and everyone was genuinely nice and eager to help with anything you could want or need
- Every evening they offer turndown. It's not like at other hotels we have visited. They give you a sheet with the next day's weather and a little something extra that changes every night. A couple nights it was a few luxury chocolates and wafers, another night it was a delightful calming pillow spray. Even if you don't want turndown they still leave the treats and weather forecast for you.
- For being in the middle of a bustling city, it was such a quiet room and we couldn't hear other guests or any noise from the city.
-The airconditioner in the room worked great! We like it very cold and it stayed cold the whole time. This may seem trivial , but we found many hotels in the UK don't have AC
- Try the Curry Room! The best curry I have ever tasted! They even have one of the curry dishes available (Butter Chicken) for room service to try and see if you like it. It's a very intimate setting with excellent service and the manager (Mohan Senchuri) came to visit and check in with us at the table and offered his card if we had any questions or needed anything from him.
- The water pressure is pretty intense.If you like strong pressure then it'll be great for you, but we had to turn the faucet down just a wee bit.
- Finally, the location is perfect. We walked every where we wanted to see and it is very close to most attractions and some gorgeous parks.",5,2019,06,14
137,Returning again to Hotel 41,"Third trip to London for the celebration of Queen's birthday and always enjoy staying at 41. 
Watching the fly-over up on the roof with a glass of champagne is always a thrill.
The staff is more than friendly and courteous. They are outstanding in every way",5,2019,06,14
137,Our new home away from home in London!,"We capped off a 10 day European trip with a stay at Hotel 41 on our 25th wedding anniversary. The trip included stays at 5* properties, but Hotel 41 was the best of the best. 
This is a very boutique hotel right in the heart of London, about a 5 minute walk from Buckingham palace. Having stayed in other areas- we both agreed that this central location was ideal for touring the city. 
The room was gorgeous- well appointed with luxury amenities throughout.  
The service was Four Seasons level-exceptional from beginning to end. This is a very special property. 
Staying at Hotel 41 gave us the most memorable anniversary. We have found our new home away from home in London!",5,2019,06,10
137,Checked Every Box,Unrivaled service in every way. Excellent location and adapts to all needs. Professionalism in all areas of guest service and in the one issue we had was met with immediate response. Highest regard for all areas of our holiday.,5,2019,06,05
137,"Stay Here....No, Really, Stay Here.","What a wonderful find! Hotel 41 is located on Buckingham Palace Road, a 5-minute walk from Victoria Station, and perhaps a 10-minute walk from the Palace. 

It is the hotel that thought of things you didn't know you needed. After a very long flight from the USA, we were greeted with a glass of champagne in the truly lovely restaurant / bar area of the hotel. The hotel has only 22 rooms, and we almost never saw any other guest even though we stayed there for 10 nights. The hotel is nearly silent, which is incredible, given its location. 

It is quite deluxe without ever feeling stuffy. The room was wonderful. Every night our bed was turned down, and we arrived to soft music, candlelight , his-and-hers slippers by the bed and snacks provided. The showers are like standing under a torrent (which is a happy change from the pitiful showers in the US), and then you choose a towel from heated towel bars. The service throughout our stay was the finest we have ever had in over 40 years of traveling about. The staff is available 24 hours a day; ready to provide anything you need, and yet they were absolutely never intrusive at all.

Every afternoon there are complimentary snacks of very high quality in the bar. The same is true in the evening. The evening offering is called  'Plunder the Pantry"" and it really is like being in a British Country House in which you are given carte blanche to ""plunder"" the larder. Amazing.

We absolutely felt like we were the most important guests that had ever stayed there. The staff remembered our names, drink preferences, places we had planned to visit, etc.; in essence the hotel was the best part of our trip. If we were to return to London, we wouldn't stay anywhere else.

All of this luxury comes at a price. And it was worth every penny we spent.

Bravo to all, and especial thanks to Stefan, David, and Erica for making our stay so memorable. Thank you, thank you.",5,2019,06,03
137,Simply perfect,"I stayed with my husband and we chose this hotel for its location, as we were invited to a Buckingham Palace Garden Party. Generally we visit London to go to the Theatre and there are any number of 5 star hotels more conveniently located for the Theatre District. We have, in recent years - and to make my point - for example, stayed at The Savoy, Claridges and The Soho. When we stay in London (or anywhere without our children!) we spoil ourselves.
Well, that isn’t going to matter any more. Whether we walk or take a taxi, if No 41 has availability it is where we will be staying on future London visits. 
The service was exceptional. The facilities impeccable. Everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel, but so much more. 
I am only putting this review up because the staff deserve it. If you are reading it, by all means ignore it and go somewhere else. Somewhere the staff won’t know what you want or need before you do. Somewhere with less comfortable beds, less quiet rooms, fewer delicious complimentary snacks. And then there will be availability when I want to book.",5,2019,06,02
137,Exceptional Customer Service and Beautiful Property,"From the moment you arrive to the moment you depart, Hotel 41 is an exceptional hotel that exceeds all expectations. Upon arrival, you are greeted with a glass of champagne. Throughout the visit, you experience unexpected touches like turning the TV on to a station that featured relaxing music. 

We didn't take advantage of tea-time, but we did enjoy the executive dining room. The breakfast experience was exceptional. Food is prepared well, but the service is what wows you.

The executive dining room stays open until 1 a.m. - we enjoyed some late night cocktails and paired them with the food that was available. 

The staff is friendly and helpful and their mission appears to be that they want each customer to have an exceptional experience.

I am so happy that we stayed at this property.",5,2019,06,02
137,Extraordinary Experience,"Hotel 41 was fantastic from the moment we arrived. We received personalized service and top notch accommodations. From champagne on arrival, to afternoon tea, to hand delivered custom soap - Hotel 41 is a superb experience all around. We will absolutely return when in London.",5,2019,05,28
137,"Fantastic Staff, Location, Everything!","We've just returned from a whirlwind family trip to London and Scotland.  As is usual, I relied on TripAdvisor for help in choosing the right accommodations, tours etc.  41 Hotel did not disappoint.  We were traveling with 5 adults and 6 young children.  After a 10 hour flight, it was lovely to be greeted with smiles and champagne at the 41.  We were there for 4 nights and were treated fantastically.  All the staff went out of their way to accommodate any need.  They treated our children with kindness and we felt like family by the time we departed.  The luxury was fantastic, purge the pantry welcome, and the staff unsurpassed.",5,2019,05,28
137,First class all the way,"Hands down the best hotel experience I have ever had. The staff are so personable, attentive and helpful. The room was lovely, clean and extremely comfortable. It’s the little details that go a long way- champagne on arrival, chocolates in the room, welcome cards, loofahs in the bathroom, his/hers bath slippers and I could go on... the plunder buffet in the executive club is such a great treat at the end of a long day. Will never stay anywhere else when visiting London!!",5,2019,05,28
137,Loved it again,"I feel like we have definitely found our London Hotel, maybe because it wasn't our first visit it didn't feel as special, but that is really trying to find something negative to say.  It was great again, the rooms are comfortable and quiet, almost hard to believe that you are basically in the center of a large City.  The location is fantastic.",5,2019,05,27
137,A hidden gem,"We have just returned from the most amazing stay at hotel 41. 

My husband booked the hotel for a treat for our first wedding anniversary. If I’m honest I didn’t know the hotel existed but what a hidden gem!

The hotel is located on the fifth floor as it’s sister hotel next door accommodates the other 4 floors. 

The theme of the decor throughout is black and white and is simply beautiful.

On arrival we was greeted with a glass of champagne and was advised we had been upgraded as it was our anniversary. Rather than a executive king room we was staying in the junior suite. What a treat! 

The suite was amazing. Where do I start - we was most certainly home from home. Everything you need is available. 3 TVs to choose from with separate sky TV. A beautiful bedroom with a huge bed that could fit 5 people in and a beautiful spacious bathroom with lovely toiletries, I personally never have a bath in a hotel but happily spent half an hour in this one. 

What sets this hotel aside from the rest was the finishing touches and the staff going the extra mile. Our bathroom mirror had a beautiful message on from my husband, we had a cake and treats in the room. The complimentary sweet bar and ice cream in the executive lounge. We went out for dinner so didn’t take advantage of the complimentary food in the evening but on return the room had candles, rose petals, more sweet treats and was very romantic. The fragrance  pumped through the AC of the hotel is Devine, it’s so nice we bought a bottle of the room spray to spray at home.

 Not forgetting the staff - extremely friendly and helpful. Although we didn’t have any requests I can imagine nothing for the team is too big or too small. 

We have stayed at many hotels around the world but hotel 41 is by far the best we have stayed in. We are already planning to return to reubens the sister hotel next door as I hear they have the best afternoon tea in the city.",5,2019,05,25
137,Faling ill wasn't the plan but........,"Regular guests at 41, we arrived mid-morning and almost immediately after our welcome glass of champagne, left for a day out with friends.  Early to bed, we succumbed to a virus going around our grandchildren's school and spent a difficult night.  The next morning we informed Lauren, the Resident Manager, who despite having a fully hotel, managed to arrange for us to stay in our room for a second, unplanned night.  There was no way we could have dressed and packed, never mind changed rooms. During that day and evening, the staff could not have been more helpful and understanding, going out to collect medication, offering appropriate light meals and beverages and bringing endless supplies of water, etc whilst respecting our necessary privacy.  Falling ill away from home is always difficult but Hotel 41 is a reassuring support for everything and anything one might need. 
On our next visit, we will return to champagne and Bouchard Finlayson wines in the Executive Lounge or on the newly-opened Roof Terrace and enjoy Plunder the Pantry.  Thank you all for your care and consideration.",5,2019,05,25
137,Best hotel experience of my life,"We treated ourselves to a night at Hotel 41 as we began our honeymoon so were flying from Heathrow the following day and wanted to start off on the right note. Boy were we not disappointed!

On arrival we were congratulated on our wedding and told we were being upgraded to the conservatory suite. We had booked one of their ""standard"" rooms (although nothing in this place can be called standard). The conservatory suite was OUT OF THIS WORLD. A king-size bed, a separate seating area, a jacuzzi bathtub, 3 TV's (one in the bathroom!) and best of all, a retractable canopy over the bed uncovering the conservatory roof so we could sleep under the stars (well, what stars you could see... this is London after all!)

But I'm getting ahead of myself. The hotel entrance is quite small and conspicuously tucked next to The Reuben so you'd almost miss it if you didn't notice the flag outside. The whole hotel bar the reception is located on the 5th floor. When you arrive a porter is called to take your bags and you're escorted up in the lift to the 5th floor to check in. You will notice as you walk through the hallway this wonderful smell... the hotel has it's own fragrance pumped through the airflow system so the whole place smells amazing (you can also buy the fragrance to take home if you like it that much!)

You check in at the desk in the executive lounge. Whilst you do this, you are given complimentary champagne. I had the pink one - it was outstanding. You're then shown to your room and the helpful staff will point out anything special you need to know about it before leaving you to wander round like a wide-eyed idiot who can't quite believe where you are.

Complimentary robes and slippers are provided (the slippers in cute his & hers bags). The bed had a red rose on it, there were little treats laid out (macaroons and such). The room had a Nespresso machine and the TV's all had Sky (with a little note on the remote informing you that it gets cleaned between every guest stay). 

You are invited to the executive lounge for drinks (and the amaretto sour and espresso martini we ordered were amongst the best we've ever had) and where you can also access the pantry. OH MY GOD. Complimentary chicken pot pie (oh dear lord it was so good), chicken foie gras, cheese and biscuits, fresh fruit, ice cream and desserts. Needless to say, we did not go out for dinner! 

When we returned to our room, the staff had popped in to leave us some chocolate covered strawberries and some massage oil! Husband was very pleased! 

The hotel boasts that there are 2 staff to every guest, and there is a button on the phone marked ""Whatever, Whenever"" which if I had needed anything else I'm sure we would have used, but we had everything we could have ever imagined in just that one night! It's no surprise the hotel is consistently ranked as one of the best hotels in the UK and Europe. No hotel in the capital will ever compare for us now!! We will be back - and thank you Hotel 41 for starting our honeymoon off in true style!",5,2019,05,23
137,1st class,"My wife and I spent 16 nights total in England and Scottland. We spent 2 nights at Hotel 41. The accomidations and service was 1st class. I would consider this hotel the best of the 7 hotels during our stay in the UK. The staff was very attentive and extremely friendly. Our two breakfasts and one late lunch were delicious. We stayed in the Balmoral Suite which was very spacious and well appointed.  The hotel had a special birthday cake under a glass dome along with an assortment of freshly baked chocolates waiting for us in the room.
Thanks

137,Loved it!,"I had an amazing three night stay (if way too brief!) Completely understand why this boutique hotel is rated so highly. From the luxurious, stylish and comfortable room to the lounge and pantry and the excellent attention to detail from staff, Hotel 41 is an oasis of calm and comfort centred in the heart of London.",5,2019,05,23
137,Still the Best!,"Another wonderful stay at 41! The personal service is attentive and everyone makes you feel extra special and addresses you by name. This time we chose s smaller executive room, which was very cozy, very nicely decorated and well furnished. 
Can't beat the location close to Buckingham Palace, the Royal Mews, the Queens's Gallery, and St. James park.
Great to relax in the executive lounge with champagne upon check-in, with drinks before dinner, after the theatre for something to eat from the pantry before retiring to bed and last but not least, for their elegantly presented breakfast. As Stefan recommends the Eggs Benedict, he describes it as the ""breakfast of champions"". 
Our trip was cut short due to a family emergency but we look forward to returning, when we can stay longer and spending time in this beautiful hotel with their club atmosphere. Special thanks to the resident manager, Lauren Hargrave, for all her assistance in arranging our stay, helping with our sights and the special touches the hotel provided.",5,2019,05,20
137,A Wonderful Experience ,"It was a fantastic stay. The staff are attentive, friendly and welcoming. the afternoon tea is wonderful and the pantry is a brilliant feature. After coming back from a night out it was great to raid the pantry and have a nightcap. I have been fortunate and lucky to have stayed in many premium hotels all over the world and this was by far the best for me.",5,2019,05,18
137,Hotel 41 delivered the holiday of a lifetime!,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 for 8 nights at the beginning of May for a birthday/ anniversary trip.

Hotel 41 is that calm sanctuary that keeps you refreshed and ready to face your day with energy and excitement. All this with true welcome for their city of London. This trip was a year in the making, and I had decided on Hotel 41 early on. About a week before our arrival, I began to get nervous and thought my expectations were too high for Hotel 41. I worried for nothing! They delivered an amazing holiday experience. Hotel 41 goes above and beyond in the service experience. It is as if they wish to provide you with lifetime memories.  For example, one night while chatting with Oris (name hopefully spelled correctly) we mentioned our potential plans for the next day and she gave us some great suggestions. Later that evening she thought she may have given us misinformation, so research was done and we were updated in the morning! This is just one example of the genuine level of care and concern shown at Hotel 41. The location of Hotel 41 cannot be beat - steps from Buckingham Palace and the decor and comfort of the rooms fit right in with the overall goal of an elegant sanctuary. I cannot wait until the next time!

",5,2019,05,17
137,Our #1 hotel choice for London,"I've been to London numerous times, and had been lucky enough to stay in other 5 star places. Although the other hotels have better amenities (bigger bathrooms, etc), they really are outdone by the SERVICE provided by the Hotel 41 staff (not to mention that free pantry!!!). We didn't have to sign for anything (the staff makes sure they know YOU right from the get go), and any concerns are addressed immediately.

And the location is superb - right in front of the Buckingham Palace, 2 blocks from Victoria underground and the Big Bus stop right in front of the hotel. 

And yes it's pricey, but you definitely get the value for your money. We will definitely stay here again when we go back to London town!!!",5,2019,05,14
137,"Like staying with family, if your family is really wealthy","I'm not trying to be sarcastic. The staff was so attentive and so friendly it was like having family in London. The room we stayed in was decent sized, not one of the suites, but it had enough room for two sisters with a lot of luggage (we arrived after a cruise.) The amenities were fabulous and the location can't be beat. When we needed detailed directions (well, I did since I get lost easily and was trying to get to a pharmacy by myself) one of them even took me most of the way to my destination (by foot) and recommended places for me to shop while I was out and about. I wish I could afford to stay there again, especially during a warmer and drier season. But the hot cocoa in the lobby was always welcome and the blankets were warm and cozy.",5,2019,05,09
137,The best hotel i have visited so far,"my apartment had a prob so i have to move some where this hotel is near my location so i choose it but really i was surprised so clean ,the welcome service was awesome ,rooms were clean .Even the food was good i have ordered the food two times and dint find any difficulty in taste and freshness .",5,2019,05,08
137,The best,"Never fails to be the best in London, our home from home. Great location and rooms but the most important aspect of our stay has been the service. Everyone at 41 is friendly, cheerful willing to help in any way. We can't fault them. We love our stays at 41, a wonderful hotel to see London or just relax. We cannot rate it highly enough.",5,2019,05,07
137,Hated to leave...,"I spent four days and three nights in this lovely hotel with a small group of friends.  Everything about the experience was exquisite.  Of course, the rooms were clean and comfortable.  The decor aesthetic is charming. The location is fantastic.  The staff was friendly and helpful throughout.   

But the star of the show for us was the executive lounge experience.  It offers excellent food and drink and a comfortable space to spend down time when not our touring London.  Meetup for a nice breakfast or coffee to start your day.  Meetup for cocktail hour before heading out to dinner.  Stop by after dinner for card games or drinks by the fireplace.  We did all three...more than once.  It delivers a quaint, social, relaxing experience with exemplary quality of service and attention.  100% recommend.",5,2019,05,07
137,Utterly Flawless!,"Personalized and welcoming service like I have never seen before. From the moment we pulled up outside to our departure, the staff was professional, enthusiastic, and personable. 

Excellent food and beverage selection for such a small hotel, from our 6:30 AM breakfast to our post-theater dinner at 11:30 PM.

And with not much between the hotel and Buckingham Palace aside from a single road, the location cannot be surpassed.  Away from the tourists and late night sports car drag races on the north end of the park, you feel peacefully at home in the middle of everything!

I look forward to my next trip to London as I will certainly be staying at this hotel again!",5,2019,05,07
137,Exquisite Gem In The Heart Of London,"The 41 is not an inexpensive hotel but neither is it hotel experience that you will soon forget. Located directly across the street from the Royal Mews on Buckingham Palace Road, it's centrality to London is compelling. The hotel is also less than 500 meters from the Victoria Underground station and a shopping/restaurant complex. Convenience is definitely a plus.

In terms of service, quite simply you will not find better service anywhere. Every member of the staff will know your name and greet you warmly. Your every need will be anticipated and attended to.  Within the lounge, every member of the staff will remember your favorite cocktail and will prepare it exquisitely. 

I cannot recommend a hotel more highly than the 41.",5,2019,04,30
137,Rather pricey but well worth it.,"Wonderful location, atmosphere and staff. Close to Victoria Station, Hyde Park, St. James Park and within waling distance of theater district. Executive lounge at 41 was superb. Great complimentary snacks and drinks served in afternoon and evening. Leopard bar had nice easy listening live music from 6-10 in evening.",5,2019,04,28
137,We absolutely loved it,"It was a wonderful stay. The stuff was great and we did notice the little things - from having water available everywhere in the hotel (starting at breakfast continuing at reception and in the rooms) to the little gifts  at turn down service rolling up the usb cable
and fixing it with a velcro  band.
Another highlight was the birthday cake for our daughter.",5,2019,04,27
137,London Exploring,"We checked into Hotel 41 and had an incredible time. The Hotel is a real hidden gem which we spoke about long after leaving. It is quiet, intimate and the staff are just lovely. We will definately recommend to friends and family.",5,2019,04,26
137,Europe Holiday,"Hotel41 would have to be one of the best hotels we have stayed in while traveling around the world. 
The staff should be commended for the impeccable service to the guests of the hotel. The rooms and ambience of the hotel make it feel like home.",5,2019,04,25
137,Perfect,"What is there to say that hasnt been said before? The room was lovely, but the greatest part of this hotel is the atmosphere and experience. Everyone goes out of their way to make your stay memorable. Every detail is seen to and everyone makes you feel at home. We will never stay anywhere else in London. Dean and Orsi were particularly wonderful!",5,2019,04,25
137,Our new favorite London hotel,"We just loved this hotel. From the moment we arrived, greeted with champagne and the personal attention that only a high-end boutique hotel can offer, we felt like part of the family. A posh family with a gorgeous home in a beautiful part of London. 

Our room was quirky, with a sitting area downstairs and the bedroom upstairs, which added to the charm. I took a bubble bath with the champagne from the check-in to recover from our long flight and the tub filled in about two seconds flat. After that, things only got better. Because this was once a private home, when we went into the lounge it felt like gathering in the sitting room, but with a healthy supply of delicious appetizers, like salmon with dill and beet puree on toast, and a wide variety of drinks, and our new friend from check-in to top us up without us having to ask. The sheets on our bed were gorgeous, breakfast was divine - I indulged in the green juice while my husband opted for a proper English breakfast, fried toast and blood pudding included - and we just didn't want to leave. Thankfully the amazing staff accommodated this as we visited at a quiet time and we were given a late check out. Bottom line: we'll be back. As soon as possible. And I'm a bit conflicted about sharing this review because I don't want it to be sold out when we return.",5,2019,04,23
137,Happy Guests,"We enjoyed our stay at Hotel 41. It’s a small  boutique hotel but you will be impressed by the quality and flawless service provided by their staff. They were warm, friendly, and always willing to tend to your needs without being overbearing. Full breakfast, tea service and snacks were delicious. We will definitely return. 
",5,2019,04,23
137,Special birthday night away,"We took our parents away to celebrate an 81st birthday. What a fantastic present. Hotel 41 was incredible from the moment we arrived. They gave us all champagne on arrival and all the staff were so friendly and welcoming. Our rooms were beautiful and it was lovely to receive a birthday cake and bottle of champagne which we enjoyed later in the day. The hotel arranged tickets to the Churchill war rooms so that we did not have to queue. When we returned in the evening we plundered the pantry! Fantastic food, snacks, ice creams and drinks. 
The staff arranged taxis for us the following day to visit various sights in London. Nothing was ever too much trouble for them. This is our absolute favourite hotel and the third time we have stayed there. We will definitely be returning. Thanks so much to all the staff for making sure it was a truly memorable birthday occasion for my mother in law. It’s something they will never forget.",5,2019,04,22
137,A Special Place,"I decided to try a new Hotel in London on this trip, and was richly rewarded. 41 is a small, boutique hotel with an amazing staff. It’s just one floor with a small exclusive entrance in the heart of London. On the 5th floor near our room is the Executive Club. There the staff takes care of your every need from great food to packing your luggage if you like. I truly felt like I was at a beautiful home with the finest furnishings and an old world London feel. The staff make it a truly special place. If you want and authentic, throwback place in London that feels like home, 41 can not be beat!",5,2019,04,16
137,A wonderful stay,"We had high expectations given all the great reviews we had read before we booked, but Hotel 41 more than lived up to them.  We were given a really warm welcome when we arrived and everything was done in a very personalised way.  The rooms were lovely and well equipped with everything you might need, not huge but really cosy and beautifully decorated.  The sitting room/bar area was very comfortable and had a lovely relaxed ambience and all the staff we interacted with were both professional and warm.  We've stayed in many hotels but Hotel 41 has created something very special indeed.",5,2019,04,15
137,A Stay to Remember,"We were fortunate to stay here for a second time and it did not disappoint, in fact was better than he first time, with our room being 'in the sky' with its glass dome roof. From the moment you arrive, until your final departure, every detail is catered for and nothing is too much trouble. The breakfast was as you would expect, with the choice and food quality. We plundered the pantry one night after a theatre visit and as they knew we were celebrating a birthday and a wedding anniversary, we were provided with a cake in our room. We will be back! ",5,2019,04,15
137,Star struck,"Invited to stay by a friend, I could not even get entry to my room with out reassurance from them with my credit card, it didn't even have enough credit to insure me going in! Was it worth it? I have no idea what it cost, but the centrality of the location was fabulous, the afternoon tea was just darling, and the staff attention unparalleled, plus my room, oh my.",5,2019,04,14
137,Outstanding property with superb service!,"There’s a reason Hotel 41 is rated #1 in the U.K. From its location, to amenities, staffing quality and decor, it’s simply the finest hotel I’ve patronized in Britain. 

Upon arrival, you’ll be pleasantly surprised at how the staff are extremely courteous, attentive and knowledgeable. It only gets better from that point. Fabulous food and decor make every pound spent absolutely worth the expense! ",5,2019,04,14
137,London Calling,"I was lucky enough to find myself searching for accommodation in London again this April for a conference.  I considered saving a few pounds and booking a large impersonal chain, but for a couple of special nights in one of my favorite cities, why not stay at my all time favorite hotel for the second time.
I will tell you why not - it’s never as good is it?  The memories are always better than the reality....WELL NOT AT HOTEL 41.  It was like returning to long lost family.  I was greeted by name and immediately offered a coffee closely followed by  French champagne (scary how well they know me after just one previous visit).  My bags were quietly whisked away as we confirmed particulars and then I was invited for breakfast (favorite meal of the day).  Breakfast at Hotel 41 is special; it is the perfect blend of British pomp and circumstance (think haddock and silver teapots) with a range of choices to excite most international guests - where do those croissants come from?  Surely not across the Channel!  Post flight I was equally as enthusiastic about a change of clothes; but before I could enquire about the possibility of a quick shower I was welcomed to my room - at 8 am.  Who gets to check in at 8am?  Surely there is a catch, but no, this is true homely British hospitality.  And more surprises - everything I had commented on or mentioned 3 years previously was there in my room like magic.  Having walked through sleet to get to the room, and having sat like a zombie on flights from Oz for 25 hours I was pretty excited to see an exercise bike, yoga mat and yoga DVD tucked away ready for warming up and stretching my miserable muscles.  Even in the absolute heart of London my room is bathed in natural light, the heritage features of the rooms are tastefully modernized by the cleverly simple colour scheme of black and white which helps to make the most of even the weakest of English sunshine, and it was struggling on this morning.  My room is huge, with the usual desk, chair, bedside tables, and robe, but with the addition of a sitting area with table and chairs positioned to enjoy the rays of sunlight, and the bathroom has bath and shower, and also takes advantage of natural light through a sky light made possible in every room (I guess) by the fact that the whole hotel is on the top floor of this converted 1800’s home.
The next four days passed in a blur of conference, eating, strolling, tubing (how many people can you fit in a tube?!) but each evening I returned home, to smiles, warmth, laughter, stories, pots of tea and perfectly balanced attention. If food is the way to your heart come and visit - complimentary homemade scones await from 2pm, canapés replace them from 5pm and then the pantry is stocked for plundering in case you have the munchies strike later on; so incredibly thoughtful considering the jet lag hunger pains that can strike at anytime.  Turn down service has its own place in my heart too - an aromatherapy candle is lit in the bathroom, soft background music is left playing and each evening there is a different treat to explore once you ease tired feet into the most amazing hotel slippers you will find on the planet (word of advice, leave enough space to sneak a pair home with you; this was a personal failing)!  One night I found a little atomizer of lavender sleeping spray and snoozed right through 2 am and 4 am for the first time, waking to my alarm for the first time in years.  I happened to mention this in passing during my breakfast feast and when I returned from 10 hours of conference there was a note and two more atomizers waiting in my room - English hospitality yes, but more than that, this is consideration, thoughtfulness, generosity and for me epitomizes the difference between a big impersonal chain and staying with ‘friends and family’ at Hotel 41.  Treat yourself, but be prepared, it will not be your last time.",5,2019,04,12
137,Fantastic ,"Red Carnation across all their properties set the bar in their respective categories - 41 is arguably the best and in my view this is because of the team - they are exceptional. Some of the kindest, most genuine and hard working people you will meet. As always the style of property is an acquired taste (which we love) and at this price point nothing should be too much trouble - it simply never is. Yet another fantastic stay. Absolutely brilliant. Thank you again to Lauren, Andrew and the rest of the team. ",5,2019,04,12
137,Impeccable...,"My husband and I just returned from London.  Our stay at Hotel 41 exceeded our expectations.  From the moment we entered this property we realized we were in for something special.  Their impeccable service, attention to detail and their ability to anticipate our every need was absolutely unbelievable.  London is a wonderful city to visit and staying at this exception property only enhanced our visit all the more.  Thank you to the entire staff of 41 for your attention and kindness.  We will see you again!",5,2019,04,10
137,Top Notch Service ,"Wow, my mother and I just returned from our first stay at 41- it not only exceeded our expectations but it set the bar so high I don’t know how any other hotel can compare. Beyond the aesthetically pleasing interior and rooms, the all day snacks, canapés, treats, and ice cream, & the perfect central location in London, there is the best and most attentive staff working at 41. They not only met our needs but their attention to detail and thinking one step ahead truly sets them apart from the rest! We felt like royalty- the staff knew our preferences (sometimes before we did!), had a unique attention to detail (themed surprises left in our room each day!), and truly cared about our experience and making sure our trip exceeded our expectations! This amazing service started the second the door opened and continued as they sent us to the airport with a bag of treats, water, and a sincere goodbye! I cannot rave about this hotel enough. We
were so sad to leave but will certainly return many times - a true gem! ",5,2019,04,08
137,The best hotel I have stayed at,"The reviews for this hotel were fantastic, so I booked 2 rooms for myself and my wife and 2 friends. 
The valet parking was a great help as central London is a nightmare, we were taken to the executive bar where the great experience began, from sipping complimentary champagne to canopies and some great toasted sandwiches.
The staff were friendly, professional and made you feel as if you were at home. The rooms very clean, the bed was the most comfortable bed I have slept in on all my travels. 
It is pricey but it is amazing, even breakfast was stunning. I cannot speak highly enough of the hotel and staff.
I now know why it is voted London’s no1 boutique hotel. Location by Buckingham palace is superb, 
Highly recommend this for anyone who wants a break or a romantic break, your wife will not be disappointed",5,2019,03,31
137,Best Hotel in London,"Phenomenal Hotel.  Great service. 
Convenient to Buckingham Palace.  The Concierge was a tremendous help with sightseeing, tickets for plays and transportation needs. I would highly recommend for anyone staying in London. ",5,2019,03,29
137,Wish we had stayed longer!,"This was the nicest, best customer service at a hotel we have ever stayed at. From the soft pillows and linens, steaming hot shower with tremendous water pressure to the fantastic service in the lounge and always having snacks and drinks available, this hotel really impressed us. The concierge always had great recommendations for us and everyone made sure our stay was perfect. Will definitely stay here again next time we are in London!",5,2019,03,24
137,Best service,"Stayed her for a night with my wife, and i must say the service at Hotel 41 is in its own league. This is our Hotel in London, will definitely stay her when we visit London again. The hotel staff where very friendly and you felt right at home the minute you entered the door.",5,2019,03,22
137,Among My Greatest Hotel Experiences,"Hotel 41 is an exceptional hotel. We spent a week at Hotel 41 and had a wonderful experience. The hotel is full of character, charm, and meticulously maintained. The staff was remarkably attentive. The executive lounge is a wonderful, quiet place for breakfast, afternoon tea, or a peaceful nightcap after a day of exploring the city. Sitting by the in-room fireplace was another great way to unwind at the end of the day. It's in a great area and very walk-able to much of the city. If you choose not to walk, it never took us more than a minute to get a taxi.",5,2019,03,17
137,Practically perfect in every way!,"My daughter and I met in London for a weekend getaway! I had read the previous reviews from tripadvisor and booked the hotel!  The moment we arrived we were greeted by friendly staff that took us to the executive lounge and offered us champagne.  The room was comfortable and done in black and white...the beds are very comfortable!  
We loved the Nespresso maker, the heated towel bar in the bathroom and the evening goodies we received at turndown service (homemade candies, lavender spray for our pillows).
We enjoyed an afternoon cocktail in the executive lounge and were brought delicious Canapés and croquettes.  They also have a ""pilfer the pantry"" each evening where you can stock up on goodies between 8 pm-1 am (included).
The hotel was in a great spot for site seeing and also walking to restaurants...a quick walk across the street.
I could go on and on but highly recommend Hotel 41!",5,2019,03,15
137,Wonderful weekend,"I have no hesitation in recommending this charming hotel, and endorse the glowing reviews written by others. We could not have wished for a better place to stay for a luxury break in London. A lot of thought has been given to making your stay as comfortable as possible, however, it is the excellent service that makes it such wonderful experience.",5,2019,03,11
137,Update to Simply the Best,"Rarely does a hotel continue to set new standards of defining luxury, yet Mrs. Tollman and her Carnation Group do it!   My previous post ""Still, Simply the Best"" remains accurate.  Mr. Hendry and Ms. Hargrave continue to direct an outstanding team.  The warmth, friendliness, and attention to every minor detail remain the hallmark of the 41.  The staff is extremely well trained and continues to make each stay well above the high expectations I have.  I occasionally lecture to other medical professionals on what ""service"" means, and cite many examples of our experiences there.  lf you are looking for a boutique hotel where cleanliness, luxury, attention to detail, and staff helpfulness offer a quiet respite in busy London, this is the place.   We have referred over 30 friends to the hotel now, and my feedback from them has been 100% positive from all.  The 41 remains, simply the best.",5,2019,03,09
137,Set a new standard!,Hotel 41 set a new standard for excellence.  Seldom have I experienced the wonderful staff and enjoyed the attentiveness delivered at this hotel.  Management and owners of the Hotel can be particularly proud of both these people and the excellent facility they operate.  Congratulations in order.  I intend to search out other establishments  in the Red Carnation chain in my future travels.,5,2019,03,04
137,Wonderful place,One of the best places I’ve stayed at in a long time. The staff are magnificent and go above and beyond. The rooms are very clean and look wonderful. I’ll definitely be returning back here soon next time I’m in the country,5,2019,03,04
137,Just what you want,"Firstly all the five star reviews are correct
Attention to detail and customer service are first rate.
Everything is as you would expect with a top quality hotel, with the lounge being a perfect refuge from the outside world.
Would strongly advise you to visit if in London.",5,2019,03,03
137,London Short Stay Gem,"Great Hotel for a couples weekend in London or short business trip
The staff are excellent, the executive lounge is a haven away from the crowds. Short walk to Buckingham palace and the Mall. This park walk takes you straight to Leicester Square 
",5,2019,03,02
137,Superb,"If you ever travel to London Hotel 41 is a must.
We enjoyed this super Hotel for a weekend trip in December. Exceptional standard of service, great food and charming atmosphere. Sit with a glas of wine next to the fireplace! The location great too.
We loved every aspect of our stay and will return.",5,2019,02,28
137,#1 for many reasons,"Don't bother looking at any other hotels in London, this is hands down the best hotel we have ever stayed in. I won't go into too much detail, but my husband and I felt like royalty staying here. From the turn down service with little treats that surprise you (it was my husbands 40th birthday, and they left a cake and rose petals in our room--SO lovely), to the staff knowing you by name with the friendliest attitude. It was our first time in London, and we simply want to come back just to stay at Hotel 41. Best experience ever!",5,2019,02,26
137,"Return visit, just as good as last time","This was a return visit after being so impressed the first time about 3 years a go.
It didnt dissapoint, from walking in the door to checking out, the service and extra mile the staff go to make sure your stay is extra special, sets this apart from the rest. Its a relatively small hotel so i guess that helps to give the experience a more homely and welcoming feel, a glass of champagne of your choice while you check in, sets the tone.
The rooms are classy with the decor unique and you can tell a lot of thought has gone into the design, again to provide everything you need, whilst providing a comfortable and special space. All the amenties you would expect are in the room, but fresh fruit and pettles and a few other touches just make the experience that little bit more special. Love the pantry in the exec room, free nibbles which change during the course of the day and fabulous hosts who just pamper you, but in a nice relaxed way not over the top way.
This is a true 5 star hotel and if you prefer the smaller boutique type hotels with a more unique and personalised experience then i would highly recommend 41.",5,2019,02,25
137,Wedding anniversary visit,Wow. From the moment that we pulled up outside we were welcomed. The concierge took our car. Fabulous check in over complimentary nibbles and choice of champagne. The rooms are perfection and ours came with flowers and cake to celebrate our anniversary. We can't wait to try breakfast.,5,2019,02,24
137,Impeccable service with a personalized touch!,"My family is well traveled and we have been fortunate to stay at many places, including five star luxury hotels. However, the personalized service at Hotel 41 is second to none. Each night there were kind treats and surprises left for our three children at turndown, and the amenities in the executive lounge are truly amazing. Breakfast, tea time, evening “Plunder the Pantry sessions, and more...my 5 year old daughter wants to live here, I think! Unfortunately, my boys and I were pretty sick during most of our visit to London, but the staff at Hotel 41 made this a wonderful stay nonetheless. I have never been more enthusiastic about a hotel!  Thank you to all the kind staff!",5,2019,02,22
137,No longer a 5-Star Establishment,"I want to start by saying that this was my second time staying at Hotel 41. The first time was 4 years ago and I had an absolutely wonderful experience. I wish I could say the same for my last stay. Hotel 41 was my wife and I's last stop on our honeymoon. We had been traveling for 4 weeks, and I was so excited for her to stay at the hotel I had raved about in the past. Unfortunately that excitement was short lived. There is a very thin line between a 4 and 5 star hotel, and what we experienced at Hotel 41 was at maximum a 4 star experience. Some of the below complaints may seem petty. But that is what separates a 4 and 5 star hotel. At a 5 star hotel they should never be any complaints, especially so many...

1) The first complaint was the air temperature in the room. It was 4C (40F) outside, yet our room stayed blistering hot all night. We had the thermostat cranked down as low as it would go 18C (65F), yet the temperature remained at 25C (77F) the entire stay. I brought this to the attention of the front desk and they ensured me they would take care of it... yet nothing every changed. So night after night my wife and I sweat through our sheets in our sleep, which leads me to my next complaint.
2) The laundering of sheets... Apparently Hotel 41 has an initiative where they only launder and replace your sheets when asked. However, we were not told this upon checking in. So on the last night of our trip our sheet had begun to stink from sweat so bad that I went to the front counter and asked if they had changed our sheets. They informed me that there was a slip of paper that we need to place on the bed so the staff would know to change the sheets. This slip of paper was on the far night stand in the corner of the room underneath the tissue box. I understand that they are trying to conserve energy and resources by taking this measure, but they should have explained this upon us checking in. But as a ""5 star"" establishment they should be changing sheets regularly weather the tenant request it or not. 
This doesn't even take into consideration the feel of the sheets. The top sheet was comfortable, but the bottom sheet was waxy and was not soft in any measure. I assume this is so people don't sweat into their mattress.
3)Both of the showers were poorly designed. The first issue was with our stand up shower. We had just arrived at Hotel 41 from a long day of travel, I was ready to shower off and get ready for bed. I reached inside the shower and turned it on. To my surprise the cleaning ladies have left the water going to the ""wand"" instead of the ""shower head"". Well the one good thing I can say about Hotel 41 is the great water pressure. So much so that the wand leaped from its holder and started spraying like a angry snake (imagine an unmanned firetruck house).It completely soaked the bathroom and myself. The major problem is that I was wearing my camel hair sports coat with silk interior lining. And if you don't know, neither camel hair nor silk can get wet. My $1,700 sports coat shrank over night and ruined.But technically this isn't the Hotels fault so I chose not to complain. I should have been more diligent when turning on the shower.
The second complaint about the shower was the tub shower. It only had a ""half door"" so this resulted in residual water spray all over the bathroom. Leading to my wife stepping out of the shower, slipping on the soaking wet stile and bruising her bottom as she fell onto the toilet. Again, technically not the hotels fault, but could absolutely be resolved with a proper shower door.
4) The window in our room faced an office building next door. The hotel has placed ""black out shades"" over the window to attempt to drain out the radiating light that pours from that building at every waking hour. The attempt fell massively short. Light poured through both the blinds and curtains. There was a dense halo of light that surrounded the window and made it difficult to fall asleep if you like a dark room. 
5)Currency Exchange. When I arrived at Hotel 41 I wanted to exchange a small amount of money so that I could tip the staff for various requests throughout my stay. That's when the hotel let me know that there was a commission that the hotel took from the exchange. The front desk staff even said that I would be better off pulling the money from an ATM down the street. This is the first ""5 Star"" hotel I have ever been at that charged such a large commission, hell, most 5 Star hotels don't charge a commission anymore. But I needed cash to tip the bellhop, so I had to eat that loss. Its poor etiquette to take a commission out of a currency exchange, that is meant to tip YOUR employees.
6) The towel warmer in our bathroom did not work. After letting the staff know, they said they would have it fixed. It still wasn't working when I checked out. 
7) Their ""continental breakfast was trash. The fruit at gnats and flies on them the first morning. Another older couple even commented on the flies around the food. Luckily the second morning there were no insects on the food.
The dinner prices were absolutely outrageous as well. And please don't think I am cheap. I have no issue with spending a few hundred dollars on dinner. But when the dinner taste like that of something you get from a pub, I expect the prices to reflect that. But they didn't, the food was merely mediocre, which doesn't represent a good value buy for me. 
8) My last and maybe most petty complaint is that the hotel did absolutely nothing to make our Honeymoon special. And please note that they absolutely knew this was our Honeymoon and congratulated us. Every other 5 Star Hotel we stayed at did something to make our stay extra special. In Marrakech they upgraded our room and laid rose petals on the bed for us each evening. In Zermatt they upgraded our room and brought complimentary breakfast room service to our room every morning and had a free taxi waiting to take us to the ski slopes. In Geneva the front desk brought us a box of hand made Macaroons from a local vendor down the street, as well as chocolate dipped strawberries. In Brussels the hotel had a chilled complementary bottle of Champagne waiting for us upon our arrive back every evening. Along with new Belgium chocolates every evening. In Paris they upgraded us to their royal suite where they had roses leading us to the bed. 
Yet, Hotel 41 did absolutely nothing. No chocolate, no Champagne, no congratulations note, no upgrade. Nothing... 

I have traveled all over the world, been to 6 of the 7 continents and stayed at 5 star resorts, hotels, and riads from here to New Zealand. And Hotel 41 has now become one of the worst ""5 Star"" experiences I've ever had. I really hope someone from management sees this and takes action to resolve these problems. Because if not, I have a hard time believing their rank as the 5th best hotel in the world will continue. Because I have stayed at Hilton Garden Inn's that were nicer with better service. Not worth the nightly rate in my eyes. However, if you want a 3-4 star experience at a 5 star price, this is the place for you!",2,2019,02,22
137,Here We Go Again,"When you walk into a place and the first thing somebody says is, ‘Welcome back Mr and Mrs Gaygan, it’s lovely to see you again’, you know you are somewhere truly special.

I spoken before about how wonderful this place is but I never get bored of writing about it. It wasn’t apprehension about visiting again but I admit to thinking about whether or not it would live up to the previous three visits. Because after all, all good things must come to an end at some point, surely?

As with so many other things, Hotel41 bucks the trend and we felt totally at home even before the lift had taken us to the executive lounge.

The welcome, the room, the food (particularly the croque monsieur), the attention to detail and the care and concern from ALL staff. It was all simply wonderful. 

This visit was only a one night visit as a thank you to Mrs Gaygan for taking the strain over the last 6 weeks at home because my work has been bonkers. One night is never enough and that’s why we have already enquired about a longer visit pre Christmas. 

The final part of review just about sums up everything about Hotel41. I got an email from Marlon Wunschel (Assistant Manager at Hotel41) asking if we enjoyed our stay and looking forward to welcoming us back in December. To top it off, he even enquired to make sure we got home safely.

Hotel41 care, even when you are not there. Now that’s class.",5,2019,02,19
137,Amazing Hotel ,"I booked this hotel as surprise to celebrate our 4th Wedding Anniversary. And based on the reviews plus the hotel being rated no1 I was excited to arrive!

We were not disappointed - we arrived late due to delayed flights but were still given the same 5 star treatment with champagne and excellent attentive staff on arrival.

Our room was lovely and the bed was extremely comfortable - just what you need after a long day/night around a London! 

The hotel even surprised us with an Anniversary cake in our room and other little extras to make the trip feel very special! 

The complimentary section at the hotel is also a great added extra - canapés, snacks, sweets, ice cream, breads and cheeses - just in case you feel a little peckish. 

I can’t say enough about the wonderful staff and hotel - it is simply a must visit and we can’t wait to return!

Thank you Hotel 41 for a fabulous time!

We will be back :) ",5,2019,02,18
137,Amazing ♥️,Our second stay and I thought it couldn’t get any better a beautiful hotel with fantastic service and friendly staff who go above and beyond to make your stay pleasurable.I can’t wait to stay again soon,5,2019,02,17
137,Just wonderful ,"What an amazing hotel, from the moment we  arrived to the time we checked out, everything was perfect. Impossible to single out any one member of staff as they are all absolutely top class. We stayed at Hotel 41 for a birthday weekend celebration and the extra little touches were a lovely addition, even arranged a surprise treat at our dinner reservation.
Would recommend this place to anyone

Mark and Helen",5,2019,02,17
137,The best send off!,"My wife and I were emigrating from the UK and I wanted to prepare a surprise for her for our last night. I had never heard of Hotel 41 before but was recommended it by a friend who had stayed there and loved it. My wife has a dairy allergy and the staff prepared a dairy-free chocolate cake which they left in our room with a message (written in chocolate!) wishing us luck with our new adventure. The staff were attentive, friendly and approachable, and would ask us about our upcoming move (which was a very nice touch!) My wife was thrilled with the surprise and we'd definitely stay there again when visiting London. Thank you for such a lovely night!",5,2019,02,16
137,Valentines Day ,"We had been recommended this hotel by a couple we meet while on holiday, a chance meeting and a small comment”it’s the best hotel in London “ meant that upon our return we looked up “Hotel 41” and I booked for 14th February. 
It was absolutely perfect for my husband and I. The staff were engaging and polite and nothing was too much trouble. Our room had everything we needed and anything else we required was only a phone call away. 
A few things I feel I have to mention. It is the first hotel that we have been to that the all staff domestic maintenance even the window cleaner were exceptional always putting us first. All staff served with a smile and I genuinely believe that they enjoy working at the hotel. We watched returning customers being welcomed like old friends and staff had time to talk to us something that is sadly lacking in most hotels. 
It was just a wonderful experience and took only one night to convince us that this was now our favourite hotel in London. ",5,2019,02,16
137,truly exceptionnal,"I strongly recommend this hotel. Very nice place, in the center of London (near Buckingham palace). Exceptional quality of service. Rooms and bed are really great. we really appreciated the bottle of champagne offered in our room and the continuous access to high quality snacking, delicious breakfast, and so and so and so... Looking forward to go there again !",5,2019,02,13
137,Perfection!,"My husband and I chose Hotel 41 for our stay in London in February of 2019. It's hard to put into words how great this hotel is! The staff is what truly makes the experience one of a kind. It's in a great location that is easily walk-able to Buckingham Palace, Parliament, Big Ben etc. We enjoyed cocktails and canapes by the fire every evening before heading out. Perhaps it was just the jet-lag, but the bed was amazing!",5,2019,02,12
137,Loved every minute,Thank you so much for making my stay amazing and my Birthday. I saw the show Wicked and when I returned back to my room I had a surprise cake and a signed poster from the Wicked cast. Amazing service and great cocktails!,5,2019,02,12
137,"""Best"" and ""Luxury"" are overused. Need more of ""Exceptional"" and ""Impeccable""","We stayed 5 nights. Upon entering the door the concierge Lenny used our name making us feel we're in the right place. The main room albeit short of space is classic, warm and well appointed. Coming to London as tourists kept us busy. We only ate breakfast here and had a gluten free afternoon tea. The house has just 28 rooms, so everything is quaint and quiet. Just the way I like it. 

Guests willing to use $800+ a night know what to expect for service ATDs (attention to details). My wife and I certainly maximised our stay however the list of faux pas service issues are quite long and worth mentioning directly to the GM or GSM.  

Housekeeping was perfect. 
Professional staff worth mentioning; Victoria, Lenny, Vladislav, William, Mitchell, and Lauren.

Overall I love the brand image and intend to stay in another one of the Red Carnation properties or join their Uniworld river cruises.",4,2019,02,12
137,Enjoying the Christmas Season In The Heart of London,"The Hotel 41 was wonderful experience. We arrived at our private entrance decorated for the season. We were greeted immediately by a staff member and shown to a private elevator that took us to the floor that makes up the Hotel 41. We then moved on to the very comfortable private lounge where we checked in. Although we were early, the room was immediately available. 

The room was perfect, service was exceptional throughout our stay, the location was ideal and the private lounge was the perfect place to start and finish our busy days.

We plan to make Hotel 41 our home base during our future trips to London.",5,2019,02,10
137,Perfectly unperfect,"This is not a typical modern post-modern top-of-the-line 5 star hotel. Although perfectly located it is on the 5th Floor of that Building, with everything on that Floor. The Executive Lounge gives you everything you Need over day and night. The Rooms are british with more classical Elements but all very functional. It is the 'perfect unperfect'.",5,2019,02,10
137,The best hotel I have ever stayed at,"Location is perfect-across the street from Buckinham Palace. 2 blocks away from Victoria Station. Staff was friendly yet professional. I had a damaged power cord for my laptop. When I inquired where I might buy a new one they offered to find one for me. 

Beautiful English lounge is always open with snacks and drinks. 
We enjoyed our stay so much we extended our trip for another 3 days.",5,2019,02,08
137,A very fine hotel,"From the interior appointments, to the service and staff - there was no stone left unturned. This is one of the best hotel experiences I’ve had and the location could not be better. The atmosphere is more suited to private comfort and that was key to our recharge after three weeks of travel. Also - the snack bar is on point.",5,2019,02,04
137,Just superb,"What can I say, from opening the door to leaving everything is just top notch luxury. This is a must stay if you can. The lounge is even better than the rooms. Right behind Buckingham Palace and within walking distance of many attractions.",5,2019,02,03
137,Impeccable,"What a treat. Stranded thanks to some awful weather, I thought I'd drop in and stay a night here to see what all the fuss was about. Well, I can tell you their place as top rated hotel on TripAdvisor is well deserved. From the moment I walked into the establishment, I felt like I was in good hands. Guided through check in (if you can even call it that, felt more like a pleasant conversation in a warm firelit lounge), the attention to detail is second to none. The room itself was spacious for the location with a large king bed, wonderful ensuite, and everything felt like it was in the perfect place.

The hotel itself is all on one floor, and has an intimate feel so I never felt like just another guest. They have a gorgeous executive lounge, where a tasty breakfast is served along with plenty of goodies around the clock to nibble on.

I will be staying here again. Oh yes.",5,2019,01,30
137,Very enjoyable London gem,"My husband and I stayed here last week for 3 nights and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. This hotel feels tucked away and a true retreat from the busy streets outside. We had a suite which was very comfortable. We had a well stocked mini bar and plenty of glasses, tea and coffee machine, very large comfortable bed and very nice pillows. We had a problem with noise on arrival as there were builders on the roof. The staff were very swift to offer other room options and as we decided not to move we were given a bottle of champagne which was very kind. The food is very good and do eat in the sister hotel The Ruben which is below Hotel 41. We dined in their restaurant and had a super evening of delicious food and a good chat with the sommelier who was fun! The reception area in Hotel 41 is also the lounge/bar and it’s very comfortable and cosy. Drinks and snacks are always available and honestly we couldn’t fault our stay. Staff are very friendly and polite and we are looking forward to coming back.",5,2019,01,28
137,Incredible stay. Absolutely exquisite. ,"We stayed here for 1 night in November 2018. We booked Hotel 41 for its incredible reviews. We visited to be able to watch Heathers the musical in Theatre Royal Haymarket. 

The booking system online is really easy to navigate, initially we booked a 3 night stay for a really reasonable price. Including breakfast. We were then sent a form by email so that concierge could tailor our stay to the way we'd like it. The form included a 'pillow menu' which I really enjoyed ordering from. They offered aromatherapy pillows, body pillows, firm soft you name it. They also offered the usual, wake up calls, newspapers etc. We found it amusing that you could request exercise equipment to be in your room. They also offer a service to order your theatre tickets. We used this service as it was proving difficult to find Heathers tickets. 

We requested to have tickets for the closing night of the show, and the seats we'd chosen (or so we thought) were excellent. Only a few days later, I had an email to confirm the tickets and the person we'd spoken to had accidentally booked the tickets for the wrong date. It wouldn't have been a huge deal if Heathers wasn't so popular! The night we wanted to go was almost sold out so we were just going to cancel our booking all together. It was then that I received a phone call from a manager expressing how sorry she was over the issue, she offered to find tickets on closing night and front the cost because of the inconvenience. What a wonderful gesture. Hotel 41 had already exceeded our customer service expectations and we hadn't even got there yet! 

We had to cut our trip to 1 night before we arrived as I was unable to take leave from my job, the staff were really accommodating of this and didn't mind at all. They just changed the booking. 

Upon arrival, we were offered champagne, I politely declined and we were offered a soft drink instead. We'd had a really long journey. Check in was really thorough, we were showed around the executive lounge and then to our room. To our surprise, we'd been upgraded to the Balmoral Suite. We've never been upgraded in any hotel before so this was a real treat for us. The man from the front desk showed us everything in our room and explained the 'whatever whenever' button. You press this and someone on the other end does as you request (within reason). We only used it once during our stay and that was for an extra suitcase stand. It was delivered in minutes! 

The room was huge. Seperated into 2 parts. There were 2 entrances. The first part was a living space, with a TV, sofa and bathroom with shower. The second part housed the king bed and a sofa, dressing table, walk in closet, 2 bathrooms (I Know, 3 bathrooms!!), a desk and 2 tv's. One TV at the end of the bed and the other opposite the sofa. All 3 tv's were connected so we didn't miss a moment of what we were watching even if we were in the other room! Sky TV was also included. 

The bathrooms were beautiful. In the main bathroom there was a tub and an overhead rainfall shower along with a vanity area. In the second bathroom in the main room was only a rainfall shower. In the 3rd bathroom there was a shower and vanity area. I don't know why there were 3 showers but it's nice to know how the other half live! 

Considering we were in London, the space in the hotel was really roomy. We had a view of a courtyard and clock tower outside our windows. 

The service in this hotel is above spectacular. The staff cannot do enough for you. The attendants in the executive lounge were so down to earth and were happy to chat. The honesty bar is stocked to the high heavens and the snacks available all day kept us going. There's a little fridge freezer full of Jude's ice cream to help yourself to with compliments, my favourite flavour was the caramel and pecan. They also offered what they called 'plunder the pantry' which we felt was sort of like a midnight feast. After returning from the theatre we enjoyed a helping of hot sausage bake, sweets, cheesecake, fruit and much more. It was so nice to go to bed with a full belly. 

When we returned to our room after being at the theatre, our bed had been turned down. We were left his & hers slippers and a hot water bottle in bed which was a lovely homely touch. There were also tealight candles in the bathroom so we could indulge in a warm relaxing bath before bed. The bed itself was so comfy, we both slept like babies. The noise level outside is still pretty loud, but that's what you get when you stay in London! I wish I'd brought ear plugs. 

Breakfast the following morning was exceptional. On a Sunday, breakfast is served until 1pm! So we didn't rush to leave our room in the morning. We sat down for breakfast at 12.30pm. The breakfast menu has a wide variety of dishes, from a full English to avocado toast. We both opted for a full English and the continental breakfast. These were included on our package. You chose one option from the menu and then helped yourself to the continental buffet. The continental selection was impressive. Fresh exotic fruit, yoghurt, cereals, fresh baked goods, pastries, juices, everything you'd expect just with better quality. 
The full English was delicious, I opted for poached eggs and they were cooked just right for me. The sausages you could tell were local, along with the eggs and bacon. The hash brown was home made! I wish I'd had another. 

Checking out was easy. We paid the outstanding amount and then left. We left our bags in our room and they delivered them downstairs for us once we'd checked out. The one thing you should keep in mind is that hotel 41 is on top of the Rubens. If you're not good with stairs, there is a lift. Concierge are also happy to help with luggage and getting around. 

I would love to come back and visit again once I've saved enough, it's so worth the money. You need to stay here at least once if you travel frequently to London! ",5,2019,01,27
137,Simply stunning!,"It’s hard to fault this hotel so I won’t....no detail was missed. Service was immaculate from all the staff and the food we sampled, ranging from an exquisite English breakfast, to never ending bar snacks as we were invited to “plunder the pantry” were first rate. We shall return....",5,2019,01,27
137,Simply...... they just get it right!,"Now i genuinely do not say this that much as im hard to please, however.....
My Wife, Snoop our cockador 5 month old puppy and I were greeted by name as we stepped out of the taxi on arrival with a warm welcome, the service started from there.
My Wife and i had a champagne reception and snoop had a bowl of ""pawsecco"" (nice touch).
In fact it started earlier than that, from the call i made to make the booking the attentiveness and desire to understand what makes the stay brilliant for us was expressed and carried out, this the same for all the team, it wasn't an over the top fake style either as you can get in some hotels, if you know what i mean!

We stayed in a junior suite the room was well equipped and had a very comfortable cozy atmosphere. It is very classic which reminded me of a bit of New York. 
It wasn't the most luxurious hotel i have ever stayed in for within its price range but that could be down to personal taste i suppose.
I would like to thank all the team at 41 for a great stay and you left an impression which as i say is hard to get from me. I recommend this place to all. ps Don't be put off if you are concerned its dog friendly if you are not a woofer fan, you would never know and think of it another sign they understand the small touches that make your stay stress free by being dog friendly, eradicating the worry about our furry friends being elsewhere, leaving your mind to just relax and enjoy the stay.",5,2019,01,26
137,Amazing stay... never wanted to leave,We stayed at Hotel 41 and absolutely loved it. The service was amazing and we had such a lovely stay. Everyone was so welcoming and when they heard we were going to the Harry Potter studios they customized a few things specifically for us. The food they have during the evenings was so great and not to mention the ice cream! The rooms are wonderful and we loved reading out in the lounge area by the fire each night. The location can’t be beat either. Thank you to all that helped make our holiday in London such a wonderful experience!,5,2019,01,24
137,perfect as always,"This is the second time we have stayed at 41 and it is still the most perfect small hotel!
The staff are exceptional and the facilities second to none. We ate in the executive lounge and when we returned to our room the staff had turned down the bed, lit the fire, lit candles and spread petals and even placed a hot water bottle in my wife's side of the bed...absolute bliss.
This has now become our hotel of choice every time we visit London.",5,2019,01,23
137,Amazing,"We have just returned from Hotel 41 after a 3 night stay to celebrate my husband’s 60th birthday and I can honestly say this hotel is perfect. From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave nothing is too much trouble for the wonderful staff. By the second day they knew what drink we liked with breakfast and which colour toast we preferred! 
We were upgraded to a suite as it was a special occasion and it was so lovely. They really have thought of everything in the rooms, lovely toiletries, robes, slippers, big comfy bed, a pillow menu, a beautiful writing desk, I could go on and on. Anything you want you just phone reception for, even a phone charger as I forgotten mine, someone was sent out to get me one!
The breakfast was lovely, I had full English for a couple of days and then the continental on the last day, you won’t be hungry. There are endless yummy snacks constantly on offer all day too.
We had afternoon tea on my husband’s birthday and it was divine, we returned to our room to find a birthday cake, a lovely surprise.
If you want a big hotel with a pool/gym/spa etc then this is not for you. If you want amazing personal service in stylishbut comfortable surroundings with lots of little extras then book now, you won’t be disappointed. As a bonus you will be neighbours with the Queen during your stay",5,2019,01,21
137,Great Hotel .... especially the service ,"I generally don’t write reviews. Almost never. But the staff here were so thoughtful and so helpful during my three night stay that I will make an exception. This is simply a great hotel, especially if you’re on business and use the executive lounge.  The staff are exceptional. I high recommend it.
",5,2019,01,20
137,Exceptional,"This was our second stay and, once again, we were not disappointed! Exceptional service and staff are wonderful, attentive and charming. Our stay was faultless with a beautifully furnished and well appointed room, delicious breakfast, an incomparable selection of treats in 'the pantry', a sublime, relaxed atmosphere in the lounge and thoughtful 'little extras' at turndown.  The staff are thoughtful without being intrusive, and they manage to predict your every need, even before you do! Without doubt, we will return very soon.",5,2019,01,17
137,Wonderdul stay,We stayed only one night but we appreciated the staff and the place. Delicious breakfast. The Chimney fire in our room was very appreciated. Very central position. Everything was wonderful. We will come back later.,5,2019,01,14
137,The best hotel we've stayed at....EVER!,"We booked this hotel through Costco Travel.  It was definitely a splurge for us, but after reading so many great TA reviews, we decided it was worth it and did a cheaper hotel in Paris to compensate.  

Their customer service is amazing...even before we arrived in London! 

We actually booked them for 7 days, and then discovered we had to move our trip by 1 week.  Unfortunately, it looked like there was a blackout date for all Red Carnation hotels (which Hotel 41 is part of) right in the middle of our new dates, so we couldn't book with them. Costco's travel agent said there was nothing they could do, and recommended I book another hotel.  I contacted Hotel 41 and explained why we needed to move our date (brother-in-law was getting married and booked a venue without knowing we were planning to be out of town), why we chose this trip (for our 10 year anniversary) and asked if there was anyway we could still stay with them.  I even mentioned that we had Hamilton tickets booked and had this vision of being able to walk to Victoria Palace Theatre to see it.  They wrote back immediately, told us they would be happy to have us come.  And within a few minutes, a travel agent from Costco also called me to confirm we could stay with them.  Yay!

We arrived late Sunday night (around 11pm) as there were few cabs available on a by the Pancreas train station, but as soon as we got there, someone greeted us by our names (the staff will always call you Mr. or Mrs.) and took us up the elevator to the Executive Lounge while another staff took our bags to our room.

The Executive Lounge (EL).  I love their Executive Lounge.  It's basically a 2-story room that comprises of your front desk/concierge, lounge, dining room, buffet table, library, and the upstairs has some computers for you to use.

When we arrived at the EL, they offered us a glass of champagne (we could pick from 3 types), we filled out our information and they took a copy of our passports.  Then they had someone show us to our room (he didn't know where the safe us, but it's inside a drawer in the closet).  The decor of the room is beautiful and tasteful in Hotel 41's signature black & white colour scheme.

We weren't tired yet and wanted to explore the EL ""raid the pantry"" offering and have a drink, so we went back and grabbed a table.  There are drink menus which you can choose from or you can make your own drink at the honest bar (just record what you used and your room #, and they'll put it on your incidentals).  We put in our drink menu and then went to plunder their pantry!

Plunder the Pantry: Let me just take a moment to explain this.  In the EL there's a ""buffet"" layout and in the evenings, they have all sorts of hot and cold offerings.  That first night, their hot offering was a Butter Chicken pie, and the cold offerings were little mini mason jars filled with salads (their coronation chicken salad was so good!).  They also had bags of chips (or crisps), popcorn, dried fruit/nuts laid out, and also had a selection of cheese and a couple of individual sized desserts.  Also available is a mini freezer full of Jude's ice cream.  You just help yourself to as many of them as you want!  Drinks will be charged, but anything in the ""pantry"" is free.  

We ate our snacks and then finally went to call it a night.  The bed was super comfortable.  A really nice touch is that they leave a card every evening on your pillow showing the forecast for the next day and a suggestion of what you can do or see. They also had a cake saying Happy 10th Anniversary, and a lovely note welcoming us to the hotel and saying congratulations on our anniversary! 

They also leave other lovely his and her gifts each night on the bed (not sure how they knew which side of the bed we slept on!!), but I won't tell you what they are as it's nice to be so delightfully surprised!

The next day we did some sightseeing during the day before coming back to Hotel 41 to get ready to see Hamilton.  We had asked the staff at the EL desk to make a reservation for a pre-theatre dinner at bbar (a South African restaurant right beside the hotel), which was lovely, and walked 5 minutes to Victoria Palace Theatre to watch the Hamilton musical.  (side note: Hamilton is AMAZING!!!!).

We did debate about doing some post-theatre, but decided to go back to Hotel 41 for that.  That's probably the only negative I can give Hotel 41.  Rather than trying other bars and restaurants for late-night drinks, we would inevitable choose the EL for drinks as they were really good, and the food in the pantry was free!

A nice surprise when we came to our room was they had left us some macaroons with the Hamilton logo on them and a note saying they they hoped we enjoyed our show.  So nice!  Of course this little table was getting crammed as we still hadn't touched the cake from the night before as we were full from plundering the pantry! Lol!

Some random things:
Breakfast:  we had breakfast every morning as it was included in our package.  We ordered a la carte and also did the continental buffet.  My favourite a la carte items were the Eggs Royale (eggs benedict with smoked salmon), Bubble & Squeak, and the Avocado toast with poached eggs.  The yoghurt is amazing in the buffet - highly recommend those.  After a day or two, they knew we both liked our Americano with coffee and milk, so they just asked us if we would like that before preparing it.  there were a couple of mornings where I went for breakfast before my husband, and the staff would say to me, ""I know Mr. Thomas likes his orange juice with his coffee.  Should I bring a glass out for him?"".  My husband definitely liked the fact that his coffee and juice were waiting for him when he got to our table.

Snacks:  i would usually grab a bag of chips/popcorn (the salt & vinegar ones are great) and a bag of dried fruit/nuts in the evening, and then just take them with me the next day while we were sightseeing.  They also had rusks, fruit, and bottles of water by the door, as well as umbrellas, in case you wanted to take some on your way out.

Bathroom:  The toiletries are so nice!!  I wish I could buy this brand in Canada!  They smelled amazing.  Having a towel warmer available was really nice.  There's a huge tub with shower and a standalone shower with multiple heads.  The water pressure and temperature was great.  My only complaint was that we never were able to take a shower without water exiting as whenever we opened the door/partition to get out, there was water everywhere.  

Volume:  One thing we noticed is that people in Paris and London are not as loud as people in Canada and USA.  Everyone speaks in their ""inside voices"" and we learnt quickly to do the same so as not to be rude.  We went to The Curry Room (an Indian restaurant in the Reubens hotel) near the end of our trip for dinner.  It's a small restaurant below ground with only 10 or so tables, of which only 5 or 6 were full.  It was very obvious as to which guests were from North America - they were the loudest!  We could hear entire conversations, and hear the music one of the guests' daughters' was playing on the phone/tablet.  It didn't matter that one of them was around the corner...they were that loud (or, depending on how you look at it, the rest of the restaurant was so quiet).   

Convenience/Transporation:  Hotel 41 is literally around the corner from Buckingham Palace, a 10 minute walk to Westminster Abbey and Westminster Palace, a 5 minute walk to Victoria Station (which connects into 3 lines for the Underground so it takes you almost anywhere you want to go!), a 5 minute walk to Victoria Station for the bus depot (we used this for our tours to the Harry Potter Studio as well as to Bath/Windsor/Stonehenge), and is a 30 second walk to the stop for the Hop On Hop Off bus tours (for both the red and blue buses).  It's in an incredibly convenient location!!  The only thing is if you take a black cab, you might have to say the Reubans Hotel or provide the address.  Many cab drivers didn't know Hotel 41 as it's such a small hotel.

The Staff:  The staff were all lovely...I really can't speak highly enough of them!  From David who welcomed us, to Victoria who always greeted us when we entered/left the building, to Mitchell who always made us feel comfortable and was attentive during breakfast.  Oh, and to Mr. Jones, who made us laugh so much during our Afternoon Tea and told us all about his travels around the world.  My husband, who had never had High/Afternoon tea, was worried about how stuffy/formal/uncomfortable it would be, but Mr. Jones made it so nice for both of us.

Overall the stay was magnificent.  Hotel 41 definitely was, and remains, a highlight of our 10 year anniversary trip to Paris and London!!

I did wonder whether we would be treated differently from other guests as we booked through Costco, but they were lovely to us.",5,2019,01,09
137,Fantastic hotel,My wife and I enjoyed a romantic vacation with superb service from Hotel 41.  We enjoyed starting the day in the executive lounge for breakfast as well as ending it there with snacks.  The staff was very helpful attending to details for us during the day as well.  Can’t wait to come back!,5,2019,01,07
137,Hotel 41 - a Great Place to Stay in London,Hotel 31 is a wonderful small hotel with individualized rooms.located in the heart of Knightsbridge and close to Buckingham Palace.  The  common areas feel like an upscale London club.  A true hidden gem.  Highly recommended.,5,2019,01,07
137,Perfect as always,"We went for our annual Christmas time visit to Hotel 41 and this time actually stayed over Christmas. We arrived on Christmas Eve and stayed for 4 nights in a split level junior suite which we have stayed in previously. 

I honestly cannot give this hotel enough compliments. Everything about it is absolutely perfect. It has to be our favourite hotel in the world. It is just so relaxing and you would never know that you are in the middle of London. All of the staff are very friendly and treat you as a friend and a special mention to Lauren the resident manager who will always stop for a chat. 

We have no negative comments to make on our stay and have already booked again for December 2019 for a pre-Christmas break. 

In addition to the hotel, the Nova complex is also very nice and has a good selection of bars, although we don’t tend to leave the hotel lounge very often!",5,2019,01,07
137,Outstanding as always,"Simply the best hotel in London!
It's easy to forget you are even in London as you leave the noise behind and enter the tranquil world of Hotel 41.
The ""Whatever, Whenever"" button in the room perhaps gives the best insight into the quality of the service.
Breakfast was excellent and the evening canapés, nibbles and small plates menu are incredible, particularly considering they are included in the room rate.",5,2019,01,07
137,Zena,"Just back from another visit to the 41 as always everything was perfect, we were able to watch the fireworks on the rooftop on New Year’s Eve with a glass of champagne, every single member of staff are just wonderful, food excellent bedrooms are fantastic lovely touches from the turndown service hopefully see you again soon ",5,2019,01,04
137,Best ever,I come to this hotel twice a year and it never fails. Service is almost perfect. There are always one or two people at the registration desk who will arrange anything needed. Small (only 28 rooms) but exquisite.,5,2019,01,04
137,Consistently excellent,"Just back from what has become a traditional pre-Christmas stay at 41. The most relaxing yet, as we made sure this time to spend the evening in the Executive Lounge by the fire enjoying sweet and savoury treats from the Pantry, before a great night's sleep and a wonderful breakfast selection the following morning. As ever, we were very well looked after by the entire team who continue to provide an excellent experience for guests.  We look forward to returning in 2019.",5,2018,12,22
137,Perfection,"It’s been a few years since our last stay at 41 and I’m pleased to say it’s still as good as ever.

From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave the team make your stay magical.

Upon arrival there is free flowing champagne and they have an open pantry of delicious snacks and soft drinks.

The rooms a very comfortable and well maintained as are the bathrooms.

The location is just behind Buckingham Palace so it’s a short walk to Piccadilly or Kensington.

It’s just lovely and worth every penny.",5,2018,12,21
137,At Christmas Time✨🥂✨,Hotel 41 is simply wonderful. Welcomed with 🥂🔥 and all the delightful team.. A very special place. We made sure we had time for Cheese Toasties this visit😋 Always so happy here!! Thank you ALL of you💕Absolute perfection in absolutely everyway✨XX,5,2018,12,19
137,"Personal, discrete and exceptional luxury","We stayed here for 1 night, in an Executive King Room. Picked a rate excluding breakfast, so we didn't get to try that.

Our stay was fantastic and we would recommend this to anyone.

Highlights:

+ Incredible staff with impeccable attention to detail. We were addressed by name by most staff members throughout our 1-night stay. They had also noted the Swedish tradition of advent and made a little arrangement around this in our room.

+ Fantastic executive lounge with high-quality nibbles, snacks and food around the clock. There's also a great honesty bar, great seating and a cosy fireplace.

+ The ambiance, atmosphere and service is refined and discrete - yet personal and warm. It truly feels like being at home, but with 5-star service around you.

+ Welcome drink, where 4 different champagnes were on offer. (2 white, 2 rosé)
+ Lovely Penhaligon's toiletries.
+ Excellent turn-down service

I also noted some minor things that I believe can be fine-tuned, which I only mention as I believe there's a genuine interest from management to hear it. It's obvious that 41 strives for perfection.

- No power sockets were easily accessible from the bed
- Lighting controls were a bit too far away from the bed
- The bathtub felt a bit worn and could do with an update
- Same goes for for the fittings in the bathroom, they looked a bit worn and torn with quite a bit of limescale if I remember correctly.
- The wardrobe space could also do with a small face lift.",5,2018,12,17
137,Exceptional Service and Comfort,"Without a doubt this is one of the best hotels i have stayed in. Being Local to the area i only reserve staying at 5 star hotels abroad but this was a treat and a class above the usual hotels.
There is so much character to the hotel and rooms themselves. The breakfast spread was amazing and plenty of options for a vegetarian like myself. 
The bathroom was clean, spacious and full of all complementary toiletries. 
Warm and cosy beds.
Highly recommend 
",5,2018,12,12
137,Simply exceptional,"I've stayed in many 5 star luxury hotels...none come close to Hotel 41. This was a truly exceptional experience.

Pros:
- they read your mind and seem to know what you want before you even ask.
- staff are wonderfully attentive without being intrusive.
- excellent rest in a very comfortable bed.
- incredible attention to detail both in the room and around the hotel.
- stunningly beautiful hotel.

Cons:
- none",5,2018,12,06
137,Fabulous from beginning to end,Spent 3 nights here for my 50th Birthday. Suite was amazing and immaculate. Little touches like pillow spray before bed make it extra special. Bed very comfortable. All staff very polite & can't do enough for you. Breakfast delicious. Will definitely return.,5,2018,12,06
137,The Best Service Ever - Loved it!,"We stayed at the 41 Hotel for 3 nights during our honeymoon. We received a warm welcome with champagne and dessert. The staff were absolutely wonderful. They helped us plan our trip at every turn and really cared about our experience. It felt nice to come in at the end of the day and chat with the staff and get their advice. They'll remind you to take an umbrella or book things for you and point you in the right direction. They help you WITHOUT HESITATION. You never feel like you're bothering them or you're a burden. We've stayed at properties like the FS, Ritz, etc. and the service is on par, if not much better.

There's also a lovely executive lounge where there are free snacks. Every day in your room they'll leave you something new or cute like eye cream or something. If you like to feel special - stay here.

I'll definitely be back.",5,2018,12,04
137,"Remarkable, Generous & Kind!","I have booked just one night at Hotel 41, as I was curious to know the reasons behind all of these positive reviews, and I wasn’t disappointed! Since the first moment the hotel treated me with generosity, as I’ve arrived to the hotel around 6am and I knew that the check-in time was 2pm, but without any hesitation, they checked me in one of the rooms till my room was ready. 
The staff was amazingly kind and helpful, the bed was so comfortable and the sleeping experience was second to none. 
I wish they had bidet in the bathrooms. Otherwise the stay was a happy story to tell!",5,2018,12,03
137,Impeccable!,"I have to say that the service we received was impeccable. The staff were all so polite and could not do enough for us. We commented that whilst we were over the road from Buckingham Palace, we felt like we were in it with a the plentiful and super professional staff on hand for our every need. The room was immaculate and the bed linen perfect. The breakfast was delicious served in the beautiful lounge again by staff who were incredibly attentive. The Curry Room at the Rubens next door was also fantastic.We will most certainly return.",5,2018,12,03
137,The Staff Are The Best!,"Recently stayed for a couple of nights while having a short break in London. Due to all the amazing reviews from Trip Advisor we decided to try the hotel for our first stay at this location. From the moment you walk in to when you leave the fantastic staff cannot do enough for you and they are all so helpful and friendly and i would imagine if travelling on your own this hotel would be ideal. From entering the building you take the lift to the 5th floor where the hotel and its 28 rooms are located. very cosy and intimate and a very nice lounge where you can check in and also serves as the breakfast/dinner area and evening drinks. Lovely wooden features and an open fire with very comfortable chairs and couches. The breakfast was wonderful with an extensive choice and excellent service. The rooms are very nice although rather small with all amenities and good size bathroom. Evening drinks are a must as they serve you with free snacks, the toasted sandwiches are amazing! I would fully recommend this hotel as a special treat for a couple of nights. The only faults are it is a small hotel with narrow passageways and it can feel a bit claustrophobic at times and maybe the check in should be on the ground floor and not on the 5th in the lounge as the lounge can get very busy especially at breakfast time. It is also extremely warm which did feel a bit uncomfortable at times even with a t-shirt. It is in a great location close to Buckingham Palace and Green Park and only a 20 minute walk from the West End! As mentioned before though the staff are simply the best!",5,2018,12,01
137,Excellent in every way,"This hotel is one of the greatest hotels in London.
I have stayed there a few days ago again and the service that was already excellent, has even been improved.
The staff is just perfect, giving a more than a perfect service.
The rooms are exquisite .
There is just nothing bad to say about the hotel. Just go there and see for yourself",5,2018,11,29
137,Surpassed my expectations!,"What a treat to have spent a couple of days at the beginning of my husband and I's 10 year Europe trip here. I expected big things based on the reviews, and Hotel 41 certainly delivered. I don't even know where to start... From the champagne when we first arrived, to friendly assistance in finding fun things to do, to the dairy free lattes being delivered to our room after wake up each morning, to the cosy lounge, to the delicious packed lunch for our train ride to Paris....the list goes on. The care, detail and service at this hotel is exceptional. Thank you for creating memories for my husband and I that we will never forget.",5,2018,11,26
137,Excellent,"We stayed here for one night for some Christmas shopping, although we only live up the road in North London. The hotel was absolutely excellent. It felt small and intimate, the service was very good (but not intrusive) and the quality of everything in the room was was top-notch. Little touches like lighting the fire in our room or leaving a hot water bottle, or the champagne trolley on arrival, add to the experience. I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants a quality stay away from the hullabaloo of other bigger 5* London hotels.",5,2018,11,25
137,Super nice ,"Stayed her with my daughter on our last night, wished I had made it 2.
We arrived a bit early and was taken up to the club lounge where we sat in the lovely surroundings and enjoyed a complimentary glass of champagne. Very good location an easy walk from the station and heaps of restaurants. 
Hotel was beautiful. Staff all so friendly. Our room was the nicest of our stay, we had some delicious sweets in our room, free water and a cosy fireplace. In the evening the staff came to turn down the bed and left us with a hot water bottle and some eye cream , a nice touch. Lounge had a great atmosphere to just relax and enjoy a drink in the evening, and enjoy the included nibbles. We went to the bag o nails for our evening meal, then came to lounge and enjoyed cheese and biscuits.  Later in the night we tried the tubs of ice cream. 
Would definitely recommend this place ",5,2018,11,18
137,The Best,"I’be been several times there and is my prefered hotel in London. Staff is amazing, they are always ready to help you, anticipate your needs, and the best is they are effective always! Last time I was arriving late everywhere but cominicating with them by email they helped to manage and change my bookings (restaurants & shows) on the go. It is a small hotel but very comfortable, you feel there like in a club where you have been member since 10 yrs ago and everybody knows you. At same time is very quiet. Location in front of Buckingham Palace and near Victora is perfect also. Only one warning, as it is small you should book in maximum advance because some times is fully booked (although they manage to help you to find another hotel nearby).  Only good memories about 41!",5,2018,11,13
137,Home Away from Home,"This was my third visit to Hotel 41 and it did not disappoint! The staff were incredibly welcoming and helpful, making me feel at home. They were happy to accommodate my last minute change for my car transfer with no issues. My room was comfortable and beautiful, as always. I continue to love how well situated the hotel is to so many locations, including a quick walk to the Tube. Hotel 41 has become my home away from home while in London and I can’t wait to return on my next trip!",5,2018,11,12
137,Quite literally my favorite hotel in the world!,"As good as the big five star hotels are (Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, Montage, etc.) they can’t even begin to compete with the quality and service of Hotel 41. The experience in the executive lounge is unmatched by any other hotel, whether it’s the extraordinary made to order breakfast menu, afternoon tea, complementary snacks or simply lounging about to read a book, the service is simultaneously unobtrusive and the most attentive I have ever experienced. The subtle and thoughtful touches in the room are beyond compare. Personalized cookies wishing us a good time at the theater; a hot water bottle in our bed when we returned to warm our sheets. Unheard of! If I could choose one hotel to stay at in Europe, this would be the one!",5,2018,11,12
137,Impeccable service with the Queen as your neighbor.,"Literally right across the street from the Queens residence, the Hotel 41 is a hotel within a hotel, situated on the 5th floor of the Rubens hotel. From the time you enter until the time you check out you cant help but be impressed with the level of service you get from every single hotel employee you meet.

The rooms are a little tight but we did have a king size bed and were able to function fine in the room.

Without even having to go outside you can walk through to the Rubens hotel and have afternoon tea, a great dinner at the English Grill or a drink at one of the bars.
 
Victoria station and the tube entrance are less than a 5 minute walk. This is a great location for tourists.",5,2018,11,07
137,Service and location second to none!,Before we even arrived on Oct. 29th the staff at the hotel was contacting us to see what they could arrange for us ahead of time. Upon our arrival we were treated like royalty. They gave us champagne and a comfort room to store our luggage and freshen us. Once our rom was ready they upgraded us without our asking. The room was on 2 stories complete with fireplace. The breakfast and afternoon tea were amazing. It is close to some theatres and right next to Buckingham Palace. We will stay here again!,5,2018,11,07
137,God Save the Queen. And 41. ,"My wife and I had the good fortune to stay at this hotel for about a week. The hotel has a great location next to Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station. Essentially, everything in London is within reach. But what makes this hotel special isn’t the location, nor the building itself. It’s the employees, who are clearly well trained in hospitality and have an obvious love for what they do. They are kind, friendly, helpful and always seem to have the answers when the questions are asked. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at 41 and will be back when in London again. ",5,2018,11,07
137,Wonderful Experience ,"We opted to celebrate our 12th anniversary with a weekend stay at Hotel41 and were treated to an upgrade. It was a surprise that was very much appreciated and the split-level suite and its facilities were exceptional. There was a handwritten note, a bowl of fruit and later a small cake to welcome us. Housekeeping made sure the room was always in good condition and there were even lotions and a hot water bottle on my bed during evening turndowns. Certainly most thoughtful as unbeknownst, I was suffering from a sprained back. 

Staff took time to cater to our needs and made sure that we were comfortable yet were unobtrusive and afforded us privacy. Questions were always answered and requests were looked into very quickly. There were staff that delivered professional service yet extended themselves to ensure that we were happy. We genuinely appreciated how Mitchell would take the time to check in on us and provide us with suggestions on where to go and what we could see and do; then there was Paula at breakfast who took really good care of us from the beginning of our meal till we were ready to leave the lounge; on our last evening there was quietly affable Gabriel who plied us with snacks and took the time to introduce and explain what was available to plunder at the snack bar. The different salads in jars were scrumptious! 

Hotel41 definitely deserves its rating on TripAdvisor and we did not regret choosing it as the accommodation to mark the important milestone in our marriage. The treatment we received was worth it! Although not all staff were as friendly or forthcoming, we were not overly bothered by this as Hotel41 really exceeded our expectations in making our stay more comfortable and all-inclusive as compared to our initial stay in another 5* establishment along Regent Street. This will most certainly be our accommodation of choice if we ever return to London. ",5,2018,11,06
137,Beautiful hotel,"Absolutely fantastic hotel, right across the street from Buckingham Pslave. Extremely good service , top notch!!! The only negative would be that the rooms are very small which is not uncommon in Europe. Every night they left something in your room such as chocolates, rose petals etc. I would also highly recommend the tea and dinner at the English Grille in the Ruben. ( essentially hotel 41 is the 5th floor of the Ruben but you have a separate entrance",5,2018,11,06
137,Stephen,"Wonderful hotel full of fantastic attentive staff.
Classic English style and atmosphere makes it extra special -a proper London hotel!
Loved the executive lounge and all the snacks available on the house.
Loved the fire place and fire on my arrival to my bedroom so cozy and inviting.

Breakfast was fantastic.
Absolutely no complaints
I’ll be back.",5,2018,11,04
137,First Visit ,"Thank you for a wonderful first stay. I enjoyed every second of it. All the staff friendly and I thank them for that. Special thanks go to the reception team for booking and then cancelling the dinner reservation several times, to Stephen for his kindness when the week didn’t go to plan, to the housekeeping staff - I loved the little touches on turndown and all the chefs, kitchen staff, waitresses and waiters the food was superb. I am looking forward to another stay soon. Sue xx",5,2018,11,04
137,Truly amazing 5* and more,"This was our second visit to hotel 41 as we first visited last year for our 25th anniversary and were so impressed came back for our 26th. This hotel is simply the best, from the moment you step through the door to the moment you leave the service is impeccable and personal. The lounge is a haven to relax in with wonderful food and drinks whenever you want. The rooms are truly Devine, we were lucky enough to be upgraded to the conservatory suite, wow amazing. Im not sure we will ever find a hotel to top 41 and hope we are fortunate enough to be able to return next year.",5,2018,11,02
137,I loved 41 ?,"The hotel was in a great location. We loved the little feeling and attention to guests.

first of all?
I am very happy to save money thanks to this magic place: savehotel.ml

the manager, was overdone. She welcomed us and assisted with all our needs. She and her staff really make you feel special. The room was very spacious, clean, large and comfortable.

Will stay again when I am in London.",5,2018,11,01
137,Amazing hotel!,I can’t say enough wonderful things about our experience at Hotel 41!  The staff in particular from Steven to Dean to Mitchell just made us feel like we were part of the 41 family.   I can say without question the best travel experience my wife and I have ever had.  We plan to visit London again in the next year and the only hotel we will stay at is 41!   Cheers!,5,2018,10,31
137,Outstanding,"What can I say more than it was Great. The standard service is beyond anything I have ever  experienced. I  have stayed in many fine hotels, but this might just be the finest.  The bedding and linen were all top drawer and comfy.",5,2018,10,30
137,Royal Treatment in a Royal Hotel,"The service and attention paid to guests was excellent. I could not have asked for more. Location was great, just a short walk to Buckingham Palace. Lots of other destinations that you could walk to or take a short Uber/cab ride.",5,2018,10,27
137,Amazing place to stay! ,"Most amazing hotel we have ever been! Service is 5 stars, rooms are clean and comfortable, we only stayed for a couple of nights and were quite sad to leave. Food is also excellent! 
Worth every penny!",5,2018,10,24
137,Loved it great stay,I go every year sometimes the cleanliness in the rooms could do with extra attention staff especially the lad with curly hair very attentive always great .the rooms very very clean .i love it pool are great,5,2018,10,24
137,One of the Finest,"From the glass of champagne at check in, hot water bottle in bed, candle lite every evening in the bedroom to the toasties at the executive lounge.... what else could you ask for. The location was perfect, the staff is top notch (Mr. Steve Jones is in his element) and the hotel amenities are far beyond what you would expect.  

Our stay at Hotel 41 was top notch and absolutely perfect.",5,2018,10,20
137,Perfect 20the Wedding Anniversary Stay,"Our first trip to London staying at Hotel41 exceeded my already high expectations knowing that it is a 5 star rated hotel.  We stayed in an Executive King room. The room had every amenity you could imagine,  including towel warmers in the bathroom, separate tub and shower stall, desk stocked with every office supply you might need ( I needed a staple remover and stapler).  Nespresso machine and hot pot also in the room.  The quality and efficiency of the service throughout the hotel was of a level I have not experienced ever.  The check-in experience, the sincerity and the warmth of the greetings leaving the hotel for the day or coming back , the efficiency of taking orders for breakfast, after dinner drinks , the clearing of plates is unrivaled.  I asked about adapters for outlets and they were plugged in for me on arrival to the room. I will miss the Hotel41 and look forward to coming back.  The competence, professionalism and sincerity of everyone onsite from the maid service to the manager is most impressive.  As they are apt to say in the UK, simply, ""brilliant.""",5,2018,10,17
137,Hidden Gem,"My wife and I with our 8 yo son and 10 yo daughter stayed at Hotel 41 for four consecutive nights and then a single night when we came back from Paris to fly back to California.
We all had a great time.
The staff were amazing!
The Lounge was a huge highlight of our trip too.  Great food and beautiful place to hang out after dinner.
Kids loved Jude’s ice cream at the lounge.
The black coconut flavor is amazing.
The location of the hotel is perfect too.
Half a mile from Hyde Park made it perfect for running and they have a couple of nice gyms within a block of the hotel",5,2018,10,14
137,Incredible,"This was the most incredible, unique experience for us for a hotel stay.  We stayed 5 nights and the staff are amazing.  The room was great (usual London sized), but the experience was fantastic.  I couldn't imagine staying anywhere else in London.  Every hotel we have stayed at and will stay at will probably not compare to this place.  Other hotels need to take a lesson.",5,2018,10,14
137,"First class, amazing all around","From the moment we checked in until we left 5 days later we were thoroughly impressed. The staff was very helpful booking tickets to any activities that interested us, the food from breakfast to dinner being offered right there in the private lounge was top notch and delicious. The maid service was above and beyond with nice little night cap gifts each evening. The rooms were very tastefully done with deep soaking tubs and very comfortable accommodations. The knowledge and service of all the concierge was great, everyone was very eager to assist and very helpful with questions. The fire in the private lounge area was very warm and inviting after a long day of exploring the city. The location of the hotel was perfect, walking to all the parks and attractions as well as the Victoria train station for further exploring. We will definitely stay at this location anytime we are in London, top notch, 5 stars to all the wonderful staff.",5,2018,10,12
137,Right at home! ,"The hotel is amazing but what made this stay so special was the wonderful staff!  They were helpful with anything I needed from arranging a car for the airport to the attention and personal service at breakfast.  The rooms are beautifully decorated and the bed is so comfortable! Every amenity you could possibly need is available and this is a great location right by Buckingham Palace. Being a small boutique hotel has its advantages with such personal service.  Bravo Hotel 41!  Looking forward to another visit in the future! 
",5,2018,10,09
137,Excellent staff responsiveness,"Our stay at Hotel 41 was our best hotel experience in 40 years. The staff was excellent and everyone was very responsive to any questions and requests. After a couple days, they were aware of our dietary restrictions and made sure they were reflected in the excellent breakfasts and snacks throughout the day. The hotel is very centrally located near Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station.",5,2018,10,07
137,One of the very best hotels I have ever visited! ,"My daughter (aged 14) and me stayed at the hotel for one night. What a pleasure! The hotel is luxury, and the staff are just very very nice, and make you feel special and wellcome. Pure luxury, at the same time a relaxed and friendly athmosphere. 

The breakfast/ lounge/ restaurant room is just like an old fashioned adventure. We had a drink there after the restaurant, and the staff made a very nice alchohol-free drink for my daughter (and the very best Margarita for me).

The stay was completed with a very nice breakfast. 

We will be back 41! You are a hidden pearl, I hope many people with find you. 

The hotel is very close to Buckingham Palace. We had a nice walk passing by the castle through Green Park and then you are in the middle of everything.  Victoria station is also just 3-5 minutes walk from the hotel. 

Best regards Kristin 
",5,2018,10,05
137,Stunning and elegant!,"We absolutely loved this hotel. The location couldn't be better; an oasis of quiet and calm but steps away from the nightlife and Victoria Station (as well as the underground). 
The staff thought of everything! We particularly enjoyed evening drinks which always included canapés and ""toasties"". We discovered the ice cream fridge early on and together managed to sample six out of a possible ten varieties. We're coming back soon to try the rest!",5,2018,10,02
137,Fantastic place to stay.,"What makes this place special is not the fantastic location, nor the great room, not the spectacular service. It is the staff. Friendly, helpful, and just all around nice. We had a fantastic stay, walking distance to all kinds of places, but the people really helped make the experience one of the best I have ever had traveling. Thank you.",5,2018,10,02
137,Perfection!,"Outstanding experience.  Great facilities, but staff made the experience.  Every single person I met was professional, cordial, and went out of their way to make me feel at home and make my holiday a success.",5,2018,10,01
137,1st Class with some more!,"We had a fantastic time, the hotel, staff, bedrooms, exec lounge, food and ""plunder in the pantry"" were all 'simply the best'. The 3 days were not long enough, anyone visiting this hotel need to consider spending more time at the Hotel, breakfast was great, dinner at the Rubens 1st class but evenings in the Exec Lounge was brilliant.",5,2018,09,28
137,Gem of a hotel,"We stayed here to celebrate my husband's 50th Birthday.  From the minute we arrived, we were made to feel special and welcome.  The staff were all amazing; they were always on hand to help and advise but not in an overpowering way.  This is just the most wonderful hotel and we will definitely come back for our next big celebration.",5,2018,09,27
137,Wow ,"Fantastic place, fantastic staff and fantastic atmosphere! Felt so comfortable and relaxed and like I didn’t want to go home after my visit, I would recommend to friends and family and will definitely revisit this hotel. ",5,2018,09,26
137,Fabulous Beautiful Hotel!,"Hotel 41 is simply wonderful!  It is extremely lovely and every aspect is special!  The location is excellent and centralized for getting around in the city of London.  The lounge for meals was so beautiful and very comfortable, and the food was very well done for breakfast each morning. We loved it!  Our room was great and was maintained perfectly every day.   One of the most special aspects about the hotel is the absolutely wonderful staff!  Each and every one of them made us feel very welcomed and important and were exceptionally helpful.  I have no doubt that when we return to London, we will be staying at Hotel 41 again!",5,2018,09,24
137,Birthday trip,"This is my second time staying at Hotel 41 and it was wonderful! This visit was with my mom and aunt. My aunt had several special dining and room requests and the staff were incredibly accommodating. We were visiting for my mom's birthday and the hotel had a special piece of birthday cake waiting for her in our room, such a lovely touch. All of the staff are just really top notch, I can't say enough about the support from my initial emails with Adele, to Lauren, Victoria and Gabriel once at the hotel. Thank you for such an amazing visit.",5,2018,09,23
137,Small but miraculous!!!!,"Everything was perfect! Our arrival was warm with a glass of champaign. The Room was very comfortable with enough space for our suitcases and absolutely marvellous! Every detail is special, even the slippers were separated with 'His' & 'Hers' bags! The amenities were wonderfoul and the maids were adding the missing ones. the breakfast also, even though the place is quite small, had almost everything! Everybody makes you feel like a Queen & a King! many thanks!",5,2018,09,18
137,Luxury hotel!!,"Me and my wife stayed at this hotel for one night,just to try an exclusive hotel during our stay in London 
Everything,from the staff,the decor , the detail and the atmosphere generally,was perfect.
The breakfast was delicious .The private lounge was beutiful
 The room including the bathroom was extremely spacious. Location was perfect with a short walk from Victoria Station. It is a short way if you want to visit the Royal Mews which is located just across the street from the hotel. Buckingham Palace is a just down the street. The drinks in the executive lounge after a day of sightseeing is really relaxing. Absolutely worth a visit",5,2018,09,17
137,Simply the best,"If you enjoy the chi-chi chic, bling-bling, ostentatious type of 5 star hotel, well, Hotel 41 is not for you. However, if you enjoy unassuming elegance, uncompromising quality, and superior personalised service, then you'll absolutely love this boutique hotel. Located on the 5th floor of the buildlng, you could pass by the discrete entrance of this hotel without noticing it. But as soon as you present yourself at the door, that first impression of extremely attentive service is not just an impression. We were  welcomed with a glass of champagne and small hors d'oeuvres, while we waited just 15 minutes or so as they finished preparing our room, requested for early check-in.. We felt pampered throughout our 7 day stay. Rooms are of a very respectable size, spotlessly clean, and well appointed. The hotel is very quiet, which ensured a good night's sleep after walking 15kms every day. The ""reception"" on the fifth floor feels like the comfortable common room of an old English manor. We ""plundered the pantry"" pretty much every night, enjoying Gelato after our evenings out. Staff are extremely polite and helpful. This hotel is well situated - close to Victoria station if you need to take the Tube or are hopping on the Gatwick Express. The excellent reviews of travellers and independent ratings in travel publications are truly deserved.",5,2018,09,15
137,Continues to be the best,"We arrived from an overnight flight at 8:a.m., tired and bedraggled, knowing our check in time wasn’t for hours.Although our room wasn’t ready, Hotel 41 brought our luggage to a “courtesy room,” which was one of their standard rooms, where we napped until our booked room was ready. Hotel 41 then upgraded us to a junior suite. The service, as always, was perfect. This is truly a great hotel and I can’t wait to come back.",5,2018,09,13
137,1st visit to London ,"Absolutely loved my 6 days in Hotel 41. The rooms were comfortable, the pillows my favourite!The staff just gave you their utmost service. Nothing was beyond them in trying to please and make our stay memorable. We would love to return to this splendid Hotel. Superb in every way !
",5,2018,09,11
137,Our Recent Stay,This is a 28 room boutique hotel located on the 5th floor with a small ground floor entry. The service is excellent and what you would expect and desire....best service I have ever experienced while travelling. The rooms are cozy and very comfortable...shower is excellent and set-up as a rain shower and they have a separate bathtub with shower. The bath products are wonderful...Penhaligon's of London....brought these back with us. The hotel is located adjacent to the Royal Mews which is part of Buckingham Palace. There are several Bar/Restaurants as part of a outdoor pavilion to the left of the hotel as you leave if you get hungry or want a drink at night. One tip for this area and London in general...there are several street closures due to construction so give yourself extra time to get to places or to get to tours .,5,2018,09,09
137,London,"Can I rate more than 5 stars?  Wonderful hotel with wonderful people.  Odd little place, only the 5th floor of Rubens Hotel, but what charm!  Lots packed into a small space.  In London to celebrate birthday and 25th anniversary and I actually felt cherished by the whole staff.  Patrycja's smiling face every morning at breakfast a bonus. One block to Buckingham Palace, one block to Victoria Palace Theatre to see Hamilton. Excellent hotel, excellent trip.  I would return to 41 any time in London.",5,2018,09,08
137,Superb!!!,"Visited with my wife on her birthday and, having held our wedding at another Red Carnation hotel, had high expectations which were more than met by the warm, friendly welcome and marvellous service we experienced throughout our stay.

The room was extremely comfortable and of a good size, well presented and maintained. The champagne on ice, candles and rose petals arrayed when we returned from our evening out was a fabulous touch and made for an even more memorable occasion.

Breakfast was brilliant, and they catered for my wife’s vegan diet superbly well.

You will not be disappointed at Hotel 41! 

",5,2018,09,08
137,The friendliest staff,"The staff truly make a stay at 41 exceptional. They are so friendly and so willing to help. The location of this hotel is perfect, so close to Buckingham Palace. The tube station Victoria is less than a 5 minute walk and allows you to be anywhere fast. 
Breakfast is delicious and includes some real British treats. 
We thoroughly enjoyed the Afternoon Tea that we booked as an extra. 
The snacks available all day and night are also delicious.
Our room was perfect.",5,2018,09,07
137,FABULOUS Hotel! Attention to detail is unrivaled.,"I made a great choice selecting Hotel 41 as the destination to celebrate my 50th Birthday. It was the attention they gave to the smallest details that made my stay extra special. It begin upon my arrival, with having my room ready way before the advertised 2:00pm check-in. I was amazed when I got to my room, they had a small birthday cake and sweets for me. Part of my trip included seeing the musical Hamilton, and to my shock they prepared macaroons with the logo for Hamilton, and an note to enjoy the show.Turn down service with candles and rose petals and a staff that was attentive, helpful and available to handle your every request puts Hotel 41 above all the rest. I would definitely stay here again. Loved every minute of my visit.",5,2018,09,06
137,We will be back!,"Thank you for such a special visit. So happy I came across this little gem of a hotel when looking for something very special and a little bit different for my husbands 40th birthday treat. 
We were both sad to leave today after being looked after so well where all the staff actually took the time to get to know us by name and do everything possible to ensure we had a great weekend.
The birthday champagne and cake were also lovely gestures!! 
A big shout out to Steve Jones - a really interesting guy happy to share all his tips and travel ideas.
We would love to come back soon to try out the new roof top terrace ;)
This hotel is well worth the price tag! Great value for a hotel of this quality in London. 
Thanks again, Sarah and Gareth Evans x",5,2018,09,02
137,BOUTIQUE HOTEL - EXCEPTIONAL,"We have once again stayed at Hotel 41 - without a doubt it is one of the best hotels we have stayed in - exceptional service, surroundings and facilities.  When you walk in it is like walking into your own oasis of peacefulness and wonderful staff who are there to help you.  Special thanks to Magdalena, Lauren Hargrave, Lauren & Marlen whose help was invaluable.  We will be back next year to sample the wonderful hospitality received at Hotel 41.  Thanks once again from the both of us.",5,2018,08,30
137,One of the best hotels we have stayed in,This discrete boutique hotel is one of the best places we have stayed in. Tucked away above the Reubens Hotel it is ideally placed for sightseeing in the capital< Although quite small it has all the facilities you need and much more besides. The staff are incredibly attentive and nothing is too much trouble. Breakfast was good and there were a range of snacks available throughout the day. Rooms are a good size and very well equipped. It is quite expensive but definitely value for money,5,2018,08,29
137,Magnificent ,"Gorgeous boutique style hotel located very close to Buckingham Palace. It’s a small hotel next to the much larger Ruebens Hotel. The reception team make you feel so welcome on arrival. The glass of champagne and canapés were a welcome treat after a long car journey. The rooms are lovely. Mainly decorated in black and white. They are very modern, but classically English at the same time.. a unique blend of interior design. The staff are very helpful for reservations, advice etc. The breakfast is lovely and hot dishes are cooked to perfection. Breakfast should be savoured that this place... don’t rush it.. it’s simply divine. The lounge area with sweet treats is a lovely touch. We were treated to a room upgrade part way through our stay which was a lovely gesture and allowed us to stay in their beautiful conservatory suite which is simple exquisite. I can’t recommend this hotel enough. Great location, great rooms and great staff... everything you need ! Well done Hotel 41.",5,2018,08,28
137,"Lovely hotel, great staff","Stayed for a couple of nights, the hotel is great and the staff are very good. 

Wr didnt have breakfast but the canapes later in the day were very nice. 

The location is fab, 5 mins from Victoria so great transport links. 

The bedrooms are well appointed if somewhat small but the whole hotel is quirky (good).  

Attention to detail by the staff is excellent.

The toiletries provided are high end.  The shower is amazing, phenomenal water pressure.  Beds are comfy.  

Lovely as a treat and perfect for a special occasion, not sure id stretch to this price point unless it was a special occasion. ",5,2018,08,26
137,Another incredible stay,"We had a three night stay and had a wonderful time.  All of the staff were amazing, remembering what we liked to eat and drink on the first day, and making us feel extremely comfortable from the beginning of our time at the Hotel 41.  The 41 is an intimate boutique hotel, with excellent and personalized customer service.  We will certainly return to the hotel when we’re in London.",5,2018,08,24
137,Simply amazing,"We stayed at the hotel for our anniversary . All I can say is  it was just beautiful was start to finish . The staff , the decor , the attention to detail and the atmosphere simply perfect. I’ve been lucky enough to stay at beautiful hotels all over the world , but this one is magnificent. Everyone in the place cares . They lit candles in the evening for when we returned , the breakfast is delicious . The private lounge beautiful . I love it all . Had a fabulous time and would recommend you stay . Basically the best hotel in London , I’ve stayed at all the big pricey places . Never again , I’ll be back here . One day they might adopt me and I can just live there full time .",5,2018,08,23
137,Perfect!,"We just returned from a 10th anniversary trip to London and Edinburg.  I spent much time researching the right hotels for our trip.  Hotel 41 was simply amazing!  The staff were all friendly and extremely helpful and everyone knew our names!  They had a special anniversary cake and bottle of champagne for us which was so incredibly special.  

The room including the bathroom was extremely spacious.  Location was perfect.  Just a short walk to Victoria Station.  We really enjoyed our visit to the Royal Mews which is located across the street from the hotel.  Buckingham Palace is a little further down the road.  The complimentary treats throughout the day, canapés in the evening, ice cream and late night pantry are all additional benefits of this hotel at no additional cost.  Drinks in the executive lounge after a day of sightseeing was so relaxing. It's such a great value!

We'll return!",5,2018,08,20
137,One Night Theatre Visit,"It is really hard to get the correct tone for this review as so many brilliant and colourful reviews already exist.  There is little point in repeating what is already plain, almost all of which we would agree with, highlighting the exceptional care are friendliness of the hotel team and the intimate “club” like feel.

Our room was a little dim looking into a very unattractive courtyard which was a little disappointing but not disastrous.

Is it the best hotel in London?  This depends what you want from a hotel, but based entirely on the fact we stayed at another of their wonderful hotels, The Milestone, I would say it could only possibly be 2nd best.

A lovely stay nevertheless.

",5,2018,08,16
137,Enchanting hideaway in the centre of London,"This was my second visit, and if at all possible this place is better than on my previous visit.  It’s a bolt hole, private, and the service is impeccable.   No traffic noise, well appointed rooms and enormously comfortable.

I can only say that we will return again and again.  You will see from other reviews that I am someone who travels the world frequently, and I do have my favourite hotels in different capital cities.  This is the one for London.",5,2018,08,15
137,The best of the best in London,"My second stay at this hideaway in the centre of London.  It is a superb hidden gem in the centre of a busy city.  The quality of this place is unbeatable, and the service and help for guests is like no other in the world.

We will return as we thoroughly enjoyed our short stay.",5,2018,08,15
137,Excellent hotel,"41 made us feel like royalty for a week! Everything was taken care of for us, the staff is so attentive and kind, they also give great recommendations for tour companies and food. The location of the hotel is great as well. I really appreciate how the staff went above and beyond. Thank you all again!",5,2018,08,14
137,A very good option.,"We have recently enjoyed a three night stay in a split level suite which was a pleasant experience.
All staff were helpfull and attentive, all our needs were met and without doubt this hotel does deserve it's ranking amongst the higher echelons of London hotels.
Breakfast is a quiet and relaxed affair and the lounge is comfortable. 
Our room was a reasonable size with all you would expect for the price paid.
The location is excellent, walking is a pleasure and all you need is close at hand.

A big shout out to all the staff we encountered and a big thank you.

This hotel is ran like a Special Forces Unit, 99.9% need not apply!",5,2018,08,14
137,Outrageously Good,"Well, what can I say. I was left spellbound by their service and the comfort and amenities.

The location is absolutely amazing.

If you have the money, go for it. You won't regret it. Even at this price, this gives you the highest bang for the buck in such a central location of London.",5,2018,08,05
137,The Hotel that keeps on delivering a 5-star experience…,"I’ve left my fair share of reviews every time we come back to 41Hotel, for a very good reason! 

This Hotel is and absolutely deserves to be number 1! 

The service, personalised experience, familiar faces, staff and location all make for this hotel being one easy way to get comfortable when travelling back to London and almost has a way of making you feel ... like you never left or that you're part of the family! 

Another exceptional stay which has a lot to do with the staff.

Thank you again!",5,2018,08,04
137,Nice find,Travelling its fun and sometimes tiring I'm so glad I stayed here. Very clean and great service. Worth every penny. Highly recommend to you all travellers or even if you visiting this place is just amazing find. See u next time :). Thank you,5,2018,08,03
137,Luxury at its finest!,"I found Hotel 41, here on trip advisor. My husband and I came to London as a part of our 20th wedding anniversary. I cannot express enough about this hotel! The staff put effort in every detail. We arrived and checked in early from a red eye flight. The staff took our luggage and guided us to the executive lounge to complete check in. First, we were offered a delicious complimentary glass of champagne. Our room wasn’t quite ready, which we expected. We stayed in the executive lounge and were presented with snacks and comfort while we waited (no more than 15 minutes). After arriving to the room, In which Adele assisted us to; along with giving us information and plenty of advice of things to do, we slowly took in the details of this beautiful room in 01. Very beautiful and clean. They even surprised us with a cake and chocolates! (Thank you!) We took Stefen’s advice (every piece of advice he gave us) and stayed up until 9pm to help with our jet lag. The executive lounge is where we ate our included delicious breakfast- I recommend the eggs Benedict. This is also where we gladly retreated for a night cap every evening. They have snacks all day and through the evening, along with delicious ice cream (my favorites were the black coconut and also the flat white), along with a top shelf selection of wine and spirits. Hotel 41 has amazing staff- forgive me if I fail to mention your name: Adele, Stefen, Max, Greta... You’re all amazing and I will absolutely recommend this stay! ",5,2018,08,02
137,Hotel 41 Meets The Royal Standard of Excellence,"My stay at 41 more than exceeded my expectations. From cheerful manners, attentive service, exceptional surroundings, practical help, delicious food and fine conversation, the entire staff enriched my trip to London in every possible way. I was treated like a highly honored guest.  ",5,2018,07,31
137,Best of the best,"Perfect location, one of the best hotels I have ever been to . The staff is friendly, good looking and well trained! We had maybe the best Beef Wellington we ever tried and despite the high rates we will definetely return back here! Cheers to John, Liza and Pawel for everything!",5,2018,07,31
137,Am I too old to say OMG!?,"Third visit to Hotel41 and I still get goose bumps thinking about it. 

Not sure that there is anything else to say that hasn’t already be said. This place is simply perfect. Yes it is expensive but worth every single penny because of the way you are treated and the attention to detail that is given to every aspect of the visit.

My suggestion is as follows. Stop reading the reviews and just book. Go! Take the significant other in your life, pack a bag and get there.

Thank you Hotel41. For everything. See you for visit number 4 some time in 2019.",5,2018,07,29
137,Sublime,"It's hard to know where to begin with this review. With a heavy heart I have just returned back to the 'real world' of my own home and the daily grind of real life and work. The office is looming ominously for me in the morning yet my mind is a million miles away from it: I'm reflecting so fondly over the last 24 hours during my all to brief stay at Hotel 41. 

I still smell sweetly of the Penhaligons products supplied. I wanted to take them all home with me but I resisted the temptation. I also wanted to take away the monogrammed soft fluffy towels. And the sheets. And even just one of the pillows from the huge pillow menu. And the robes. And the slippers. And even the unique piped fragrance throughout the hotel (which I believe I'll be able to in a few months time I'm told as it might be made available to buy!) I wanted it all to take home with me to remind me of my time here. But I didn't take anything away apart from an incredible experience and a sense of real honour that I've had the privilege of staying here. 

From the moment we walked in the door, we were made to feel special.I want to go back. And soon. I almost don't want to give everything away in this review so that upcoming guests can be surprised by what they find when they stay so I will try to keep things brief and as understated as I can but I really want to shout it out to the world as it's been so good!

We were met with very friendly warm welcome (by name) and a big fuss was made of Dennis, our little French Bulldog. We were shown to the Executive Lounge for a seamless check-in. Before I'd even had a chance to sit down I was offered a choice of champagnes and Dennis a choice of Pawsecco or Bottom Sniffer (it's canine beer, for the uninitiated). We were then taken to our room. Wow. Room 4104 was on 2 levels with the most stunning glass roof. Perhaps it was the staircase but it really took my breath away. We continued to discover all sorts of surprises in the room: a 40th birthday cake, chocolates and best of all a special bed for Dennis complete with dog treats, a pet menu and all sorts of things to keep him happy. It's so hard to put into words. The attention to detail, however small, was incredible. Nothing seemed too much trouble. 

The staff are impeccably well trained and presented: they all strike just the right balance of being unobtrusive yet friendly, attentive and familiar all at the same time. Guests are made to feel like they're part of an exclusive (yet approachable and unintimidating) club. 

Breakfast was lovely and we dined in Bbar for dinner (again also great and welcoming to Dennis who sat on a little mat by the table). The Executive Lounge was the perfect space for a late night exquisite whiskey (a lovely big list too!) 

This is most definitely the best hotel I have ever stayed in and I completely understand why it is reviewed so favourably by so many. It is unique and has a personal touch that I have not often found in many larger establishments. We were sad to leave today and we can't wait to return. 

Thank you so much Hotel 41 for a really memorable stay and a huge thank you to all the staff who made it so special for us.",5,2018,07,29
137,Favorite hotel in London,Great location with an excellent and attentive staff. The rooms are lovely and was delighted by the daily snacks - what a nice surprise. Every detail is carefully thought out. We look forward to our next visit!,5,2018,07,28
137,Simply exquisite ,"This is an exceptional hotel. It has really earned its top ranking on multiple sites. It is   Boutique with only 28 rooms, situated within walking distance of Buckingham palace, Westminster Cathedral and Victoria station. The small extra you pay here compared to other hotels in the area is worth the high level of service and comfort offered. 
We were greeted at the door and taken to the executive lounge to check in. Instead of the usual check in desk, we sat down in the lounge where we were offered our choice of champagnes. In the executive lounge there is a selection of complimentary snacks throughout the day. They even offer ice cream. The room was luxurious, clean and comfortable. All food and drinks we had were great. 
The attention to detail by all of the staff was exceptional throughout our stay. This is one gem we are happy to have found and will definitely stay here again. ",5,2018,07,28
137,A wonderful stay at a wonderful hotel!!,"I had seen this hotel in TripAdvisor and had  always wanted to visit!! My mum and I decided to stay as a joint Christmas and birthday present and we were not disappointed!!
We were greeted at the door and waited for someone to show us up to the fifth floor where the main of the hotel is located. When we arrived on the correct floor we were taken to the Executive Lounge to check in. We were welcomed with a lovely glass of champagne whilst we filled out the details needed which was a lovely way to begin our stay!!
Following this we were shown to our room which was delightful!! I love the black and white theme that runs through the hotel and the room was perfect!! Not large, but perfect for what we wanted!! Lovely comfortable twin beds, writing desk, sofa and tv area and a beautiful bathroom!! Everything has been thought of here...from the welcome sweets on your table as you come in, to toothbrushes/paste and razors, to stationary in the desk!! We decided to eat in the Executive Lounge which was again a wonderful room!! The food was excellent as were the drinks!! Another special touch which I have not seen anywhere else was the complimentary snack area which changed throughout the day, which included crisps, pastries and even ice cream, with a warm snack of an evening that you could help yourself too!! Finally when we arrived back to our room after our dinner we had the lovely surprise of a birthday cake for my Mum which was kindly boxed up for us the next day so we could take it home with us!!
In the morning we had breakfast in the Executive Lounge, which was as expected delicious!! A great way to end our stay!!
I have never stayed in a hotel so well organised where literally everything has been thought of and covered!! My mum and I hope to return in the near future!! Thank you to you all for a wonderful stay!!",5,2018,07,24
137,Exceptional everything during our third stay at Hotel 41,"I cannot fathom coming to London and staying anywhere else. Hotel 41 is beautiful, the food and cocktails incredibly delicious and the delightful staff helped with all our bookings and coordinated drivers for our party of four. I had a snafu in which tickets had to be picked up and there was no way for us to physically make it by before the event. Hotel 41 arranged for someone to pick them up. We were introduced to what is now our favorite new gin cocktail, made with Gin Mare, a rosemary sprig and two Spanish olives by Steve. Another gentleman on staff, Steph, recommended a straight razor shave and place to get one for the guys that they thoroughly enjoyed. I will be back as soon as I can! Thanks for all Hotel 41!!!",5,2018,07,23
137,Out of this world!,"From arrival to leaving we have never felt so well looked after nor spoilt in any hotel.

Upon arrival we were greeted by a really friendly young man in the lobby, who seemed genuinely interested in making us feel comfortable and relaxed. The lobby has snacks and drinks that are there to refresh you on arrival and departure. We were then taken up to the 5th floor lounge to check in. Stefan brought over a selection of champagned and made a great recommendation for me to try (as I have no clue nor a distinguished palette).

We were a little early so we were offered some canapes (cheese straws, egg dip and olives) with our drinks whilst we relaxed in the lounge.

The lounge has a mini freezer with around 12 different flavours of Jude's ice cream that you can help yourself to whenever you want.  My favourite flavour was the the black coconut...I will definitely be trying to find this one again!

There are many other snacks available in the afternoon...bags of nuts, sweets, popcorn etc and the shiniest of red apples sit in bowls dotted around the corridors, along with plated canapes on tap.  In the evening, there is a selection of cheeses, a hot option, salad type jars and desserts, and bottled water is complimentary all day.

The room was stunning...a very large king size bed dominated the room, but there was enough space to fit a desk, TV cabinet, sofa, coffee table, small dining table and 2 chairs and we were lucky enough to to be overlooking the Royal Mews.  The room was very quiet and the air con did a great job. The bathroom had a bath with overhead rain shower and handheld showerhead and was powerful with plenty of hot water.

Turndown service was brilliant...it happen twice on one night with different goodies left on our pillows and candles with rose petals left around the room... absolutely beautiful.

The hotel also made us a cake for put 14th wedding anniversary and left some sweets in the room upon arrival. It's an absolute travesty that we didn't get to taste it as we were so completely full from all the dining that we were doing in London and at the hotel...we were stuffed!

Would I return? Undoubtedly. Because of the hotel? Yes. Because of the staff? Absolutely. 

The staff are amazing...all have absolutely the right attitude. Very positive, kind, friendly, chatty but not intrusive and work together seamlessly to provide the best customer service I have ever experienced.  Staff knew your name, there was no awkward signing of receipts after you had bought a drink...they knew who you were and disceretely added it to your tab. They remembered where you visiting that day, and were frequently offering information and tips on how to make the most of any visits and sightseeing.

The staff make the hotel. From chatting to the young man in the lobby, it seems that there is a placement or management programme that staff attend.  Whatever this process is for training, it works and these friendly, omniscient people made our stay.

Thank you Hotel 41 and the team.",5,2018,07,23
137,Wow,"Brilliant from the minute you step through the door. Very welcoming staff (glass of champagne, anyone?) and the hotel itself is beautifully quirky. We didn’t make the most of the (free) ice-cream bar so that’s my excuse to go back.",5,2018,07,21
137,Just Wonderful,"An Unforgettable experience, Never felt like a hotel ,more like an exclusive club. Staff went beyond expectations and made our 2 day stay even more pleasant. I would highly recommend this hotel to all ",5,2018,07,21
137,Prepare to be Pampered,"The Hotel 41 is one of the finest hotels I have stayed in. The staff is universally excellent--friendly and helpful. From the welcome in the lobby to registration on the fifth floor, to the staff in the lounge, everyone was so pleasant and knowledgeable.

Stefan in the lounge offered us great advice in local museums and history and the lounge setting itself is very special. Sort of like having your own English club, with tasty dishes, snacks and drinks throughout the day and night.

Breakfast service as also outstanding with a wide variety of breakfast items for all tastes.

The hotel rooms are extremely well appointed, including virtually everything one needs for a restful stay. The rooms are quite spacious by London hotel standards and all very quiet, since they are on the fifth floor away from the traffic below in Buckingham Palace Road.

The location is exceptional --literally right across the street from Buckingham Palace. 
Worth every penny for both the service and location.",5,2018,07,21
137,Five star experience ,"The room was very comfortable, with every amenity. Staff were very attentive. There is a lounge where snacks, ice cream, and fruit are complimentary and available from morning to night.  The staff very kindly allowed my visiting family to use the lounge for an afternoon.  Couldn’t be better.",5,2018,07,19
137,There is simply no place better,"This boutique hotel is simply incredible.  I cannot list enough superlatives to describe its rooms, comfort, food and most of all the hospitality and staff.  From the minute you check in the staff makes you feel special and they truly want you to have a wonderful stay.  They helped us set up tours, rides, reservations for dinners and transportation to and from the airport..  In the Executive Lounge daily pantry snacks, drinks and even free dinner dishes are served lounge And is free.  Alex, Jonnais, and Jean Nicholas were just incredible to us during our stay.  The turn down service at night is just wonderful and you really feel special after a dinner or night activity with snacks, gifts and candles.  All the personalized service and touches make this place very special.  It was the best hotel stay my wife and was I have ever experienced.  We have traveled extensively around the world over the last 20 years and mainly stay at small boutique hotels.  This hotel is number 1.  Book it now.",5,2018,07,17
137,Sometimes perfection comes in the form of responding to challenges,"Let me start out by saying they people at Hotel 41 are top notch.  They will do whatever it takes to make your stay better and help you enjoy your time at the hotel and London.  Marlen was especially helpful in putting together a surprise for my wife upon arrival.  I had purchased Wimbledon tickets and wanted to surprise my wife.  Marlen procured a piece of astro-turf, tennis ball, strawberries and cream, Lanson Champagne and a card from my dictation and set it all up for us in the room.  It was perfect.  That perfection continued, but in a different way.  Our first night we didn't sleep too well.  I felt the room was noisy and the AC (thank goodness for it during a heatwave) was blowing directly on the bed.  I brought it to the staff's attention, and they sprung into action.  There were apologies, quick room change (with them doing all the work), a letter, more apologies, champagne and just an overall effort to respond to the situation.  It was just well done.

The room situation, honestly, is a bit tricky.  They have done an admirable job in creating luxury out of quirky, small spaces, but in our first room, the layout was just a bit awkward.  Even in our much quieter second room, the bathroom was a bit of a struggle size wise (and we had just come from Paris with super tiny rooms).  Even with the room situation, I'd return in a heart beat.  We felt so looked after and we looked forward to coming back to the hotel after a long day of sightseeing.   Big bonus to the ""plunder the pantry"" and other little perks.  Well done.",5,2018,07,17
137,"Whatever, Whenever","There is no place like 41.  We have been fortunate to stay several times in the last few years, including an 8 day 'friends and family' visit in 2016 during which we treated as such; friends and family. 

41 is ideally located for those who like to explore on foot.  The hotel is across the street from the Royal Mews / Buckingham Palace. It is an easy 10 minute stroll to the Birdcage Walk and both St. James Park and Green Park are within 15 minutes as is Westminster Abbey.  Recently Nova Food has emerged across the street with a multitude of food and drink options which are handy as well if you are lucky enough to have theatre tickets for Hamilton; something we were able to secure through the hotel on our most recent visit.  41 is about service. We have established great relationships with the people of 41.  It can be a struggle to find that ""Goldilocks"" spot between attentive and intrusive, between professionalism and a personal touch. We have found that 41 hits the mark nearly 100% of the time.  As for the physical space, the hotel is beautiful and elegant and yet is neither stuffy nor intimidating.  I am in the habit of wearing my slippers to the Lounge, just as I would in my own living room. The food is excellent and you can literally eat all day long.  41 is a special place.  It is small and personal, so if you prefer anonymity and the varieties offered at larger hotels, then this may not be the place for you, but if you want to feel at home, there is none better. Whatever you need, whenever you need it. 41.",5,2018,07,16
137,Pure Luxury,"I got engaged in Hotel 41 so it definitely holds a special place in my heart anyway, but I don't think you could describe the hotel as anything other than pure luxury. 
The rooms are super spacious given the location.
All the staff go above and beyond and nothing is too big or small an issue for them to help with. I know Florent helped my now fiancé out a lot when planning the engagement surprise.  
The little touches such as your glass of champagne on arrival, the ice cream available in the executive lounge and hot chocolate when headed out really added to our stay.
The hotel is so grand and luxurious, in such a great location in London and just went above and beyond for us - I really hope we make it back in the near future to stay again.
I would happily recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to London especially for a special trip and would rate it way more than 5 stars if I could.",5,2018,07,09
137,Impeccable hotel,"An absolute gem! Lovely atmosphere and amazing staff. Open pantry gives an extra value, especially when you travel alone, not too keen to spend every night eating out.
Hotel location is super, close to parks, tourist attractions and public transportations. 
Highly recommended!
/Emilie A",5,2018,07,06
137,Wonderful experience!,"Large comfortable room with all of the amenities you would expect.  The huge difference is the staff who competently and quickly responded to our questions and needs.  They were so welcoming--yet professional--that we felt like we were staying with friends.  All of their suggestions were perfect for our needs.

Delicious treats with cocktails.  A freezer full of ice cream for your snacking any time.  The morning breakfasts were excellent. 

Everything was great--and we will recommend the hotel to everyone.  Thanks.",5,2018,07,03
137,Amazing Discrete Hotel,"We stayed a Saturday night and were very impressed. 
Quite a discrete entrance as this hotel doesn’t shout like most properties for this luxury do.

The staff were fantastic and very helpful.

The interior is great and the rooms well furnished. ",5,2018,07,01
137,Fabulous Service,This warm and welcoming hotel was a dream! The staff are polite and extremely professional. Endless delightful food items are offered throughout the day complimentary to guests. The rooms are clean and the bed is comfortable. Fabulous stay!,5,2018,07,01
137,Outstanding attention to detail and customer comfort,There is a good reason 41 is so highly rated by its visiting customers. It is their outstanding attention to customer care and comfort. The room assigned though not terribly spacious had every comfort feature you could possibly want. The bed was particularly comfortable with a perfectly balanced duvet. Of the right weight too. The highly branded 41 property will leave you wondering what else could they have done for you to remember 41. It's not all the 41 logos that you see on everything but the human interaction of the amazing staff. Including the highly experience South African F&B manager whose recommendations one should listen to. He will charm you to dizzying heights. That is what you will remember best from 41. The rest can be chaulked as world class creature comforts but the absolute takeaway is the standard setting attention to customer satisfaction. 41 delivers at a very high level. A must try!,5,2018,07,01
137,Fabulous,"I was booked for 2 nights first, after 2 I’ve decided do stay here for my entire business trip.  Rooms are spacious and comfortable, clean. Food is delicious! Staff are helpful, they will go forward to make your stay perfect. Definitely would recommend",5,2018,06,29
137,London Luxury,We stayed here twice for a total of six nights. The staff remember your names and provide outstanding services. The hotel is above the Rubens Hotel and related. The facilities are well done and stylish. We have stayed at many other London hotels but would consider this to be our new London home. It is in a walkable and safe location with good restaurants and theaters nearby. Worth it!,5,2018,06,26
137,I think they invented 6-star service,"Seriously, I've never had service so attentive anyplace, and I've been to some swanky places. This is a small hotel so you get a lot of personal attention from the staff - I'm still trying to figure out how everyone knew my name on the first day. You'll read about the executive lounge a lot in other reviews, and it is a very nicely appointed room that you'll walk through a lot on the way to your room and the check in and check out. Don't expect to make your way through that room without stopping for an assortment of drinks, canapes, and other goodies - the staff will just make sure it magically happens for you. During breakfast and dinner times more substantial food is offered as well.

The room itself was well appointed and the bed was quite comfortable. It is small, so don't expect grand lobbies, spas, and pools - but if you're looking for a comfortable and quiet place to rest in a very classy place with highly attentive service, Hotel 41 is hard to beat.",5,2018,06,26
137,40th birthday treat,"Took my husband to London to celebrate his 40th birthday.  Stayed over a weekend in a double room.  Fantastic welcome, beautiful room, only issue was that we walked everywhere and had to resist the concierge's urge to sort us out with taxis!  Food at breakfast plentiful and varied and snack ""larder"" available later in the day although we had so many lovely nights out we didn't need to avail ourselves.  Great luxury London base.",5,2018,06,26
137,"Brilliant hotel, with staff who go out of their way to help you","This was our second time staying at Hotel 41, and it was even better than the last time. When planning the trip we had booked a world class restaurant for one of the nights. However two weeks before we arrived the menu changed to one where I would not be able to eat anything on the menu. After trying to organise something with the restaurant, we decided to find something else. We contacted Hotel 41 and the concierge staff were superb and quickly provided multiple options covering a large range of foods. When we picked one, Hotel 41 then arranged everything for us.
Once we arrived, the staff were excellent, asking what our plans were and if there was anything that they could help with (including organising tickets to the more popular shows). The room was well laid out and equipped and the perfect size for this style of luxury hotel. The night staff could not have been more helpful, going out of their way to ensure that we had everything we needed.
The breakfasts were superb and the food in the lounge area was excellent.
The staff in Hotel 41 made our long weekend break go from being good to brilliant. I cannot recommend it highly enough.
Please note, that if you are after huge rooms, with a fancy gym/pool in the hotel, Hotel 41 isnt for you. However if you are after an experience were you are treated like you are special, with excellent rooms and superb decor, then you will enjoy staying at Hotel 41.",5,2018,06,25
137,4th stay and still out of this world ,Wow this place still keeps amazing me. It’s lovely to return here feels like home from the moment we arrived we had a lovely greeting with champagne. Our room was as beautiful as always and those little touches still make a difference. The little gifts we get on the bed when you have a turn down are such a nice thought. The slippers are so comfy that is all we wear when In the hotel we have breakfast in them. Totally feel so relaxed and welcomed. We had chance this time to meet a lovely guy Stefan who works there. He was such a delight to have conversations with. A perfect gentleman. We stayed In one night and were planning our wedding Stefan made sure we were always topped up with a drink and nibbles. The staff there can not do enough for you. Perfect stunning place our favourite by far ,5,2018,06,25
137,Why oh why oh why.......,"......Can’t I award Hotel 41 six stars?

Once again Lauren and her team have excelled themselves. Absolutely nothing is too much trouble for them. A lovely surprise was the anniversary cake in our room.",5,2018,06,24
137,Family trip to London,"Unbelievable experience!  We have traveled to many, many places and stayed in some of the finest hotels and have never received as good of service as we experienced at Hotel 41.  The location and rooms were great but it is the staff that truly separates this hotel.  We highly recommend it!",5,2018,06,20
137,Perfect in Every Way,"I have chosen to stay at Hotel 41 several times because the team makes me feel truly at home. I always refer to it as my home away from home. 
From the moment I see the doorman in his stately uniform, the fabulous concierge to the minute I step onto the elevator I am transported to another world. A glamorous world filled with lots of beauty, joy, and heartfelt graciousness. Reception!.

From the first glass of champagne ( yes rose) to the lovely appetizers, chatting away with the lovely staff and guests who could ask for anything more....but there is more.

I had just returned from a visit to India which was not one of the finest trips I have taken and had returned with high anxiety and the staff were so kind to look after me as I had not slept in days and what a better night's sleep then in the Savoir handmade bed! I finally recuperated with the kind assistance of reception.

This hotel has a heart and a soul and I am truly grateful to everyone who works there as it is my passion to stay and it is their passion to provide the highest level of service in the industry.

Oh yes, and I did plunder the pantry several times...putting a few extra goodies in my handbag just in case! Yes, they approved.

I do hope to come and stay again someday. I love it here.",5,2018,06,18
137,Made our honeymoon ,Trust is the word to use when it comes to the 41 hotel. We decided to stay there for our honeymoon and it was the best choice we could make! My new wife has coeliac disease so everything has to be gluten free. They also baked gluten free buns and brownies specially for her. The staff are beyond professional and incredibly helpful. Check in was quick and effortless. Room was immaculate. Breakfast was divine and they make one of the finest martini’s in London. Hotel 41 is the only place we will pay for when visiting London again. ,5,2018,06,16
137,Excellent Experience from Start to Finish,"Beautiful Hotel with service that is the best. The staff is helpful, the rooms were immaculate, and the lounge area was certainly a big plus after a night with the Rolling Stones. The concierge and staff could not have been more helpful day and night. This place is a destination, not just a hotel.",5,2018,06,15
137,A Master Class in Hotel Service,"My husband and I stayed at 41 Hotel in March for a short getaway.  It would be easy to walk past it -- next to the Ruebens with a sign that says Residents Only next to the door.  The hotel facilities are charmingly British-feeling, with a wood-paneled lounge and all the accoutrements.  Staff couldn't have been more helpful as we focused on seeing things we hadn't seen on previous trips.  We especially appreciated Steven Jones (Steve as he introduced himself ""in American""!) in the lounge, who walked us through high tea and knowledgeably discussed the Modigliani exhibition at the Tate Modern that we had enjoyed that day.  My husband spent lots of time in the lounge for breakfast each morning (coddled cream!) while I enjoyed lazing in the room, which was an Executive King -- beautifully decorated but small with no view.  Only complaint was there was no place to plug in a hair dryer in the bathroom, which was awkward at best.  We will stay here again next time in London and will recommend to our friends as a great, centrally located city hideaway with fabulous service!",5,2018,06,13
137,The best hotel,"From the moment we stepped inside, everything was great! The staff, the executive lounge, the champagne, the room, the food, the snacks... It was just a wonderful experience from beginning to end. Our choice of hotel whenever we visit London in the future.",5,2018,06,12
137,Wonderful,"My husband and I stayed her for 3 days and wished it could have been more. The room was beautiful as well as comfortable. The lounge area offered snacks and drinks all day and if there is anything you want to know about wine just talk to Stefan. The hotel  staff were friendly and helpful, even printing out all the Harry Potter locations throughout the city. The hotel is in a perfect area of the city, easy to walk to many places or take the tube or bus if you don't like to walk. Will return to Hotel41 when we are in London again.",5,2018,06,12
137,5 Star service,"We stayed for 1 night during our long birthday weekend in London; the hotel is quite hidden on the Main Street, very close to Buckingham palace.
We were greeted by the doorman and then we were shown to the lift which takes you up to the main reception and lounge area. 
The entrance is very grand and breathtaking; the staff on reception were very welcoming, and we were offered a glass of champagne on arrival. 
Our room was very luxurious, but homely; the bed was comfortable. We had chocolates and a birthday cake in the room, which was a lovely surprise. The room had tea and coffee making facilities, bath robe /slippers, safe, toiletries and water and Sky tv. 
The lounge area (also where reception is) is very cosy, with air conditioning and various complimentary snacks are available including ice cream. 
The hotel arranged our tickets for The Tower of London and can assist with arranging transport if required.
Near to the hotel is a small square of bars and restaurants, although some closed at 9pm (it was a Sunday).
You can use the facilities in the sister hotel next door. 
The staff are wonderful and nothing is too much trouble. 
Breakfast was very nice and I can recommend “the breakfast of champions” 
",5,2018,06,10
137,2nd visit amazing again,"2nd visit and it was perfection again . Upgraded into a suite awesome . 
NOTHING is too much trouble and they are so generous with everything all of which is complimentary unlike so many 5 star hotel who charge you for everything . The staff are the stars of the show . Just delightful in every way . The only thing i would say is that if you like ultra modern then this hotel might not be for you . Otherwise just go and be blown away by the experience",5,2018,06,08
137,Believe the Hype!,"Hotel 41 has elevated my expectations in what to expect from a luxury boutique hotel. The Executive Lounge is one of the most beautiful, yet comfortable and welcoming places to relax. The delicious canapes, abundant snack bar and even the ""honor"" bar made it easy to enjoy an afternoon curled up into a comfy couch with a good book. The staff was simply incredible and big kudos to creating a great experience! From the front desk and concierge team: David, Mitchell, Marlen, Victoria, Max, and Lauren to the Executive Lounge staff: Stefon, Alex, Armin, and Marcelo, they are the heart and soul that makes Hotel 41 worth the stay. (Super big thanks to David for shipping artwork I left behind!) I'd also like to extend a thank you to the sister hotel, Rubens' Doormen, Aaron and Stuart. They were equally charming and attentive. I highly recommend Hotel 41 for those that want an intimate and relaxing hideaway within the hustle and bustle of London!",5,2018,06,07
137,Best in London,"This is like going to an exclusive club. We returned last week after a couple of years. Service is second to none. There are no weak employees. They are all great, The rooms are spotless. The only thing lacking is a gym but I am sure they will find one for you if needed and maybe even exercise for you if you ask. The private lounge is always stocked with food. You really could just eat there all the time. No reasson not to give 5 stars.",5,2018,06,05
137,I'd say they deserve their #1 Tripadvisor ranking,"Beautiful place. Excellent service. The Executive lounge, open to all 30 rooms, is amazing. The living room of an amazing mansion.  Check in is seated across a table there. Everyone is so friendly that I saw guest after guest plop back down at the table when they came into the lounge. Drinks and snacks are always available. I don't drink but their champagne cart looked amazing. Several brands for the asking. Staff was legitimately concerned with everyone's day to day tourist activity. Couldn't be a better location, across from the Royal Mews and a block from Victoria Station. It's next door th The Rubens, with which it shares services. It's actually attached, you can go from one to the other through a nondescript passage.  Expensive but half-price compared to the Savoy or something. While I assume the ""price is no object"" people may stay at the Ritz or the Peninsula, this ""you et what you pay for"" but nothing shocking in expense traveler loved it and will be back. ",5,2018,06,04
137,Wonderful Staff and Hotel!,"This is one of the most beautiful hotels I have stayed. They leave nothing to chance. They are one step ahead of any need a guest may have. The hotel transports to an era when elegance was the norm. The staff is highly motivated and go out of their way to help you in any way they can, everyone at the hotel I came across  was absolutely great. I visited London and Edinburgh, but this hotel was truly the highlight of the whole trip. The location is very convenient since is near Victoria Station and the Palace. The smell near the elevators was one of the best things I have sensed. The rooms were second to none. Enjoyed the daily fruit at the room. Thank you for your generosity and attention to detail.",5,2018,06,03
137,Home from Home,"Over 2000 excellent reviews and a number one rating on tripadvisor is very well deserved indeed! 

Hotel 41 is all about customer service and the small details, from the moment you walk through the door, every detail is perfect in every way!
Check in with a glass of champagne as your luggage is taken to your room and enjoy some treats in the beautiful executive lounge before discovering your lovely room.

We were delighted to find a compimentary bottle of champagne on ice along with handmand chocolates and a selection of fresh fruit.

The staff at 41 really go the extra mile to make sure that your experience exceeeds your expectations at every opportunity in a way that makes you really feel like you are home away from home. ""Plunder the pantry is a must.""

We would like to also mention the curry room in the sister hotel next door - venture through the ""secret door"" and down some stairs to find a real treat!

Thanks to everyone at 41 who made our two night stay in London so special, and a very special mention and our thanks to Steffan who was superb!",5,2018,06,01
137,Better than expected,"I had never stayed in a small boutique hotel, but now I am hooked. Hotel 41 is elegant,  intimate and friendly.  We felt as though we were visiting dear friends who told their staff to treat us like family. Food and drink are available all day in the lounge and, after one day, they knew our preferences. The staff is superb. We loved coming ""home"" after a busy day of sight-seeing and shopping or an evening at theater to relax in the lounge with a snack and a drink.
As I expected, the rooms are a little small, but beautifully appointed.  The location, right across from Buckingham Palace, is so convenient.  We could walk almost anywhere. I highly recommend Hotel 41.",5,2018,05,31
137,Lovely rooms,"Absolutely Nice and clean room&bathroom, we liked the luxury design with my husband.
The breakfast was really tasty I had sirloin steak my husband had a salmon.
We'll go back soon again thank you for the experience",4,2018,05,31
137,Breathtakingly wonderful,"A small corner of insanely luxurious tranquility, just a minute’s walk from Victoria Underground Station. It seems impossible to believe that this is central London. The place is absolutely spotless, no mean feat for an older building with much wood panelling and lots of old books lining the walls. Everyone knows your name as soon as you walk through the door and nothing is too much trouble. I especially loved the ‘Whatever, whenever’ button on the phone! 
We were here for a ‘big’ wedding anniversary, mentioned it in the booking and were treated like royalty the whole time we were there. My only regret is that we had just one night. We will most definitely be heading back to our newly found London bolt hole. 

Many thanks to the incredible staff who made our stay from 28-29 May so memorable. We will see you again!

",5,2018,05,29
137,Simply the best...,"41 is no doubt the best establishment that we have stayed in London by far – and we have stayed in many 5 star hotels believe me during our various weekends away in London. I wanted to find a special treat for my partner’s birthday and seeing Wicked was amazing but staying at 41 was ‘the icing on the cake’.

The attention to detail and the attentiveness of the staff surpassed our expectations and it was actually a joy to spend time in the Executive Lounge as it was so perfect – the staff just knew when to attend and also when to leave alone – all very satisfying.

Many thanks to Lauren, Marlen, the Doormen, the Executive Lounge staff, etc for the best experience of our lives in London so far. I think this will be difficult to top.

We hope to see you all soon in not the distant future...",5,2018,05,27
137,Absolutely wonderful!,"From the minute we walked into Hotel 41, we knew this was going to be an extraordinary hotel and we were correct. We arrived in London fairly early and even though check-in was not until the afternoon, they promised our room would be ready shortly and invited us to use another room to shower/freshen up/nap while we waited. The check in process with complimentary champagne was a nice touch. 

We had booked a split level junior suite and it was gorgeous. The layout worked very well for us and it was so spacious. The bathroom had a huge soaking tub and separate shower. 

The service at this hotel really sets it apart. Everyone went out of their way to make sure we didn't need or want for anything during our stay. We were here for 3 nights and I cannot think of one negative during the entire stay. I will definitely be back and can highly recommend without hesitation.",5,2018,05,24
137,Exceptional service and attention to detail,I have stayed at many of the best hotels around the world and the team at 41 provide the sort of personalised service and attention to detail that puts them right up there with the best in class. The kindness shown to myself and my wife really made our stay at 41 an experience rather than just a night spent in yet another luxury hotel.,5,2018,05,21
137,"Second visit, equally as perfect as before","We returned to Hotel 41 whilst in London to celebrate my wife's birthday. This was our second visit and was as perfect as the first (2 years ago). The Hotel team are fantastic, nothing is too much effort, and without even mentioning it, they knew it was my wife's birthday (checked from our previous visit) and made our stay even more special. I cannot fault this hotel, from the moment you step in until the minute you leave you are made to feel special. Will certainly return again.",5,2018,05,18
137,Nice place to stay ,"I was stayed there for one night only. 
The hotel is really  so beautiful and look like old.
Very well decorated with  nice food.
Service is really top of the noche staff is very courteous and attentive..
Hotel location is prime..
Nice place to stay here.. ",5,2018,05,18
137,"Superb service,beautiful classic hotel ","
We were travelling as honeymoon...We had 14 hours flight from HK to London. They are so jice to give us a temporary room for refreshments and rest! It’s so important after a long flight...location is good as It is easy to walk from Victoria Station to the Hotel...just about 5 mins...room size is good and beautiful, bathroom is classic! the most surprising is they sent a gift basket to another hotel on next day...as for apologise for a minor shortfall .... wow...even only some snacks...but this gesture really impressed us! So much thanks for all of your excellent service! Definitely will come back!

",5,2018,05,17
137,Our perfect hideout,"Our regular business trips take us to 41.  We would stay nowhere else.  On this occasion we returned to The Curry Room situated downstairs through the bar in The Rubens, which was every bit as good as we remembered and no getting wet or trying to find a taxi in the rain.  If you really enjoy an authentic curry, have a look at the menu.  This is as good as it gets.  Service and knowledge impeccable and curries full of flavour rather than just mouth-cringing heat.  This is not what it is about.  My husband had the pork vindaloo (choice of pork or beef) whilst I had the Natal lamb, both of which were splendid.  All but one table was occupied by the time we left at 9pm, and the place hums with enthusiasm from both guests and staff.  The Curry Room pleasingly offers exceptional value for money.  Ask reception to book you a table for an memorable experience.  

We returned to our room - Balmoral. A lovely surprise to be upgraded to this beautiful unilevel suite (some are split level) as we have knee issues.   A choice of bathrooms, a choice of televisions, two settees, a dining area, walk-in wardrobe, and a view over the Royal Mews.  Pretty stunning.  

Service and ambience as always welcoming and highly professional.  You have to love the job to be as good as these people are.  Lauren and her team never disappoint.  Thank you all.",5,2018,05,17
137,Real Luxury,"Staying in this hotel was like being on a luxury cruise - the service was impeccable and personal, the beds were comfortable, the linens fine, and there was some type of food available in the kitchen all the time.
My personal pet peeve in hotels is the quality of their towels.  I love big and fluffy towels, which I rarely get in hotels; but here, they were huge, and lush.
On our last night in London, my husband and I went to see Hamilton.  We were very excited and told one of the stuff about that.  When we came back after the show, we found macaroons with Hamilton insignia imprinted on them, a red rose, and rose petals strewed all over the room!  I mean, I have never....!!!!!",5,2018,05,16
137,A wonderful stay in a fabulous hotel,"One again everything was fabulous, beautiful spacious rooms, very friendly approachable staff, who go out of their way to make sure you have a wonderful time at Hotel 41. lots of little extras such as champagne on arrival, chocolates in room, fresh fruit, ice cream, sweets and treats in the afternoon, pillow menu and many other wonderful little touches. The beds are divine, spacious and so comfortable.
Our family joined us in the evening for drinks and were made to feel very welcome by staff.",5,2018,05,16
137,Just as expected!,"Located in the heart of London near the victoria station and the Buckingham Palace, the 41 is an outstanding hotel. The hotel is perfectly run by a group of polite and extremely motivated staff. Clearly the employees love what they do and take care of the needs of the guests diligently. The rooms are spacious and clean, there are personal touches that make the stay very pleasant. I will be returning to this property with my family because there is such a homey feeling and my parents will certainly enjoy the personal touch and the superb social areas. There are many perks included.",5,2018,05,13
137,Perfect Hotel for a London Break,"Our experience at the Hotel 41 was absolutely perfect. I wanted to find a special place to celebrate my Wife's 60th birthday and this hotel certainly ticked all the boxes. From the moment we stepped into the building we were made to feel like we were the only guests in the place. The interior design is stunning and impeccably decorated throughout. It feels more like a home than a hotel, and the layout is perfect for a restful stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and took time to chat to us throughout our stay which is something I've never experienced before. The room was bright and clean, with so many thoughtful touches we wanted for nothing throughout our 2-day stay. I can easily understand why this hotel is currently the number 1 hotel in London, it is a perfect hotel in a perfect location.",5,2018,05,12
137,Superb Experience,"From entering to leaving, it was a superb experience, the staff were extremely helpful and the room in great condition.  We could not have happasked for more.

The room itself was well sized and perfect for our occasion.",5,2018,05,08
137,Like being in the Kingsman movie!  A private entrance to an private club feel.,"The 41 is an eclectic blend of English library and private club. The staff is as pleasant and helpful as you can hope for in a hotel.  We had a 5 night stay with a quiet, bright and spacious room.  This 5th floor hotel is well appointed and tastefully decorated.  The tones for the room are white with black accents.  Maintaining an old English flair with modern amenities in lighting, gas fireplace, and marble bathroom.  The Executive lounge is a high ceiling library with several tables and couches well situated to provide private conversation but giving the opportunity to meet other guests if desired.  The breakfast service is excellent, either a continental buffet or ordered hot items from the menu.  Raiding the pantry in the evening became a regular habit along with a perfectly poured cocktail.  This is a first class affair for those who prefer a small hotel experience.  The location is close walking distance from Buckingham palace, St. James and Hyde parks.  Victoria station is 5 minutes walk away.  Sloan street is 15 minute walk through the embassy district.  We will definitely be back to enjoy this treasure again.",5,2018,05,07
137,Delightful Stay/Exquisite service,"Trip to Ireland was canceled at last second because of bad weather, and we needed a hotel at the last second since we were staying in London. Had read about Hotel 41, decided to give it a try,  and was not dissapointed! From the arrival thru checkin we felt like we were family - the room was a 2 floor suite, with old world touches. Each night the beds were warmed with a hot water bottle! One of my travel companions commented on checkin about the name badges, and within an hour one was custom made and delivered to his room. This is the type of personal service that they offered. It was nice to be recognized and greeted by name each time. 
One of the highlights was the Executive lounge where you checked in, with complimentary champagne. It was also always open. We had a delightful breakfast there daily in front of a great stone fireplace. It was a great place to relax in the evenings with a snack and a pot of tea! Great location. Cant recommend highly enough!",5,2018,05,06
137,Wonderful and outstanding Hotel,"We recently stayed at Hotel No 41 for our wedding anniversary. Everything was perfect from our greeting by Max at the front door, to our welcome champagne on check in. The suite was beautifully decorated, the bedroomwas on a mezzanine level and was well equipped. All the staff worked seemlessly to ensure each customer recieved impeccable customer service and strived to maintain high standards. Thankyou for making our stay very special and very enjoyable.",5,2018,05,06
137,Luxury hotel ,"I enjoyed my stay over here with my family.
City Centric so easy to reach other famous locations easily. 
Nice ambiance. 
Friendly service. 
Easy to locate. 
Free wifi.
Hygiene room.
Thank you management.
",5,2018,05,03
137,Great hotel!,"The service here is impeccable, although a little too personal for my taste. The breakfast was fresh and flawless, we never had a better breakfast in our lives! The rooms were great, the beds were very comfortable. The rooms were a litlle small and a bit chilly (heating was not working). Toilets were not flushing properly. But all in all a great stay.",4,2018,05,03
137,"Best hotel service, ever.","Physically, this hotel is an ordinary, somewhat dated, small luxury hotel. But the service is absolutely incredible. Better than the best in the world (Connaught/Claridge's/etc.).. Just one tiny example: during turndown service, they carefully tidied the dangling cords on my phone chargers with little Velcro cable wraps. Who DOES that? Just stellar.",5,2018,05,02
137,Fun Hotel in the London Area,"I traveled to London and stayed at the Hotel 41 during the summer time, it was beautiful and filled with amazing character.  The most incredible think about the hotel is it's historical charm and attention to detail.",5,2018,04,30
137,"Service, Service, Service","This is an incredibly nice hotel so you expect the room to be comfortable and clean, you expect a decent lounge, newspapers, coffee, tea, etc. I read about the service in other reviews, but until we stayed here it was hard to understand what a difference that can make on an international trip.  For someone who is used to taking care of everything this was actually a little difficult to get used to, for the first hour...... we asked about getting tickets to the Churchill War Room, sure they will be down in the lobby in a few minutes.  Great, that was easy, we walked up to the area and saw a very long line, no worries, we showed the paperwork to the gentleman directing people and he escorted us to the front of the line and let us in right away, wow didn’t expect that!! Dinner reservations were taken care of, and seemingly we felt like we had the best table everywhere we went. Theatre tickets, sure thing, how about center of the theatre, about 15 rows up, yep!!  Even when we had a glitch on timing for a day trip they had it straightened up and we still went and had a great day, with a special treat waiting in the room when we got back!  Special thanks to Magdalena for all of her help, Max for greeting us warmly, and Alex for taking such wonderful care of us in the mornings, after one breakfast he remembered our coffee preference, which table we liked, everything. There are many other helpful people that we should also thank but sadly I can’t remember all the names!! There is a very funny gentleman that served drinks in the evening, wore a gray suit and recommended the Tate museum, thanks for the humor and great laughs. We will be back for sure, this is now our London Hotel. ",5,2018,04,30
137,Whatever/Whenever,"Whatever/Whenever is more than just a label on the top button of the 41's room phones.  It is a philosophy that permeates their service culture.  I could write volumes on their impeccable attention to detail, their almost clairvoyant anticipation of your needs, and that mesmerizing aroma that perfumes the halls of the 41 with a woodsy cleanliness that's difficult to put in words.  Instead I'll share my experience where once again action speaks louder than words.

On a recent trip to London, my wife realized she had forgotten to pack our portable steam iron--an indispensable item for our upcoming cruise.  I pressed the W/W button to see if I could get some help finding a place where I could purchase one in London before our cruise the next day.  Meanwhile we went sightseeing around town.  You can imagine our surprise when later I called to see if they had the info and was informed that the steam iron was already on its way to our room!!  As if that weren't enough, the next day we checked out and took the 2-hour cab ride to the ship port in Southampton, only to learn that we had accidentally left both our tablets behind in our hotel room!  Once again the hotel staff jumped into action and arranged for a courier to rush deliver our tablets to the docks at Southampton, heroically arriving with just minutes to spare!

I'm normally not one to bother the hotel staff with trifles, but it was so reassuring to know that when I needed a hand, such a diligent and resourceful group of professionals was there to help solve my problems.  Thank you, 41!

To anyone poring over reviews of top hotels in London.  You can stop your search.  This is the one!",5,2018,04,30
137,Simply the Best,"In the words of Tina Turner, whose World Premiere Musical, ‘Tina,’  we were lucky enough to see in London....Hotel 41 is ‘Simply the Best’. The level of concierge service is above & beyond all expectations. It is rare that I remember the names of Hotel management but from Victoria & Nicole who I initially made contact with to Max & especially David,....I grew fond of them all. David was funny, completely authentic, knew lots about London, traveling & being adventurous. Before booking I thought the hotel might be a bit too formal for my taste but all involved Hotel 41 are very down to earth. They seemed genuinely interested in us as artists & made suggestions based on that.  The ‘ Executive Lounge’ is on the same floor (level 5) as the rooms. Both Hotel 41 and the Lounge have a private club feel and are a quiet oasis from the high energy level of London. We took advantage of this Lounge after evenings out. The hotel is spotlessly clean but it was a good 5 days before I actually spotted someone with a vacuum cleaner. They seem to have mastered the art of catering to your every need without being overly visible or constantly present. Thank you all for such attention to detail. Loved our anniversary cake.",5,2018,04,25
137,One of the very best in the world,"Having stayed at various top-end hotels and read the raving reviews, my expectations were very high. And they were exceeded with grace and without hesitation. This is a very special place where it's all about the guest. I've come back several times and the staff never failed to deliver against the standards they set the first time. Don't tell anyone about this place so it can stay one of the best-kept secrets of London.",5,2018,04,24
137,Excellent Hotel for a Stay in London,"I would have to say this is one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed at.  The level of service provided by the staff is top notch and the facilities, food and level of customer care is unrivalled.  If you want to treat yourself book and stay here.  As an added benefit, the location in London is excellent for access to Victoria station and most of the attractions the City has to offer.",5,2018,04,23
137,A dream. ,"I’ve stayed in many a London hotel and I have to say that Hotel 41 is my favourite. Although pricey, you definitely get what you pay for and I had an amazing weekend alone, from the kids here. May make a habit of it! ",5,2018,04,23
137,World class service,"We travel a lot & this hotel has never failed to impress us with its outstanding service.
 Sharing a recent experience-
The staff were exceptionally courteous & helpful. Even the smallest requirements of each & every guests were taken care of which is really commendable. 
I strongly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,04,21
137,Not as nice,We are sad that we stayed in this hotel as the last hotel on our trip to England and France because we will not remember it as nicely as the hotels that we stayed in. The biggest thing is for us is that the people the hotel is employing are not like in the other hotels. On our journey at this hotel we did not feel as though people wanted to take care of us in the same way and that we make problems for them by being in the hotel. The staffs were not always present and attentive to what you needs and that made it difficult. It did not feel as professional a hotel and I think we had expected more form a English luxury hotel in London.,2,2018,04,20
137,Excellent stay on Christmas Eve,I had an excellent stay here this past Christmas Eve.  It was my second time at the hotel and it was just as good as I had remembered.  The staff even left stockings filled with nice little items on all the doors for guests to discover on Christmas.  I definitely plan to stay here again the next time I am in London.,5,2018,04,17
137,"Great staff, great location","This hotel is unusual in many ways. For one, it consists of one single floor, accessed from a street-level elevator, from a separate door next to the entrance to The Rubens. The hotel’s interior is quiet, despite its location near Buckingham Palace. But keep the windows closed to keep out the traffic noise!  The room-temperature controls are very good. 

The location is excellent, a short walk from Harrod’s, Hyde Park, and Westminster Abbey. The street is not as busy as it is in Mayfair, near the Dorchester or Claridges. Plenty of taxis pass by. Our split-level “suite” had a big bed, skylights, and a big bathroom. 

The staff were consistently polite and helpful. Our special thanks to Mr. Jones and to Greg and Armand in the Executive lounge, and to David for his cheerful greeting at the street door. We are especially thankful to the Lauren (there's more than one!) who helped us re-book our train after Virgin canceled it without notice on a busy weekend.  

The in-room WiFi failed occasionally, but was still the best we had in the UK. 

The late-evening “snack” (served at about 8 pm) is worth waiting for, more like a meal, and always includes a hot pie of some kind. (The pork vindaloo was especially good.) However, the repetitive music in the lounge seems unnecessary.

 We would gladly return when back in London. We make our usual statement, as with all our 5-star reviews, that we have no personal or financial ties to this establishment.",5,2018,04,16
137,Outsanding boutique hotel -- one of the best!,"This is the best city hotel we have ever stayed in, through many years of travel. We love the boutique size and the extraordinary personalized attention. The concept of the executive lounge is so appealing that we are surprised it's not a model found in other fine boutique hotels. We spent much time in the lounge, savoring the tasty food and drinks, and always felt welcomed and comfortable. The staff went out of their way to accommodate our every need and to anticipate ones we didn't even know we had. The location is excellent, and it's easy to get anywhere in London from the hotel. It is pricey but worth every penny. We can't wait to return.",5,2018,04,15
137,Great ’private club -like’ 5 star boutigue hotel,"Amazing service. Feels like a private club with attention to smallest details. Simply great, especially if you look for something more personal & different than big hotels chains. Breakfast was awesome and served until 11, thus you can make it almost like an early lunch. ",5,2018,04,15
137,Wedding anniversary stay,"We had a lovely stay here for our wedding anniversary. As it was a special occasion they upgraded our room and surprised us with a cake.
The level of customer service is excellent and the rooms very tastefully furnished.
The refreshments on offer in the lounge area are very good quality and it was a very nice place to chill out after a busy day in London.",5,2018,04,15
137,50th Birthday Celebrations in the Conservatory Suite,"I originally booked Hotel 41 nearly 10 months before my 50th Birthday purely on recommendation of Tripadvisor (being No 1 in London) and I was not disappointed in the least.

After my booking I did ""pop"" in to check the layout of the Conservatory Suite as I was going to use it as not only for accommodation but as a base for several ""drink parties"" during my stay (3 days).

The Conservatory Suite is split on two levels with downstairs seating for at least (4/5 if you include the stairs) and on the upper level seating for at least 7/8. I was pleasantly surprised I was able to bring my own bottles of wine/drinks with me and they even suggested emptying the mini bar prior to my arrival to accommodate! 

I had pre-ordered Afternoon Tea for Sunday in the Board Room for 8 (offered free of charge) and they provided the most delightful complementary birthday cake to have in my Suite with my own Prosecco. Have to say the lashings of freshly made tea and the scones and sandwiches were too much for us all to eat on the day. All tasted wonderful.

The Hotel and the Suite were wonderful and the staff were all very accommodating and extremely friendly/polite and just couldn't do enough to make my stay special. I was very sad to go but will be booking again for next year.

The only downside to my weekend of celebrations was the meal I had booked in the ""Curry Room"" in their Sister Hotel next door (Part of the Red Carnation Group).
The food was excellent but the surroundings and atmosphere were so different from Hotel 41 that it felt like I had just been kicked out of a first class suite on a plane to be put at the back in economy class.

The restaurants are on the ground floor and basement in the Rubens Hotel and are accessed by a central lounge area. On the night (Monday) there was a singer (mic'd  with backing track) that is entertaining the lounge guests. However , because of the location of the lounge and that there seemed to be no ""doors"" to the Curry Room the noise (she was a good singer however) carried so much that It was practically impossible to have a conversation without significantly raising your voice.

I did ask if they could turn the PA down but it was a significant distraction throughout the evening. If I had known that it wasn't simply mood music I would have gone somewhere much more in keeping with the style and tranquillity of Hotel 41.

I also appreciate that as they are ""separate"" hotels this may have been better to review under the ""Curry Room"" at the Rubens but wanted other guests to know that going from the simply beautiful Hotel 41 to the Rubens, may like me, be a shock and a disappointment.

Cannot wait to make Hotel 41 my ""home away from home"" once again and already counting down the days till I can make an excuse and go again.",5,2018,04,12
137,Home away from home,"Where to begin? Our family of four recently spent 7 nights in Hotel 41. From the moment we entered the hotel to the moment we left, we were treated like family. The personalized service was like nothing we had ever experienced. Within a day, the entire staff knew all of ours names and were constantly ahead of each planned moment of our trip. Some might find this overkill, but we found this level of concierge service to be extremely helpful to us as we navigated the city of London as well several countryside towns. Train tickets, restaurant suggestions, reservations, taxi service, snacks and lunches for longer  day trips...always with a warm smile. Anytime we were away from Hotel 41 for the day and trying to figure out how to manage our evening, we always found ourselves saying, ""let's go HOME, first"".  That's how the staff and accommodations make you feel. This is not a typical ""hotel"". I could go on and on. Hotel 41 is a gem of a place, exemplified by its exceptional staff...too many to name here. We did not want to leave and cannot wait to go back.",5,2018,04,10
137,Exquisite Hotel,"It seems that we are in good company as fans of The 41. Everything about this jewel box of a boutique hotel was perfect. Others have described the comfortable rooms, thick towels on hot towel racks (also excellent for drying hand laundry), delicious snacks, and beautiful spaces. The old board room AKA the Lounge is so classically British that we smiled each time we entered. The management clearly knows that their most important asset is the staff, and they are wonderful. Thank you.",5,2018,04,10
137,Truly the ultimate example of British class and service,"My wife and I have stayed here a few times, and it is always exquisite. We will be staying there again in 4 weeks. The last time we stayed we were rushing into the UK on business. We arrived late-morning as usual, exhausted and travel-burnt. We had to be smart and back on top by dinner. The hotel coordinated our ride in, as usual they had precisely the pillows, bedding and flowers we like in the room and best of all coordinated 2 masseuses for a couples-massage just after we arrived. I can't overstate how much we enjoy the people that work there, the way they take care of customers or the class with which they behave. Our upcoming trip will be our first all-pleasure stay, as we break journey for a few days before continuing east. I can honestly say that staying there, regardless of what we are doing afterwards, will be one of the absolute highlights of the trip.",5,2018,04,09
137,Heaven on Earth,"I didn't want to leave. This place is great: location, attentive staff, relaxing lounge, beautiful room with deep soaking tub, and champagne offered upon arrival. You must stay here at least once in your life to treat yourself. One word: awesome.",5,2018,04,08
137,Truly luxurious hotel,"Over the last few years we have stayed on 3 occasions and each time found the hotel to live up to the high standards we have learnt to expect. The hotel itself is extremely comfortable and well appointed and maintained, but the excellent staff make the experience a real treat. They are very attentive but remain relaxed and put us at ease.",5,2018,04,08
137,Late entry but truly 5 star service and accommodation!,"This review is late, but better late than never! We stayed one year ago at Hotel 41, July 3-5, 2017. I had originally booked a different property, but with the terrorist attack one month earlier, approximately, at that time, I moved hotels to what I considered to be a safer venue. We booked 2 rooms, one for my husband and I, the second for our teenage kids. The hotel is about 2 blocks from Buckingham Palace :) 
When we arrived, we were greeted by name. We were escorted to the lounge area and the set up was explained. We also were offered our choice of one of 3 different champagnes to choose from! Fantastic start! We checked into our rooms then went out enjoy the sights. One of the staff told us Kings Cross station had an actual Harry Potter store and also had platform 9 3/4 and we were gone! 
When we returned, the plundering the pantry started. I had to laugh. There was gourmet ice cream and the kids are rather addicted to ice cream. Anyhow it seemed that the staff were kept busy re-stocking the freezer! The selections in the pantry: excellent cheeses and appetizers. Really really good. 
I have to say, although food in the pantry was complimentary, drinks were expensive, including tea, which was not complimentary other than at breakfast. This was rather disappointing as I would’ve enjoyed more tea. 
Breakfast was fantastic and the eggs were outstanding. 
We enjoyed our 2 days immensely. The staff checked into our flights for us, entered our passports etc. Just nice to not have to do that!
Rooms were well appointed, beautiful decor, and very comfortable beds. These were kept immaculate by the staff! 
A wonderful 2 night stay and wish it could have been longer. We will return. What a relaxing feel despite its 5 stars. Not “stuffy” yet exemplary service.  We highly, highly recommend this hotel. You won’t be disappointed!",5,2018,04,04
137,Exceptional,"The whole experience from the moment you enter the building is exceptional. The care, attention to detail and personalised service is delivered by their many members of staff in such an unobtrusive, genuine fashion that you feel comfortable and valued with every interaction - they make it seem so easy!

Our stay at Hotel 41 has become the benchmark by which we will now judge any future luxury hotel experience. Outstanding.",5,2018,04,01
137,Nice,"Enjoyed a weekend away, clean and all staff was friendly. Would definitely go again and recommend. Location is also very good, enjoyed our breakfast for the price it’s what I expected thank you for great service",3,2018,04,01
137,Fabulous!!!,"Hotel 41 is truly a five star hotel, it  deserves it's accolade of the best hotel in the UK.
The service is impeccable but not obtrusive, all requests are dealt with efficiently and with a smile!
I found the extra touches and the attention to detail throughout amazing, it made my two night stay absolutely perfect.....................I can't remember when I last had a hot water bottle tucked in my bed, but it was oh so welcoming!

Thank you for a memorable stay and I hope to return very soon.",5,2018,03,29
137,Exceeded its lofty expectations,"Hotel 41 delivers on its promise! From the moment we checked in, we knew we made the right decision. Every single aspect of our stay was perfect! The location can't be beat, and the staff went above and beyond to ensure that everything was perfect at all times. 

The centerpiece is of course the living room - which was always well-stocked with snacks, and had an fantastic bar menu. The breakfast selection was fantastic, and food was prepared to order with our preferences in mind. 

The room is a bit on the small side, so we only did breakfast in our room the first day. Other than that, it was a perfect and cozy room, and the shower had epic water pressure which is always a welcome perk! 

I can't wait to tell my friends and family about Hotel 41, and hope they stay there soon so we'll have something to talk about!",5,2018,03,27
137,Amazing but we had a noisy room...,"From the beginning to the end perfect. Such a beautiful and special place to stay! Etremely friendly staff. Love the fireplace in the rooms. 
Only one thing: by email we asked some days before arrival for the most quit rooms as I am a very light sleeper. They confirmed that they would make sure we would get a quit room and I was so happy. 
Unfortunatelly we were situated beneath the special masterroom upstairs and the person who stayed there obviously was jetlagged or whatever. The up and on walking on an old wooden floor made such a sound that I was awake almost the whole night... The day after we moved to other rooms and they were perfect. However one of the staff members told me that he had his doubts before putting us in our previous room and thought that our second room is a much better choice... they were a bit smaller, but I don't mind and it made me sad to hear that. I explicitely asked for it... To me a good night rest is essential, due to a health condition I get very easily tired and this night of almost no sleep made me feel exhausted our whole special London weekend :(",5,2018,03,26
137,*Almost* perfect service...,"We stayed in the conservatory suite for a couple of nights and our overall experience was excellent. For such a small hotel I can just imagine how difficult it would be to hire and maintain such a well trained staff that truly understands and provide luxury service. There were a couple of teeny service quibbles (including one bigger one our departure) that I will detail later. They will seem very minor but at well over a grand a night, things need to be 100 percent. For these issues I scrooged and only gave 4 out of 5 rating (I wish TA would allow half stars so i could give 4.5).
We pulled up in a rental car. The hotel sits on a very busy road (Buck Palace Rd) that is ""redlined"" which means absolutely no stopping (unless you're a bus or taxi)...and there is nowhere at all to pull over or stop, but we did anyways...the doorman sprung into action, asked our names, took the key and shepherded us into the small lobby, no problems. Check in was equally smooth and fast upstairs, while they valet parked the car and handled our bags. Tea was offered and accepted during check in and in our room not a few moments after we had been shown in. The rental car company came to pick the car up from the hotel the next morning and was handled all by the hotel, no problems, with just a call to me asking if it was OK for them to take the car. Perfect.
The hotel itself is actually quite cosy (small) and has a very clubby atmosphere...i.e., very British. I think the pictures make it look a little bigger that it is, but it's not oppressive. The main check in/eating/seating area is nice and spacious and well appointed.
The Conservatory suite is worth a try just for the novelty factor (your wife/GF/mistress will think its great). At over $1000 (US) a night it was decently sized and comparable to what else $1000-$1200 a night would buy you in London, with a small sitting area downstairs with a gas fireplace and the bed/main bathroom up a staircase (the layout is not obvious in the pics). It could use a little less furniture though and i found myself moving the couch so get a proper view of the TV from the bed. The main bathroom was very large by London standards and well appointed with large jet tub, separate shower (excellent water pressure and plenty hot). From reading other reviews, it sounds like the standard rooms are much smaller. It was unseasonably cold in London the first night and another nice, unexpected touch was the hot water bottle tucked under the comforter. The bedding/bed was excellent as were the towels etc. On our return the second evening, tea was waiting, the room had been turned down, the gas fireplace was on, making for a very welcoming atmosphere. Overall, it was well presented and in nice shape as per the rest of the hotel we saw.
We didn't make much use of the available snacks/sweets, although the two or three times were went into the main area it seemed popular. The breakfast was excellent, with our made to order omelets etc cooked perfectly and with excellent table service...the kid that served us both mornings had been properly trained despite he looked about 18, so top marks to him and the hotel on that too.
Service quibbles: Very minor really, but just a few items would have really made it one of the best stays at any hotel for us and we have tried them all, or close to it.
The first two VERY minor service misses by the staff were on showing us the room on entry they forgot to (1) show us the master switch (2) show us the second half bath(!) The first issue meant a call to the desk later that night as we couldn't figure why most of the lights weren't working. The second point wasn't really an issue, but it was a nice surprise the next day when i opened the door expecting a closet and there was a whole half bath! The third service miss was the fruit bowl. It was nicely stocked upon arrival and my wife and I munched through pretty much the whole thing in our 2.5 day stay...but it never got restocked! By the end of the second day it looked a little sad with a half mauled bunch of grapes and a lone orange sitting there.
The fourth miss wasn't that bad either, but the problem is they did so well on everything else during our short stay, it kinda stood out! We had the hotel organize a car service from the hotel to LHR for a 9.45am pick up. We got to the downstairs lobby at 9.40am and it was obvious the young girl had no idea a car had been ordered, at first thinking we had a cab booked. I told her no, it was a car service we had booked and with that, she went back to doing paperwork with no further acknowledgment of our presence...it was an odd interaction. Right at 9.45 I asked her if she could check on the car (it still hadn't arrived) and as she started making motions to find out where it was, it pulled up. We were then left to open the door and take our bags outside after which she belatedly got up to hold the door open, but we were already outside. Again, just a little weird...no offer of porter service, no offering to find out where the car was, and generally no acknowledgment we were guests at the hotel, etc. Maybe she was a sub? 
Anyways, worth a try for the novelty of the conservatory suite and overall excellent service and attention to detail.

137,Excellent hotel,"Stayed at Hotel 41 for one night during business trip. Impeccable service, personal attention, classy surroundings, clean and well equipped room;- all 
facilitated to make the stay comfortable and memorable. Probably one of the best hotels in London. ",5,2018,03,22
137,"Excellent Hotel, Upscale and Mature","My wife and I stayed here for two nights in February and it was one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed in.  The hotel centers around an Executive Lounge and the activities, including checking in, breakfast and the entire food service center around this lounge.

The rooms have the best amenities and are a good size for a city like London.

Service is what you would expect from a hotel like this one.  Everyone we came in contact with was very helpful.

The free food in Executive Lounge is a nice treat, particularly after seeing a show.",5,2018,03,21
137,Quite simply the best,"My husband and I stayed here one night prior to flying out from Gatwick to the Maldives and again on the return leg of our journey from North Yorkshire. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. From the moment you enter the hotel you are in the hands of the most efficient, friendly, and professional  hotel staff I have ever encountered. 
On the outbound journey we stayed in an executive room which was excellent and on our inbound journey we were upgraded to a junior suite. It was unexpected but what a treat. This room on a split level was absolutely fantastic. 
Regarding food, we had breakfast on both occasions and were both very pleased with our full English and eggs benedict respectively. We also had a chance to ‘plunder the pantry’ in the lounge. It was excellent in the most relaxed yet efficient atmosphere. If you get a chance I recommend you stay at this hotel.",5,2018,03,19
137,What a Find!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at 41 in every aspect.  From the minute we walked through the entrance and were welcomed with warmth and respect to the time we sadly had to leave, this hotel and its staff impressed us with professionalism and forethought.  Although the spaces (entrance, passages, rooms, bathrooms) are not large, the superb black and white decor makes up for it with attention to detail and interest.  The convivial business lounge, which is the hub of the establishment and which is operative from early morning until late every night, has been cleverly laid out into private seating areas suitable for breakfast, teas, snacks, drinks, late night foraging or just reading the newspaper.  Such a clever concept.  Here you can help yourself to drinks and an array of tempting sweet treats or you can order from the menu.  We can highly recommend their Croque Monsieur toasties.  The staff are friendly, polite, helpful, proactive.  During our stay they had noticed that we could not resist taking a handful of pear drop sweets from their huge glass jar at the entrance whenever we passed by; on our departure we were handed our very own bag of pear drops for our journey.  Bravo to all.",5,2018,03,13
137,Ladies and Gentlemen serving Ladies and Gentlemen!,"Myself and my wife have stayed here a few times and without exception it is the best hotel to stay in whilst in London. A real unique home from home experience, put simply we love it!

All staff are exceptional, a special mention to Steve and Dean for the way they looked after us.

We will return soon I am sure.",5,2018,03,12
137,Fantastic Holiday,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying here on a recent trip to London. We could not recommend the hotel more. The location was fanatic and the staff, sublime. We were warmly welcomed and shown to our room, despite arriving at 9:00 am. The restaurant recommendations from the staff surpassed our expectations. We hope to return on future trips.",5,2018,03,11
137,Returning Home,"This is my daughter and my fourth stay at the Hotel 41 and will certainly not be our last. Based on our experience, we can honestly say that the consistently amazing customer service at the Hotel 41 doesn't happen by accident. It happens on purpose! The Hotel 41 staff goes to great lengths to make sure you feel like invited guests to a party and they are the hosts. From the front desk staff to the wait staff to the housekeeping staff...an experience is created that's worth talking about to other travelers and not easily forgotten. I certainly will not forget the congratulatory card for my daughter's engagement, or the thoughtful tokens left by Lukas to make my trip to Kensington Palace all the more special, or the tea tray sent to my room with a lovely note from Mitchell after a long day navigating London's snow days or Steve's interesting conversations in the Lounge as we enjoyed an array of food goodies not to mention Alex's supurb attentiveness. There are so many to name who make this place special...from Flo to Marlen, Nicole, Victoria, Andrew and so many others...thank you for your commitment to excellence and for doing what you do so well guaranteeing we will want to return and bring our friends.",5,2018,03,11
137,Exceptional boutique hotel,We stayed here for 2 nights and highly enjoyed every detail. From check in to check out the staff were excellent and treated us like royalty. The hotel is small and expensive but worth it for very special occasions.  The decor and style is very luxurious and the rooms are amazing. Food is delicious and staff are amazing. We will be back and recommend highly for others to stay here. ,5,2018,03,11
137,Birthday bliss,"My husband and I stayed here for my birthday after having had it recommended to us by a friend..

From the very 1st welcome, to the helpfulness with taxis and directions to the swift easy checkout nothing was too much trouble for any member of the staff. 

we were made to feel that nothing was too much trouble ..

And the little extra touches the hotel provided were what makes this hotel  a cut above some others.
Our room,the food and the service were all amazing and we wouldn’t hesitate to return.",5,2018,03,09
137,Customer service defined!,"From the very moment that you enter, the staff is completed dedicated to your experience. The rooms are tastefully done with little extras like chocolates and lavender spray at turndown service. Fruit is always present in your room. This is strictly boutique! You could walk right past it if you didn't know what you were looking for.
Thank you Victoria for helping us with our luggage situation!!! She was making calls for us 8 hours after we had checked out!",5,2018,03,09
137,What a find-sublime,"Tucked away and barely noticeable next to Reuben's hotel is the 41 Hotel in Buckingham Palace road, number 41. A delightful boutique hotel  of 28 rooms and part of the red carnation group that has hotels like the Oyster box in Umhalanga rocks South Africa and the 7 Apostles hotel in Capetown-top of the range 5 star hotels -as is the 41.
The attention to detail is brilliant, from a glass of champers when you check in  in the lounge, to the handwritten note from the hotels manager welcoming you.
The rooms are not huge but well appointed with great amenities. The bed is divine and one could just sleep an entire vacation away . The decor is warm, black and white tiles, wood, black and white warm upholstery , thick curtains that do block out the light  and little goodies that just make your stay better and more comfortable.
Their is one number to press on the phone -it's labelled, whatever , whenever- and believe me , whatever it is you want and whenever you want it just press the button and incredibly well trained staff spring to action to attend to your wishes. Jokes aside the staff were brilliant, courteous, helpful, willing to make your stay more memorable and comfortable -for instance , I do him an injustice as I honestly cannot remember if this is his name, Michel, he was staff member on duty downstairs at the street entrance, and in the entrance their were hot drinks and cold and sweets and the normal paraphernalia of a hotel that is NOT minimalist-umbrellas etc etc .One of the sweets my wife and I always took a few of from this huge jar were pear drop sucking sweets-delightful and just great-we wanted to purchase some to take home with us as we had never seen the in South Africa but unfortunately all the specialist sweet shops had similar but not the same-the day we left placed in our room was a lace bag filled with the sweets for us to ""nibble on our way home""-how awesome was that!
Then the lounge-for hotel guests where one ate brekkies, nibbles, raided the pantry-sweets , toffee s, ice cream, crisps , nuts and at various stages of the day from 5 pm to 11pm ,toasted sandwiches  that were delicious , thin and well toasted , crisp and tasty and other faire like huge baked pies , lasagna etc, just in case one came back from a show at night or arrived on a late flight or one just felt like a nibble-an honor bar was also in evidence and there is a good variety of hard, and soft tack available from scotch to brandy, port, sherry , beer and cold drinks , wine etc etc.
A gent by the name of Steve was our favorite and he seemed to run the lounge , always on hand to graciously serve, chat with guests and make one feel welcome and at home -what an asset to the group-mind you all the staff were great-everyone knew your name shortly after you booked in and again , brilliantly trained staff-not one bad report on anyone-only glowing praise for all-well done management team.
When we arrived home there was an e mail from the hotel manager acknowledging the ""how do you feel about us"" card one tends to get in all hotels but never hears anything back on when filled in-well this e mail did acknowledge what I had to say and addressed all the points I had to make-again well done management-you guys are so far ahead of your peers service wise.
As an aside the the decor throughout the hotel is warm , well thought through and seems to be of only of the finest fabrics and decor accesories. Really a much much more than pleasant stay-it was superb and if I ever get the chance to stay again it will be a no brainer-will go out of my way to return",5,2018,03,07
137,Sheer perfection from arrival to departure ,"My husband and I have just recently returned from a one night stay here and it was perfect! We chose this hotel due to its outstanding reviews and boy, they weren’t wrong. The customer service shown to us by everyone we encountered at the hotel was second to none. From Nicole’s beaming smile with an offer of a freshly made hot chocolate when we arrived, to Max who showed us up to the Executive Lounge and the wonderfully kind Florent who checked us in, everyone was delightful and literally could not do enough to help us. 

Aside from being wonderfully located near Victoria stations, this hotel happily goes the extra mile to make everything special for its guests. On arrival we were informed that we had been upgraded to the Balmoral Suite which was a most unexpected, but extremely generous, surprise. The accommodation was stunning and the little touches such as complimentary champagne on arrival as well as sweets and cake in our room, just made the whole experience sublime.

Breakfast was truly delicious with a superb range of continental and hot options available. Again, the service provided by Stewart and Laura was excellent. 

I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and we’ll definitely be back!! Thank you!!
",5,2018,03,04
137,Exquisite and so British !,"Everything was perfect, from the room to the people with all the little details that make your stay unforgetable. The hotel is very central (located nearby Victoria station) and 5mn by feet from Buckingham Palace.",5,2018,03,02
137,Best in class,"My wife and I stayed in London for 10 days to celebrate Christmas and her birthday. It was my job to pick the hotel. After extensive research, I picked Hotel 41. To say that this establishment is amazing would be a complete understatement. The most attentive, friendly, accommodating staff we have ever experienced. We stayed in a couple of different rooms(by choice) and they were terrific. I would like to give special attention to a few of the staff. Lukas, Adele and Florent who helped with the original reservation. Thank you Hotel 41 for such a wonderful experience ",5,2018,03,01
137,The best ever!,"Thank you everyone at 41 Hotel for making my stay just perfect. It‘s a real home away from home - which welcomes you after a long day in the city. Besides the super friendly and relaxed staff, the evening turndown completed a perfect week in a perfect hotel. ",5,2018,02,25
137,Message to The Ritz Hotel - Please take notes...,"Reservation made via Expedia
Room Type - Executive Room, 1 King Bed
Breakfast included
Room Number - 4106
Duration: 1 night (14th February 2018)

We experienced the magic that is Hotel 41 for the first time for one night as part of our honeymoon.  

The welcome to the hotel can only be described as simply outstanding.  Lucas at the concierge desk was the first point of contact. Immaculately dressed, he welcomed us as if we were family members.  After taking our details, we explained we unfortunately missed our 
Hard Rock Cafe reservation due to traffic delays.  He said he would contact Hard Rock to see if the reservation could be honoured despite being nearly 1 hour late.  

We were taken to the Executive Lounge to officially check in.  As the reservation had already been prepaid we were asked to swipe my debit card for a £50 deposit/pre-authorisation as I made the reservation. A choice of two types of Champagne were offered - so we opted for a delicious offering of the Lanson Rose.  The Pantry and Honesty bar are also situated in the Executive Lounge, the concept and timings were explained to us.  The Honesty bar must of housed nearly 100 bottles of wines and spirits for times when service was not available but all drinks taken must be entered into the Honesty Book.

We were then escorted to our room. Our luggage already arrived safely placed on a luggage rack.  The dimensions of the room were larger than we imagined.  The deputy manager had left a handwritten welcome note on the table along with a selection of magazines and luxury confectionery - hotel branded black and white macarons, a Turkish delight, a marshmallow and two perfectly tempered chocolates.   We barely had time to take in the surroundings when Mitchell contacted our room telephone to confirm that the reservation for Hard Rock Cafe had been reinstated.  All we needed to do when we arrived would be to show Hotel’s business card to skip the queue.  He also offered to arrange for a London Black Cab to take us directly.  The effort it would have taken just to get our reservation back despite the location being fully booked for Valentines was a touching, over and above gesture so commendations to both Lucas and Mitchell but this was one of the many outstanding examples of exemplary customer service.

After Hard Rock and a mini shopping trip we returned back to the hotel to find the welcome drinks we had not finished had been removed.  I assumed my husband consumed this during the rush to make the Hard Rock booking.  We contacted reception to ask what happened and to purchase another two flutes but they replaced these for free with their compliments.   

We finally made our way to the Executive lounge in our attempt to “plunder the pantry”.  As the time was after 8pm, it took all my willpower not to go mad. The options for that evening - a sensational, mouth watering and succulent Cottage pie, a vast selection to choose from the salad buffet which also included Salmon/Ham/Vegetarian mini mason jars, fresh bread, crisps,snacks, a mini fridge full of a mixed variety of mini pots of Jude’s ice cream and Valentine desserts of either dark chocolate gold leaf mini tarts or heart shaped red macarons filled with strawberry cream. We actually did not see the Cottage pie until our second visit to the pantry after midnight.

When we returned back to the room it was beautifully transformed.  The turndown service included a hot water bottle placed inside the duvet to warm up the sheets, the gas fireplace had been switched on, tea lights were lit to enhance the mood, red rose petals were scattered on surfaces, his and her slippers placed beside the bed. Breakfast menu, Laundry Form and Weather forecast for the next day placed on the bed for your perusal.  It was a welcome sight after a long day.

I wanted to arrange for a last minute massage for my husband as a gift.  The staff were able to arrange this at very short notice for the next day.  Amazing.

The only downside to our stay happened when workmen decided to start using a jack hammer after 1am in the morning not far from our room window.  The noise became louder and louder. We called Reception to enquire about the noise.  They investigated the disturbance and contacted us back with an update.  They offered us the option to change rooms which we declined as it was too late.  They offered to bring up earplugs as part of a sleep pack.  It was, in no way the fault of the hotel as it was beyond their control.  Despite this the hotel compensated us for the inconvenience caused as an apology.  

I will have to apologise for not mentioning the names of all the staff encountered.  Everyone worked extremely hard to ensure our satisfaction. All staff were very respectful and attentive.  We were spoilt by a level of service never experienced before which we found to be very addictive.  

We shall definitely return for a longer stay opting to stay in one of the suites.  We both highly recommend this experience to anyone thinking of staying here - Do not hesitate to book due to price as this experience is definitely worth it. 
 
This exclusive boutique hotel more than lives up to all of it’s accolades.

Note to The Ritz Hotel - a quote from Bea Tollman, Owner of Hotel 41.

“You can build a palace, but it means nothing if you don’t focus on your guests.  All guests want to feel special. “ 

Our stay at Hotel 41 was extraordinary.",5,2018,02,24
137,Wow Memories that will last forever!,"Stayed here as treat for 40th birthday on febuary 20th and I have to say I really didn't want to go home! From the moment we arrived we knew this was a special place we were taken straight to the executive lounge and provided with a glass of champagne whilst checking in, the lounge was so relaxing and the staff were all amazing whilst there having a drink you are given snacks complementary as well as there being a complementary snack bar to help yourself and including icecreams!
We were then shown to our room and I would personally like to thank hotel 41 for the upgrade to the suite which really made my birthday!!! It had everything you could possibly need and more! Even down to the little things like in the mini bar were the drinks we had in the bar! I would never in my dreams thought that I would ever stay in a room like this!
Every single member of staff are polite helpful and nothing was ever to much.
The evening turndown was a lovely touch and the chocolates left on the pillow were out of this world!
Then I come to breakfast, well what can I say it was the best breakfast I have had in a hotel and I have stayed in a few! 
Upon checkout we were given a box of snacks for our journey which again was this hotel going above and beyond!
I will never forget my stay at hotel 41 or my 40th birthday and will definitely highly recommend this hotel to everyone!",5,2018,02,24
137,#1 Hotel in London and will make your trip amazing!!,"We love to visit London and stay at Hotel 41 each trip. I can honestly say that the people of Hotel 41 actually make our trips so much more special with their high attention to detail, friendly service, immaculate property and fun extras. There is nowhere else you should stay when visiting the city (it's top of 1000's of properties for a reason and has been for years).  

We were in town for a combo business/ The Crown post binge watch tour. The property is across the street from Buckingham Palace and the Royal Mews. St James Park, the Churchill War Rooms, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, etc. are all within walking distance. We walked to almost everything we did and used our room as a hub. Shopping, drop off packages. Museums, stop by the lounge for a coffee and some cookies. Sporting event, champagne and late night curry. Best and most unexpected chicken curry I've ever enjoyed (and was complementary I should add). 

There are always treats to be eaten, late night ice cream to be enjoyed and the fine champagnes flow!  The executive lounge and everyone who works in it are true differentiators. Think a luxurious living room with a fireplace, candles, books and the aforementioned treats and beverages. 

It was another perfect stay and we'll be back. Thanks again!

137,Hotel 41,"Listed as a 5 star hotel and it is.  It would spoil the visit to say all they did for us.  This hotel is on the top floor of its sister (4 star) hotel.  There is a separate entrance and when you miss it you are meet with smiles to correct.  It is a hidden gem.  Lastly Buckingham palace is across the street, Victoria theater a block away where Hamilton is performing",5,2018,02,23
137,If only real life could be like this...,"Third time lucky visiting the wonderful Hotel 41 and I can only really echo the same things that everyone else has said. 

From the second you walk in the door, to the second you leave, you feel like you are part of an extended, well treated, pampered family. 

Every single detail is thought of, from the moment you go to breakfast to the moment you go to bed. 

I cannot recommend 41 enough to anyone. 

My only problem is, it leaves you longing to go back!",5,2018,02,20

137,a very pleasant stay,"We stayed in the Hotel 41 from monday through thursday. It is a very comfortable place, where the staff tries to read your wishes from your eyes. We would always choose it again for a trip to London. The services include even the offer of complementary water when leaving the hotel for the day.",5,2018,02,16

See you soon :)",5,2018,02,12
137,A Classic London atmosphere ,"This is not one of the typical hotel I would book for a London stay but booked it for some reasons as to closeness to station and so on.
For being a five star hotel they do give you a full service from personnel to please, no complaints about this, but for us our idea of five star service is personel on alert but not on you all the time - but that’s us. Room was small but cozy. And needed one could go to the lounge to get soda or nibbling a or later on have a drink and cheese and others. Did have to call room service as the sheets were a bit stained and the warm water-bottle had broke in the bed. Hehe! Then in the service the forgot their phone .. 
breakfast was really good and the offered gluten and lactose free alternatives. So been there and some that.",4,2018,02,11
137,Cozy and warm,I've stayed here twice and I loved it. The staff is super friendly and nice and made our stay perfect from the first minute until the last. I didn't complain about anything and that's very rare :-) the rooms are warm and cozy and I couldn't wait to fall into the bed at night. I would always come back!!! ,5,2018,02,11
137,Impressive not oppressive ,"Came for a weekend as a birthday treat, and was so impressed by the attention to detail at every level: the staff are incredibly helpful and welcoming, the rooms well decorated as per the whole hotel, the food delicious and some wonderful extra perks: free snacks, massive array for breakfast, personal touch down service (including little things like winding a USB lead up neatly, with a Velcro tie), plus offering a very tasteful and welcoming restaurant. This truly feels like an elegant town house vs. ‘Just another hotel’. It’s located right in the centre of London within a stones throw of main attractions, yet with the feeling you are cosily ensconced from the hectic frenzy of city life. Wow, we will be back!",5,2018,02,07
137,London's No.1 Hotel for a reason!,"My wife and I have just returned from a short break at Hotel 41 and I can only describe this short break as amazing!!

From the minute we stepped into the entrance lobby we were treated like royalty!

The hotel is beautiful and very well maintained, our room was spotlessly clean and well serviced twice per day! 
The staff could not do enough to make our visit extra special and the attention to detail was fabulous!
The location could not be better and allowed us to walk most places we wanted to visit, however, coming back and sitting beside the cosy executive lounge fire on a cold February afternoon was fantastic!
Well done to the team at Hotel 41, no question why it is London’s No.1 hotel!",5,2018,02,07
137,Truly Fabulous,"Hotel 41 deserves the accolades it receives, everything about this beautiful boutique hotel is wonderful, from the welcome you get at the door, the drinks you're offered as you check in, the complimentary snacks, the ambience and the decor, the rooms and the en suites to the staff, all of whom are polite, helpful and clearly happy to go the extra mile, you are all credits to your organisation. The rose petals on the bed, the hot water bottles and the fireplaces in the rooms simply added to the feeling of luxury.

137,Birthday trip with my 10 yr old daughter,"My fourth time visiting Hotel 41 and again an amazing experience. Thank you for making my daughters birthday celebration something extra. I really appreciate the lovely cake waiting for us when we arrived. And that nice information kit you assembled with more Harry Potter themed sites to visit after we got back from the studio tour was such a lovely gesture.
I’m already looking fwd to my next stay with my husband in April.
//Malin",5,2018,02,05
137,Fabulous! ,My stay at the hotel was just perfect! It totally exceeded my expectation. I stayed at the Monarch Suite with access to the executive lounge and I felt like a princess. The staff was very helpful and nice. The service is on the highest levels! I adored cosmetics (Penhaligons). It was my birthday and I received so many compliments from the hotel! One guy from the staff waited me at 1 am (this time they are closing normally) because he noticed that the day before I had come at this time for the glass of champagne. Isn’t it adorable?! At 41 Hotel you have all you need to relax and feel at the hotel like at home. It totally worth stating. I’m happy that I’ve chosen this hotel! It’s very hard now to stay at other hotels. I highly recommend it! ,5,2018,02,01
137,Boutique chic at its finest!,"Perfect stay to celebrate my 30th Birthday.
Upon arrival, we were greeted at the front door with the option of having a cup of hot chocolate with a selection of sprinkles and added treats. We were then taken upstairs to the hotel sitting room /reception and were welcomed with a glass of our chosen champagne. Great start to a romantic weekend!
We were then advised we had been upgraded to their conservatory suite which is a stunning 2 storey room, with electric horizontal blinds that open and close the blinds on the huge conservatory glass roof, above the amazingly comfortable (best ever) super king size bed. Never have we been as comfy as this before in any hotel.
We were given loads of extra treats complimentary, such as canapés, and a birthday cake and sweet treats (Selection of homemade chocolates and macarons) in our room.
The turn down service was amazing. Fresh red rose petals were scattered around the bed and candles were lit and left in our room. It was so romantic. A hopeful romantic's heaven! to top it off, they left a luxurious bottle of pillow spray for us to use if we wanted!

We were lucky to have been given this amazing room, as it had a nice big jet spa with a tv in the bathroom too. The spa bath was gorgeous, and we spent a bit of time sipping a glass of bubbles in there before heading out for dinner. Although, I do wish we had spent more time at the hotel to really enjoy every little detail.
To finish off, there is a 'plunder the pantry' buffet until 1am, and 'help yourself' freezer with a selection of gorgeous frozen yogurt / ice creams.
I really loved my stay here. Everybody (all staff) knew you by name, and spoke to you as if you were family, which was lovely. My other half said how outstanding the service was at this hotel. We did go to the Ritz the next night, so we had two 5 star experiences to compare. While both are very very different experiences, we did feel as though Hotel 41 had the edge - because of how personal the hotel was and how lovely all of the little extras were.
Breakfast was incredible. And they serve until 1pm which is great - it meant we could enjoy your room until check out, then have breakfast afterwards. We feel this is one thing that other hotels should definitely take from this hotel. at the Ritz, breakfast finished at 10am I think - too early for us. when we are on holiday / break, we like to have a lay in.
Forgot to say also, Bbar next door does an amazing cocktail and we had lunch there too. lovely Wagyu burger! Definitely recommend it there too!
So all in all, the Hotel 41 was my favourite London hotel so far!
10/10 for all aspects. Attention to detail, personalisation, quirky added extras, all amazing. Well done everyone and thanks so much for an amazing birthday treat, I am sure Mrs Tollman is very proud of you all!",5,2018,01,30
137,A gem of a hotel,"Mesmerising stay in hotel 41. Located right opposite the Royal Mews on Buckingham Palace Road and above the Reuben’s Hotel, this little gem of the hospitality industry is deservedly ranked Number One in the United Kingdom. From the concierge to the reception, from the restaurant team members to the Room Attendant, everyone exceeds expectations. In fact they all raised the bar to such level that it can’t be toppled in term of service. 
There’s a lot of five stars hotels around but the one that makes the o difference is the people. Highly recommended.",5,2018,01,28
137,Amazing stay with some exceptional service!!! ,"We stayed for 1 night after staying at a 5 Star Mayfair hotel the night before! Well the difference was amazing. This boutique hotel is incredible with exceptional service from all the lovely and very professional members of staff. They offer personal service at another level. I have stayed in some lovely hotels around the world but this hotel takes service to an exceptional standard. The room was spotless with some lovely touches and plenty of room on two different levels. My wife and I really enjoyed the extra nibbles, Sweets, Ice cream and plundering the pantry! It is the little extras that differentiate this hotel from others. 

Thanks to hotel 41 for allowing us to relax and enjoy a special weekend. ",5,2018,01,28
137,Unbelievable accommodation and Service,"We arrived at Hotel 41 to be greeted by friendly helpful staff, As soon as we entered the hotel we were offered hot chocolate, which was great considering it was cold outside. As we checked in our bags were taken to our room. While checking in we were given champagne and then a tour of the hotel and information about our room. Our room was a split level with lounge/fire place downstairs and bathroom, bed upstairs. 
The first night we had a glass of wine and were treated to free canapes and the staff there were exceptional. They were friendly, helpful and entertaining.  We had dinner booked at the adjoining hotel, The Rubens at the Palace, which is the sister of Hotel 41. We were escorted through an internal door to the restaurant and introduced the the other staff. It was great to have an Aussie as our waiter. Great service. In the morning my wife had a hot chocolate waiting for her as she loved the first one. On the third night were were again treated to free canapes and exceptional service. 
When we commented how good he staff were the reply was we love our job and love working here, so its not like work. Over the month away this hotel rated the top with the quality of the hotel and room. Comfort of the bed and the incredible staff. I highly recommend the hotel for those who wish to be treated like royalty. Thanks to the staff for making the hotel so special.",5,2018,01,28
137,"Back to 41, back to heaven...","Yet another accolade - this one from Trip Advisor

556240108

As very regular long-term guests, we love returning to 41.  Unusually, we have been twice in the past fortnight.  First was to stay for a family birthday dinner in Mayfair, and for the pre-dinner drinks we all met at 41.  The champagne was presented with canapes and a beautiful complimentary cake (which we arranged to be kept in the fridge for the next day to share out and take home).  Second, three days later we had a business meeting prior to a city break in Florence.  We enjoyed our complimentary welcome glass of Veuve Cliquot in the Exec Lounge and ordered a fish and chip lunch - always a good combination.  After our meeting, we sank gratefully into the sofa by the fire for evening drinks and canapes before plundering the pantry (Shepherd's Pie that night) which was perfect with a glass of Hannibal.  Next morning, we enjoyed a super cooked breakfast of vine tomatoes and crispy bacon before catching our cab to London City Airport.  
We are experienced travellers to world-wide luxury destinations and appreciate unrivalled quality, care and service. Congratulations to Lauren and her lovely team for another great visit.  We return next week on another business trip and are confident in the knowledge that consistent excellence will prevail.",5,2018,01,26
137,They go the extra mile,"Hotel 41 lives up to its reputation. You feel special stepping into Hotel 41, from the exclusive entrance, to the personal escort up to the hotel itself and the champagne upon arrival. Staff are very attentive, but no overly so. We were treated to a upgrade, to a quirky suite that had a sitting area leading to the bedroom up a flight of stairs. Hotel 41 don't scrimp on details, providing complimentary treats like chocolates, his and her toiletries and even a heat pack warming up the bed! We went out for dinner and came back to candles and rose petals! More hotels should put in the effort that Hotel 41 does! I would definitely recommend!!",5,2018,01,26
137,Going Home Again,"Although we live in Washington, DC, every time we visit Hotel 41, it feels like we are going home again.  From the personal welcome at the street level reception desk to our early morning check-in in the Executive Lounge, everyone greeted us by name and seem to remember us (we only visit once a year).  Here is an example of the level of service to expect.  My wife prefers foam pillows, while I'm OK with feather.  The hotel remembered that my wife sleeps on the left side of the bed and arranged the pillows correctly.  Hotel 41 must have an excellent customer database to record this level of information.  

Also, any hotel that has a button on phone that reads ""Whatever, Whenever"" is a place you should consider staying. 

After watching the construction of the new building complex across the street for the last 4 years, it was finally open and now has several excellent choices for lunch/dinner.  But don't eat dessert, since you can always find a special treat in the Executive Lounge before you head to bed.

We will be back ""home"" for our next visit late this year.  Hotel 41 delivers on all of its promises and 5-star reviews.",5,2018,01,25
137,Amazing hotel in london," Sthe staff was really amazingly friendly and helps with all issues. The breakfast was suppeb and vrey tasty .The Rooms are clean, the led tv works perfectly and the shower is an amazingly waterfall.highly recommend this hotel ...",5,2018,01,24
137,Attention to the details ,"Superb service and a beautiful setting! Staff are quick to engage you in conversation, make suggestions and provide helpful tips, and make you feel welcome. I was always greeted by name and the staff took the time to learn more about my interests and my plans. I enjoyed the many personal touches...for example, after seeing a musical that I had mentioned in conversation earlier, I returned to my room that evening to find some small treats in connection to that same musical. The setting is lovely, presenting a cozy, yet classic feel. I stayed in an Executive Suite, which did not disappoint. Classic black and white styling with personal touches. Excellent location...within walking distance of many museums, theatres, restaurants, and Buckingham Palace. Also easy to access many jogging routes. Lovely in-room breakfast. If you want to feel pampered in a beautiful setting, I would highly recommend!

137,Best of London,"My husband and I met our adult daughter in London for a few days of sight-seeing and to enjoy the city. Hotel 41 was our favorite part of the trip! We felt like we were the only ones staying there (even though we weren’t), the staff was so attentive, welcoming, and thoughtful. The breakfast in the lounge was delicious and fresh. A true taste of Britain with an exquisitely set table near the cozy fireplace. 
They welcomed us at every turn, offering to help us with directions, recommendations, and even welcomed us with champagne! 
We were here for our 30th wedding anniversary, and we are already looking forward to returning. This is the place we want to stay every time we visit London. Thank you to all who made us feel so welcomed! Our daughter had to leave for her flight at 3am, and they were so helpful with transportation and helping us see her off, even in the middle of the night. 
The hotel is quiet, elegant, well cared for, well staffed, unique, and truly one of the best places we have ever stayed. Our needs were special, due to missed flights and late arrival, but the staff remained accommodating to any challenge we presented. We couldn’t have been happier with our stay!",5,2018,01,22
137,Wonderful experience,This Hotel is unbelievable. The Staff are exceptional and the facilities are second to none. We booked for my Wife's birthday and when we arrived in the room we had a selection of treats and a birthday cake. The executive lounge is a real winner but the staff really make the difference. This will now be our home from home when we visit London.,5,2018,01,22
137,Simply Wonderful,It has been a while since I have stayed at the Hotel 41 but it was a great experience.  The service and facilities are first class in all respects.  It was a great place for a business meeting.  The service provided to my invited meeting guest was perfect. ,5,2018,01,21
137,"Lovely service, we will be back","We had a very short stay here and it was as we expected from the other reviews. Staff very attentive and nothing too much trouble.

Despite the central location once you are upstairs and inside it is very quiet and we heard nothing in our room. 

Lots of nice little touches abound like the complementary snacks, ice-cream and cheese in the evening. Turn down service folded our clothes and event tidied up charging cables. Breakfast was top notch.

We'll be back!",5,2018,01,21
137,Birthday Weekend in London,"Stayed in this fantastic hotel for my wife's birthday and had a the most memorable weekend.

I really believe that the key to 'Hotel 41's' success is that they manage to make you feel special from the moment you check in and are offered a glass of champagne till the moment you sadly have to leave.

We loved 'plunder the pantry' in the evening which I think is pretty unique all the way through to one of the best breakfasts we have ever had in the morning.

The service we received was exceptional with all staff being so friendly and personable and a huge thank you to the management team at Hotel 41 for the complimentary bottle of champagne left in our room which we enjoyed in front of the fire.",5,2018,01,21
137,I keep coming back!,"Never a disappointment, hotel 41 is the epitome of comfort, class and a top quality hotel with a lovely friendly atmosphere from the second you arrive with a glass of champers on check in and helpful, genuinely friendly staff and comfort at every turn. There’s the fabulous b bar cafe on one side of the hotel, with the best salt beef sandwich you’ll ever taste- and on the other, the wonderful Ruebens at the palace (sister hotel) with the new ‘curry room’ which serves the best currys along with superb cocktails, live music and wonderful service are the norm. You don’t need to travel very far to have a superb time and, like me, you’ll keep coming back again and again 😊",5,2018,01,19
137,"The most wonderful hidden gem, we are so glad to have found it and can't wait to return","The most wonderful hotel, a real hidden gem. My husband and I both agree 41 is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in in the world, and we have visited quite a few! From point of booking and arrival at the hotel, right through to departure we felt like the most important people in the world. The service at 41 is impeccable, as is the decor throughout, not to mention the stunning array of food in the 'pantry'. We were served complimentary hot cheese and ham sandwiches (over a glass of wine and a game or two of chess on the balcony!!) before we went to see our show, as we ran out of time to go somewhere for dinner, and this was a really lovely gesture by the hotel. After seeing a show in town we returned to the hotel and we able to 'plunder the pantry' which was simply put, AMAZING. A beautiful offering of fresh salads, fruits, cold meats and seafoods, gin and tonic ice-creams and delicious desserts. We were served a lovely bottle of wine to enjoy with our food and we ended up being the last people to go to bed, it was just so lovely sitting and relaxing in the lounge. Our room was stunning, split level and extremely spacious and the bed one of the most comfortable we have slept on. I asked for a really quiet room as I have a nervous system illness which makes me very sensitive to noise, (although I'm not sure any rooms would be noisy here!) and this request was actioned which was really very much appreciated. I didn't hear a pin drop all night and I sleep so well which is always a huge relief when I'm away from home. The staff at 41 are brilliant, they all seem to be genuinely happy in their roles and to go out of their way to ensure your comfort. They actually do care. I love the little touches at this hotel, the hot water bottle in the bed at turndown, and the Elemis toiletries on the pillow with sleep mist.. these are the things that put this hotel into a league of it's own. We are delighted to be visiting the hotel again in February as we are seeing a show, and we absolutely can't wait.",5,2018,01,17
137,So different....,"This might be the best hotel that I have ever stayed in.Not only were the staff spot on but the vibe was like no other hotel I have been too.
Upon coming to the reception area the service was like no other I have had",4,2018,01,12
137,incredible accomodation,"Luxury Hotel, incredible service, nice surrounding area and amazing staff.
I am always happy to come here when I have to visit London, is such a great experience and it become better at any new stay.
Ok it's expensive but it's really a great way to spend my money because everything it's excellent!!!!!!

I just love this place",5,2018,01,12
137,New Year Celebration,"Recently returned from seeing in the New Year at 41 Hotel and they certainly do it in a style that befits the hotel.
It is difficult to beat a Glass of Champagne for toasting the New Year and a Piper to pipe in the New Year.
It was our second visit and it certainly lives up to all the reviews.
It is like coming back to your favourite place where they welcome you with open arms and a glass of champagne.
The button - WhateverWhenever - on the telephone in your room is an indication of the level of service they pride themselves in. It is answered very quickly.
Can’t wait for our next visit.

137,Cozy place,Small room but cozy. The hotel staff are some of the best I've experienced around the world. It is across from Buckingham Palace and if you're looking for a boutique 5 star experience I would recommend this hotel.,5,2018,01,10
137,"Quaint, Cozy, Excellent!","The service here is amazing, most attentive staff I have experienced in a hotel.  The vibe is like a private club.  When you access the property it is past a reception desk to an elevator.  When you get tot hotel, it occupies one floor.  In the center there is a lounge featuring drinks and food all day.  Fireplaces, cozy sofas and intimate tables.  If you want to people watch and mingle in a bigger hotel environment, you can go next door to the Rubens Hotel. Larger, more impersonal, however still lovely!  I had several drinks at the bar there and listened to live music.
My room was well appointed, comfortable bed, deluxe sheets, top of the line toiletries, fantastic turn down service treats! Hot water bottle in bed every night was a great after a cold day in the city!
I will certainly return and look forward to it!",5,2018,01,09
137,Another fabulous stay,"We stayed here just after our wedding in 2015 and decided to return for our anniversary. Right from the moment I booked we were treated like celebrities. 

The staff here know how to be present, without being in your face and the whole operation is incredibly slick. There are so many hotels I've been to which should take some advice from the Hotel 41.

The food choice from breakfast through to ""plunder the pantry"" is extremely generous and we didn't need to eat out as we were so full. The wine and cocktail list is equally good. We tried a bottle of Hannibal from their sister winery in South Africa and it was seriously good.

The Hotel and its staff stand out as there are an abundance of extra touches here. I don't want to spoil the surprise for you so I'll just list a few things we loved on our second stay here:

- Vast pillow choice.
- Beautiful 2 floor room with its own working fire and mini Christmas tree.
- Extensive DVD list.
- Amazing treats throughout our stay (most of which were complimentary).
- Secret lift to the Reubens hotel where we had drinks and entertainment.

Generally the team pulled out all the stops to ensure that we had a memorable anniversary.

We came here to relax, but if you are a tourist from overseas the location is excellent to reach the best parts of London.

We can't wait to return later this year and are hoping to visit some of Red Carnation's other hotels for an equally amazing experience. 

You simply have to stay in this hotel!",5,2018,01,07
137,Perfection,"This was my first time to visit this beautiful hotel and it deserves 6 stars for the perfect service warm and friendly too perfection. The reception and lobby are so beautiful you don't want to leave. It transports you to another place in time. The rooms are so pretty, with fire places and wonderful bedding.

The service is impeccable. Everyone you meet is charming and have a wealth of knowledge and they all want to be of service.

Ivo and Laura were so helpful to me as was Victoria the concierge, Aaron the doorman and Laura the GM and her staff...just lovely people who continue to earn important awards that they truly deserve.",5,2018,01,07
137,Christmas in London,"Six of us stayed at this lovely boutique hotel just a few blocks from Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station.  The property is very elegant but homey. You are made to feel as an honored guest in someone’s home.  Perfect for Christmas morning. The staff is friendly and attentive. The complimentary “Plunder The Pantry” service provides high quality snacks throughout the day, including a light evening buffet.  The Guest Services staff are excellent at making dinner, entertainment and tour arrangements. Individual kindnesses shown by staff members were also much appreciated.

I have never had a better hotel experience.",5,2018,01,06
137,Perfect as always,This was our 4th stay at Hotel 41 and it is always perfect. There is no other way to describe it. The staff are amazing and nothing is ever too much trouble. It is a peaceful and relaxing retreat in the centre of London. Can't wait to return for Christmas 2018. ,5,2018,01,05
137,As good or better than expected,"Stayed here 12/26/17 - 12/31/17.  Could not have asked for better service and a better experience up and down their team.  Special shout out to Nicole who was just outstanding in her service but then again so was EVERYONE else only wish I jotted everyone's name down.  
The location is awesome and easy to walk to all over London or a short walk to the Victoria Tube stop.
I can't wait to return and would not think of staying anywhere else in London.  We had a large room particularly for a European city which was very comfortable.
Thank you !",5,2018,01,04
137,Service beyond comparison...,"Although not returning to stay this time, I had been in touch to ask a favour for my Partners Christmas present.  Not something I was sure they could do, but I decided to ask anyway.  I initially contacted Malcolm, the General Manager, with my request.  He responded positively and gave me the relevant detail I needed to make my choices, which I did.  I arranged to pick up and reimburse them for my Partners Christmas present on Christmas Eve (which they had arranged), and was greeted by name, offered a hot chocolate drink on arrival (it was cold and windy outside) and asked to go to the reception desk upstairs.  Again, greeted by the team by name and the present was brought through.  I expected the present in a 41 bag or similar but was flabbergasted to find the present had been professionally wrapped and had a ribbon around it.  All I had to do was put a tag on and write it out (even I can do that!).  I was asked if I wanted a refreshment (partner waiting so unfortunately no).  There were people enjoying afternoon tea, plundering the pantry and warming themselves by the fire.  It was a case of been there, done that and enjoyed every minute of it.  The best part (as usual) was being met and greeted like a dignitary, the worst part was having to leave the luxury and pampering only 41 can do so well after such a short time.  We will be returning later this year to celebrate another special occasion and look forward to meeting the team again.  
Many thanks to Malcolm and the team at 41 for service well over and above expectation.",5,2018,01,04
137,Benchmark of class,"Our 4th visit to Hotel 41 in as many years and it absolutely isn’t an exaggeration to say that each visit has got better and better. Our last visit was to celebrate our 10th anniversary and the kindness and standard of customer service that we were shown made it something that will live long in our memories. Hotel 41 remains the benchmark against which we measure service at other hotels, which explains why we are currently planing our 5th visit.",5,2018,01,03
137,Private Club Feel in Heart of London ,"The customer service is outstanding! Everyone that works there is smiling and friendly & you feel like they truly want to help you with anything you need.  I won’t stay anywhere else in London ever again other than Hotel 41.  From the customer service, to the quality of the food, to the comfort of your room....all 5 stars!!!",5,2018,01,02
137,"Great hotel, excellent service ","We stayed in Hotel 41 for a week from Boxing Day until the first of January. From the moment we arrived we were amazed by the excellent service. The moment you check in the staff know you by name, they remember about everything you tell. We went to a show and the day after one of the staff asked us about the show.

In the lounge there are always some snacks (completely) and you can order about any drink you can think of. I was getting a bit ill during my stay (I catched a cold) and one of the staff told me I should drink a Toddy. Didn’t know what that was but see got one from me and it did help. The next few days several members of the staff asked me how I was doing. 

We’ve stayed in several 5 star hotels but you can’t compare hotel 41 with any of these. Hotel 41 is a 5 star plus hotel.

The room had a king size bed and was very clean and has everything you need. Every evening you get a bottle of water next to your bed and they put a hot-water bag in your bed. Our room even had two international power plugs and a home trainer (which we requested).

Breakfast is also very good. You can use a buffet with fresh bread, yogurt, fruit, etc. And you can order warm breakfast from a menu. I can recommend the crushed avocado :-).

We had diner in the lounge once, which was excellent and we ate twice in the Curry room below the hotel which is the best Indian Restaurant we ever ate (other review).

Any negatives? Maybe but if the service is as excellent as it is here it’s hard to find any negative things.",5,2018,01,02
137,The Perfect Hotel,We were going to London for our honeymoon and decided to stay at Hotel 41 after seeing its high rating and great reviews.  The hotel and staff surpassed our expectations. The staff surprised us with a congratulations cake in our room. The room was spacious and comfortable and we looked forward to the nightly turn down service (loved the hot water bottle). The lounge was a great place to relax after spending a day sightseeing. We enjoyed the food and goodies from the Pantry. The staff were exceptional; very friendly and helpful.  The location of the hotel could not be better. Lots of great restaurants nearby and it was easy to travel all over London. We would never be able to stay anywhere else if in London and we're already planning a trip back.,5,2018,01,02
137,Ultimate Service,"The hotel was warm and welcoming and was an ideal home base for our time in London.  The room was a bit smaller than we expected, but what the room lacked in size, the staff made up for with their impeccable service.  The staff was extremely attentive and was happy to help with any request.  In fact, they even followed up with a special request after we checked out!  The hotel is well located, within walking distance to the train/metro station and many of the top sites in London.  Each evening, after a long day of sightseeing, we looked forward to the varied and delicious Plunder the Pantry offerings in the cozy lounge.",5,2018,01,01
137,Industry Excellence!,"The staff is remarkable. The property is exquisite. The location is unbelievable. From a Christmas tree in our room, stocking on our door and present under the tree, they made my daughter’s Christmas in London unforgettable. Thank you 41 Hotel",5,2017,12,30
137,What a treat,This hotel is located directly across the street from Buckingham Palace and close to the tube.  My husband and I stayed here for three nights and were blown away by the service/cleanliness and attention to detail from this hotel. You are greeted at the front door and escorted up to a wonderful lounge area where you are given a glass of bubbly (really good) and olives while you get relaxed and checked into your room.  The room we were in was wonderful clean and by English standards quite roomy.  To my surprise on the first evening there was a water bottle in my bead which was a nice added touch to our stay and upon arrival there after it heated my bed before I retired to it lol.  Morning breakfast was included and it was yummy - I am a coffee snob and there coffee was good!!!!  I would really recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to feel like a queen while in London and not being with her in her castle next door :),5,2017,12,29
137,Still amazing,"Our second stay at 41 was every bit as magical as the first. Perhaps helped, just a little, by the surprise upgrade to the wonderful Conservatory Suite (what an amazing treat - thank you!). Plunder the pantry food was varied and delicious, as were the canapes which accompanied our cocktails.  It was great to see some familiar faces, and a few new members of the team, all delivering the trademark service for which 41 is renowned. So tough to drag ourselves away from the lounge and back to the real world, but we're already planning our next visit.",5,2017,12,22
137,Top Hotel,This hotel is top notch. From the time you check in to your departure the staff makes you feel like royalty. The hotel is also in a great location. As an added bonus the “snacks” that are put out towards evening out are unbelievable. One night after a long day we had wine and the snacks it was a perfect end to the day. Keep up the excellent job.,5,2017,12,21
137,Once in a lifetime,"There are no words to describe the experience of staying here. 7 stars.

Tucked away above the Reubens hotel you would never know that this luxurious hotel is there. Extraordinarily attentive staff with fantastic attention to detail. Food was wonderful.",5,2017,12,21
137,Small and Perfect!,"Great little London hotel! Staff was very helpful with our various needs (from arriving early to transportation) and we really enjoyed our stay. This hotel excels at all the little unexpected things, like leaving a hot water bottle in your bed at turndown, along with other treats like pillow spray or lip balm. The location is perfection, right across from Buckingham Palace and close to the Victoria tube and train station, so you can get to everywhere you need. The snack pantry was one of my favorite parts (all hotels should do this) and it was nice being able to grab a quick snack whenever you wanted! Rooms and bathrooms were well-appointed and quite spacious as well. I'd definitely return!",5,2017,12,21
137,Incredible place like no other.,We stayed here for a night on the 19th December as it was our anniversary.  I had high expectations and they were completed exceeded. All staff without exception were friendly and welcoming. We were given an upgrade and we were blown away with the penthouse suite. The food was amazing and there was lots of it. The complimentary champagne on arrival was lovely. Afternoon tea and breakfast were superb. Thanks for a memorable trip. We will definitely return. ,5,2017,12,21
137,A Royal Honeymoon ,"When you get married in Disney World  where do you go on your honeymoon? How about across the road from The queen of England? 
Hotel 41 is the most luxurious experience from champagne welcomes to dvds & popcorn delivered to your room to high tea fit for royalty. 
Even when you come back to your suite after a long day shopping at harrods what better way to do it than with rose petals covering ur room and a cosy hot water bottle in your turn down queen sized bed? 
My husband and I fell madly in love with this hotel & we cannot wait for our next visit already! 
Love the Robbs ",5,2017,12,19
137,The Best Hotel ,"Hotel 41 is the best hotel I have stayed at. 
The personal service that the staff at Hotel 41 provided during our stay was excellent. They would greet us at the door, and in the lounge by our names. They would provide recommendations on places to see, restaurants to eat at, etc.  The rooms were spotless and evening turn down service always provided a treat, hot water bottles in the bed and a lip balm or another small surprise. ",5,2017,12,17
137,Maybe perfection,"Must be great when even your morning toast is shaped like a bunny!

Make a list of all the things you want in a five (maybe six) star hotel within 200 yards of Her Majesty’s backyard. 

Now imagine a service level that matches this dream hotel.

Now, make a reservation at “41”!

You won’t regret it.

Enough said?

Excellent staff - helped with musical tickets (at the last minute), dinner reservations and local recommendations at markets.  Logistics are great - fast, free Wifi (I was able to run my VPN without any issue), everything worked.  The details are not missed - turn down services are amazing, hotel water bottle in the bed and nightly sweet treats.  The Executive Lounge is great - perfect snacks, Raid the Pantry, drinks, fireplace, mingle with other guests if you want or don't.  We haven't been to every hotel in London but this is our favorite.",5,2017,12,11

137,Deserving of 6 stars!,"Deservedly Number 1 in London on TripAdvisor! My partner and I have just stayed for 1 night only but will definitely return. A wonderfully intimate and luxurious hotel where absolutely nothing is too much trouble, our room was beautiful, heavenly bed and brilliant shower and bathroom, the executive lounge with complimentary champagne on arrival and all day snacks and treats a real delight. We returned from dinner out to find our bed turned down, bedside candles lit and lights dimmed and a hot water bottle placed in my partners side of the bed...fantastic! 
The full English breakfast was one of the best I have ever enjoyed, the home made hashbrowns superb! Thank you so much to all the staff, exemplary service and hospitality all round, we hope to return soon!

137,Fantastic hotel with wonderful staff 10/10,"Customer service = top notch. Steve in the executive lounge was particularly helpful and friendly, giving us a great insight into the local area and made us all laugh. The rooms are exceptionally well decorated and cater to one's every whim; the room was equipped with hot water bottles and laptop cushions at our request, along with the elegant Penthaligon's toiletries. View of the golden carriage in the Royal Mews from our executive suite. Thoroughly recommend if in search of some high-end luxury.",5,2017,12,04

Not the biggest hotel in London, but that doesn't mean the rooms are small.
The room is spacious, well-designed and well equipped with pretty much everything that you could need for your stay. 
Extrememly comfortable bed and stunning room will make you feel right at home.

Location:
Hotel41 is located near Victoria station - one of the biggest hubs in London - which makes it easy for many to simply walk from the tube station to the hotel. If you're travelling from Gatwick you can simply take the Gatwick Express to Victoria and then walk a few minutes to the hotel. This makes it easy for you to get around in London as well. Just go to Victoria and take the tube to wherever you want. PERFECT.

The hotel is close to Buckingham Palace, the Buckingham Palace Gardens and other attractions and you have plenty of high end fashion brands with their shops in the area.

""It's the little things that matter the most"" - a saying that I keep thinking about when I think about Hotel41. The attention to detail (even the smallest ones) and the customer service is the BEST - and you simply won't be dissapointed.",5,2017,12,02
137,A wonderful stay in London,"The entrance to Hotel 41 is right next to The Reubens and quite discrete but once in welcomed by a very friendly Lukas who had already been a star by email, receiving a parcel and helping me prepare a surprise for my wife.

We were taken upstairs and booked in while being given a complimentary glass of champagne which we finished off sitting comfortably infront of the fire.

We had arrived very early and left our bags while going for lunch and on our return they were all in the room. We had booked the conservatory suite which features a glass roof and large double jacuzzi bath room.

The romantic turndown was a perfect end to our day.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and all the staff were friendly and managed to remember who we were and what we had done in order to ask how it had been.",5,2017,12,01
137,Simply the Best!,"I love this hotel! The customer service starts with the reservationist, Nikki! She made the booking process seamless and is an asset to the hotel! Andrew, who seems to do everything at the hotel made my stay brilliant with all of the little touches like my favorite cupcakes and football on the tv 😊 Upon leaving, i contacted Nikki about another stay and although 41 is fully booked, she still helped me find a great place at a partner hotel! If you want to be treated like royalty... 41 is your place to stay! ps- the shower in the split level suite is AMAZING! ",5,2017,11,29
137,November,"Hotel 41 was booked as a surprise night away  for our 40th Birthday, by our lovely friends. We were greeted with a glass of complementary champagne and the experience just got better as the day continued. The staff just couldn't do enough for us, and it made for such an enjoyable stay.

The room was spacious and well equipped with everything that you could need for your stay. Exceptional service and can't wait to return to the hotel",5,2017,11,27
137,Excellent service in a quaint setting,My wife and took a quick trip to London in August.  The service and room at Hotel 41 was top notch.  Great location to see many of the London sites.  The staff was on top of everything. We have no complaints. ,5,2017,11,25
137,Superb service,The service and attention to detail was exceptional. Nothing was too much trouble. An intimate hotel which caters for  each individual. The executive lounge is a perfect size providing a comfortable environment to relax. Fantastic venue for a special event. Husband was receiving his MBE and the hotel made him feel special and remembered all the detail of the event. ,5,2017,11,24
137,Simply Awesome!,"Definitely the best service I’ve ever encountered! My room was nice, view was poor, but I probably had one of the cheaper rooms (booked through Expedia). The perks that came in the cost of the stay were great (water, snacks, etc.) Definitely recommend!",5,2017,11,21
137,Hotel before my visit to Buckingham palace for investiture,I stayed at this hotel with my wife and sister as it was only 200 metres from Buckingham Place. This is exceptional when it comes to customer service. Everything was perfect from the front desk to the room and the amazing Executive Lounge.  I stay in hotels all round the world and this beats them all. Small and a real throwback to the days when people were there to delight and serve. Give yourself an exceptional experience here.,5,2017,11,16
137,Wow wow wow,"If you got a room here you will never forget it.
A small hotel but one of the best. Rooms are perfect but the main thing is the staff and the service. It is royal. The staff is the most professional and committed I have ever seen, even in hotels that are the best of the best on London, and I've been around all of them.
A special note of recommendation should be given to Victoria that goes out of her way to make your stay perfect but this is true to all the staff. Of you have had here more stars I would have given then in this review. ",5,2017,11,16
137,Wow ,"Wow what a hotel, everything about this place is superb. I've. Never stayed in a hotel as lush as this. Immaculate. It's the Madonna of all London hotels. If looking to impress take a loved one or your other half here",5,2017,11,14
137,Always a Warm Welcome!!,My husband & I have stayed at Hotel 41 for many years & its our Constant into London because we are welcomed as friends. If you want to feel The exclusive & Fancy a touch of the Best...Book in & see for yourself!:-) Enjoy!!,5,2017,11,13
137,Amazing service and great location!,"This was our first time to London and we weren't sure where to go or stay but trusted that this hotel got such great reviews on TripAdvisor. Let me just say we weren't disappointed. The hotel is in a fabulous location, close to Buckingham Palace, Victoria Station, and tons of other easy to walk to landmarks. I have to say, our expectations were exceeded by our stay. The staff was so friendly and welcoming, and eager to make our experience incredible. Nicole provided us with great recommendations for dinner and entertainment and we enjoyed everything she suggested. The rest of the staff knew our names and made us feel right at home. The housekeeping was amazing! There were so many little touches like cord keepers, and sheet warmers, and everyday they made sure our room was organized and comfortable. I can't say enough good things. Can't wait to go back!",5,2017,11,13
137,Luxury in a personal way,"A 3-night stay that was perfect. The service is excellent still on a very personal way. You really feel welcome and welcomed in this hotel. I have been in London several times, but this was without question the best hotelstay I have had in this city.",5,2017,11,13
137,Luxurious and Welcoming,Hotel 41 is beautiful and they have thought of everything you might need.  The beds are extremely comfortable.  The rooms are stunning.  The food is delicious.  The service is impeccable yet friendly.  We stayed for five nights and every time we came back to the hotel we were welcomed by name and asked about our day and it felt like we were home.  Location is also great (just down the road from her maj).,5,2017,11,12
137,Fantastic service and building ,"Stayed here for 2 nights and the staff were amazingly accommodating- nothing too much trouble. They booked my friend and I into a hair salon last minute, recommended restaurants and were truly fantastic. The best location to tourist attractions and the most comfy bed. ",5,2017,11,11
137,A little hidden gem in London.....,"I booked Hotel 41 as a surprise weekend away to treat my Wife for her 40th Birthday. We were greeted with a glass of complementary champagne and the experience just got better as the weekend continued. The staff just couldn't do enough for us, and it made for such an enjoyable stay.

The room was spacious and well equipped with everything that you could need for your stay. In the evening, we were up against the clock in getting ready to go for dinner at the Roux at the Landau and the room was left in a bit of a mess when we left. However when we returned, the fire was on, candles lit with rose petals around the bed, background music playing and the everything in the room has been tidied (clothes folded and hung up, toiletries arranged neatly in the bathroom) and there was even a hot water bottle in the bed!. The bed was very spacious and comfortable and we has a very peaceful nights sleep in the middle of London.  

The breakfast was very good indeed and the added benefits of 'Plunder the Pantry' throughout our stay and the goody bag for the trip home were the finishing touches to the experience. It's not cheap, but in our opinion it's worth every penny as the weekend will stay long in our memories. Thank you Hotel 41 and all of the staff that made our stay so enjoyable.",5,2017,11,06
137,Fantastic Hotel!,"Stayed here for our 2 year Anniversary back in August and had a fantastic stay. From the minute you walk in you are treated like royalty. Staff are very polite and well trained. We really enjoyed the welcome champagne from the trolley, very nice touch! The room was beautifully decorated with extremely comfortable beds. Had a few Brandies in the bar when we got back from the show and was again, very well looked after. I have stayed in several of the top Hotels in London (The Dorchester, Savoy, Shangri La, Mandarin Oriental etc) and I can honestly say, Hotel 41 is one of the best and has a lovely personal touch, which can get lost at other larger Hotels. I'd recommend it without hesitation.",5,2017,11,01
137,Great Hotel,"41 is most definitely the best hotel in the city!
Everything is 5 star - location, accommodation, attitude.
But what really makes this hotel superb is the Staff. All the crew members are real hospitality stars - attentive to every detail, responsive, cordial, helpful.
Thanks a lot, people of Hotel 41!",5,2017,11,01
137,Executive suite and lux from start to end,"The service is without peer. The fireplace in the executive lounge warmed me as I drank champagne and nibbled delicious canapés. Our tastefully decorated bedroom had either a 16 or 18 foot ceiling and the lighting was easily adjustable to provide anywhere from single reading to brilliant room light.  A pillow spray, complimentary bedroom slippers (new), and the offer of a complimentary shoe shine all enhanced the experience and in-room spa options are available.  It is across the street from Buckingham Palace and gift shop.  We opted to dine at the pub at the corner, the Bag of Nails, and then enjoyed a restful good night sleep before returning to the USA.",5,2017,10,30
137,Excellent hotel that will spoil you for anywhere else,"We stared here for 4 nights in October.  I can't rave about this hotel enough, it was everything I expected and more - and I tend to expect quite a bit.  Room had those extra special touches - welcome note and chocolates, towel warmer in bathroom, robe and slippers, hot water bottle in bed each night, turn-down service with different surprises.  The staff were truly exceptional - quickly learned our names and preferences.  This hotel pampers you beyond belief without giving off a feeling of pretentiousness - we cannot imagine staying anywhere else in London.  Thanks to everyone who helped to make our stay special.",5,2017,10,30
137,Beautiful and Unique Small Hotel,"We absolutely loved Hotel 41 and would stay there again if we ever are lucky enough to go back to London!  Every staff member is so personable, and they go above and beyond to take exceptional care of you!  We stayed in an executive King room and it was just lovely!  The decor throughout the hotel was gorgeous. We loved being able to go through a door on the hotel side and access The Reuben Hotel next door for dining options and a bar.  We paid for a full breakfast every morning and the food was delicious!  One of the staff members heard we were going on a diet when we returned to the states, and when we got back to our room one day during our stay, there were candies, cookies, and sweets on the table with a little note saying that they hope we could enjoy these before our dieting started!  Our last night there, during turndown service, they put little candles surrounded by rose petals throughout the room.  And on my 60th birthday, there was a little something sweet from them waiting for me.  The little touches were so very nice! We met very nice people each day in the executive lounge and enjoyed relaxing in there at the end of the day. We were within walking distance of several places, and the others we took an Ueber to and from.  No hassles at all.",5,2017,10,28
137,Everything you could want and more,"My wife and I visited London for our 12th anniversary last week.  We decided to stay at Hotel 41 based on the reviews and boutique appeal.  Needless to say, we couldn't be more happy with our choice.  The location is outstanding as are the accommodations.  However, the thing that truly sets them apart is the service.  The staff is incredibly friendly & helpful.  They did everything possible to ensure our stay was top notch.  Everyone of them knew who we were and provided guidance to ensure a great trip to London.  I really can't say enough.  I travel all over the world and Hotel 41 was one of my favorite places.  I highly recommend it and we will be back.",5,2017,10,27
137,Escape ,"This was our second visit to the 41 and once again we could not fault this hotel the staff are all fantastic, patryicia who served our breakfast the first 3 mornings is a lovely young lady, as were all the other members of the team, Lovely having a chat again with Steve who is just wonderful, we were upgraded to a junior suite which was fabulous all the little touches they do in your room are great, hot water bottle in the bed was a nice touch, you can have fresh milk with your tea which is lovely, chocolates when you arrive in your room, plunder the pantry is divine a must try for all visitors, ice cream is gorgeous. the only downside was we had to leave can’t wait for our next visit. ",5,2017,10,25
137,4 and counting.....,"This is our 4th time staying at Hotel 41 and as with the previous 3 stays, it couldn't have been any better.  The service continues to shine like no other.  The staff is eager to please, always, and everyone goes that extra step to make sure you feel like you're at home.  It's pure perfection in every way possible.  This will certainly not be our last time at Hotel 41 and I would recommend it to all.  A special thanks to the entire staff.",5,2017,10,25
137,Pure perfection,"My husband and I have just returned from a 2 night stay at Hotel 41. The trip advisor reviews say it all, this hotel is pure perfection, from the greeting at the entrance to the farewell when we left. Nothing too much trouble any problems dealt with immediately and fantastically. Beautiful rooms and fantastic food and drinks. All the staff here are amazing and special thanks to Dean for making us feel so at home. we truly cannot wait to return. Thank you so much Hotel 41.",5,2017,10,24
137,Smitten with Hotel 41,"We recently spent a week at Hotel 41 in a Junior Suite.  The hotel was able to arrange a private transfer from the airport directly to the hotel for us (BIG PLUS...considering we were exhausted and didn't want to have to think about anything after flying overnight).  Check-in was seamless (thanks for the champagne!).  Our room was well appointed with a very comfortable bed and chocolates at the ready.  We were on a trip celebrating my birthday, so there was also a birthday cake in the room upon arrival with a bottle of champagne.  These little details do not go unnoticed-we were so appreciative.
We loved relaxing in the lounge, whether for high tea (you have to try it!) or a couple of cocktails-it was such a nice environment.  The whole team went out of their way to make sure that we were having a nice time-calling taxis, arranging dinner reservations, leaving weather forecasts for the next day as well as treats in our room, just to name a few.  
Special thanks to Steve (we didn't get to say goodbye, but please know that we really enjoyed meeting you), Mitchell, and ""the Scotsman"" (and please forgive me, but I have forgotten so many other names, including the woman who served us breakfast the last morning and recommended the avocado toast-so good!)  Every single staff member was lovely-what a great team.
One very special touch during our trip left me speechless.  The team was able to arrange us dinner reservations at a steakhouse one night.  When we got to the restaurant, our waitress brought over two glasses of champagne, compliments of Hotel 41.  Honestly, I was so taken aback that I thought there must have been a mistake.  But it wasn't.  It's just Hotel 41's amazing ability to make their guests feel taken care of (but not only that-appreciated!)
I cannot wait to stay here again.  I will never consider another hotel in London!",5,2017,10,24
137,Executive Club,"Hotel 41 was a wonderful surprise. We stayed for 3 nights and fell in love with the hotel. The rooms are beautiful, the staff is friendly, and awesome. Having access to the Executive Club was a wonderful treat for breakfast, cocktails, and even dinner. Really love the hotel...a hidden gem.",5,2017,10,23
137,London Luxuory ,"Above!This property was first class upon getting out of the taxi. The service was unbelieveable and they knew our names, what we liked, and took excellent care of us. The lounge area is beautiful, the rooms were lovely and the amenities were top notch. Would recommend this hotel to anyone..",5,2017,10,21
137,Oh how we miss the Hotel 41!,"We returned recently from our fifth stay at the Hotel 41. Obviously we love it!  We loved the location before but it is fantastic now with the newly opened shops and restaurants that had been under construction during our past visits. The new Cardinal Place entrance to Victoria Station is very handy. 

We cannot say enough wonderful things about the Hotel 41. As noted, excellent location near Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station. Beautiful building with an English country club feel. The Executive Lounge with the all-day snack options was a delight to return to for a break during busy days of sightseeing and for an evening snack/meal. 

What sets the Hotel 41 a notch above is the staff. Every single person at the Hotel 41 works hard to make sure guests enjoy their stay. We've stayed enough times to get to know many of the staff. They are not employees to us - they are friends. Malcolm, the general manager, is always welcoming despite the fact we stay using a Costco package. Adele has always been wonderful to us, going above and beyond. Nicole is always super pleasant -- we so enjoy seeing her and visiting with her. Paula, who frequently took our breakfast order - always pleasant and efficient. And Steve - you rock! We loved returning to the Executive Lounge when Steve was working. We enjoyed sharing our day with him and learning some London tips from him. 

Yes - we will be back again. There is no other place to stay in London as far as we are concerned.",5,2017,10,19
137,It just gets better and better,"This must be the best hotel in the world, bar none. Our second visit here and if it were possible, it was even better second time round.

The staff welcomed us back like returning relatives and they instinctively knew and remembered all the the things we liked, from the important (I don't drink alcohol) to the insignificant. However, that is the point, nothing is insignificant to these people. There is a warmth and humility that is genuine and tangible in everything that they do. 

I want this review to be about the people and not necessarily the food, room, drink or service. In many ways that is a given with a 5* hotel. What makes Hotel41 so very different, unique and special is that they care about me (and my wife) for who we are. We are not rich, nor famous. In fact this couldn't be further from the truth. We both work in schools and have to save up to visit this wonderful establishment.

No request is too small and they know when to engage in conversation and when to leave us alone. Somebody being bothered to ask how my day has been, mean what they say and then listen (properly) to the answer that is given is a sign of pure class.

Here's the curve ball: Our trip was cut short by one night because our son was taken ill. Nothing too traumatic but it still meant that we had to leave and take over from Nanny and Grampy. Hotel41's response was simply unbelievable. They let us leave our stuff in the room and sent us on our way with coffee and croissants at a moment's notice, so that we didn't have to worry about stopping for stuff on the way home. Once we got home and everything settled down I phoned Hotel41 with a request. As a thank you to them, would it be OK for Nanny and Grampy to come to London and have the final night of our stay with them? The wonderful Victoria didn't need to think twice; 'Sir, it would be our pleasure to welcome and look after them'. 

I got a text from my father-in-law a few hours later that read: 'Arrived safely at Hotel41. I think I've died and gone to heaven'. That pretty much sums everything up.

Finally, the first question that the staff asked when my in-laws arrived? How is your grandson?' As I said earlier, pure class.

The saving up for next year's visit had already begun.

Thank you, Hotel41

",5,2017,10,19
137,The Best Hotel in the World,"There is only one problem with this hotel: I will never be satisfied at another hotel after staying at Hotel 41.  It is a small hotel -- 22 rooms I believe -- and is more of a private club.  The hotel centers around the Executive Lounge, a dark wood paneled room with fireplace, tables, chairs, and a large, knowledgeable, and very amiable staff who work to assist the guests constantly.  Perhaps the only thing more abundant than the staff is the food that it out in the Lounge at all hours.  There was no request that the staff did not attempt to meet.  Our room contained a fireplace that was lit every evening when we returned.  I have never stayed at another hotel that approaches the beauty, grace, and sustenance of Hotel 41.",5,2017,10,17
137,Exceptional experience,"My husband and I stayed here in early October and our experience at Hotel 41 was ideal in every way from the moment we arrived, to our suite (upgraded for free--thank you Hotel 41!), an exceptional dinner in The English Grill with a complimentary scotch tasting, as well as surprise champagne and strawberries when we returned to our room after dinner. Our suite was unbelievable--two levels, fireplace, and a retracting ceiling so we could enjoy the stars at night. I've never seen anything like it. The location was ideal, in the heart of the city right by Buckingham Palace, and yet the hotel felt completely quiet and private. Employees Nicole, Patrycja and Andrew worked hard to make us feel like royalty. We loved our stay and wish we could have stayed longer!",5,2017,10,16
137,Wow- secret treasure in London.,"The attention to detail at this hotel is unparalleled. The staff is impeccably perceptive- they anticipate your needs before you even know you have them! If you ask for a wake up call, they ask if what type
Of coffee they can send with the call. If you walk through the door with luggage, they not only take your luggage, they personally walk you into the conservatory lounge and pour you a glass of champagne while they check you in. Sometimes they surprise you and upgrade you to one of their 6 exclusive suites- and give you turndown service with candles and rose petals. We feel like we stepped into an alternate reality-
truly pampered and valued. We travel frequently and seek out lovely places to stay. We have never had an experience like this before! If you get a chance to stay here, please take it. It is an incredible opportunity for an escape from normal life. Andrew, Steve, and the rest of the staff- thank you! ",5,2017,10,10
137,A great place,The space that I stayed with my husband was definitely one of the best. The room had a particular scent to give of its welcomness. We stayed there for 2 days and we just wanted to stay but we had to get going to our next country.,4,2017,10,09
137,The best little hotel in London!,"This place is truly a gem. My sister and I stayed here for three nights--the staff greeted us by name on arrival, we had a beautiful upgraded room and there were ALWAYS really really good snacks!! The staff was friendly and helpful and all of them had a great sense of humor. Stay here!!",5,2017,10,06
137,Completely Spoiled for Any Other Hotel Experience!,"My husband and I spent 4 nights with his 93 year old mother at Hotel 41.  I chose this hotel for its reputation for outstanding concierge service and the Executive Lounge experience.  The hotel and staff exceeded our expectations.  The rooms are beautiful, clean and offer every amenity.  The lounge is a special treat, offering delicious food at all times of the day.
But most importantly, the staff is perfection!  Every request is met with a cheerful professionalism and genuine kindness.  We are completely spoiled for any other hotel experience in London or elsewhere, and we are well traveled in the U.S. and abroad.",5,2017,10,05
137,Outstanding in every way- A hidden gem!,"We recently stayed at Hotel 41 for a couple of nights for my 40th Birthday. This was a family visit with our two children, aged 9 and 5.
The hotel is truly beautiful, both the building itself and the decor which is incredibly stylish and has real personality, no bland beige interiors here! Instead you can expect luxe black and white carpets, real orchids, classic dark wood and touches of gilt.
Nothing is too much trouble for the wonderful staff here. 
Check-in takes place in the lovely lounge where you are welcomed with a complimentary glass of a fantastic choice of champagnes.
The lounge is also where meals are served and this delightful setting complete with real fire makes you feel very relaxed and 'at home'
Our suite was wonderful, the rooms was beautifully decorated and there were fresh orchids throughout. 
There was also a selection of fresh fruits, sweets and a wonderful personalised cake, which  was a lovely gesture for my birthday, complete with chocolates and macaroons. The bathrooms were luxurious and nicely decorated and the toiletries supplied were by Penhaligans. The children loved the fact that they had their own bathrobes and slippers, which many hotels overlook. 
There was an amazing walk-in wardrobe too, fitted out with dark wood chests of drawers and plenty of shelves, hanging rails and mirrors.
We had an afternoon tea in the lounge after checking in, which i would highly recommend, there was a children's version available too and a huge selection of teas available, all beautifully presented.
The hotel offers a constant supply of complimentary treats in the lounge- this changes throughout the day and includes sweets, cakes, pastries, pies, biscuits, meats, cheeses, fruit etc, this is a lovely and very unusual touch.
Throughout our stay the staff were attentive and eager to help but never intrusive, asking if we needed directions, bringing us maps etc and offering to book tickets for shows etc.
The children were especially delighted to find some treats left in the room one evening which related to a conversation they had with one of the staff- this was a lovely touch and made them feel so welcome.
The food in Hotel 41 is wonderful- we had breakfast and dinner and both were delicious.
I would recommend Hotel 41 to anyone, not only is it a beautiful place to stay with fantastic staff, but it is also in a brilliant location, literally a few minutes walk from the Palace.
",5,2017,10,04
137,Best staying,"Best place to staying here, good for honeymoon or family, food was so good and testy, best recomendation, clean and staff  so friendly to talking. We will come and stay again for nex time. When stay here also so easy go out anywhere. Good and must be come again. ",5,2017,10,01
137,surprise upgrade,"We visit London every few years and always stay at the Rubens at the Palace Hotel.  We found it on line over ten years ago and told our travel agent about it.  The Rubens is a great hotel and part of Red Carnation Hotels (more on them later).  When we arrived at the hotel this past August, we were greeted at the door as usual and escorted to the front desk. We were informed that our room was upgraded to the hotel next door; the 41!!   I just finished reading the August copy of Travel Leisure and remembered the 41 was rated #1 in London ahead of The Goring.  Needless to say, my wife and I were excited.  We were escorted to the elevator up to the top floor of the hotel and into the magnificent lounge (think a private club atmosphere).  We were given the Balmoral Suite which was exquisite.  It had two rooms, a huge king bed with two couches and two full baths.  When we opened what we thought was a closet, we found another fully enclosed shower: WOW.  We always were served fresh fruit in the room.  The lounge was down the haff from us and besides food/snacks/ drinks/ pastries/ candy all day had the absolute BEST staff.  They could not help us enough, offering suggestions, directions, etc.  They also told us the fascinating story about Red Carnation and Mrs. Beatrice Tollman, the owner.  I have never met Mrs. Tollman but she and her team know how to run hotels.  Easily on par with The Four Seasons for quality accommodations and customer service.  Needless to say, I highly recommend the Rubens and the 41 and would expect all their hotels to be of similar quality.",5,2017,09,26
137,Above the Rest!,"We had the absolute pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in mid-September for 5 days. There is a reason this hotel is number 1, and it comes down to service.  The words, ""no or we can't"" do not exist in the staff's vocabulary. Hence, the ""whatever, whenever"" button on your hotel room's telephone.

We have been fortunate enough to stay in very nice hotels all over the world, but we can honestly say, the service at Hotel 41 exceeded all of them.  We are not going to single out one person on the staff because everyone was truly exceptional.

The hotel is very much like a secluded club, an oasis if you will, in a bustling big city. It was a pleasure coming back to Hotel 41 after a long day of taking in the sites of London.
The atmosphere of the lobby was very tranquil. The candles, music and fireplace added to the ambience.

Food was availablele 24/7 for the taking, from snacks during the day to salad, bread, a main course and ice cream in the evening. It was such a treat to come back late at night after the theater and help yourself to the goodies and sit in the relaxing lobby.

The hotel rooms are beautifully appointed.  We reserved an Executive King, and it was a very good size for 2 people.  It was very nice to come back to our room and find treats on our pillows from the staff.  A welcome site indeed!

We arrived on my husband's birthday, and the hotel had a cake and chocolates waiting for him in our room, along with a number of candles burning and rose petals.  It was lovely.

Thank you to everyone at Hotel 41 for such a special experience!  When our travels bring us back to London, this will be our choice of places to stay.

Our very best,

Tom and Karen",5,2017,09,26
137,OUTSTANDING,"By far the most outstanding, professional, accommodating, informed and courteous staff.  Have been to some of the finest Hotels here and abroad. It does not have the glitz of a Ritz, what it does have is an intimate, classy and peaceful setting.  You do feel like it is a home away from home.  There is delicious food all day in the Executive Lounge.  The room has quality toiletries as well as toothbrushes, shaving kit, sewing kit, iron and board etc.  Each day 2 bottles of water and a sweet treat.  The location is away from the craziness around Trafalgar and Piccadilly, yet very convenient.  2 minute walk to Victoria Station. Thank you to all the staff at Hotel 41 for providing a wonderful first time London experience.",5,2017,09,26
137,Stunning hotel & staff,"What a lovely treat in London - Hotel 41 - from the welcome at the door, drinks upon check in, attention to detail by the staff, beautifully appointed rooms, to the delicous ""help yourself"" food available at the bar, and scrumptious breakfast in the relaxed informal lounge. Outstanding all round - thanks Hotel 41!",5,2017,09,25
137,Shaun and Kelly,"The most impressive accommodation of our three country visit. Every detail of our stay was well attended. The service was impeccable and tailored perfectly. The room was beautiful, and the location of the property was perfect. Being in the business of delivering an exceptional customer experience, I learned a few things on how to understand the importance of exceeding expectations. We were truly spoiled at Hotel 41, and felt very welcomed. 

Thank you to the entire team at Hotel 41! ",5,2017,09,25
137,There is a reason why this Hotel is Number 1 on Trip Advisor!,"For location, service and just great attention to detail this hotel cannot be beaten. A big thanks to Malcolm and his team for making our stay here again so enjoyable.

If you are visiting London this hotel is opposite Buckingham Palace with Victoria station just 2 minutes walk away.

The staff are so helpfull, the rooms beautiful and the standards of cleanliness and quality of the bed linen are just awesome.

My advice is ""book it"" :)",5,2017,09,25
137,Whatever! Whenever!,"There is a phone button marked ""Whatever! Whenever!"" in the room: this best describes the experience we had. Top-notch service, excellent breakfast and the fantastic ""Conservartory Suite"" made this a high-class stay in London. All is very british, especially the Afternoon Tea (really, try it!). Fine room perfumes, king size bed, 24h service and a fantastic view through the glass roof. One of the best five hotels we have been so far!",5,2017,09,22
137,It's a Dogs Life,"If your looking for some last minute luxury with your dog Theodore can highly recommend 41, and we loved it too, we normally stay at the sister hotel in Kensington which is fabulous also, but we think we may have been swayed over to 41.
It's definitely a home from home experience with only 28 rooms, lovely homely lounge with food on tap all day, we really enjoyed our evening in with yummy salad jars, shepherds pie, cheese ice cream and a really great bottle of wine, all the staff are just perfect a special giggle on arrival I chose a glass of pink champagne and Theo opted for the Bottom Sniffer beer rather than the Pawsecco.
The room was beautifully clean, exceptionally well equipped and presented.",5,2017,09,21
137,Book this right now!!,"For our anniversary my husband surprised me with a trip to London. Although he booked the trip I booked the hotels so I finished the internet looking for the best hotels in London. We stayed at another 5 star hotel for the first few nights in soho and after a side trip came back to London to the 41. Although our first hotel was a true 5 star and quite immaculate, the 41 was in a league of its own! 

The service is what makes the hotel out of this world! When tired and starving I went to the hotel staff to see if someone could help me find a sushi place for dinner (it was already 8pm- during London fashion week) I had no less than 3 people calling around and booking us at several different restaurants so we could pick where we wanted to go! They got us into Nobu and we were off to have a great dinner! Upon return our bedroom was ready for us with rose petals and tea lights lit everywhere.. not to mention the sweetest note saying they hoped we had a great time at Nobu! 

The lounge was great and the staff were tremendous! 

The bed was also incredibly comfortable and I have no idea what size that bed is but it is certainly bigger than any king size I've slept in (including my own)!

Tiny thing to be aware of- our room looked right out At the royal mews - gorgeous but if you are a light sleeper some sirens at night may be a bother - that being said, my husband and I are both deep sleepers and this didn't bother us at all but if you are a light sleeper you may want a room not facing bunckingham palace road (or just call down and I'm sure someone would be there to provide you with ear plugs in a matter of seconds).

Special thanks to both Lauren and Andrew who I felt really went out of their way to make us feel welcomed.

There are sooooo many 5 star hotels in London but if you are lucky enough to score a night here I can't recommend it highly enough! ",5,2017,09,20
137,The best hotel,"The best hotel I have stayed on. Very clean and service is superior. The staff help you with anything you ask for and you can always go to the lounge and find something nice to eat. It's not just a hotel, it's an great experience. Whould highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2017,09,19
137,Fantastic weekend,"Me and my collegues (6 persons) had an amazing stay in this hotel from friday - sunday. The atmosphere is really friendly and nice, the people that work there are extremely serviceminded and I could not ask for any better treatment. The ""whatever whenever"" button on the phone says it all. :)  The bed was really good to sleep in, the best I have ever had. Even better than the one I have at home. :) And the drink and food was also a really nice experience. Thank you Hotel 41 for the best hotel-experience of my life. ",5,2017,09,19
137,Unbelievable comfort service location!!,"Loved 41!!! Happened upon it- we didn't know it was trip advisor #1. Everyone was very real and helpful- food great. Location perfect. The extras were extremely notable- sheets, bath products. I won't go anywhere else in London!
",5,2017,09,16
137,Top Notch,"After a long and exciting trip through mainland Europe, we were tired and wanted to spend a few days in London.  We needed some major pampering after traveling to multiple countries.  The 41 did NOT disappoint.  The staff was genuinely welcoming and helpful, the hotel room was comfortable and beautifully decorated, and the main salon was a great place to sit and refresh.  My husband and I plan look forward to staying at The 41 again when we visit London.  I loved this boutique hotel!",5,2017,09,15
137,The only place i will stay in London,Undoubtedly one of the best hotels in the world in terms of exclusivity and exquisite treatment to customers. The details that make the stay unforgettable are innumerable. For a London feeling this is the place!,5,2017,09,12
137,Always wonderful,"Hotel 41 is a home away from home, and we love staying here. Book as far in advance as possible as it is very popular. We worry about writing a review in case we can't get in next time we're in London - we certainly wouldn't stay anywhere else given a choice. Customer satisfaction is their top priority, and they always succeed.",5,2017,09,10
137,Our second stay - just as awesome as our first!,"otel 41

London

520468664

We stayed here about 3 years ago and loved it so much we gave friends a voucher as a birthday gift. When they couldn't use it, they returned the voucher to us and off we went back to Hotel 41. Staying here is a truly a classically enjoyable experience in what great service ought to be. A small hotel occupying one floor of a building, they have a handful of rooms and a large staff so they can offer really exceptional service. I felt as if there was no ""nickle and diming"" you - snacks and beverages are available all day in the Executive Lounge where you can enjoy a great buffet breakfast. At night, they offer turndown service and will tidy up the room again and provide fresh towels. They place bottled water each evening by the bed. We loved being able to get a snack or drink any time of day or evening as part of our package. Staff is very professional, helpful and wonderful. For example, the airline lost my bag and the Hotel 41 staff called the airline throughout the day. When I finally received word that the bag was in route to the hotel and due in at round 2:00 am, staff arranged for someone to drop it in my room so I would have it immediately in the morning. The concierge offered to send someone to shop for me if I needed help purchasing new toiletries, etc (luckily I did not need to take them up on that offer but it was a wonderful back up when I was feeling pretty awful not having any luggage!) My husband and I have been to London a number of times and were not planning on this recent trip but jumped at the opportunity to stay at Hotel 41 again. Best hotel we have stayed in around the world. Book a room here!",5,2017,09,09
137,Superb,"I've stayed in 5 star hotels around the world, and one question I ponder is, ""what makes a luxury hotel different?""

I think it could be how comfortable and welcome they make you feel as a guest. 

Here are some ways Hotel 41 does that:
1. Staff is waiting in the lobby to escort you to check in. You are offered a cold (or warm) drink, and taken care of immediately.
2. A personal note welcoming you is waiting in your charming room.
3. Among other things in the room: the remote control is in a baggie (they've sanitized it!), water waiting by the bed, a candle lit in the bathroom, heated towel racks--honestly, anything you could think of, it's there. And if it's not? They will get it for you. I needed a curling iron with a UK plug. I had it in less than 5 minutes.
4. The staff all know who you are. They greet you by name. The feeling that you aren't just a number. Or a price tag.
5. The absurdly comfy bed. I'm picky about this and the beds at this hotel are fantastic.

I'd absolutely stay here again. And I'm usually of the opinion that I like to try out different places, but why mess with a great system? Thanks Hotel 41!",5,2017,09,08
137,What's The Difference That Makes The Difference?,"Rather than wax lyrical about the superb furnishing of the hotel, the perfect location and the unparalleled quality of customer care and service, and rather than replicate the many fine words of praise set down by others, I thought I'd try to highlight what for me, makes staying at Hotel 41 so special.  

As with my stays at all other hotels, I plugged my phone into the charger overnight, and took it with me on my walks about town the following day.  On my return I found the lead had been neatly coiled, and a piece of Velcro helpfully attached to keep it that way.  (Please see photo).  I know it's only my opinion but for me, this is a perfect example of what the whole Hotel 41 experience is about - the efforts made by a team of people to anticipate my needs and satisfy them before I become aware of them.  Into this picture a thousand words can be read - team meetings in which housekeeping share ideas about striving to do a job better, and better and better, never being satisfied with the status quo.  I can't be sure but I can't imagine for a moment that management came up with this idea, they're simply giving employees the freedom to think and act in the customer's interests.  It's the difference that makes the difference.

When this example is replicated throughout, it serves only to bring us back to this fine establishment, again and again.",5,2017,09,07
137,Customer Service x 1000.,"As the hotel management intern from Portugal said, ""This hotel takes customer service to a new level. There is not better place I could learn."" From the moment we arrived, we felt like we were being waited on hand and foot. We needed a bathroom in which to change after arriving from an overnight flight...We were given a room! We then came back from a tour and could hardly stay awake after being up 24 hours 9( bad flight). It was not yet check-in time. They gave us a room in which to take a nap! Look at the photos and see what they offer, but you cannot see from words or photos what extraordinary customer service they provide. Other things we loved: We were within walking distance from Buckingham Palace-across from the Mews. Wonderful, safe location near lots of restaurants. Rooms: Not huge but had everything you need but didn't know it-even a towel warmer! Comfortable beds! The ""drawing room-type"" lobby is so cozy but also elegant enough to be found in a country estate. Wonderful food laid out and wonderful cocktails. When in London, we will never stay anywhere else.",5,2017,09,05
137,Bliss,"I happened to stumble upon this hotel by accident but am I glad I did! We have our annual '41' stay each year leading up to Christmas and I look forward to it all year. We have stayed in rooms and suites and can honestly say that it is top class. Nothing is too much trouble. Guests are treated like royalty and the staff go out if their way to make sure your stay is special. From the complimentary champagne on arrival to the little treats they leave in your room, so far we have had a birthday cake, basket of fruit, wine and a signed photo from the cast of wicked when we went to see it a couple if years ago. We love the executive lounge and the honesty bar and last time, we were sent home with a goodie bag for the train journey home! Please don't change anything, you are perfect! Looking forward to next time x",5,2017,09,03
137,Details are priority,This hotel goes above and beyond for all guests. The vibe of just checking in the hotel is a vintage royal English welcoming with a glass of Champagne and some chocolates waiting in your room. I was impressed by the towel warming racks in the restroom. They basically do everything they can to make you feel at home. I stayed in a Executive King room which was perfect for 2 people. If you have a lot of luggage you might have to think about upgrading. We had room service on both nights we stayed because most pubs in the area closed at 11. Thank you to the staff  that went above and beyond while we stayed there.,5,2017,08,31
137,Perfect experience!,"My daughter and I vacationed here for several days.  The hotel is gorgeous, but what made it an exceptional experience was the efficiency, kindness and friendliness of the staff!  The afternoon tea is not to be missed.  The presentation was lovely and the treats delicious.  In addition, their ""plunder the pantry"" is a generous and thoughtful way to welcome travelers weary from a long journey.  The little extras such as the turndown service in the evening also made for a perfect vacation.  Very memorable!",5,2017,08,30
137,exceptionalpersonalized service,"The warm and friendly  staff delivered exceptional service, They realized my daughter was entering university shortly and provided her a surprise congratulatory decorated cake!  Small details were all looked after and their timing for fulfilling any request was outstanding. They were engaging without any feeling of being overbearing.",5,2017,08,29
137,A Wonderful Oasis,"My wife and I stayed here for our 30th wedding anniversary and were extremely impressed. From the moment we arrived, we felt genuinely welcome. And of course, it is the staff that make or break a hotel, and they were all excellent. The pink champagne on arrival, the special cake in our room, were lovely touches.
The Executive Lounge, which is in the style of a Gentleman's Club, was a great place to relax, and to have breakfast. It truly is an oasis of calm in Central London.
Number 1 for a reason, and thoroughly recommended.",5,2017,08,29
137,We Have a New Family at Hotel 41,"My husband and I just spent 9 days in London and had the best time of our life.  Hotel 41 was perfect.  The location, the service, the food, the drinks and most of all the friendships that were made with all the staff.  When we left, we felt like we were leaving family.  Before we came to London we had never been treated like royalty, but we now have.  Next time we go to Europe, we will spend a few days or more at Hotel 41.",5,2017,08,28
137,Lovely place,We wanted to stay some where that was elegant .We found it. Lovely people .they will go out of there way to help you. A place like home. Easy access and parking. A lot to see from here too. Will come here again if we can afford it.,5,2017,08,25
137,Stay like Royalty,"We started our week long trip to London in a flat.  We wanted to stay in London like we were living there, but why stay like a commoner when you can live like royalty at Hotel 41.  Looking over the Royal Mews while staying at one of the most exclusive addresses in London.  The staff was excellent and every person was engaging and willing to help.  It is really a notch above other hotels we have stayed at.  The Executive Lounge makes the stay perfect as it is always ready to get you anything you may need.",5,2017,08,24
137,It is not a hotel ...... but home,"My wife and I travelled from Hong Kong to London on vacation. We stayed in this hotel just for the 17th to 18th August. 

Here is not much to say and of course no need to say much but:

'It is not a hotel but a home for every traveller'!!

Thanks to the front desk (both day and night shifts), social manager, all servers, house keeping team and everybody there. We support its environmentally-friendly practices as well.
The only thing to remind is we have not pay attention is there something like a 'door-bell' or phone at the front door because if someone whose room card does not function, he or she may have difficult to get back into the hotel in the night. 

We probably will not be in London in the near future. If we visit London again, Hotel 41 is our first choice. If the staff there can still recognize us, then this hotel we believe it is really our home in London!!",5,2017,08,24
137,Best Hotel Stay Ever!!,"I can not begin to say how much I enjoyed my stay at the Hotel 41 in July 2017!  This was by far the best hotel I have ever stayed at in the world!  The experience begins at the front door, continues at check-in and the executive lounge, with it all coming together in the Junior Suite.  I cannot compliment enough the entire staff who bent over backwards to take care of me.  Thank you very much!!",5,2017,08,22
137,The best!!!,"A long overdue review but I had to share that this is the best home away from home in London! My 14 year old daughter and I stayed for a week last October and had such a great time. The hotel is located just next to Buckingham Palace and is an easy walk to lots of sites. You can see into the ""mews"" from the hotel windows and it's a few minute walk if you tour Buckingham Palace. The tea and daily breakfast are delicious and the nightly treats make the evening a fun adventure. The hotel helped us with dinners and transportation as well, and when they found out we were going to see the Harry Potter play they left special witch hat cupcakes for us in our room. Just one of the many special things about staying at Hotel 41. Thank you to everyone there! ",5,2017,08,22
137,Excellence with warmth,"This hotel has set a new bar for me when traveling. The decor is lovely, the food is great, the beds are wonderful, the baths are outstanding - but the staff. The staff is the very best part. Steve Jones in particular went so far above making my teenage son welcome and delighted, it made his trip. No effort was too small, they were always polite, helpful, and kind. This hotel has the kind of polish of the very best service without ever feeling stuffy, and is right across from the palace. Tea time is one of the many delights I highly recommend - the open pantry is stellar. I cannot wait to plan my next stay here.",5,2017,08,20
137,"Awesome hotel, great staff, perfect location",Location puts you in perfect walking distance to all the sights.  The hotel is a boutique that had the best staff of the four different hotels we stayed at in the U.K.  reception area serves as a hub for anything you need.  Rooms were very nice and ultra clean.  Will be back for business trips for sure.,5,2017,08,20
137,The best hotel in the world,"We love Hotel 41 so much. We have stayed there for 13 nights and it was amazing. We were treated on arrival with a lovely glass of champagne which was the best way to start our holidays. Adele and Magdalena were very friendly during the check in process and accomodate all our needs. They also shown us few rooms to choose from to make sure we could  pick our favorite. All the breakfast team are very friendly. Special mention to Alex, Jerry, Marta, Dean and Stefan. The breakfast offering is incredible. Fresh pastries, Smoked fish, cured meat and a large a la carte menu to choose from. The front desk are so helpfull arranging all our needs, Florent, Lauren, Mitchell, Nicole, Victoria, Moreno were all wonderful and have made our stay so special and perfect.  The room was fantastic. Very large. The housekeeping team has done an incredible job making sure our room was spotless every day. The turndown service is also the best we have ever seen. Music, candles, treats and so on. Everything was perfect. Every nights, we enjoyed the plunder the pantry and all the snacks on offer. Daniel and Marcelo were superb and made everything they could for us. Hotel 41 is for sure the place to stay when in London if  you want to be treated like royalty. We cannot wait to come back for another amazing stay. The team of 41 should definitely train other hotel in the world.",5,2017,08,19
137,My new favorite hotel,"We have stayed at hotels all over the world.  We prefer somewhat quirky boutique hotels and 41 Hotel fits that description perfectly.  The location is marvelous (just across the street from Buckingham Palace).  Our ""Junior Suite"" had a sitting room with fireplace and a flight of stairs up to a space with a desk and a good size bedroom and bathroom.  The furnishings and decor were lovely.  The room was immaculate.  Most important, the staff is absolutely wonderful.  We were known by name within minutes of our arrival.  There is food available in a large common room 24 hours a day.  Late buffet dinners there (included in the tariff) were delicious and perfect for jet lagged travelers (us) who returned late from theatre on several nights.  The entire staff went out of their ways to accommodate us.  A simple example: we had made a large order at Fortnum and Mason earlier in the day to be shipped home.  We realized that we should have added a jar of lemon curd.  When we mentioned this to the concierges, they took it upon themselves to call the store, get through to customer service, and get the item added.  We will certainly return to 41 Hotel any time that we are in London and would recommend it unequivocally to anyone else!",5,2017,08,16
137,Impeccable Boutique Hotel in the Heart of London,"My wife and I celebrated our 10th anniversary in London. We chose Hotel 41 based on the many fantastic reviews on Trip Advisor. We were treated to impeccable service by all the staff from the moment we arrived to our departure. The staff is courteous, helpful, friendly, with a mixture of flair and British reserve. Our room was perfect, with a very comfortable bed, plenty of drawer and closet space. The bathroom had a bathtub/shower combination as well as a separate shower. Excellent water pressure and plenty of hot water for a long shower after a day of sightseeing. There is a lovely main sitting room which also doubles as a breakfast area, afternoon tea, dinner and late snack. The wait staff is attentive and caters to your requests. The hotel is perfectly situated with Buckingham Palace a five minute walk, Westminster Abby/Parliament a 10 min walk and the Victoria Tube station 5 minute walk. Hotel 41 is a luxurious boutique hotel where staff and management take pride in providing a first class experience.",5,2017,08,16
137,A secret hideaway right in the middle of bustling London…,"...that also happens to be the #1 hotel in the entire city (out of thousands of options).  We just returned from our third stay at Hotel 41 and were more impressed than ever.  While they’ve been #1 for years, it seems that they are actually getting better each stay.  They have somehow perfected the art of making a hotel feel like your home - that is, if your home is extremely posh and manned by the most helpful and friendly staff to be found.

The service is unmatched and well deserving of the five-star rating.  Perhaps most importantly, this is all delivered without any trace of pretension.  This is a place you can feel truly comfortable on your vacation.  We were only in town for two nights and had a lot packed into our schedule.  The staff arranged two cars, loaned us a temp room for a quick shower upon our early arrival, delivered our match tickets to us and even surprised us with a candle lit rose turn down service.  You get the impression that there is always someone waiting to deliver a coffee or glass of rose champagne at the exact moment you realize you want one.  

Hotel 41 is located right across from Buckingham Palace and within walking distance of almost anything you want to see or do – a short walk through my favorite park (St. James) will get you to Downing Street, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, the Thames, the London Eye and most of the “must” see locations.  For anything further away, Victoria Station is only a 3 minute walk.

Finally, the property itself is unique and luxurious, with the entire hotel located on just one floor.  We never manage to spend enough time enjoying all it has to offer, but may try to squeeze in an extra day next trip just to spend time in the lounge.  The lounge offers warm breakfast, endless snacks, ice cream, drinks and a giant tub of fine champagnes on ice.  At night the lounge is candle lit and perfect for a night cap, a relaxing conversation or simply time with a good book.

There is no place else we will stay in London.  Thank you Hotel 41 for another amazing vacation!

-Jennifer",5,2017,08,15
137,Dropped in for tea,"Actually just dropped in for tea here as a bit out of my budget, but couldn't resist and pushed the holiday budget to be able to stay one night! It was perfect, and don't regret going there for a second. highly recommend",5,2017,08,15
137,Pure luxury!- All that we had dreamed of and more! 💗,"We celebrated our 20th anniversary with our first trip to the UK in May. Hotel 41 was our home base for a weeklong packed trip which included long day excursion trips in England and Wales, every single day. This resulted in us not seeing much of London as planned our first day, due to a delayed flight. When staff learned that we were unable to see much in London, they presented us with a lovely book about London which was very sweet! The pampering we received when we returned every evening was so nice!  The bedding is extremely comfortable which was very important to me. The room was appointed beautifully, and treats were always left for us upon our return. The delicious after 7 ""plunder the pantry"" was a lifesaver for us as we were too exhausted for anything else. Anything you need, they were so helpful with. The location is very good and convenient to Victoria Station. I hope that we have the opportunity to stay here again! I can't imagine staying anywhere else now! Thank you Hotel 41 for the beautiful memories!",5,2017,08,15
137,The BEST of the BEST!,"We chose  Hotel 41 for our stay in London based on all of the wonderful reviews.  This hotel was absolutely over the top with the most outstanding service we have ever received.  From the wonderful Check-In reception to the consummate host of the dining room, we were made to feel so at home and extra special.
The public rooms of the dining and bar area are so inviting and our observatory guest room was such a great surprise. 
Thank you to the management and each outstanding employee for making this hotel so outstanding and our stay so exceptional. 
We will definitely be using Hotel 41 when our travels take us to London!!!!!!

137,Brilliant hotel - staff excellent,"So we took a punt, our usual and regular hotel in the vicinity had no rooms so we had to find another.

When you arrive don't miss the entrance between Bbar and the Rubens Hotel, but if you do err, then the staff at the Rubens will redirect you.

Once inside you are presented with a well appointed wood panelled corridor and a concierge desk.  The concierge will call up to get you escorted to the 5th floor, you will be treated by a polite and knowledgeable member of staff who tells you ""all the magic happens on the 5th floor"", and it really does.  

it is all a little mysterious on first encounter, but all will become familiar quickly

You are escorted to the lounge which is also home to reception, where you are offered complementary champagne from a range of four on offer.

The staff are chatty, knowledgeable and friendly, yet they are not overbearing or in your face all the time.  The hospitality is subtle and efficient.  The team we met made every effort to remember our names and greeted us by name whenever we went through the lounge.

The décor in the lounge is wood panelled and olde world, quintessentially English, yet is isn't dated, it is comfortable. 

The rooms all appear to lead off from corridors, ours was an executive, a tad small in comparison to similar priced rooms elsewhere, it was a bit of squeeze for the more well built of us to get around the bed to them other side of the room (room 4123), the bathroom again was a tad small, but in all it was more than adequate.

In the lounge  is the honesty bar with a very good range of spirits  There are snacks supplied all day, and a buffet to plunder late in the evening - which would have been perfect had we not gorged ourselves at dinner.  Again the staff are on hand to help with your choice of drink.

and don't forget the ice cream

We didn't have breakfast as we had to be somewhere and we were still full from the night before.

This is a delightful and quirky hotel, the staff make it what it is and all credit to them.  Yes it is a bit pricey, but all told for what you get represents reasonable value.  The lounge is ever so relaxed, and chilled.  We will definitely be back, next time we need a hotel in this vicinity.",5,2017,08,14
137,Hotel 41,"Hotel name is very nice 41 and my lucky number was there so like name and aslonthey provide better service than most other hotel there so I like prefer to say please go there and yourself, and they give 5 rating out of 5..",5,2017,08,14
137,Outstanding! Possibly the best place I have ever stayed. Easily top 2.,"The service here is already well documented (and deservedly so because it is out of this world) so I'll just get right to the second best highlight of our stay. We almost didn't book the 41 because of what looks to be missing. No bar, no restaurant, no meeting space. Luckily we let the location (across from the Royal Mews) and the reviews override our initial thoughts and booked anyway. There is NOTHING missing here. The lounge at the center of the hotel is a chameleon or transformer of a room that turns into whatever you need when you need it. Great bar, tea room, breakfast area, lunch/snacks, place to meet, whatever you want it to be it is. I know I said I wasn't going to rehash the service but....THE SERVICE!!!! Just incredible. So welcoming, so accommodating, so friendly. It really felt like being at home, if your home was a classic mansion with everything you could want at your fingertips. Steve in the lounge is a wealth of information and one of the nicest people we met on your trip. Another stand out was Steve's opposite number in the morning. I cant for the life of me remember his name but he was awesome at breakfast. In fact everyone from check in to check out was just great. This place is a true gem. A wonderful find and I look forward to staying there again.",5,2017,08,14

137,Best staff on the planet!,"How many hotels can you say honestly get to know you personally.  This hotel has simply the best service bar none.  The staff looks to take care of absolutely anything you need at anytime of day, without making you feel uncomfortable or stuffy in any way.  Perfect staff for a perfect hotel!

137,Back again ,What can i say about this hotel every time I come to London I have to stay in this hotel it's very clean and the service is the best I strongly recommend this hotel to everyone thanks for everything guys ,5,2017,08,04
137,New Favorite Hotel - EVER!,"We were upgraded to this hotel from the Rubens at the Palace and simply LOVED every minute.  We stayed for 3 nights, but would have been happy with more!  Perfect location directly across from Buckingham Palace.  This was a retirement gift for my husband and everything was perfect - no complaints only compliments!  The staff (to include Florent, Stefan, Victoria, Mitchell, Paula and all others) made this a truly memorable stay.  Incredibly attentive and courteous to every guest and every request.  I am a travel agent and will be sending my clients here!",5,2017,08,02
137,I love everything about this hotel,"I have been meaning to write this review since January 2016. The date drop down doesn't allow me to go that far back so Ive put Sept 2016 as thats as far back as I can go.
My husband and I have been here twice now and there is nowhere else we'd rather stay when in London. 
The staff are just wonderful, so polite and attentive without being overly so.
The rooms are luxurious and spacious and both times we have been they have upgraded us for no extra charge.
The second time we visited (January 2016) my husband had planned a surprise trip to New York. I was under the impression we were having a two night stay at Hotel 41 but he had arranged for just the one night but had been in contact with the hotel to make sure the kept up pretences that we were actually there for two nights. They also managed to pack our entire room up whilst we went for breakfast and put our bags in a waiting taxi to take us to the airport where my husband then revealed the surprise.
They could not have been more accomodating and I hope to be back soon as I truly adore this place.",5,2017,08,01
137,#1 for a reason,"The hotel is amazing and goes above and beyond any request you can imagine. It's beautiful, in a great location, and the staff sincerely wants to make your stay amazing. We stayed for 1 night for my birthday, and it was the most luxurious hotel I've ever stayed in. Be prepared for being treated like a celebrity.",5,2017,07,31
137,Hotel 41 Extraordinary,"When we read that Hotel 41 was voted the best hotel in London, it filled us with a mix of excitement and a bit of dread that it could not match the hype. Well, it does and goes beyond. From the choice of 4 champagnes when we arrived to the the solicitous attention to our needs and requests, Hotel 41 is unmatched. The staff is especially attentive and they seemed to genuinely care about us and our experiences. The ""plunder the pantry"" is truly a wonderful way to end a day sightseeing in London. I have already recommended the Hotel 41 to a few of my colleagues and friends.",5,2017,07,31
137,Two visits a week apart,"My husband, son and I had two fabulous experiences this month at Hotel 41.  We stayed three nights before heading to other destinations and then returned for another three nights before flying home.  The staff went way above and beyond any hotel we have ever stayed.  Our room (both times) was a 2-level suite which was perfect for our small family. The sofa-bed on the first level accommodated our son while we enjoyed a king-size bed on the second level.   We really enjoyed the lounge and the hotel location!  We highly recommend Hotel 41!",5,2017,07,29
137,#1 for a Reason,"We had the good fortune to stay at the 41 for 4 days last month. Our visit was nothing short of spectacular. The hotel feels like a luxury private residence with impeccable service and over the top service. A shout out to Magdalene,Andrew,Steve(a history buff like me) and Lauren(for the amazing upgrade on our last night). Its been almost  3 weeks since we've been home and we're still talking about the service details that separate the 41 from any previous hotel. 5 stars is in insult to this property...we are already making plans to come back. Bravo 41!!!",5,2017,07,29
137,'Mini-moon' - one night stay,"We stayed for one night just after we got married to have a little 'us' time as we had a large amount of guests from abroad staying in London for our wedding. The level of service is exceptional and the room decor and quality is true luxury. The free food at supper time is amazing and free champagne on arrival oh and the free ice-cream! - everything is just fantastic - We loved it - and just what we needed after a hectic wedding schedule. Was tempted to book another night but we had family obligations the next day that we couldn't get out of. I guess the only slight limitation is that there is only one communal area - the 'lounge' where you eat breakfast and which is fantastic but there are no views out of the windows in the bedrooms or the lounge so you do feel a little enclosed - but to be honest that's what we went for so it suited us well. I would definitely book again and recommend this hotel, especially if you are visiting London but you prefer a small, personal and quiet hotel.",5,2017,07,29
137,Excellent location,"This is our second stay at the Hotel 41 and everytime, it is perfect.The design is classical and the whole building is perfctly renovated. 
We really appreciated the welcome of the staff (florent). Our room was beautiful and very confortable.",5,2017,07,29
137,Simply Top Notcg,"A true luxury hotel in every sense of the word. Outstanding facilities and the entire team could not have done more for us. 

The location is central to all things London. And returning after a day on the town to the Hotel 41 Lounge is a marvelous way to conclude the evening. 

The staff members we encountered went out of their way to insure everything we desired was provided and they were genuinely nice people. 

I won't stay anywhere else in London after experiencing 41! ",5,2017,07,28
137,Our third visit ... Flawless!,"It was an absolute pleasure to return to this coveted gem. No need to go into the details because other guests have covered all the details. 

My husband and I really appreciated being able to freshen up after the long flight by having access to a special room reserved for early arrivals. 

Even though I tried 3 weeks prior to our stay, I was unsuccessful in obtaining SkyGarden tickets due to it being the busy summer season. I had communicated my disappointment via email to Hotel 41 stating how difficult it is to obtain these passes - I even tried as soon as they opened up the reservation window. It was a complete surprise to have found out upon our arrival that reservations were made for afternoon lunch at Darwin Brasserie at SkyGarden. Hotel 41 kindly provided a credit on our bill and apologized for not being able to secure tickets for us either. What? Where am I? Where else on earth does this happen except at Hotel 41. It was totally unnecessary however such a gracious token of fine hotel stewardship was greatly appreciated. 

Thank you to *all* the staff for making yet another visit even more special than the last. If I have left out a name, I apologize in advance -- *everyone* deserves a special thank you for the unrivaled service and hospitality that we have not yet found elsewhere. 

Steve and Stephen ... thank you for the unforgettable Bloom gin & tonics ... Ivo, Andrew, Victoria, Nicole, Victoria, Daniel and the lovely housekeeping staff all work round the clock to ensure each guest receives 10 star service. 

Oh, I almost forgot ... my husband still raves about the fabulous water pressure from the rainshower we had in our bathroom and I've been waking up here at home wondering when the pot of French press coffee and toast are going to arrive. ;)",5,2017,07,26
137,I love this hotel!,"Everything about this hotel is superior.  The hotel is located right next to Buckingham Palace, and our room was lovely, quiet, and comfortable.  The staff is amazing!  Every member of the staff that we came into contact with was friendly, helpful, and welcoming.  I appreciate being allowed to check in several hours early after our overnight flight from the US.",5,2017,07,26
137,Simply Amazing,"My family and I stayed here for 9 days. As you step through the doors you are greeted by the gorgeous interior and amazing staff. You'll be ushered up to the 5th floor to the Executive Lounge where you will enjoy a glass of champaign of your choosing and hors d'Oeuvres. The staff is at your beck and call the entire stay and strive to treat each guest like royaltiy. Even the children! 

Once you have recieved your royal welcome, you will be lead to your room. What a room it is! We had two, each just as gorgeous as the next. Each night you will enjoy turn down services and special treats left by housekeeping such as a variety of snacks, bottled water both sparkling and flat, lip balms, relaxing pillow sprays and more. 

Our children, 16 and 13 years old, loved the Executive Lounge pantry. It offered an ice cream bar and snacks they could grab at all hours. My husband I loved the selection of cheeses, cold cuts, pies, and other goodies offered all day. The Executive Lounge is a perfect place for a night cap or coffee as well. 

Staying at this hotel really made our trip special. I'm so happy we chose it and when we return to London this is defiently where we will stay! I can't thank the staff enough.",5,2017,07,25
137,"Best Service Ever ,  Anywhere","A different Hotel  than most fine luxury hotels  .  Everything you might expect from a top rated hotel , with one major  exception , the service was better than any hotel I have ever stayed in .  No matter what you asked for , it was done in a gracious , and experienced manner . I would suggest that you stay in a suite with the separate sitting room . You will not believe this hotel , and it has a wonderful location , being next to Buckingham Palace . The Royal Mews are across  the street , and it is worth the visit .",5,2017,07,24
137,"""Secret"" hotel with wow factor service","You aren't supposed to reveal secrets, but this one is hard to keep. Enter the lobby and take the lift up to the lounge, you will be transported to an environment stripped of the London hustle and bustle. As you enter you are offered a beverage while your rooms in being arranged and once you sit down with your drink any stress from traveling or running around London just seems to drift away in the timeless turn of the century London interior. The rooms are what you expect from a high end boutique hotel. Great beds, luxury linens and toiletries - it's all there. What makes it stand out from the rest is the staff who outdo themselves at every chance they get, 24 hours a day, with everything from skilled bartenders to creative chefs. Best of all is the lounge staff who will sort you out whatever your need might be. There is also a buffet with food or sweets depending on the time of day. The lounge is also an excellent place to sort out some business if need be with reliable and fast wifi as well as a separate area for those who need a bit of space. Highly recommended for all travelers who value quality and service.",5,2017,07,21
137,"Great boutique hotel, intimate may be a bit too intimate.","I booked this hotel because of the ratings & rave reviews from the guests. I booked it despite that there weren't bigger rooms available. We booked into the Executive King suite and it was really very small. We hardly had any room to put anything away and we were spilling out of the room by the end of our stay. The bathroom especially is very tiny and had very limited room to put your toiletries in between two people. I had to leave all my stuff on the desk which cluttered that space and made it messy. The plumbing is also quite old and the water faucet that controls temperature was broken and fiddly. The water didn't drain well which is a pet peeve of mine.
 It was a mistake booking here in a standard room & a bad judgment call on my part as in general we do tend to value space & spend on it. 
Don't get me wrong, the hotel is very nice. The service is very attentive, not that we took much of an advantage of it since we'd prebooked most things before the trip. 
The breakfast there is a thing worth writing about on its own! I especially loved their full breakfast (which I could only manage half of it and just once!) and the plenty of salmon they had out on the cold platter. The breakfast area is beautiful though space is an obvious rare commodity. The snacks they bring out throughout the day & with your evening drinks are a nice touch. All the staff was very friendly and helpful. 
If small friendly hotel with friendly staff and personal service is important to you, this is a great pick. If you do like space and fair amount of food & facilities option, this probably won't do it for you.",4,2017,07,20
137,Cannot wait to visit again,"This was my third stay at Hotel 41 and yet again it did not disappoint on any level. When planning my trip to the UK I knew Hotel 41 would the only place to stay while in London. The service is impeccable but not stuffy and nothing is too much trouble. I love the lounge where one can linger over a pot of tea or a glass of wine and feel as if you were in a private home. Breakfast is served there and it is cosy and unhurried. The staff are friendly and attentive and always have a smile.
Love the cosy rooms with every small detail thought of - lots of fluffy towels, a great shower, comfortable bed and floating votive candles in the bathroom with the turndown service to name a few.
I cannot wait for my next stay!!!!",5,2017,07,18
137,My Favorite Hotel,"My only wish, after staying here on 4 separate occasions, is that they had a Hotel 41 in every city.  It truly is a wonderful hotel with incredible customer service that every hotel should try and attain.  Each year it's great to see familiar faces and also meet new staff.  The rooms are always immaculate and perfectly decorated.  The shower, as some have noted, are perfect pressure.  The sweets and treats and dinner snacks in the Library are always such a wonderful touch.  The service with breakfast and drinks is spot on.  I wish I could provide some constructive feedback but I simply can't.  My entire family loves visiting Hotel 41 and make it a must on any trip to London.  
Thank you so much for another wonderful, memorable stay.",5,2017,07,18
137,Simply Outstanding - AGAIN,"If you haven't tried this little Haven of Paradise yet - I would definitely advise it. It's cozy and comfortable, intimate and private. We really truly counldn't ask or wish for anything more. It's completely relaxing and, whether you stay for 1 night or 7, you feel totally relaxed and refreshed.
  It's the wonderful staff that makes the difference for us, they are kind, caring, totally professional, discrete and always go above and beyond the call of duty. They're just amazing, Lauren and Stefan are incredible.
  The rooms are comfortable and very tastefully decorated, very clean and supplied with high quality accessories. We now wouldn't consider staying anywhere else and can't recommend Hotel 41 highly enough.
  We stayed for a special celebration and we can honestly say that this trip will be remembered for all time.",5,2017,07,17
137,The best service!,"Hotel 41 is amazing. The level of service was unlike any other five star hotel I've stayed. It's small and intimate so the staff really get to know their guests. They didn't even ask for my name when we showed up for breakfast because they automatically knew. On the first day I asked for softer bread for my young son (instead of sliced sourdough rolls) and I didn't have to remind them on the following days. They just remembered.  Because it's a smaller property, the atmosphere is quite charming, warm and cozy. The Executive Lounge has complimentary snacks/appetizers 24/7.  It was so great to go there after a long day of sightseeing. We would order a drink and graze on the delicious food. As for the room, the beds were very comfortable. The bedding was top notch.  I highly recommend Hotel 41. You won't regret it.",5,2017,07,14
137,A truly excellent experience ,"I cannot recommend Hotel 41 more highly. It excels at the usual stuff: comfy beds, quiet halls, clean rooms, spacious bathrooms, proximity to the sites and quintessential British decor. Where Hotel 41 excels is in its attention to the guest which I must say is without compare. By the time I left several different staff members had undertaken a coordinated effort to ensure that my departure was smooth and that I had plans for the next stage of my journey. Their executive lounge is akin to a club room as a country club in that it has delicious snacks at all hours and the guests hang about making conversation and meeting one another. Most importantly to the experience is a man named Steve Jones whose role includes: hanging out in the executive lounge, being impeccably dressed, entertaining you with polite conversation and dispensing valuable tidbits about London culture and travel further afield. Your missing the experience if you don't spend some time with Steve.",5,2017,07,13
137,Beyond Amazing. Staff is truly next level.,"There are 5 star hotels (and I've stayed at dozens) and then there is Hotel 41 which stands a level above, primarily due to the incredible staff and attention to detail.  I stayed in an Executive Room with my eldest daughter who is 7 (she would most certainly say 7 1/2) for six nights and the experience was phenomenal.  Each morning a member of the staff would help my daughter with her hair, another staff member ran out to get Gatorade at 10pm just because I inquired about where I could go buy some, yet another offered me his old backpack he wasn't using any more for my trip home and gave my daughter beautiful jewelry pins that she loved, and another still got her a tiara to wear when we went to see the show Wicked.

But more important than all these things given to us was the real gift, which was spending time with the hotel staff.  Each member of the staff was kind, helpful, intelligent, warm, empathetic, and just overall great human beings.  What a well run establishment to be so selective and spot on when locating talented and capable people like these!

Location and Security are truly ideal at this hotel.  The rooms are elegant and perfectly maintained. There are so many small touches, way too many to list. The bed was amazingly comfortable. I really have no suggestions for improvement, which is quite rare.

With hotels like this, a six star rating might be needed moving forward. I can't imagine a better hotel anywhere in the world. Staying here is a privilege and sets my expectations almost unreasonably high moving forward. This is just something you'll have to experience for yourself. The whatever whenever button on the telephone in each room sums up the experience. Truly a cut above all others!",5,2017,07,13
137,Magic.,"Simply a magical experience, once again. (Our second stay at Hotel 41 over the past 3 years). We have stayed at many fine hotels, and although great service is expected and often delivered from them all, none of them achieve the level of intimacy and hospitality like Hotel 41. Just a few examples:
Greeting your kids by their names, as if they all knew you for years.
Getting tickets to theater when already sold out.
Getting tickets to a museum exhibit when already sold out (and complimentary to boot).
Baking a chocolate fudge cake just for your kids, the following day from when they asked for a piece of chocolate cake, (that wasn't even on the menu). 

They just do not accept not being able to provide you what you ask. I have never experienced such dedication to service. 

Truly a unique place thanks to the people that are there.",5,2017,07,12
137,Never felt like this before,"I don't even know how to express my sheer delight that I experienced from my stay at this haven in London. From the very beginning to the end the staff, service and general environment was exhilarating. I have never felt so comfortable nor content at any other hotel that I was a guest. Let me just say that this is 5 star to the max. Thank you everyone for your sincere indulgence of this very captivated American.",5,2017,07,11
137,repeat visit,Excellent hotel with best service you can find.   Great location.   Would gladly recommend to all.  Stayed with our 2 teenagers who loved it.   Lounge is like a private club with free food and staff that is first class,5,2017,07,11

137,As wonderful as we remembered,"This was our second visit to Hotel 41, two years after our original visit. Hotel 41 was as wonderful as we remembered. Their service and attention to detail is unparalleled.

We arrived about 11:00 AM after our overnight flight from the U.S. via driver arranged by the hotel. The staff welcomed us with the traditional welcome champagne and quickly checked us in. We were pleasantly surprised that our room – upgraded to a junior suite – was ready in less than fifteen minutes. 

Our room contained a lovely fruit plate to welcome us. Alas, the temptations of the Executive Lounge, with its morning breakfast and the evening “plunder the pantry”, made it difficult for us to fully consume the generous contents, which were updated daily.

At our request, the staff had recommended and secured dinner reservations at a two Michelin star restaurant. As would be expected at a five-star hotel, the staff reminded us of the reservation and provided guidance on when we should get a taxi for the restaurant. 

Each night we received turn down service with associated chocolate, pillow spray (something I did not even know existed), lip balm, or other small but useful items presented in a “his” and “hers” bag. On the first night, turn down service included multiple lit candles and rose petals, reminiscent of our romantic turn down I had requested on our previous visit for our 30th wedding anniversary – a lovely touch helping recreate our previous experience.

Each departure was met with an offer for a taxi or water to take with. Each arrival was met with a greeting by name.

We were fortunate that our stay overlapped the Stefan, whom we remembered from our previous visit. He is clearly suited to the service industry since he is able to converse intelligently but politely on just about any topic.

If you are looking for a large hotel where you can be an anonymous resident, checking in on your cell phone without any personal contact, this is not the place for you. On the other hand, if you are looking for a place that cares about catering to your needs, remembers your preferences, and provides personal service, you will easily understand why this hotel is the number one rated hotel in London on TripAdvisor.

It took us two years from the first visit to return, but I suspect that our next visit will not take so long.",5,2017,07,06
137,Brilliant hotel,"We love this hotel! It is just like a club, revolving around the executive lounge. We stayed here for 3 nights and were very sad to leave. The staff members were absolutely brilliant. We had many great chats with the staff members in the lounge that made us feel so at home. Our room was extremely comfortable, although we could not get the separate shower to work, so we used the shower over the bath instead. The location near Buckingham Palace and St James's Park was superb. The food in the lounge was very good and plentiful. I loved the 'plunder the pantry' in the late evening and also the many snacks which came with our drinks.

We are returning to London for 2 nights in September, but sadly, will not be staying at 41 as it is booked out for our dates, proof of what a great hotel it is. Considering that we booked almost a year ahead for our stay in late May, next time we will book early again!",5,2017,07,05
137,They make magic happen...,"Just back from our second visit to this remarkable, glorious hotel.  Calling it a hotel doesn't seem right.  It's more a private club, a home from home where, just like at Hogwarts, magical creatures (called the staff) work away to meet your every need and wish, usually before you were even aware of that need.  Amazing. From checking in sipping a choice of four champagnes, to the beautifully appointed rooms (those beds are soooo comfy), to the perfection that is the Executive Lounge, to the wee surprises awaiting your return after an evening in the second best city in the world (I'm a Londoner by birth and upbringing, but now live in the best of all cities, Edinburgh 😊).  The purpose of our visit was to attend the third of Adele's concerts at Wembley. Waking up on Saturday morning to the news of the cancellation was - to put it mildly - disappointing.  The staff expressed genuine commiserations. Then I set them an impossible challenge,  a challenge worthy of the Triwizard Tournament itself: get us tickets for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. I have tried to get tickets every ballot when they release them, don't even get close to securing the tickets. But I was staying at a hotel where magic, literally, happens. I kid you not, by the time breakfast was over, they'd got us tickets for that days shows, parts one and two.  I am (have you guessed) a huge Potterhead, so this was better for me then seeing Adele, it was all my Christmases come at once.   (The show is amazing - go if you possibly can). Then, after a lovely walk - well, floating on happiness- back to the haven at that is Hotel 41, we enter our room. What was playing in the Bose stereo? Adele's ""25"" cd...and on the table, Harry Potter cupcakes and a note from Adele the Hotel 41 wonderwoman, saying she thought we might enjoy a bit of Adele, the singer, when we got in.  Brilliant,  amazing.  On Sunday, having met my brother and family we returned to the sanctuary and spent a relaxing evening in the lounge, with lovely Daniel recommending delicious gins and plundering the pantry. Fantastic. Then one more surprise, having spoken with Andrew Sunday night, we reminisced how he got us the only Scotsman newspaper in London last time we stayed. Guess what paper was ready for us this morning?  Yep. He'd done it again. The staff did all this for us, went over and above, not because we're special (we're not) but because it's what they do.  And even better, they delight in, and take great personal pleasure from, delivering this highly personal and exquisite service to every single guest.  One word to sum up this Hotel?  Magical. 
Thank you all so, so much.  

",5,2017,07,03
137,They treat you like Royalty!,"My wife and I stayed at Hotel 41 for my 65th birthday.  They treat you like Royalty!  The service is outstanding and they even had a birthday cake and a card in my room upon arrival! The food in the Executive Lounge is outstanding....and it is available for breakfast, lunch, tea, dinner and after-dinner heavy snacks.  The service in the Executive room is impeccable.  The location of the hotel was perfect for us as we could easily walk to the Royal Mews, Buckingham Palace, and even Big Ben, Parliament, Westminster Abbey, and the Churchill War rooms.  The rooms had every amenity and were very clean and well serviced.  Everything about the hotel was luxury.",5,2017,07,02
137,Perfect!,"Lost count of the number of times we have stayed at 41 over the last 5 years and we keep coming back because it's the best hotel we have ever experienced.  The team are exceptional in the way they care for their guests.  A few examples on this trip were; being taken up on the roof with champagne to watch the flypast for trooping of the colour, being left a thoughtfully prepared gift in the room the night before we went to see a concert, are just a few of the reasons why we return. It's great to see so many familiar faces in the 41 team each time we return and they greet you with genuine warmth.  They are all great fun and are encouraged to be themselves, not to interact with the formal stuffiness you can experience in other luxury hotels. It feels unfair to single anyone out as everyone at 41 delivers the same fantastic service but special thanks on this visit go to Andrew, Flo, Stefan and of course Steve.  Please don't ever change 41, we love you!",5,2017,07,02
137,My new London home,"A small boutique hotel directly opposite Buckingham Palace.
I loved this place. The staff went out of their way to make me feel special. I have NEVER had service like this before in my life. The rooms were gorgeous but, be warned, they are in a converted terrace house so are small, dark and oddly shaped at times. Quirky definitely works as a description. I still really enjoyed it as the rooms were very unique. The breakfast was superb and the ice-cream freezer available 24 hours a day was fantastic! Love it when hotels do something a little different. Can't thank everyone on staff enough. I had a sensational stay and felt like the most important person in the world.",5,2017,07,02
137,First class hotel,"This hotel does not have a pool or golf course, but I'll match its service level with any world class hotel I have stayed at, and I've stayed at the tops hotels around the world.  The staff is very well trained with personal attention to all your needs.  The hotel is located at the heart of London with very tight security.  We felt very safe, which is important especially with recent terrorist attacks in London.  Well don!",5,2017,06,29
137,Our new London home!,"Very small boutique hotel with only 28 rooms and a 2 to 1 staff to guest ratio.  Simply the best and most personalized service anyone could ask for.  All of the staff know your name and room number and remember all of your preferences.  We had a problem with the bathroom sink faucet on the second day, and it was taken care of immediately with a complimentary bottle of wine as an apology. Beautiful classic atmosphere and first class accommodations.  Worth every penny spent.  We will be back.  Maitre'ds Stephan Otto and Andrew Muir were fantastic as was all of the staff.  Can't wait to come back.",5,2017,06,29
137,The MOST incredible experience ,"Our stay at Hotel 41 for the weekend was simply amazing. From being greeted at the front door to anticipating our every need, we experienced a weekend that was truly unforgettable. The service and genuine care you receive from the staff is exquisite. We highly recommend this hotel experience to maximize your time in London. And we will be back. ",5,2017,06,26
137,"Excellent service, incredible location","The service at Hotel 41 is just wonderful. We stayed there for three nights, and the small service touches were nice, e.g. they took the time to ask whether we were vegetarian (my wife is) and then the chef made a separate appetizer for her over the complimentary afternoon snacks.

The location is perfect if you are there as a tourist -- one block from Buckingham Palace, and easy walking distance to Big Ben, The National gallery, and much more, and one block from the tube. Their executive lounge is perfect to relax with great light food (complimentary) and drinks. The price of the hotel (it is a bit on the expensive side) was worth it.

However, this is still London, where space is at a premium. So the rooms are not large, and the executive lounge is cosy as opposed to grand. Also, the bathroom fittings are a little temperamental. But for our money, we would stay there every time we go back to London.",5,2017,06,25
137,BEYOND EXCELLENT! Simply superlative and more,"I usually don't post on Trip Advisor because frankly I find it a place where folks overhype a place or have an ax to grand and rarely use it as a once source for my travel needs. This one is an exception. This boutique luxury hotel is mind-blowing in terms of service and taking care of one's unique travel needs. If you need to be near Buckingham Palace or Victoria Station, there is no choice but Hotel 41. On this trip I needed all type of different stuff that I usually do - dry cleaning, pressing, ice cream at 2:45 am, tux pick up and return, even a haircut and beard trim. No request was not met with a same. The executive lounge is you private pantry and bar and is stocked with liquors you never heard of. I have done a fair amount of traveling and always been disappointed when a hotel claims they'll do everything from unpack your bags to ply you with food and drink 24 hours. These folks DO IT! I can honestly state for the first time ever that this is truly a bargain given the deliverables and service.My wife did yoga and the room with a breathtaking view of London. WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY, except don't go there because I never want to be shut out of this place when I return to London!! Thank to you its Manager Ms. Harking and the entire Hotel 41 team for greatness rarely found in the hospitality industry. The Red Carnation Group certainly has some magic in its midst, just check out the reviews for Ashford Castle in Ireland, which is an amazing property as well.",5,2017,06,24
137,Amazing Visit,"My wife and I recently visited London for our 20th wedding anniversary.  You can easily read other reviews regarding the convenient walking distance to theaters and eateries, places along the Thames, the luxuriously comfortable rooms, and the beautiful lounge with pantry and evening fare with the availability of top shelf alcoholic beverages.  But it is the service that is second to none. 

From the minute you arrive, you are treated as if you are part of a private club where old friends are glad to see you. Upon return from the show Wicked, we had two delicious cupcakes in our room and a playbill picture signed by the lead.  One night they even had an anniversary cake and champagne waiting for us in our room.  The top notch staff could not have been more informative, personable and accommodating.  They made sure we did not need for anything and made sure we were comfortable at all times.

We have stayed at some exceptional properties and Hotel 41 is at the top!  We hope to visit again.",5,2017,06,20
137,2nd Stay and still exceptional!!!,"We overnighted in London on June 3rd and decided to once again pick Hotel 41. Exceptional comfort, service, location, style just across the road from Buckingham Palace Mews. My husband is still raving about the water pressure in the shower. This hotel is basically our go to whenever we visit London forever more!!!!",5,2017,06,19
137,"Exceptional service, style, comfort in the heart of London","My wife and I recently visited London for some business followed by a few days of vacation. After my conference finished we stayed three nights at Hotel 41.  We were not disappointed.  

The hotel is on the 5th floor of another hotel, the Rubens, with a separate street entrance through which you pass by a desk into a short hallway leading to an elevator.  The entrance is staffed throughout the day until midnight by a very engaging man who we enjoyed chatting with daily as we came and went.  Our luggage was brought to our room while we registered.  We were brought to the executive lounge and a glass of champagne (several choices offered) was provided.  The lounge is reasonably spacious and very comfortable with a ""pantry"" located in one corner stocked with a variety of foods night and day, including fruits, breads, meats, cheeses, salads as well as drinks and snacks including ice cream!   Afternoon tea is served daily, but we were always out and about and therefore missed this feature.  Service in the lounge was always exceptional and a full hot breakfast is available as well, if desired.  

The appointments and furnishings are very luxurious and the rooms are quite comfortable.  Ours was an ""Executive King"" and had large windows with a good view and mahogany furniture with a black and white color scheme.   The marble bathroom had both a tub and a glassed shower both with rainfall type shower heads and practically  monsoon force water flow!   The bed was quite comfy and a choice of pillows were offered in a pre-visit questionnaire that was sent to us ahead of our arrival. 

The location is convenient, just behind the Royal Mews and Buckingham palace, and the Victoria Station metro is just around the corner.  The hotel is an 8 minute walk to a nearby Hertz where we hired a car for a day trip to Stonehenge and Bath.  

A bit more about service, which is what really puts this hotel over the top.  As I mentioned, all the staff with whom we interacted were genuinely friendly and interested in providing the best possible service.  We were able to get tickets and attend a performance of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child one afternoon and evening. We shared a bit of our excitement about attending with the staff before departing.  Upon return late that night, there on our desk were two cupcakes with ""Harry Potter"" drizzled on the plate using icing.  Next to that was a gift box with a Marauder's Map heat sensitive mug that reveals the map as hot liquid is poured into it, along with a note expressing the hotel's hopes that we enjoyed our show.  This exemplifies a level of service and care that is quite rare. 

We have stayed at some exceptional properties throughout the world and Hotel 41 is at the top!  My wife and I both feel that we would be lucky and very happy to stay there again when next we return to London.",5,2017,06,18
137,Excellent Stay,"Excellent stay rin a room that was  exceptional . The staff were the best we have ever had the pleasure to encounter, friendly courteous that you could not find fault with. Nothing was ever to much trouble, they made our stay in London all the more enjoyable.
The pantry that was always on offer served excellent food and treats that were complimentary. 
Breakfast was amazing , best scrambled eggs have ever had.",5,2017,06,16
137,Amazing hotel,"This hotel is very special indeed...if you want sheer luxury with amazing staff then this the place to stay. Its 5 star which really does go above & beyond for your stay.
We had a 3 night stay with a room with views of the Royal Mews it was the best bed i have ever slept in. The food/service/staff awesome. We can't wait to visit again.",5,2017,06,13
137,41 Has Redefined Hospitality,"The Hotel 41 has entirely redefined Five-Star Hospitality!  Some friends had told me about the Conservatory Suite at 41, and following some research, I asked my travel agent to book it for my week in London.  I will never be able to thank those friends enough!  Although branded separately, 41 is actually the most exclusive rooms available at the Rubens at the Palace, and is directly across Buckingham Palace Road from the Royal Mews, which are the stables and garages of Buckingham Palace.  The parlor of the Conservatory Suite looks directly through the gate of the Mews.  There is a very small entry-way from the street, and an elevator will takes you straight up to the fifth floor, and the Executive Lounge.  There really isn't a ""front desk"" just a little table in the corner of this magnificent room, where you are ""checked-in"" and introduced to a staff of consummate professionals, who will see to, meet, and exceed any need or request you may have.  The lounge is open 24/7 for snacks or a drink, something to read, or just to sit and watch television.  Throughout the day they serve a series of buffets, and you can't sit down, at any hour, without being asked what they may serve you!  By the second morning at this wonderful home away from home, the staff knew how I liked my morning coffee, and even to bring it in a paper cup, so I could take it outside while I smoked!  They seem to anticipate everything, and when thanked all staff genuinely replied, ""My pleasure, Mr. McIlwain"" correctly pronouncing my name!  I don't want to name any staff, for fear I will forget one of their many kindnesses, but a couple went way above and beyond!  Leaving on a Sunday, Andrew took it upon himself to post some articles for me on Monday morning, emailed me when his mission was accomplished, and once again expressed his hope that I would be back.  I most certainly will!  Dominic somehow learned that I was looking for a particular product of Sainsbury's, and upon my return one afternoon, I found not one, but two packages of same, along with a very nice hand-written note, hoping that was what I had been searching for-as well as the hope that my day at the British Museum had been well spent.  

The Conservatory Suite itself is truly one of the great hotel rooms of the world.  Downstairs is a small parlor, with a wet bar, powder room and fireplace, looking over the arched gate to the Royal Mews.  Fresh flowers, treats, and drinks replenished daily, and a comfortable place to sit and watch London traffic, although well insulated from all but the loudest motorcycle or construction equipment.  Upstairs is a large, beautifully appointed bedroom, lots of storage space, full bath, and a most comfortable bed, situated under a pyramid of glass that makes up the suite's ceiling!  What joy to sleep under a shower of English stars, or to awaken to a gentle patter of rain.  Smaller than a comparable-if there is one-American hotel suite, it is quite large for a European room, very nicely appointed, and very comfortable.  Nightly turn down services include, sweets, lighted candles and soft music, as well as aroma-therapy, and a little meditation for the day, along with a weather report for morning!  Hotel 41 sits in a block, entirely operated by the Red Carnation Group, which includes The Rubens, with several bars and restaurants, as well as The B Bar, and shopping.  Right around the corner is the Cardinal Place indoor mall, and Victoria Station.  Entertainments, specialty shops, bars, etc. abound, and is only minutes from the Palace of Westminster and the Abbey.  

Although the physical attributes of the Hotel 41 are far far above more common five star hotels, the service, and attention to detail provided by the staff is head and shoulders above even the best.  You really are made to feel as though you are the guest in the beautiful city home of very dear friends, and I cannot rate them higher.  Very much looking forward to my next visit!",5,2017,06,12
137,Grandest Hotel Visit,"Upon arrival at 41, we were treated to a hotel tradition of champagne.  We chose the Queen's favorite, which was exquisite. As we sipped our champagne,  we perused the fantastic library. When we arrived in our room, there was a fresh basket of fruit and a plate of chocolates.  Snacks were available in the library as well as drinks. Hourderves were served prior to dinner. All of this was included in the price. The staff was exceptional.  On the phone, there is a button for ""whatever/ whenever"". If travelling to London, this is the hotel to stay at. I will definitely be returning!!!",5,2017,06,12
137,Classic Elegance,"We recently returned from our third stay at Hotel 41.  As always it was amazing!  The staff works together to ensure that the guests' visits go smoothly.  We likened it to some swans we saw on a small river near Southampton.  The current was fairly swift, but the swans appeared to be beautiful and calm.  We know their feet were paddling quickly to stay in place.  The staff at this hotel are constantly working behind the scenes to make sure guests are treated with courtesy and efficiency.  We owe a special debt of gratitude to Adele.  We already have the hotel booked two more times in the next year.",5,2017,06,12
137,It doesnt get any better than this!!,"From the moment you walk in, the staff truly treats you like family. I've travelled a lot and this hotel is head and shoulders above many. Hotel 41 sets the benchmark for all other hotels to aspire to. The room was breathtaking and the decor was first class. Location is exceptional with everything right out your door. If staying in London, look no further. Hotel 41 will be seeing us over and over again. What an amazing group of people! ",5,2017,06,12
137,Customer Service,"The hotel and rooms are interesting, but frankly, what sets this place apart is customer service. Period. They are focused on you getting the most out of your stay.

The Salon is where all the action is. We didn't do this, but on a rainy, dreary London day, I could imagine spending nearly all of it sitting in the Salon and reading. Probably not the best place for young kids

Great location for all things in Westminster. Loved it",5,2017,06,11
137,Hospitality at it's very best,"My wife and I spent two very enjoyable nights in this wonderful hotel - actually, it's more like a private club. 
From the moment we entered the door, we were treated to very friendly, personal and professional service from every staff member that we met. The ambiance is such that the Executive Club room - where everything takes place - is the perfect place to relax and 'chill out'. There is a comprehensive bar with complimentary snacks available and they offer a meal service as well. At all times, there will be attentive staff waiting to deal with your every whim - they go out of their way to make Hotel 41 feel like a 'home from home'.
The rooms are extremely comfortable and well appointed and the power of the shower was something to behold! 
This boutique hotel sets the standards in hospitality for others establishments to follow.
I highly recommend Hotel 41 - we will be back!",5,2017,06,09
137,Never stayed anywhere like this,We arrived to a very friendly welcome. Efficient check in aided by a glass of champagne. Could not fault the friendly efficient relaxed service. Beautiful room. Excellent breakfast and delicious pantry to help yourself to. We loved every minute. ,5,2017,06,07
137,"great room, great service, great drinks and breakfast","We stayed in room 29, which was a perfect sized room. One of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on. The staff kept bringing little gifts and treats every night, which made our 10 year wedding anniversary very special.",5,2017,06,05
137,We have christened this 'our hotel' in London!,"We had the pleasure of staying in Hotel 41 recently and it was a stellar experience. From the moment we entered, we were treated warmly, and welcomed like family. EVERYONE from start to finish was warm, friendly, and professional. Every single thing we experienced in this hotel was top notch.  When planning our trip to the UK, we used a travel agent who had suggested hotels for each of our venues. Hotel 41 was not the agent-suggested hotel for London, however after doing my own research I was confident that this was the hotel we wanted. The location is excellent, being very close to Buckingham Palace and within walking distance of much that we were interested in seeing in our short (2 night) stay in London. The quality of the service, as others have mentioned, surpasses all others. Hotel 41 is a small boutique hotel, which is what we were looking for. The breakfasts were wonderful, and the happy hour was magnificent. All drinks that we tried during the happy hour were refreshing and well prepared. The snacks that were offered along with the drinks were superb.  The attention to detail for all of their guests surpasses anything we have ever experienced, and we have traveled well to many places.
Before we arrived,I had communicated with staff about restaurant reservations, and they were able to make excellent suggestions and advance reservations. They were even able to snag a table at one of the most coveted restaurants in the city, where we were treated like royalty.THANK YOU to all the team who does such a fine job at making guests feel that hotel 41 is their home away from home (only better!!)!

We look forward to our next return to London and staying at Hotel 41.",5,2017,06,04
137,The best,It's the best without any doubt. Staying somewhere else will be a injustice to London visit. Superb rooms and great location. Service is great. Good is a little expensive. Rest is as a like all reviews says. The best.. u hoo,5,2017,06,01
137,Amazing,"This is the best hotel We have ever stayed in. Staff are excellent, they cannot do enough for their guests. Only one night stay, wished we could have stayed longer. We felt so relaxed and pampered. 

Romantic turndown fantastic. Great location.

Everyone should stay here at least once in their lifetime. ",5,2017,05,29
137,Incomparable service... a must!,"Hotel 41 has definitely the best service we have ever experienced among all the very good hotels we have been to. From the moment they welcome you, they are full of warm and heartfelt attentions. Yet without being too much. The staff has been of very good advices which definitely emphasized the quality of our stay in London. Frankly, we have been highly impressed by our experience and will definitely stay there next time around. The hotel is also very well located which makes it even more interesting. It is small, full of charm and truly worth the expense! Enjoy!!",5,2017,05,29
137,Excellent Service great location,"Had a lovely stay here whilst attending a royal garden party. The location for this was perfect only a short walk from the palace. It's not like any hotel I've previously stayed in because it's located on the fifth floor, accessed by a small lift. The ground floor entrance is very nice and it feels like a private members club, which again is nice. Reception is based within the 'executive lounge' which is a beautiful room with a small split level gallery where you can have some more privacy if wanted. We were greeted very well with a complimentary glass of fizz ( four to choose from!) service on the whole during our stay was very good in deed save for a couple of minor issues. Firstly, our WHB tap was loose and they failed to fix it after I'd reported it. Secondly there was a South African gentleman who greeted all guests most days, he was very pleasant,however I found him to be let's say a little too enthusiastic, especially first thing in the morning. The room albeit small for the rate charged ( guessing this is central London for you) was very nice along with bathroom. All usual add ons you'd expect from a hotel of this standing and mrs Lowe had a great make up mirror! The executive lounge was good ( lots of sweets, snacks, as much ice cream as one could eat, lovely evening nibbles and food ) however only bottled water was FOC which I felt was a little mean. I was charged £9 for cup of tea! I'm not expecting to have free booze but a cup of tea? This was the most I've paid for a hotel room and I love my luxuries and am not afraid to shell out for a special occasion but wanted to see what the actual benefit was between this place (circa £500/ night) and what I'd consider to be a really nice room (circa (£250. / night) the answer for me was not much apart from the service, which though very good , not perfect. Consider no gym , pool etc and it's probably not worth the extra. I really enjoyed our stay / experience and don't regret the additional cost but feel it's probably more due to its location than anything else.",4,2017,05,29
137,It is without doubt the best hotel in london,"Hotel 41 is a wonderful small hotel near Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station. It´s location makes it very easy to reach the interesting locations of London very easy. Hotel 41 and its staff offer the best service that you can imagine. There is a wonderful and warm welcome each time we arrive. The rooms are perfectly designed in black and white. The turn down service is perfect - water provided for the night, a small sheet of paper with the weather forecast and tips for the next day. The breakfast offers either a buffet or a typical English breakfast - be careful if you order it - it is huge! We aleays love the conversation with the staff. There is always the feeling that the staff is really interested that everything is okay. It remains the best hotel in London.",5,2017,05,28
137,You have to stay here,"This hotel is amazing, every part of it is a wonderful experience and worth the value. I can't ever imagine staying anywhere else while in London! I wish every hotel operated like this one. Thank you for the wonderful time! ",5,2017,05,27
137,Unbelieveable Experience,"In traveling many places in the world, we have not experienced such outstanding accommodations as we did during our stay at Hotel 41. First, it's location is just down the street from Buckingham Place, and is convenient to most attractions. Hotel 41 has a limited number of rooms, which convey the feeling of being special. To that point the service and  dedication to detail is without approach. The quality of the dining was excellent. The staff was very friendly and responded to every need, truly professional.
If you desire the best, Hotel 41 should be your selection! Glenn & Kae Erickson, Danville, California, USA",5,2017,05,24
137,Wonderful stay after a memorable afternoon at a Royal garden Party,"From the moment we arrived nothing was too much trouble for the incredible staff at Hotel 41. We were made to feel like part of the family. The personal service extended to friends who joined us for drinks before supper. Our room was beautiful, light and airey with candle as part of the turn down service. Canapes and snacks were plentiful and delicious. We will certainly return for a special occasion",5,2017,05,24
137,The Best Hotel In The World,"This was the best hotel stay I've ever experienced.  It is a smaller hotel, so you feel pampered and taken care of with a personal touch from every employee who all greet you with a smile.  The staff are courteous and quick to respond to any issue or request.  Rooms are luxurious and 5-star quality all around, no issues of cleanliness or missing amenities (and if you did need anything, again the staff is on call and eager to assist you).  The Executive Lounge for breakfast, drinks, afternoon tea, or late night snacks is an ornate room with classic and elegant decor.  Located in beautiful Westminster just opposite Buckingham Palace's Royal Mews, fine dining and beautiful sightseeing is just minutes away on foot.  Victoria Station for Underground service is only a short walk as well, giving you easy access to almost anywhere in downtown London.  Everything about this cozy little hotel is luxury and class.  You will not be disappointed by staying at this spectacular hotel.",5,2017,05,23
137,High standards maintained!!!,We stayed here again during our 2nd trip to London and had the same quiet room 4109.  The staff anticipated our every need.  The lounge where breakfast is served is great.  The location is very central to call areas of London as fellas walking distance to Victoria station.,5,2017,05,23
137,Favorite Hotel and Staff!,"Hotel 41 is our favorite Hotel ever and everywhere!  Beautiful Boutique Style and the Staff - AMAZING!  This was our second visit and we can't wait to go back.  Perfect location too!!!! We walked to see the changing of the guard, palace and many other tourist attractions.  The food and wine selection is delicious too!  Oh and most important the BED WAS SO COMFY COZY!",5,2017,05,23
137,Best Hotel and staff ,"Beautiful small hotel with one of the most amazing staffs ever!  They were so responsive, helpful and friendly....like none I have ever encountered before!  We loved the entire experience and will definitely make this our hotel in London!",5,2017,05,21
137,Amazing Hotel and service,My wife and I just spent a night here for a wedding anniversary and had a wonderful time. All the staff were very helpful and polite. We stayed in the Monarch suite which I highly recommend. Amazing food in an amazing building with great staff. If you are in London this is the place to stay! ,5,2017,05,21
137,Great Hotel in London,"Hotel 41 located in London is a gem in a city with hundreds of highly ranked hotels. This hotel should have a 10 star rating as it trumps most of the big name places. My wife and I were in London for seven days and very happy that we chose Hotel 41. The service, and personal attention that this hotel gives its clients is over the top. The staff was very helpful and always went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of. 

Hotel 41 is directly across the street from the Buckingham Palace Royal Mews, and just a short walk away form many other London attractions; Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abby, Big Ben, Houses of Parliament, St. James Park, The Green Park, Trafargar Square, Piccadilly Circus, just to name a few. There are also plenty of restaurants and shopping in the area. 

I will definitely stay at Hotel 41 again, and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.           .",5,2017,05,18
137,I will definitely stay here again,"Stayed here for 5 nights in April 2017 and loved it.  Room was clean, cleverly designed, executive room was really nice and had great food and drink options.  Hotel is well located and has a fantastic atmosphere.

But really, the best thing about this hotel is the staff; I've stayed in a few 5 star hotels before and have often found the attention over-the-top, but the Hotel 41 team offer the perfect level of hospitality  Their staff are intelligent and great at engaging with guests with the right amount of care.  My wife and I joked about Hotel 41 being our new home-away-from-home and I am looking forward to my next visit.",5,2017,05,18
137,A Beautiful Place!,"We stayed here as a splurge for one night in London. It was in the perfect location, central to shops, restaurants, and sites in London.The room was clean, quiet, and comfortable and we couldn't have asked for a better stay.",5,2017,05,17
137,"""Whatever, whenever""","Incredible service, staff at your fingertips 24 hours day.  They have thought of everything.   The button on the phone says ""whatever,  whenever "" and they mean it.  Boutique hotel in lovely older building.   Temperature always right, excellent room lighting, and the mattress was more comfortable than mine at home.   The Executive lounge is open 24 hours too with snacks and drinks gratis.  They have spoiled me for staying in a typical hotel ever again. ",5,2017,05,17
137,What Makes A Great Hotel,"There was a mistake with my room.  The hotel could have handled the challenge in a variety of ways, Hotel 41 choose to comp me the night.  It was truly not necessary, but it was a wonderful gesture that turned a mistake into a fan.",5,2017,05,17
137,Perfect start to honeymoon,"Booked Hotel 41 after reading the various great reviews and the fact it was Number 1 on here. It was a treat for the first night of our honeymoon before we flew from Gatwick the next day and we couldn't have wished for a better place to stay.
The hotel is beautiful and the staff couldn't do enough for you, they were all fantastic. As it was our honeymoon we got a free upgrade on arrival which was a nice surprise.
We also got a bottle of champagne and personalised cakes in our room as well which was amazing and a nice personal touch.
The hotel really made us feel special during our stay and we will be returning I'm sure hopefully in the near future.
Fully deserving of all the priase the hotel has already recieved and will continue to recieve I'm sure.",5,2017,05,15
137,exquisite stay,we stayed here for a business/leisure trip on 13th May 2017. From the minute we walked through the doors we were knocked out by the fantastic service... We were escorted to the lift and in to the beautiful executive lounge to check in. whlie we did we were offered champagne and because my partner is not keen on champagne  wine was offered.. Steve jones in the lounge is an asset to the hotel. He did everything he could to make sure everything we needed was available to us.. The room was beautifully decorated and the bathroom was kitted out with plenty of toiletries that so many hotels overlook. The service from every member of staff we encountered was the best we have found in all of the hotels we have stayed in... We went to see wicked that evening on our return were 2 cupcakes on a decorated stand with wicked decorated on it and a signed picture.. Breakfast in the morning was beautifully cooked and presented... We were gutted we were only staying for 1 night but we are planning our next visit already.. love love love this place.,5,2017,05,15
137,Wonderful boutique hotel,"Arrived jet lagged but greeted warmly by the staff and the room was ready for us 2:30 pm.  The suite was on two levels, you climb the stairs to get to the sleeping area and bathroom, the sitting area with another desk/chair and more comfortable chairs were downstairs.  A tray of petit fours and basket of fruit awaited us in the sitting area. The service here is incredible.  Before leaving the US, I had requested by email a foam roller and yoga mat for my back which they provided at no cost.  Also requested that there be a gallon of distilled water for a CPAP machine which they also had in the room at no cost.  Provided a SIM chip and installed it for me at cost (£20 from Vodafone) but forgot to charge me the 5% service charge.  When I reminded them twice about the missing charge, they complimented me on my honesty but then waived the fee since they had failed to include it twice.  At 1 in the morning we were awake and hungry due to the jet lag and miraculously the executive lounge had a full spread of delicious meats, cheeses, fruit, pastries, a hot seafood in cream sauce topped with piped mashed potatoes that had been browned in a broiler, and 24 hour availability of ice cream!  Since we had declined the arrival glass of champagne, they provided a glass another time at no charge (actually was charged but when we explained the situation they removed the charge).  The breakfasts were excellent and they had streaky bacon (American style) in addition to the British style bacon.  Their restaurant recommendations were excellent and they booked the reservations for us ahead of time (St. John and Tom Cubitt).  The location across the street from Buckingham Palace was excellent and we could walk to pretty much everywhere we wanted to go.  Traffic (which we experienced when we took a taxi to St John) was horrendous, however, and the 30 min expected ride took nearly an hour.  Better to walk or take the underground (Victoria Station).  Love this restaurant although if you have mobility problems the two floor arrangement might be difficult. Re room recommendations, this is too long for the section below so including it here.  Room 4116 has an emergency exit from the bathroom that leads to the mezzanine level of the executive lounge (!) so in the morning you can hear people having breakfast.  It didn't really bother us because we were usually up and about before then.",5,2017,05,15
137,Amazing Hotel with Amazing People,"Our memorable stay began with warm greetings  by Nicole at the reception desk and whom escorted us to the Executive Lounge upstairs where we had our check-in, also helped by Lauren. Not to mention Steve, who served us the bubbly Champagne and yummy snacks..  💜 then Florent took it from there to introduce us to the room which was to be ours for a night, the famous Conservatory Master Suite, a must-try for travellers to London! And there awaited us was a beautiful bottle of champagne with the red carnation signature and more handmade savouries! Such a Wonderful Welcome❤ We could not wait for night time to be able to gaze at the stars in the sky just lying from our bed.. 
When we were about to go out, Maria was very helpful to give us some tips..
During the evening, there was Edgar at the Executive Lounge, ever-so-ready to assist us in every possible way, and thanks to him, our room temperature became accordingly to our likes! 
And then to end the lovely night, we surely got to close our eyes with London's city stars as the last things in sight.. 
As we checked out the next day, we did not forget to thank and mention to all the beautiful staff at 41 that we will DEFINITELY return in JUNE! Such an amazing stay!",5,2017,05,14
137,second visit,this hotel is a 5 min walk from the thames ideal for the London eye boat trips etc and amazing shops and restaurants the teas coffees etc are so generous as is everything in the room and fresh milk from reception if you need it. also everyone is so friendly and helpful thay cannot do enough for you we run a 5* gold guest house so we are very picky but this place is the best :-),5,2017,05,13
137,Wow,"Fabulous location, a short stroll to Buckingham Palace. 
You are made at to instantly feel at home by charming staff. Fresh fruit is readily available and the bonus of afternoon tea and snacks as well as the "" plunder the pantry"" spread from 8pm adds a huge amount of value.
A smart black and white decor throughout, great water pressure, nothing is too much trouble.
Understated luxury without the busyness of a large hotel.",5,2017,05,10
137,Hotel 41 is a Winner!,"A great hotel adds so much to our trips.  It is a wonderful place to start every day and a relaxing place to end each day. Hotel 41 was that hotel for us in our recent visit to London.  

My wife and I had a wonderful time in our six nights at 41.  The room was very nice, the food was great and the staff was terrific.

There were so many things we liked that is would be difficult to itemize them all, but I will touch on some of the highlights.

We particularly appreciated the availability of a guest room prior to check-in and after checking out of our regular room.  After a long flight from the U.S., the ability to take a nap and freshen up was a key.

The hotel was perfectly situated to launch our daily forays into London.  It was close to dining and only a block away from a local theatre which we enjoyed.

On our first day, we were treated to afternoon tea.  The staff let us have our complementary glass of Louis Roederer Champagne with the tea.  It was delicious and added to the experience.  The tea was very nice with all the classic bells and whistles. Steve Jones charmed us with his stories.    

A highlight of every morning were the awesome full breakfasts.  I loved the full english breakfast and the waffles.  There were a great variety of items and we tried to sample as many as possible.

We enjoyed the nightly food service and nightly treats.  The casseroles were very good; particularly the seafood and lamb ones.  I enjoyed the Jude's ice cream and several of the pastries.  We appreciated the free bottled water.  We also enjoyed the rusks and Earl Grey Tea.

The all-around professionalism Magdalena Pokorska was noteworthy.  

Adéle Coetzee was a star.  She had a wonderful friendly demeanor and amazing attention to detail.  She gave us several tips on dining and transportation that enhanced our experience.  One day I mentioned that we enjoyed drinking ""London Fogs” (a vanilla tea latte) in the morning.   The next day, without requesting them, we were served them at breakfast.  Adéle could teach clinic in customer service.

There was also a tall, thin young man who waited on us often.  His name escapes us but we appreciated his efforts.

The whatever/whenever button was good to have.  We liked the house keeping staff and evening turndown service/room freshening.  Every night we were provided with special treats.  One night we were given a delicious “Happy 35th Anniversary Cake”.  What a treat.

It seems like a minor detail, but we appreciated the speed and availability of the elevator.  At other hotels waiting for an elevator can be time consuming.   A major plus was excellent wifi included in the room rate.  It is something we look for in a hotel.

We are enjoying our parting gift, the cookbook ""A Life in Food”.  I mentioned it at the front entrance while departing for a walk one day and a copy signed by the staff showed up in our room.  That was a terrific touch.",5,2017,05,10
137,40th birthday ,"We have travelled a lot for many years and are very picky with cleaning, services and impressions. At our honeymoon we experienced many 5 stars hotels in many countries which all where superb. But we had agreed together that this hotel, Hotel 41 is the best we ever stayed. We loved it from the first to the last minute. ",5,2017,05,10
137,"Great location, amazing service","Hotel 41 is a boutique hotel at the top floor of a classic London building near Buckingham Palace.

Two features make Hotel 41 a really special place:

The incredible level of service, that manages to be efficient, friendly, and attentive to detail (hey they will pack your luggage if you want!)

The executive lounge, a beautiful wood-paneled large lounge with a mezzanine. It is a great place to relax or grab a bite away from the hustle and bustle of the City. They serve breakfast, high tea, and have a full bar + snacks pretty during the whole day.",5,2017,05,09
137,We miss Hotel 41 already,"We spent 8 nights at 41 and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The staff was friendly, engaged and efficient. It was a pleasure to start the day with a fantastic breakfast in the Executive Lounge where the wait staff greeted us with a smile, remembered our names, and offered assistance with our plans for the day. They have truly mastered the art of fine service. The room was spotless, well-appointed with a very comfy bed. Turn down service included nightly treats and the staff provided a special treat related to our visit to the play: Wicked. So very nice and thoughtful. When we return to London, we will stay here again.  I’m really concerned that we’ve been spoiled and no other hotel will live up to Hotel 41.",5,2017,05,08
137,Beyond Belief,"Ah, so you want to spoil your partner to a five star trip into London for their birthday. You might think to go somewhere fashionable like The Savoy or The Ritz.
You may do that, but you shall certainly not be treated as well. I assure you.
To say the staff are great is useless. These are not staff - they are artists! Hospitality is their craft and it is beyond belief. It's the details. They anticipate your requirements. Exceed them. You never feel like you're on a conveyor belt of care, no. More like an experience of a life time. Many other hotels would do well to study how Hotel 41 perform.
Impeccable rooms. Great food and drink. No request is too large or detail to small. 

Next time, though, I shall really test them!",5,2017,05,08
137,Hotel 41 ( 4+1=5star Experiece),"What can I say - fantastic. We made our Easter great by visiting Rome, and on our way back to Dublin we wanted to stay in a top hotel in London.
As a surprise I found Hotel 41 on the top of the list, so we decided to try it.
Advice: Try it! It was amazing! I will never regret that decision.
Lovely room, luxurious in every aspect and everywhere around you! If love luxurious we need to try this one!  ",5,2017,05,08
137,Highly recommended!,Me and my partner had the most fantastic stay here! 5* well deserved. Would highly recommend this to anyone staying in London! Absolute bliss. We had the most fantastic nights sleep in a top room! Brilliant! ,5,2017,05,07
137,25th Anniversary ,Words won't accurately describe this experience. It was other-worldly. I've stayed in many of the nicest hotels around the world and not one comes even close to the quality and service of this hotel. It's just in a different league all its own. Favorite hotel experience of all-time!,5,2017,05,04
137,Excellence,"Nothing but fantastic.
Beautiful hotel with outstanding services all around.
Actually better than our own in NYC.......
Stayed only for 11 hours but it was worthwhile to hub. Will return to this landmark Hotel.
The Caesar salad in the midst of the night was a wonder.",5,2017,05,02
137,Superb,"This hotel was amazing. If you are accustomed to staying at nice hotels and you anticipate the luxury concierge treatment, this hotel is for you. It is directly across the street from the Royal Mews, which is located on the edge of Buckingham Palace. The nearby South African restaurant has great food as well. I used this as the base of operations and was able to comfortably tube around London. Easy access to Victoria station and then hop on the circle or victoria lines to get where you need to go.",5,2017,05,01
137,In A League Of Its Own,"I'm not so comfortable with the phrase 'home from home'.  Though we have a perfectly nice home life, we don't get waited on hand and foot by delightfully pleasant people who enjoy their jobs; we don't get our requirements anticipated and acted upon; nor do we enjoy such incredible luxury in our bedroom/suite, a turndown service, wonderful surprises popping up here, there and everywhere.  At home, we have a pantry, but nothing to compare to this, and though we have a few bottles, it's nowhere near the superb range available at the bar.  So, 41 is much, much more than home from home, for us anyway.

A mistake was in fact made.  It's not the making of a mistake that marks the quality of an establishment, it's the nature of the response.  And I've never seen anything like this response.  Such kind people genuinely disappointed, but things corrected quickly and generously, with grace and style.  Awesome.  

This was our first stay, and we knew immediately we'd be back, perhaps an annual treat.  But within a week or two of returning home, we caved in and booked again for later this year.  It's the only hotel where I've actually found myself looking forward to meeting again the staff, because they seem like friends.  In fact, that's the difference that makes the difference at 41 - the staff and their passion for their work, for delighting customers.  We can't praise the hotel highly enough.",5,2017,05,01
137,A Truly Special Hotel Experience,Everything at Hotel 41 was perfect. The staff were so wonderful and attentive. The room was very comfortable and quiet. Everything you could want was right at your fingertips. The location was perfect. Hotel 41 is a gem of a hotel in a fantastic city. ,5,2017,04,29
137,5 star experience at 41 Hotel,"Booked in December for our April stay and immediately aware this would be a 5 star experience all the way.
Easy booking and excellent relevant communication with confirmation and offers of help with anything to make our stay easy and special.
A warm welcome on arrival from a team of courteous staff that displayed an interest in our plans without being intrusive. Clearly high calibre, well trained individuals working as a well motivated team.
A glass of complimentary champagne  and canapés were a pleasant welcoming touch to start our short break in London.
The Hotel is small with less than 30 rooms and the elegant lounge is the hub for check in, bar, refreshments and breakfast. A cosy feel with a Minstrels gallery , high ceiling, historic library and warm wooden furniture.
Our air conditioned room/suite was impressive . Split on two levels with a downstairs sitting room and an upstairs bedroom and bathroom with a feature skylight affording a view of the days perfect blue sky.   A large bathroom with spacious shower and jacuzzi bath was impressive  . All the decor is a black and white theme throughout the room and the hotel.
Whist we were in London to view an art exhibition and enjoy dinner at a super restaurant , 41 Hotel was a special base with a warm atmosphere, attentive staff and attractive furnishing..
Our stay was most enjoyable and we will return for future special occasions when quality and ambience are order of the day.

137,Red Carnation Collection experience Part 3,"So I've finally arrived at the last of my Red Carnation Hotel trip shenanigans destination and I have to say: yes, I know now why it's voted the No1 Hotel in London on TripAdvisor. Like her other two sister hotels (Egerton and Milestone) the service is impeccable. What makes 41 stands out from the rest of the hotels, is the fact that all the people working at 41 consistently willing to walk that extra mile to make your stay there a magical experience: Champagne accompanied welcoming checking in, in the grand and yet cosy executive lounge. Courtesy room for the guest who checks in early. All the front house people greet you warmly by your name. Beautiful and tasty canapés and ""raid the pantry"" in the evening. I've had the good fortune of meeting the legendary Mrs. T (the lady president of the Red Carnation Hotels) during my stay after staying at her hotels, it was very special. 

It's the home from home experience but better. For me personally it's perfect. OK just to state the obvious: the bed is comfortable, the room is well appointed, the washroom is very clean and spacious, the service is very attentive, everything is perfect and if its not? they make it happen for you. I happened to have stayed in Rubens hotel before and it does not bother me that 41 is on the 5th floor of the Rubens, which is a very nice hotel itself.

I suppose I can only say that I like the hotel so much so, when I had a last minute trip back to London within a week, I didn't look or book anywhere else.",5,2017,04,26
137,Quite simply a fantastic hotel,"Where do i start, as so many things are just so right about this hotel.

The building - the hotel is tucked away on a higher floor, accessed by a small but beautifully appointed private entrance and lift. A receptionist greets you and then a member of staff takes you up to the hotel and it's wood panelled lounge, very cosy and intimate, to be checked in. Everywhere is clean and nicely styled. The bedrooms are very well appointed, with everything you need, plus lots of things you never even realised you may need!

The staff - are fabulous, just that right balance of friendliness, but not overly familiar. Casual enough to put you at ease, but incredibly efficient with excellent standards of service. I never had to sign a bill once, all the staff seem to know your name and room without even asking, making you feel like a regular, even if it's your first visit.

The service - this is of the highest standard, nothing is too much trouble. We had a Nespresso machine in our room and I asked if they had a stronger coffee for the machine, they asked me which one I preferred and was told that they didn't have that one, however they would have it by turndown. Just two hours later there was a knock on our room door and blow me down, a packet of my favourite coffee, even before turndown. 
It's the attention to detail on the little things that makes it too, the things you didn't ask for but they do anyway. Climbing into the enormous bed on the first night, we found that they had placed a hot water bottle in the middle to pre-warm the bed. Two little cotton bags placed on the floor on either side of the bed contained slippers, but also my wife's contained a lavender pillow spray to use if she so wished. The lounge offers a small buffet, with meats and cheese etc till 1am, which means you can come in from a show or other night out activity, sit in front of the roaring fire with the night cap drink of your choice and have a little bit of cheese and fresh daily bread, just what the doctor ordered to round off a great day. There is even a small ice cream freezer offering a selection of over 9 different luxury artisan ice creams to help yourself to if you so wish.

I did think about leaving a really rotten review for this hotel, so we could keep it a secret to ourselves, it really is that good. My wife and I can't wait to go back. 

Luxury, boutique, finest, these are all words bandied about in the hotel business. For most hotels these are just slogans and copy from marketing types trying to enforce a ""brand"", however for Hotel 41, these aren't just empty superlatives, but an accurate description of a great little find!",5,2017,04,25
137,Don't be fooled by the online photos and descriptions,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for 3 nights recently. Considering it was a special occasion, I wanted to book a first class hotel for my family and I. Talking to the hotel reception by phone for reservation purposes, it was suggested a special offer of 3 nights for 2. The price presented to me per night seemed reasonable considering this was a 5-star hotel in London and we booked a suite.
Arriving at the hotel was already a disappointment, as we found out Hotel 41 is actually the fifth floor of the Rubens hotel. To summarize our stay, the room was small, considering we booked a two room suite. The bathrooms were tiny - the shower head reached my chest so I had to kneel down to wash my hair. The floors squeaked, the bed was old and sinked in the middle. The other bathroom to the suite was very narrow and if you sat on the toilet, much care had to be taken not to burn your knees and legs on the side wall heater.
The only other location of the hotel was the Executive Lounge, which is also the reception desk, the dining room, the breakfast room and so on. Although well decorated, it would not be adequate if the hotel was full, it provides no privacy at all, even if you wanted to make a complaint to hotel management.
Our last unpleasant surprise was paying the bill. I had understood that the daily rate presented on reservation would be charged twice as the offer was 3 nights for two. I learned that the rate presented in fact was an average value, and it was charged 3 times, making the cost of this hotel unbelievably expensive and not worth the infrastructure provided.
Had I known, I would certainly have chosen other several better options in London.
The second last unpleasant surprise was that breakfast was not in fact included, other than the very basic buffet available. I ordered eggs and these were charged. I have never stayed in a 5-star hotel in my life where eggs were charged separately for breakfast.
Definitely do not recommend this hotel.",1,2017,04,24
137,Simply Amazing!,This hotel is one of the finest places I've ever stayed in the world! The rooms are luxurious and comfortable. The staff goes out of its way to satisfy. The location is perfect. There are not enough adjectives to adequately describe my experience. The Hotel 41 is #1! Can't wait to go back!,5,2017,04,23
137,Great,Loved the service very helpful staff and were always available if you need anything excellent job I had an excellent experience as I stayed for 2 nights and the server was excellent could not want anything more,5,2017,04,22
137,The Best of the Best.,"Wow! The hotel is in an excellent location.  We were given a free upgrade to a studio room which was amazing! Check in was smooth, bar area was great and breakfast was also brilliant. We're going back in August as it was so good. Central to everything and was a great non-business stay. Stayed in so many great hotels around the world, this will take some beating.",5,2017,04,20
137,The best hotel experience ever!,"Just stayed here in early April.  It's the best urban boutique hotel there is.  I cannot say enough about the ""experience"" of staying here.  It is an experience and feeling you get staying here that I have not had anywhere else and I have been lucky enough to stay at some of the best hotels and resorts.  No detail is too small.  The service and the food is beyond exemplary. We have missed the food and breakfast everyday since getting back from our vacation and can't wait to get back haha. Still looking at pictures of my eggs Benedict haha. Experience everything you can while staying, cocktails, breakfast, the pantry, romantic turndown etc.  it's all worth it and we can't wait to get back and relax in the lounge!  Thanks to all the staff for making our stay so wonderful. ",5,2017,04,18
137,One of the best hotels,My experience has been amazing and would recommend it to my friends. The hotel staff was helpful and made our stay perfect as couple. Hotel interiors are cool and gives you positive vibes when you enter.,4,2017,04,18
137,Awesome Place to Stay,"I have stayed at the 41 several times and it never fails to amaze me on how great the staff and the hotel are here.  The hotel is 5 star all the way from the moment you enter the building till when you leave you are treated like family.  Need something no worries just pick up the phone and hit the ""What ever/Where ever"" button and they are on the case.  Hungry or need something to drink late at night no problem they have that covered with all sorts of treats and drinks in the Lounge or just raid the awesome room mini bar.  Need that special room for that special night book the Conservatory Suite and have a night under the stars inside",5,2017,04,18
137,Luxury private club atmosphere at a fair price,"This is a really interesting place. I stayed over with someone who was a hotel guest and was pleasantly surprised by this understatedly opulent place.

The hotel lobby is rather deceptive because it just seems like a narrow entryway tucked between a restaurant entrance and the entrance to another hotel next door, The Rubens, which is a sister property to Hotel 41 - they are both part of the Red Carnation chain of hotels. Once upstairs, however, you get the full experience of lush, chintzy luxury with a lot of restraint thrown in - everything's really pricey looking but not in a way that's ostentatious. There's just enough of a whiff of excess to make it all seem like you're in a really great property.

The room we were in was a bi-level suite - the ground floor had a little sitting area, and there was a staircase that led to the upper floor where a king sized bed was placed beneath a skylight. This is the room of fantasy and dreams, and again, everything - from the linen to the underfloor heating in the bathroom - was just perfect.

The staff were friendly, professional and discreet, and I would rate service as unobtrusively thoughtful. We didn't have time to eat, but just on the basis of the room itself and the service, I would recommend this hotel - if only the prices weren't eye-watering!",4,2017,04,17
137,Superb! ,"I'm a little late reviewing the superb Hotel 41 it has to be the best hotel I've ever stayed in, the staff were absolutely wonderful and the ambience of this wonderful home from home was just what my husband and I needed for a short Xmas shopping break. This hotel deserves all the awards and accolades it receives I can't wait for my next visit. ",5,2017,04,14
137,An amazing weekend away!,"We wanted to escape to London for a romantic weekend away, to catch a show, see some sights and stay somewhere that felt 'special'...  Hotel 41 is 'special'!

Throughout our stay the service was exceptional, the entire team being friendly, warm and always willing to go that extra mile for us.  I had arranged for a few additional surprises for my partner and Hotel 41 didn't disappoint and in fact exceeded my expectations.  We would particularly like to thank Andrew for his great service and personal touch during our stay - you're a credit to the industry and the hotel. 

Our room was excellent with all the amenities you would expect and more from robes in the bathroom to sound proof glazing and one of the most comfortable beds I have ever had the pleasure to sleep in. (I would definitely recommend the Romantic turndown service too for that 'extra touch'.) 

The location was ideal for Buckingham Palace, the Royal Parks and was only a short trip into the theatre and the other landmark attractions that London has to offer

A memorable experience and we hope to be back soon - thank you to all at Hotel 41.",5,2017,04,10
137,Believe the hype ,"Thought other reviewers may have exaggerated, but no it really is that great. Had an amazing time from the champagne welcome, to the well stocked ""snack"" bar.  Amazing staff, especially Steve Jones in the lounge and Mitchell for his great dinner recommendations. ",5,2017,04,07
137,simply the best ,"This was my fourth visit to 41 and was greeted by Bastien on entering 41. Once in the lounge Bastien reminded me that whilst here I didn't need to do anything and this statement to me sums up 41. The staff treat everyone with a friendly warm manner and aim to take care of even the smallest detail which was evident when after my daughter said she had sore feet after walking they put a foot spa in our room. Nothing is too much trouble for the team at 41 and will try to help you with anything as I discovered when I asked for pain killers as my daughter had a headache and some one went out on a Sunday morning to get some. Lauren, Magdalena and the rest of the staff make 41 the truly memorable it is. My daughter celebrated her 25 birthday whilst here and after seeing wicked we found cupcakes and a signed photo in our room. If this wasn't enough she was surprised on her birthday morning with a cake and wished happy birthday by all the team. Thanks to everyone at 41 she had an amazing birthday. We also had lunch at 41 before we left and the food was amazing exceptional quality and very generous portions. On leaving 41 I was totally taken aback when the team surprised my daughter and I with a little goody bag for our family. This gesture totally sums up why I will return back to 41. Whilst there are other hotels in London nothing is like 41 and I personally don't want to stay anywhere else. 
",5,2017,04,06
137,Service like no other!,"Hotel 41 is a quaint boutique hotel in London on Buckingham Palace road, a very short distance to Victoria and Buckingham Palace.  It's a hidden gem  Service is beyond exceptional and no detail is overlooked.  The Executive Lounge is the perfect place to enjoy breakfast, afternoon tea, pre and post dinner drinks, etc.  While the rooms are modest in size, they have all the charm that you would expect from a luxury resort.  It's a place I highly recommend and already have plans to return to in the fall.",5,2017,04,05
137,Outdone Themselves Again,"I was unsure about writing this review given my preference to keep the hype about this hotel down a notch (and be able to actually book a room without it being full), but they just deserve each and all the rave comments. A wow defines it all. 

Yes, I have stayed at The Connaught, at the Mandarin, at the Dorchester, at the Claridges, and the Rosewood; but since we found this jewel, not going back to these other hotels any time soon. They cannot dare challenge the level of detail and excellence that is put by each staff member onto their work. The ""homey"" feel paired with the standards of luxury are, in my opinion, unrivaled. 

Being unfair as it is to name some and not all, Mr. Steve Jones is illustrative of the distinctive nature of the place and is the very definition of a English gentleman in the most elemental of traditions. Kudos also to our good friend Andrew and the rest of the team. Thank you all.

Very much looking forward to seeing you in November. 
",5,2017,04,01
137,High level service like no other!,"Our recent stay 41 Hotel was delightful in every way!  From the professional and energetic staff who guided us with dining, theater, directions, and our every whim and need, not a detail was missed.  Service was rendered with the utmost of care and polish. Snacks were abundant, a fireplace in our room was a bonus, and every night a new treat appeared for turn down- rose petals, votives burning, pillow scent spray, chocolate dipped wafers in organza black bags.  I think this place is a real hidden gem.",5,2017,03,29
137,Best Service we have ever experienced ,"Wow is all we can say.  From the moment our cab pulled up we were greeted with big smiles and wonderful attitudes.  Brought up to our beautiful rooms, they accommodated us with a 9am check in, what a treat after getting off an international flight.  Super cozy beds, great showers, and so many freebies. On the first day the staff had already memorized our names, and some how they know as we are headed down the elevator and have your cab waiting, or whatever else you might need.  

For my sons birthday they made it so special, gave him sparkling juice in the morning to celebrate, a custom cake left in the room in the afternoon (as he has food allergies), and left him and his brother a gift with a card signed from the whole staff in the evening.  Who does stuff like that?!?  

Fantastic breakfast with fantastic service, and a great lounge and location close to public transport round it off.  You would be foolish not to choose this hotel, its a luxury home away from home.",5,2017,03,29
137,Best birthday treat EVER,"I live in London but it's always fun to stay somewhere nice, be treated like a queen and play tourist and that's what my friend did for me.  We stayed here the day after my birthday.  From the moment you arrive, the concierge took over, our bags were taken to our room, we were given complimentary drinks and then also escorted upstairs.  I found a huge fruit basket and birthday cake upon arrival and the staff all wished me a happy birthday.  We unpacked, the room wasn't huge but it wasn't small, it felt cosy, the bed high and comfy and a bathroom filled with Penhaligon products.
He had booked an afternoon tea in the salon, which is where we went next, it was very nice and the salon itself was lovely, I suppose it could feel crowded if completely full but there were only 2 other couples there that day.  In the salon itself, there are lots of 'nibble's even a fridge with ice-cream which you can help yourself too throughout your stay.
We then headed out for a walk/show and dinner then on our return, he had booked a massage in our room for me.
He excused himself to the salon and I was treated to a massage in my bedroom after which I was totally relaxed and promptly fell asleep.
Breakfast is also in the salon and delicious as expected.  After a leisurely time, we then gathered our belongings and ordered a taxi home (with all my presents and balloons)
It was truly an outstanding experience and one I hope to be able to repeat or treat someone to one day.
If you want to feel pampered and looked after on a more personal level rather than a big impersonal hotel, then this is for you.",5,2017,03,28
137,Wonderful Experience ,"This is the best hotel ever the only hotel where at the end of your break you simply do not want to go home! 
I took my daughter Heather for her Birthday as we had tickets for Harry Potter. It is not the first time I have stayed now it is my favourite place. 
Everything is superb and consistent on every visit. From the soothing champagne arrival just what you need after the travelling to all the little things they suggest and do through out your stay . I had organised a few birthday surprises a cake made in house, balloons & flowers everything was presented beautifully as requested with great thanks to Flo.
From suggesting restaurants, receiving shopping, and organising taxis so very helpful nothing is too trivial for them the attention to detail spot on. The food is lovely very tasty, and they can tweak things to your own personal requests. Had cakes and fruit in our room as well. Then there is the Pantry and all of the tasty bits and bobs,never mind Chefs special nightly dish. The lounge itself is luxurious but comfortable. Don't waste your money staying in the Ritz or Savoy or any other fancy hotel in London stay in the best unique and most Luxurious Hotel 41 with the best staff in the country. Mrs Parker & Heather  ",5,2017,03,28
137,An excellent stay at this boutique hotel in the heart of London.,"The small hotel of only thirty rooms is perfect in my opinion. You enter on the ground floor where a receptionist buzzes you in and are taken to the fifth floor for check-in at the concierge desk. We were told to leave our luggage downstairs and were greeted by name when we arrived upstairs. We sat at the desk and were served our choice of champagnes. We were checked in quickly and brought to our room with our luggage already waiting. The rooms was spacious and well appointed. The bathroom was fine, perhaps a little small with a tub/shower combo. We were only there for 3 nights and spent our 2 full days sightseeing away from the hotel. We had continental breakfast the first morning and it and the service were excellent. When we asked for directions to a specific pub for dinner one day, the concierge quickly printed out a walking map and by the time we got downstairs, the receptionist was at the door pointing the way. Evenings in the lounge are the best. With lower lighting and soft music, the staff will serve your favorite beverage while you get nibbles from a buffet of hot and cold snacks. After being busy all day it was a perfect end to our days. We did have laundry done and our only snag was not having all of our items returned. When I told the concierge, however, she went down to the laundry room herself and got the forgotten items within minutes. Overall, a tremendous property and great staff.",5,2017,03,27
137,This Place Will Ruin You,"I booked this hotel because it looked cool in a picture, seriously, it's not the smartest way to book a hotel. I probably did look at its ratings but I didn't put much thought into it.  Wow, did I luck out! We arrived 3 hours before check in to a champagne toast in a lounge after we were escorted in by the lobby manager. The Lounge is set up like a library in a beautiful mansion with tables and settees that are set with beautiful linens. It boasts a snack area that is stocked 24x7 with chips, ice cream, beverages, and snacks. At night they provide ""light"" fare but you probably could call it a light dinner and not go out.  The morning breakfast is in the same room and all service is impeccable and formal without being stuffy.  We came to our room the first night after dinner to find candles and rose petals throughout the room, slippers by the bed, a quote of the day and suggestions on what to do in the morning.  There was even a lavender spray for the pillow and water on each nightstand.  I should have had a clue when the day before my stay they gave me a list of potential items i could request free of charge for my room which included a humidifier, neck pillows, an exercise bike, yoga mat, and more. There is also an espresso machine on the desk, two showers, toothbrushes in the bathroom, a whatever/whenever button on the phone.  The owner of this hotel has a mantra she runs her hotels by, ""No request is too large, no detail is too small."". This is evident in the way every single person treats their guests. Come her, you will never regret it.",5,2017,03,25
137,Loved it!,Look no further for a wonderful place to lay your head after spending the day in a beautiful and lively city!  Service is impeccable and they are truly happy to help you with anything you need. There were nightly gifts on our bed which was a wonderful touch welcoming us back from a long day being tourists. And as mentioned many times in posts the nightly Plunder the Pantry was a highlight of our day.  Relaxing by the fire in a comfy chair reviewing our day with snacks and beverage of choice. Buckingham palace is right across the street and we were delighted one morning to see the horse and carriages come out for a little walk around.  Also there's a pub across the street where we met locals who loved to chat and a little diner style eatery where we ate most mornings before heading to our next tourist destination.  Victoria Station is 2 blocks away from Hotel 41 if you need the tube.  The concierge helped us navigate until we became tube experts. The room was beautiful with everything you need to be comfortable and have a good nights sleep.  Sometimes too comfortable where we slept the morning away.  Dont miss out on Hotel 41!!,5,2017,03,25
137,Early birthday trip,"Booked this hotel as an early birthday treat, glass of champagne whilst you check in all the staff were amazing attentive without being intrusive,  our room was lovely they left two cup cakes and a card and that night rose petals on the bedside table the turn down service is lovely little gift each night left on the bed which I have to say was huge and very cosy, beautiful breakfast, lots of nice choices very fresh .they do dried fruits, nuts, crisps, popcorn, ice cream scones mid afternoon all free through the day then in the evening they do 'plunder the pantry' cold meats, cheese, little desserts and a hot dish. As I said the staff make this place delightful Steve was charming as was the young man from South Africa and all the girls were dressed extremely smart couldn't do enough during our stay will defiantly be back thank you all ",5,2017,03,24
137,Perfection,"How do you define perfection? Well, the beautifully located Hotel 41 in the heart of London comes to mind. This is my daughter and my second stay at the Hotel 41 and to be perfectly honest, I would never stay anywhere else while visiting one of my favorite cities. From our warm reception upon arrival to our final good-byes and all the cherished moments in-between the entire staff helped to create our home away from home. Each mornig heading out after breakfast and armed with travel advice and snacks, it was always a pleasure to return ""home"" after an exciting day to share experiences with the staff who were genuinely interested in our stories. Plunder the Pantry was a brilliant offering and each evening my daughter and I would meet to take part in all the delicious goodies. I will never forget the Harry Potter treat left in our room after returning from the theatre or how Mitchell and others magically produced the Harry Potter DVD's complete with popcorn - so thoughtful. I will not soon forget how Nicole went out of her way to check my train tickets and inquire about riding in Hyde Park or how Mr. Hendry made sure that our breakfast was taken care of not to mention Steve and Dominic who always charmed and contributed to the welcoming atmosphere So even though this hotel's rooms are beautiful, its beds the most comfortable, the food delicious and the Executive Lounge luxurious...perhaps perfection can best be defined in terms of the Hotel 41 staff...special people like Flo, Marlen, Lauren, Andrew, Edgar and a host of others who made all the difference in our stay. Thank you, all. We will return!",5,2017,03,23
137,Absolutely fabulous,"Lost for words really. Everything about 41 was wonderful, the service was excellent and the staff so friendly and obliging. The food was great,surroundings beautiful and rooms couldn't have been better. Every little detail had been thought of and we can't wait to treat ourselves to another visit.

137,Excellent Service,"they offered a coffee and a bag of something that we had to bring with us. like everyone the service is very simply and all. I am with my friends when we go here, my friend occupied a one bedroom to all of us. this place is very luxury but it is worth it.",4,2017,03,22
137,more than 5 star,"Wow- from the moment we arrived we were treated like Royalty. extremely polite and friendly staff. We have over the years stayed in some Fabulous hotels ( Cape Grace SA. Savoy London,+++) none of them go that extra mile that 41 goes to. nothing was too much trouble, we required an ice bucket, 2 minutes later it arrived. needed a reservation for dinner- sorted . The car was looked after very well(Valet Parking) 
The stay was for my Birthday and there was a cake waiting for us in the room and Birthday wishes from the staff.I cannot recommend this Hotel highly enough 6 stars would not be enough, we chose the Hotel because of the Trip Advisor reviews and it turned out to be a very good decision. 
A huge thank you to all the staff who made our stay probably the best stay that we have had in London, well done everyone, hope we can stay again sometime.",5,2017,03,21
137,The ratings should go up to 6 for this place,"I'm fully aware that this may sound like another gushing review and one must think they put something in the drinks at Hotel 41, but whatever it is I'll gladly have more. You never quite know how good service can be until you stay here. First, we were immediately upgraded to a nicer suite. There was a lovely fireplace and a little lounge space with champagne on arrival, a huge bed and fantastic bathroom with a bath and superb shower and all the little extras I wouldn't even have thought to ask for! The executive lounge is where it all happens, whether relaxing in front of the fireplace or under the astounding globe centrepiece, we were treated like old friends. They seem to have struck the perfect balance between being friendly and utterly attentive without being intrusive. Whiling away the afternoon with tea and scones or champagne and their impressive help-yourself pantry of snacks or cooked dinner was a delight, and Steve Jones was an absolute treasure, it felt as comfortable as chatting to my favourite uncle without feeling awkward when he topped up my drink or brought some food over. All of the staff went out of their way to make sure that our trip was perfect and you could tell that they genuinely enjoyed working there and bringing you as much joy as they could. We even had the pleasure of meeting Bea Tollman herself, who was happy to sign her lovely book for us. Yes, its luxury hotel prices and the drinks aren't cheap, but this is truly a special place and something which we will always cherish. Thank you to everyone at Hotel 41.",5,2017,03,20
137,Amazing service ,"Like everyone has alluded to, the service here is simply second to none. From emailing us before our arrival in London to our check out, when we were offered coffee and a bag of treats to bring with us, everything was carefully thought out and seamless. The hotel even gave us some really surprising gifts when they learned that we were celebrating my finishing cancer treatment for the trip. We enjoyed the food at the lounge every evening; it was simply such a classy place to relax after a day. This place was a bit of a splurge for our price range but was definitely worth every cent! ",5,2017,03,19
137,A Definite 5 Star!,"Everything about Hotel 41 was perfection! My husband and I felt like royalty from start to finish. The staff and service were impeccable! The atmosphere was warm and friendly. Each day began with a lovely breakfast and helpful suggestions for making the most of our outings. The staff was extremely knowledgeable. Each evening we returned to our room to find the fire going, candlelight and rose petals!  We wanted to pack up the hotel and staff and transport them to Paris for the next leg of our journey. Hotel 41 is our new favorite place. We are forever spoiled and cannot wait to return!",5,2017,03,19
137,Impeccable service!,"The hotel is small in size, but the service is second to none. From the moment we arrived at the hotel until our bags were loaded into the taxi after checkout, every staff member went the extra mile to make our stay feel special.
The attention to detail that is provided by this hotel was spectacular. I am certain that, next time in London, this is the first hotel I will book for my stay.
Besides the service, the hotel is centrally located and accessible to may attractions.",5,2017,03,18
137,Great Experience,We stayed there for 3 nights. My family thought the place was the best. We loved the family atmosphere and the view from the top floor was amazing. The food was also great. We particularly liked the pizza served in the main restaurant.,5,2017,03,18
137,Simply the Best!,Everything from check in to checkout was amazing. Malcolm and his team (especially Andrew and Lauren) made sure that i felt like family and never wanted for anything... a rose on international women's day was a nice touch :) Bottom line is that if you want to be spoiled... stay here!,5,2017,03,17
137,Work trip with a tourist weekend in between,"This property lives up to the hype.  My first impression of the service was excellent.  I flew into London early on a Friday morning.  I had a work meeting and was able to drop my bags at the hotel, use a room to freshen up and change and then proceed to my meeting.  My room and luggage was all set when I returned in the late afternoon.  The service here sets the place apart.  I met my college age son in London for a Chelsea match over the weekend.  The staff put Chelsea jerseys in our room for fun.  Very nice touch!  All of the staff are attentive without being meddling.  The executive lounge is lovely and comfortable.  The rooms and bath facilities are excellent.  I will definitely visit again.",5,2017,03,17
137,Lives up to the hype in every way.,"I've been lucky enough to stay at some amazing hotels in amazing cities all over the world. Offhand, I can't think of any experience that matches a stay at Hotel 41. The level of service is truly impeccable. The rooms are gorgeous. I spent two nights in a two-floor suite, which was deeply luxurious. Looking forward to my next opportunity to stay.",5,2017,03,17
137,Special afternoon tea,"A huge thank you to Flo, Andrew and Lauren for arranging, and allowing me, to bring my friend Diane to celebrate her special birthday. She felt right at home and loved every minute. 41 is unique and goes out its way to accommodate you and fulfil your wishes. My second home!",5,2017,03,15
137,Superlative,"My wife and I stayed for two nights for her 40th birthday surprise weekend trip away.On arrival we made very welcome and received a complimentary glass of champagne,we were informed about the complimentary treats that are served in the Executive lounge all day long.To make the stay even more spectacular we were upgraded to the Conservatory Suite(pure luxury),if the hotel can make your stay even more remarkable they will endeavour too.Complimentary champagne served for breakfast on the day of my wife's birthday,a birthday cake at night in the room,top restaurant and spa treatment booked by the hotel,it all add's up.Its the small things from getting direction's,seeking advice on excursion's and talking in general they do well.The breakfast's were superb with a wide variety to choose from.Simply put, the staff enhanced and transformed our stay,something we will never forget.A special mention to Andrew the Scottish guy,he was extremely friendly,always willing to talk,share and obtain information,hats off to you.",5,2017,03,14
137,W-O-W!,"What an experience!  The hotel is beautiful, and the location is prime - but what really sets Hotel 41 apart is the staff.  Every single person we encountered had as their prime objective to make sure that our needs were met.  From the welcome meeting and glass of champagne on arrival, to the complimentary canapes with our cocktails (and ever-present array of snacks and treats in the Executive Lounge) -- not to mention the candlelight and rose petals that greeted us when we returned to our room late at night -- we were pampered (OK, spoiled) for our entire stay.  I can't imagine staying anywhere else!!",5,2017,03,13
137,Best Service!,"The Hotel 41 is a unique and wonderful experience. It has a very good service and the hotel it self is in a very well condition. I would defintily cone again and recommend this hotel to friends. 
It is very close to the Buckingham Palance, just 8 min ago. Also you can get from there to Hyde Park and easily to Westminster Abby. Restaurants are close by. You have a great selection of complementary food and water. Only the wifi didnt work as easily, but i was out all the time, so didnt need it as much. ",5,2017,03,13
137,Greatest boutique hotel experience in London by far!,My partner and I traveled to London for a few nights and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Hotel 41. The property was centrally located near Victoria on Buckingham Palace Road. We were greeted with champagne upon arrival and the staff took the extra effort to get to know us and our plans for our brief stay. We very much enjoyed our English breakfast each morning and canapes in the evening. We were also greeted with a thoughtful congratulatory cake and card in our room to celebrate our recent engagement. We will refer all of our friends to 41 in the future! Many thanks! - Brian Safran,5,2017,03,12
137,Great location... Unparalleled Service.,"The location is fantastic.  We love to walk around London.  Being across the street from the side of Buckingham Palace you are in the center of it all.  The service... well, it beats the location !   The best we have ever enjoy in our many visits to London.  Our room was well furnished, cozy.  The executive lounge a work of art, with exquisite offerings and impecable, friendly service.  A true Gem !",5,2017,03,12
137,Perfect weekend destination,"Wow, we had read all the reviews and were not disappointed. Hotel 41 is an amazing place to stay, we were thoroughly spoilt from start to finish, all the staff were so friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. A fantastic experience that we look forward to repeating in the near future.",5,2017,03,12
137,By Far the Best Boutique Experience in the World!,"If you are looking for out of this world personalized service, it does not get better than this.  My husband and I travel all over the world for work and pleasure.  We decided on Hotel 41 for a personal trip to London over Spring Break after reading excellent Trip Advisor reviews.  The reviews don't even come close to how magnificent this place is.  Before we arrived in London, the hotel sent us a special list of ""wish"" items to fill out so that they could properly prepare our room for our arrival.  No detail is too small.  We alerted them that our 11 year old daughter was coming with us on the trip.  When we arrived, every member of the staff knew our name and greeted our daughter like a true VIP.  We had champagne waiting and ice cream for our daughter.  They made up a special bed for her with her own private robe and slippers.  This is a very small hotel, so it is not like anything we are used to as we typically stay in large resort-like hotels with many amenities.  We arrived to be seated at a personal desk to check in.  They have a beautiful lounge where every night one can ""raid the pantry"" for free snacks, can have any drink of choice, and relax by the fireplace.  Every member of the staff personally greeted us by name each time and knew what room we were staying  in.  We never had to ask for anything as our needs were already anticipated, from turn down service to breakfast, to tea and pastries.  We had a plate of fresh fruit in our room each day and each day we were given water and snacks to go on our excursions.  Andrew on staff chatted with our daughter about FC Barcelona futbol matches and was helpful with dinner recommendations and directions.  The service simply is out of this world.  Even at the finest hotels we have not experienced the personalized service we did here.  Simply impressive.  I didn't mention the room, but it was perfect.  We had a two level suite with plenty of privacy and every amenity imagined.  I know whenever I'm in London we will stay here.  Superb!  If you are looking for a very intimate luxury experience, this is definitely it.",5,2017,03,11
137,Second stay... there will be a 3rd hopefully,"Outstanding location... outstanding room, outstanding linen, outstanding staff, outstanding food, outstanding General Manager... Malcolm Hendry.
close to Victoria Station and Buckingham Palace... easy to go for a run in the nearby Green or Hyde Park... there is a reason why this hotel has been voted the best.
",5,2017,03,11
137,Service did not disappoint!,Exactly what I was expected on its take of luxury and service when I took my wife there for her birthday. I recommend spending time there for an afternoon tea. In addition the reception service was always accommodating when we called them.,5,2017,03,09
137,Out of this world,"I'm getting married on the 11th of March and only realised today that I hadn't put up my review for the place I proposed.  My soon to be wife and I stayed at Hotel 41 in December 2015.  It was the perfect proposal location.  The staff were amazing from start to finish.  Always welcoming and polite, nothing was too much to ask.  Our suite was without a doubt the best hotel room I've ever stayed in.  Amazing quality furnishings, technology and accessories.

After some champagne to get my courage up and then more to celebrate we made the most of the Raid the Pantry enjoying the fantastic range of snacks and treats.  The following morning we were greeted and congratulated by more staff before enjoying a delicious breakfast.

When the wedding is done and the honeymoon enjoyed we will definitely be back to Hotel 41, mybe for our 1 year Wedding Anniversary.",5,2017,03,09
137,Exceptional on every level - Just the best experience ever.,"We booked an overnight stay here to celebrate my Birthday, we also booked the Afternoon Tea and the Romantic Turndown Package, I cannot stress enough how perfect everything was at this beautiful romantic hideaway in the heart of the City.
The levels of service and attention to detail were second to none.  We had Champagne on arrival, we had been upgraded as a special treat for my Birthday into a stunning two storey suite.  We were greeted with fresh fruit and a Birthday Cake together with a bottle of Champagne and chocolates which had been arranged by our Daughter as a surprise.  Everything was just perfect.  Our Afternoon Tea was exquisite, everything was so fresh and perfectly arranged. The scones were warm and the orange ones were a work of genius. The cake selection was superb and the sandwich selection worked really well, they also kindly made us fresh beef sandwiches without the horseradish as neither of us like it.  Finally we were defeated and unable to move such was the loveliness and enormity of this Tea.  After our trip to the theatre, we returned to the ""plunder the pantry"" experience, what a fantastic choice awaited us and drinks from the bar, not to mention an ice cream too finished off a perfect day and evening.   We then went to our room which had been transformed with floating tea lights, rose petals, Champagne and Chocolate Dipped Strawberries all waiting for us, just magical.
Breakfast the next morning did not disappoint, complimentary Champagne for my Birthday and lovely choices from the Buffet, we both had fish, smoked haddock and Kippers both perfectly cooked.  We both came away saying that we had never felt so spoiled or special, all the staff really make the stay extra special, we would like to thank them all and will be returning again very soon.",5,2017,03,08
137,London,Awesomeness filled experience dont think a stay can be more delightfull best hospitality best food..😘😘 what to say people serve you with sooooooo much love felt like home especially the stafff is sooo kind nd hardworking..,5,2017,03,08
137,Excellent,I liked this hotel very much! The waiters are cute and nice when you ask for fresh water. Rooms are excellent. I will definitely recommend it to my parents and to my children. Also it is close to the metro station.,5,2017,03,07
137,"Still, Simply the Best","After several years of traveling into London on business, my wife and I continue to appreciate the absolutely amazing personal service we receive at 41. Mr. Hendry, Lauren, Magdalena, and Marlen all raise your experience to levels not experienced anywhere else.  Returning to the hotel each day feels like returning home where Steve is waiting with a welcoming smile and your favorite libation.  The property is small, which allows staff to get to know each guest and provide bespoke care. Each room is unique, and I would suggest you communicate any requirements you might have. The quietness,  attentive service, and luxury are the reason this hotel continues draw us back.  The experience here is unique, and Mrs. Tollman deserves accolades for her new directions in hotel experiences.  My wife reports a woman traveling alone on business would feel extremely comfortable.  The 41 is quite simply, the best!",5,2017,03,05
137,Absolutely stunning,Stayed here for 4 days in London and i was absolutely amazed by how stunning this place is. It was perfectly clean and felt like staying in a palace. Staff were also amazing. Would definitely recommend and would love to stay here again. ,5,2017,03,03
137,Out of this world,"Just back from a Wonderful 3 night stay.  The staff are so Professional and treat everyone with Respect and Care.

Fab..Fab...Fab",5,2017,03,03
137,A little bit of Heaven on Earth,"Just returned from our first visit to the hotel and it was an amazing stay, celebrating my wife's birthday. The special touches made the occasion all the more memorable. It certainly lives up to its reputation. Cannot wait to go back. The Plunder the Pantry is one of the highlights. The service is superb and you are treated as a special guest from the moment you enter the hotel. It is obvious why it has earned all its awards including the recent Forbes 5 Star. The hotel and all the staff deserve such recognition.",5,2017,03,02
137,The most amazing experience,"We booked in to this hotel for my wife's birthday with our miniature daschund and we had the most amazing time. We have stayed in hotels across the world and the service in this hotel is the best we have experienced and they could not do enough for us, the dog (!) or our children who came to visit us as they are at London University / Working. If you are thinking about booking dont hesitate because you will not be disappointed.",5,2017,03,01
137,25th Wedding Anniversary,"I took my wife and Mother and Father in Law to this Hotel. 
There is nothing I can say except this is the best hotel I have evert stated in. The staff were the most polite and graceful people I have ever met. Steve Jones and Michelle to name 2 could not do enough for us.
I cannot give more than 5 stars but I would say it needs 10 ⛤",5,2017,02,28
137,Amazing,"We booked Hotel 41 after reading the amazing reviews on here. Our stay exceeded our expectations beyond belief. For us this trip had been planned for a while and definitely worth the wait. From the moment we stepped through the front door we were treated like we were the only people in the hotel and nothing was a problem. We did not see our cases again until we reached our room, we were offered a choice of different champagne and selection of canapés on checking in. Our room was amazing and the turn down service is very special. We will definitely be returning to this special hotel and will highly recommend hotel 41 to anyone.",5,2017,02,27
137,Incredible service!,"From the time we arrived we were treated like royalty by the staff of Hotel 41. This is a small boutique hotel and the service provided by Patrycja, Andrew, Dominic, Maria and Adele was tremendous. We were pampered from the moment we arrived. We had a small problem with the toilet and for the inconvenience, we were offered breakfast for the week for my wife and I. They arranged great seats for both The Book of Mormon and Wicked on the day of the shows. Every restaurant suggestion was custom tailored to our needs. They sent us a bottle of Vuevre Champagne to our room, just because. After I stopped to thank them for the outstanding week in London, they arranged a transport to the airport free of charge in a Mercedes S-class sedan. I can't say enough about the staff and the service at 41. The reviews are true and I can't wait to stay in one of their properties again. Thank you again to Andrew, Dominic, Adele, Maria, Patrycja! You made our trip second to none",5,2017,02,25
137,Best service,"Hotel 41 was our first stop after our flight from Australia.   Arriving early in the morning after a day flying we were delighted to enjoy a cooked breakfast and then we were shown to our lovely room.   We were continually impressed with all the personalised touches throughout our 2 day stay and thoroughly enjoyed everything about the hotel.  The bed was divine, the decor, beautiful bath and robes all helped make our stay enjoyable.  The service from all staff from the front door to reception and wait staff were all 5 star.  The breakfasts, drinks and snacks available were all delicious.  The location was also very convenient with plenty to do and see in walking distance. We will definitely stay again.  We can confirm that the fabulous reviews are well deserved. ",5,2017,02,25
137,Top weekend,My wife and I spent the weekend here. Outstanding location and even better staff and food. Nothing was any trouble and all the staff was friendly towards us. Even got a member of staff to come on a run with me. Couldn't of ask for more. ,5,2017,02,22
137,Extraordinary,"Our annual business trip to London turned into to an exceptionally comfortable, low-key and ""warm"" experience thanks to the extraordinary staff and five-star-service every member provided at Hotel 41. 

First and foremost, the hotel couldn't be located at a better location for travel as it's located a few quick minutes from Victoria Station. In terms of walking, restaurants and landmarks abound - all within a few quick minutes distance.

We booked a split level suite for our trip and the designed served several purposes. First, we had a separate space downstairs with a cozy couch, warm fireplace and small table - which was replenished daily with a bowl of delicious fresh fruit.

The second level was a spacious bedroom with lovely windows, a large and comfortable bed, and extra large closed and gorgeous bathroom (complete with a bathtub perfect for soaking with your favorite book). High-end amenities were provided and the warming rack for the towels was greatly appreciated.

From a business perspective, my husband was able to have clothing sent in / out for dry cleaning and laundering, his shoes were shined and a freshly made macchiato coffee was delivered every morning within minutes of his wake-up call. 

The Executive Lounge was a great place to unwind after a long day. There was always delicious and fresh fare and service with a smile. One afternoon my three-year-old cousin joined us for coffee and she was spoiled by the staff, she loved the warm cookies and was especially enamored by the ""treat"" bag she was given as a going away gift for her visit. My only regret is that we didn't utilize the space more...

Hotel 41 is full of surprises and when it comes to love, it is well and truly in the details. Each evening's turn-down was an event in your day that became easy to look forward to, I will not ruin the surprises for others but the roses and candles were one of my favorites. Going to sleep every evening with a warm water bottle in the bed chased away the winter blues and added a lovely touch of ""home"" to our stay. 

We enjoyed a lovely farewell ""cake"" and keepsake gift our final evening, with a card signed by each member of the Hotel 41 team. You are a class act, indeed.",5,2017,02,21
137,It's Everything They Say,"My husband and I stayed a few nights at Hotel 41 in early November to celebrate our anniversary.  Given the reviews, hotel website and price, we were expecting nothing less than excellence - and that is what we received.  I think what impressed us the most was how comfortable the hotel and experience was.  There is a thing as being doted on too much and the staff at Hotel 41 know exactly the right balance.  Each night we sat by the fire for at least an hour to wind down, have a drink and think about the day that we had and what was on tap for the next day.  The staff came by to chat a bit but also gave us space to enjoy our evening.  I also think that this hotel, while very expensive, is a good value.  The stay includes the ""plunder the pantry"" and snacks to take on your daily outings among other amenities.  This was a splurge for us but we also considered it as part of our London experience.  We are happy that we did.",5,2017,02,21
137,Incredible value highly recommended ,"We stay for two day only but we're sure next time we will come back to stay here, room so comfortable with all of facilities you gonna need... Nothing bad to say. Staff very kind on reception they try to speak even in our language.. Was and amazing time hopefully we could come back soon. ",5,2017,02,21
137,2 night anniversary break,"What can i say this hotel is nothing short of perfect, myself and my husband had a 2 night stay to celebrate our wedding anniversary and from the moment we arrived we loved the place. Every member of staff was so friendly which to us made the stay even better. The room was lovely,and the little extras are a delightful surprise. The executive loung where we had breakfast each morning is so relaxing and the breakfast and evening meal we had here was the best I have had in a while. Will definitely be returning.",5,2017,02,19
137,Beyond Excellent ,"I booked this hotel for my mother's birthday as I saw a newspaper article on it a while back. She loves luxury hotels and it can be difficult to impress her, but she told me that it was the best hotel she has ever stayed in. 

I booked the king room and it was really nice and spacious and even had a fire place, they left a little birthday cake for her too (it was very tasty) all of the staff are really knowledgable and friendly. My mother loved it so much she wants to go again, maybe I'll book it for her next birthday too. I'll probably get my dad to go with her instead of me as it is a nice hotel for couples. 

Thank you for our stay, my mum loved and she wishes TripAdvisor had more than 5 stars. 'Beyond excellent' in her words thanks again. ",5,2017,02,18
137,Simply outstanding.,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 for my birthday treat, and a treat it was. The actual hotel is located on the 5th floor of Rubens at the palace. It's a beautiful building with a striking 350 square meter living side wall. As soon as we entered the hotel the  level of service was outstanding. As we sat down at the grand check in desk, in the beautiful executive lounge, it was explained that it is tradition to have a glass of champagne and the only difficult decision was pink or white! After checking in we decided to finish our drink in front of the roaring fire and admired the amazing room. The complimentary snacks on offer are exceptional, sweets, popcorn, chocolate, olives etc and a fridge full of ice cream. Our room was lovely, we opted for an executive king. We had a complimentary bowl of fresh fruit and bottles of water in our room, which was a lovely touch. We were located at the back of the hotel and didn't hear one bit of noise the whole time we were there. This has to be the cleanest hotel we have ever stayed in. The room was spotless and everything was to the highest of quality, even the toiletries. We had cocktails in the lounge around 6pm and were served complimentary canapés, which were delicious. They had even made dairy free ones for me, as I had pre warned them of my intolerance. After dinner we returned to our room and the candles were lit with classical music playing, and his and her slippers placed either side of the bed. Then in the bed was a hot water bottle, this was lovely as it was a chilly evening. The bed was enormous and super comfy. We decided to order breakfast to our room. The choice is outstanding and kept us going all day. The staff that brought it to our room were fabulous and explained everything they had as they laid out our breakfast. Nothing is too much trouble here, which is obvious by the 'whatever whenever ' button on the phone in your room. This hotel is another level, it's just amazing from start to finish. If your looking for luxury with really lovely staff then this is the hotel for you. You will not be disappointed.",5,2017,02,17
137,Top notch boutique hotel,"Just stayed for 6 nights. This hotel is all about service. They pamper you from the minute you arrive. I can not say enough about the level of service. I did not want to leave. The staff is great but I must give extra compliments to Adele. A couple of negatives- room 4107 shares a wall with the housekeeping closet. There were loud banging noises at times. This can be somewhat annoying when you want to relax after a long trip or day of sightseeing. It seemed to happen first thing in the morning and throughout the day. With that being said it would absolutely not deter me from coming back. And if you are accustomed to a ""rainshower"" type shower then I would suggest requesting that up front. Our first room had a shower nozzle that was hand held. Not what I'm used to and may not be an issue if you plan on taking a bath and not a shower. This was a girls trip and I can't wait to come back with my family. ",5,2017,02,17
137,Great location,Its in a good location hotel yeah deffo u can find more cheap hotels around but that one is good we realy enjoyed our stay its a big and very confortable hotel. Theres good staff working here we will be back x,5,2017,02,14

137,Hard to beat...,"Superb boutique hotel. Great location. Super-attentive staff. Comfortable and true luxury accommodations. Personalized service. Superb 24/7 ""private library"" for snacks, tea, drinks, relaxing. More appropriate for adults, i.e., not necessarily kids-friendly. Not glitzy, but you will feel at home in the heart of one of the world's great cities. Can't recommend more highly.",5,2017,02,11
137,My genius loci. It was a dream.,"restored with an amazing taste, a black and white suite , a cosiness that only in such genius loci hotels in London you can find. This place is a Life experience. You should try it at least once in a lifetime . And enjoy",5,2017,02,10
137,Out of this world ,"We this was our third visit to hotel 41 and I can honestly say this place gets better every stay. We had an upgrade to an executive suite. All the staff were amazing. We couldn't fault anything. I had the best surprise of my life when my partner proposed to me at the ritz. He had arranged everything himself with the help of the staff at the hotel. We then had a congratulations cake and champagne breakfast it was truly amazing. We had little gifts in our room each nite when we had a turndown and special thanks to Dominic and andrew. We were lucky enough to meet Malcolm the manager just to say what a great hotel he has and thanks for all his help. The staff go the extra mile and have always got time to speak to you and assist you in any way. 
Looking forward to our next visit ",5,2017,02,10
137,Birthday trip,"We stayed at Hotel 41 in the King Executive Suite through Costco Travel for five nights.  I have to say we were pampered.  The room was very clean and very well appointed. The staff left fruit and treats everyday in the room. We had a king size bed and a down duvet.  We used the pillow menu to order a body pillow and other pillows.  We slept very well.  Our room had a Nespresso maker and a tea kettle.  The hotel breakfasts were delicious and we also tried the full tea, which was also very tasty.  All the staff were wonderful and very accommodating.  They took care of our dinner reservations, cabs, shows, etc..  Hotel 41 is right across the street from Buckingham Palace.  Just a five minute walk to the Changing of the Guards.  The Hotel is about a ten minute walk to West Minster Abbey and fifteen minute walk to the London Eye.   Hotel 41 is a very small boutique hotel, so some cab drivers could not find it, so we gave them the name of the other hotel near it.   They do provide a pass to the gym which is nearby, but we did not use it since we were walking so much.  I would definitely stay again and highly recommend!",5,2017,02,09
137,3rd visit.... still surprising us!,"Stayed here recently with my partner for 3 nights. I was planning to propose at the ritz and Adele  helped me organise a romantic turndown after we got in from the ritz. The next morning we had a champaign breakfast and a nice celebration cake was presented to us!
The hotel is perfect in every way. We had a room upgrade that was perfect.. turndown every night with a little gift left on your pillow. Fresh fruit in the room daily. The lounge area is perfect to relax and have a drink.. they make a great cocktail! 
The snacks are perfect throughout the day! The breakfasts here are out of this world! Perfect!
We even got to catch up with Andrew on our last day, we saw him on our previous 2 stays and he's always got time for a chat with the guests. 
I cannot wait to return for our 4th visit in the future. 
",5,2017,02,09
137,would definitely visit again,"The Hotel 41 not only lives up to it's five star rating, but in our opinion exceeded that! The staff was warm, cordial, and exceedingly helpful. The staff treated us like family. The restaurant was elegant and the food was exceptional. Our room had many amenities, was fastidious, and nicely decorated. This is a hotel we would definitely visit again.",5,2017,02,08
137,Hotel 41,"This is without doubt a superb hotel the very best.Took my wife here  for our anniversary, staff couldn't have been more attentive room was brilliant will be booking again soon.lovely and central Buckingham palace over the road Chelsea not far away well within walking distance. Oxford street short walk shops are something else.Stunning.",5,2017,02,07
137,Incredible hotel stay!,"My daughter and I returned from a trip to Paris and London this past week and the Hotel 41 in London was an incredible highlight.  It would be difficult to overstate the elegance, service, friendliness, extra touches... that the staff put into our experience.  We stayed 4 nights and after day-long excursions each day we found delight in returning to the lounge/library area every evening for a drink and snacks.  The staff were welcoming, knew us by name immediately and took great care of us.  The room was lovely and the turn-down service each evening was beautiful, with small treats and notes for the following day.  On our last evening we went to the Harry Potter play , which they knew about, and they celebrated our magical outing with a plate of 2 cupcakes commemorating the special time we had upon our return.  We were absolutely spoiled and loved every minute!",5,2017,02,06
137,Ok hotel with very smal rooms,"We stayed here for 3 nights and the location is great, The hotel is nice but the rooms where way to smal for the price!!!
The staff was not that great!
Would maybe come back if the price was very low...",3,2017,02,05
137,Simply Outstanding,"The staff at Hotel 41 are always excellent, they are kind, friendly, professional, polite and just can't do enough for you, but they're not overbearing and don't make you feel uncomfortable at all. In fact they all make you feel so welcome it's like having a home from home. The rooms are excellent, very tastefully decorated and well maintained. The Executive Lounge is comfortable and inviting with a warm atmosphere. We went for a special occasion and Lauren and Stefan made it a trip to remember, they were brilliant.",5,2017,02,04
137,"Love this Hotel - Staff Fabulous, Food Fabulous, overall Fabulous",I stayed here with my husband and i can honestly our visit was perfect.  To say the staff were welcoming and professional is an understatement.  The beautiful room was ready when we checked in (at 12 noon!) which was a bonus. We headed out to the shops and on our return we were delighted to see a bottle of wine in our room - just right to start our evening.  We had a drink in the cozy bar when we returned and again the service was amazing.  I didnt want to go home and will definately be back - Thank you to all!,5,2017,02,03
137,Good place to stay ,Hotel 41 is a good modern hotel with all the necessary items in the room. We stayed there for 4 nights and had a awesome experience. Neat and clean city. Must visit if your budget is above 5 lakhs for enjoying and exploring the city.,4,2017,02,02
137,Home from Home - only better,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights last week.  We enjoyed every minute of it.  Room was wonderful with fire burning and even a hot water bottle in the bed in the evening (not seen one of those since my boarding school days).
The lounge was wonderful, great snacks and great service.  Breakfast was also good.
Staff friendly and seemed genuinely interested in hearing how our day went, if we wanted a taxi etc. etc.
Had a guest visiting Friday evening - he was also very impressed.  Enjoyed a gin and tonic in the lounge - so cozy.
The location of the hotel is also great.  As we didnt have our lazy children with us we could walk into town - every day - past Buckingham Palace and then either through Green Park or down The Mall.  Perfect.
Definately better than home - I dont provide half the service we got at Hotel 41.
We are looking forward to our next visit.",5,2017,01,30
137,very very nice hotel,"We could'.nt say more then people have to say. That the staff was very friendly and very nice with us.  We enjoyed every moment ant the location was important for us.  The bedroom was very clean and comfortable.

Stayed in november. we will be back for sure",5,2017,01,29
137,Consistently superb!,"This was our 5th Christmas at 41, and yet again it was an absolute pleasure.  Florent and Lauren, as always, are exceptional and go out of their way to make us feel like family returning home for the holidays.  Their absolute professionalism, personal touches, sense of fun and genuine care for their guests is what keeps us coming back, again and again!

Every member of the team at 41 is involved with making the whole experience so special.  From those we met in passing while walking through the corridors  to those who served us our breakfast every day and our drinks every night. Everyone we met during our stay showed the same level of care and attention to detail which is what we feel sets 41 apart from other luxury hotels.

It's the little things they do during your stay that make you feel special and remind you that it’s not a large faceless hotel chain but an intimate, friendly and truly customer focused team who take the time to really get to know their guests and to remember what’s important to them.

It’s also lovely to see the same faces each time we return and it proves that as a company Red Carnation must also care about the people who work for them just as much as they do their guests to ensure they retain their expertise with the amount of competition in a city like London.  

We've booked again for June and are counting the days!",5,2017,01,29
137,Amazing Experience ,"Thank you to the staff at Hotel 41!  They could not do enough for us from the smallest tasks to the largest. They made my daughter and I feel at home and welcomed. The executive lounge was lovely and the breakfasts amazing. The rooms could not have been cleaner. The bed was large and comfortable with perfect feather pillows and the down comforters kept us toasty warm. The fire place was definitely put to good use and made the room very cozy and inviting. The staff made a point to ask what we had planned for the day and always followed up (remembering where we went) and asking how we found it. We spent 5 nights at Hotel 41 and could not wait to get back after a long day of sight seeing or a night at the theater. The small lobby that you enter has a staff member there, greeting us or asking if we wanted water, fruit, a sweet or something hot to drink before leaving with printed directions to our next museum or restaurant. Very helpful. Our room 4105 was quite and looked out over the Royal Mews. I hope to return. ",5,2017,01,27
137,Absolutely fantastic ambiance!,I enjoyed my stay while in London. The room was everything I had hoped for and I was  completely satisfied with the room service. The staff are friendly and efficient coupled with the luxurious surrounding being top in its league. Highly recommended!,5,2017,01,26
137,Room was beautiful and was great value for money,"Staff were welcoming from when we arrived until we departed and the room was an escape from the world, would recommend this accommodation to all of my friends and 
Family 5 * quality A definite must have experience",5,2017,01,26
137,Very nice!,"We really loved this hotel. Our bed was super comfortable, room was clean and hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. I can recommend this hotel for everyone. You really made our holiday. Thank you!",4,2017,01,26
137,Just fantastic ,"There's really not much more I can say than others have. This was a treat for my wife's birthday and even though we only stayed one night, we felt like the staff already knew us. 

The executive lounge is lovely, the staff are great, and they even upgraded us for free. Nothing is too much trouble. 

We will be back! ",5,2017,01,26
137,5* +++,"Best service in a hotel I've experienced. Friendly, efficient, helpful - the list goes on. Faultless. Great room - faultless! Superb location. Welcome reception - superb. Refreshing hot towel & small fruit punch offered. Check out equally as good. Just how a great hotel should be!!",5,2017,01,25
137,FIRST CLASS - CANNOT RECOMMEND HIGHLY ENOUGH,"My husband and I stayed here on Saturday 21st January, the trip to London to see a show and hotel 41 stay was a Christmas gift from our daughters.  I had seen Hotel 41 reviewed in a newspaper last year as being the Number 1 Hotel in London and I am delighted to have experienced it.  Having stayed in many hotels around the world, this has to be the very top of the list.  We checked in early and were thrilled to be given an ""upgrade"" to a junior suite.  A birthday cake and canapés were awaiting us in the room, what a delightful touch.  The Service and attention to details is an absolute credit to the management and staff.  The hotel has a great ambiance and we can't recommend it highly enough.  We are definitely going to stay here again.  Great work Hotel 41, it was a pleasure and a privilege to enjoy your hospitality and First Class Service.",5,2017,01,25
137,Little oasis of calm...with a feel of the ministry of magic!,"From the moment we entered the lobby we were transported into a different world! One where the wellbeing of the customer is a top priority. The staff are so pleasant and friendly without being overbearing or fussy.  The attention to detail is incredible. The room was exquisite and had everything a guest could need (except an emery board...but I'm sure if I had pressed the 'whatever whenever' button one would have magically appeared!) the bed was so comfortable and the room was quiet. 
When looking to book this hotel many reviews talk of the free food available...canapés, the pantry, ice-creams and chocolates... but even without all those treats and goodies the place deserves its no.1 status. 
The breakfast was excellent too. We even got invited back to the lounge hours after checkout, when we called back to collect our luggage. 
Just amazing, we will spread the word and we will return.",5,2017,01,24
137,best hotel ever,I recently had the pleasure of staying for 2 nights and had a wonderful time. The service was incredible. Easily the best hotel I have ever stayed in and cannot wait to return. Thank you to everyone at 41 for such an amazing experience.,5,2017,01,23
137,A Wonderful Place - Heaven On Earth,"Really good time here, situated well allowing us to spend as much time as we like gawking at Buckingham palace. Would highly recommend a stay here.

The rooms are well kept as was the staff, who were ever so friendly and polite. A lovely place.",5,2017,01,23
137,Long Weekend in London,"Spent two nights at what is quite simply the best hotel I have stayed in anywhere in the world.
So what was so special and why will this be our only choice of London hotels in the future.
Location - 5 mins walk from Victoria so ideal for all the sights, Selfridges, Harrods etc.  A short walk to Peggy Porschen, Sloane squ and Kings Road.

Welcome - greeted with champagne on arrival. Relaxed in lounge and then escorted to room when ready. Luggage already there ( nice touch).  

Room - immaculate. Penhaligons toileteries, Sky channels if you fancied a night in.  Tea lights at turn down and a little circle of rose petals last thing at night. Not forgetting the hot water bottle in bed as well.  Very comfortable bed and pillows and lovely robes for lounging.

Foyer - complimentary hot chocolate and nibbles.

Lounge- everyone was so friendly and nothing was any effort.  Lovely champagnes, and nibbles all day and into the night.  I may struggle to persuade myself to leave the hotel on my next visit!
Superb selection of wines especially the South African and highly knowledgable sommeliers.

Breakfast - delicious! Tried the traditional South African sausages - rich and very tasty.  Had to start the day with some champagne - warm toast and lovely loose leave tea.

Finally had to leave😰but departed with a complimentary champagne to go and a luxury soap.

Beats the Gleneagles short bread!!",5,2017,01,23
137,Secret Escape !,"This hotel is a guilty pleasure ! By far the most accommodating hotel you will find so close to Buckingham Palace, The staff go above and beyond to make your stay a memorable experience, nothing is too much trouble, yet it feels so personable almost like a home from home , if you are looking for a secret escape for some R&R with the entertainment that London can iff but a stones throw away this is the one for you.",5,2017,01,22
137,Another great stay at 41,"Just returned from another very enjoyable stay at Hotel 41. We wouldn't think to stay anywhere else in London. Great location, lovely hotel, fantastic staff. Looked after from the moment we arrived, the staff were friendly and professional as always, attending to your every need, providing advice if required. Can't do enough for you. 
Super breakfast, breakfast butty and Eggs Benedict this time complimented with a good quality continental buffet. Canapés in the early evening and butler's pantry to satisfy any later hunger.  Look forward to visiting again soon. ",5,2017,01,22
137,Must stay for top luxury experience,"This is a fabulous intimate boutique hotel in a fantastic location, steps from Buckingham Palace and the Victoria tube. Close walking distance to all the posh shops and restaurants as well as the best sites to see. 

I can't say enough about the staff and hotel itself. Warm, friendly and they call guests by name as soon as they enter the hotel.  Andrew, the guest experience manager, organized the best restaurants in London for us, and planned every last detail, and room details, including, roses, candles, and an anniversary cake for our anniversary. He's just fantastic!
 The room was a king studio decorated perfectly with all the amenities one can imagine. Truly a wonderful experience for those looking for uncompromising quality in the heart of London. I would highly recommend. We could stay anywhere else but the charming hotel and lovely people and attention to exact detail will bring us back.",5,2017,01,21
137,Absolutely excellent place!,"This hotel is a hidden gem.  It is a small hotel located on a main street.  From the minute you walk in you are greeted with a hot chocolate and lots of little treats; sweets, nuts, dried fruit.  In the main lobby there is a buffet cart which is constantly being refilled with a range of snacks from sweets to cold meats to curries.  You could literally stay in the hotel all day and enjoy the range of snacks and treats.  There is also a lovely fireplace which makes sitting in the lounge that bit more special. 

The staff are incredible too, nothing is too much trouble.  They are always there to answer any questions or make suggestions.  The rooms are well presented and the bed is very comfortable. 

It is an excellent hotel and worth a visit.  It may be a little pricey but all the snacks and treats provided as well as the toiletries - Penhaligons make it worth that extra bit!",5,2017,01,18
137,Perfect and Terrific,"If you wanna experience one of the best and terrific London luxury experience you definitely need to go at Hotel 41. Everything is perfect since the first moments and steps you move onto the premises. Excellent service, excellent staff and simply excellent venue right in the middle of the Royal London. You can never be disappointed when booking a stay here. Definitely worth the visit. Priceless.",5,2017,01,18
137,The Best,"Florent and his team have to be the best. The warmest welcome and genuine too; nothing is too much trouble. We choose not to stay anywhere else in London now. We love the attention to detail eg the hot water bottle put in bed for us and fresh fruit in our room. We love ""raid the pantry"" after an evening at the theatre. Why other hotels don't do it is beyond me. The location is perfect. We can't wait for our next visit.",5,2017,01,16
137,There is a reason why we keep coming back! Incredible Hotel!,"This was our third stay at Hotel41. 
My thoughts and words that I've written in my previous reviews haven't changed a bit. 

It's still simply outstanding!

Without repeating much of what I've written in my two previous reviews it's safe to say that my expectations were once again met and well and truly exceeded. It's just such a unique & exciting experience when staying at this Hotel as you become a friend as opposed to another 'number'. The single level devoted to this Hotel keeps everything nice and simple. The guest focused service though I've rarely experienced at other Hotels of this level.

Flo, Magdalena & Steve Jones all deserve a huge thank you for making our stay yet again one to remember! A truly amazing experience.  

You cannot be dissapointed with the level or service when these three are around.",5,2017,01,15
137,Faultless ,"Intimate without ever being intrusive - a very very special place in the heart of London.   Rooms are immaculate with an exceptional attention to detail that I've only seen at the sister hotel (The Milestone) at this price point. The Library Bar (executive lounge) is a superb place to unwind. However, what really sets 41 apart is the team - absolutely faultless and as a result priceless. The nicest, most genuine and caring people you'll meet - Andrew, Florent, Adele, Lauren and the rest of the team are exceptional people. Beatrice Tollman and family have curated an amazing place and group of people. ",5,2017,01,15
137,My First Stay  at 41.  Excellent!,"Having stayed in sister-hotel-next-door The Rubens a couple of times, 41 beckoned as an interesting and special alternative.  I had been spending the festive season with friends and family in Sussex, on leave from my life abroad.  My last night in UK was to be spent celebrating my sister's birthday in London prior to flying out of Heathrow.   I checked in and had a light lunch by the fire in 41's comfortable and welcoming Executive Lounge, together with the very nice offer of a glass of complimentary champagne .  Resting up for the afternoon in a stylish and carefully designed 5 star room, I found everything to be in good working order, all sparkling and clean.   I returned to the Lounge for a pre-party aperitif with superb canapes and croque monsieur.  I chatted to the in-lounge reception and waiting staff, who were interested, smiling, and attentive. They all addressed me by name.  Breakfast next morning was a wonderful spread of high-quality  fruits, cold meats and cheeses, followed by a perfect Full English Breakfast.  I set off to Heathrow very content in the knowledge that I will return to 41 when next I visit London.",5,2017,01,15
137,Classic Style I'd say...would love to return❤️,"Our first visit to London.  Trip Advisor reviews steered us to Hotel 41 to mark our 40th Anniversary.  Was very special indeed.  Our room had a view of the Buckingham Palace Mews (stables).  Small but suitable and a great bath. The ""reception"" area was lovely any time of day..including 3 am when turning your time around.  The young man offered me a pot of tea and we shared conversation.  Upon arrival you are treated to bubbly, but subsequent beverages are on you.  We enjoyed,the breakfast and snacks.  Location is great for seeing the Palace, parks and nice restaurants in Victoria.  For our budget this is a special hotel stay but you desire a nice boutique feel with service....please stay.",5,2017,01,14
137,Most friendly comfortable and luxurious ,"Hotel 41 is our second home in London. We could not ask for more accommodating staff, great location , great atmosphere , comfortable rooms. Perfect. We come back again and again. Breakfast is delicious. If it's not on the menu, they will make it for you. Lots of good restaurant in the area. The staff is excellent in booking restaurant ms for you. ",5,2017,01,12
137,Stunning Hotel & Outstanding Service,"This really is a great hotel very near Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station (District/Circle underground line). The staff are exceptional and cannot do enough to help you regardless of what you need. The rooms are small, but really well decorated and have everything you would expect. The main reception/dinning room is excellent and is a great place to start any evening having a few drinks before heading out. Location wise its great for getting around London and seeing the sites.",5,2017,01,08
137,Royal treatment by psychic staff and Plunder-the-Pantry!,"My wife and I have stayed in many hotels all over the world and, when in London, usually stay at boutique hotels in Mayfair. We had learned of Hotel 41 when staying at a sister hotel, The Chesterfield, where they recommended that we visit Hotel 41 in anticipation of a future visit to London.  Some have been more lavish; however, this is a hotel where the staff carry the day.  The staff-to-guest ratio is probably the highest I have experienced and they seem able to anticipate every need, even communicating guest particulars (eg, activities, questions, preferences) among themselves.  The multinational (and multilingual) staff seemed genuine in their friendliness and sincere in their welcome.  While the hotel is in a fairly busy area, across the street from the Royal Mews, and a couple of blocks from Buckingham Palace in one direction, and Victoria Station in the other, once one was welcomed into the entry foyer, there was a sense of refined enclosure.  Rooms and reception are located on the 5th floor, further isolating one from the street-level activity. Rooms were small but comfortably appointed and the lounge (where the reception is located) is a comfortable space evoking the library of a private club, complete with classical architectural elements and skylight.  There is a ritual titled: ""Plunder the Pantry"" from 8:30 PM - 1:00 AM every evening.  Guests are invited to partake of a lavish spread of meats, cheeses, breads, desserts (including a freezer full of gourmet ice cream), fish, fruits, etc.  In addition, well-versed staff offer a large selection of wines, a number of which are excellent vintages from South Africa (the home country of the Red Carnation family of hotels).  We also enjoyed High Tea in the lounge with a friend, and were barely able to rouse ourselves to visit a portraiture exhibit at the Queen's Gallery, across the street.  The location allows short-walk access to tube stations: the Victoria Line (at Victoria Station) or, by traversing Green Park, the Piccadilly Line. I would not hesitate to stay here again and recommend Hotel 41 to anyone visiting London for the first time or the 50th.",5,2017,01,07
137,Most Romantic Anniversary,"We chose to come back from New Year's in Paris to stay in Hotel 41 for our 20th Anniversary and couldn't be happier.  They consistently outdo themselves with every stay.  We were greeted in our upgraded room with an anniversary cake.  That evening, they lit the fireplace and scattered rose petals and lit candles in our room for turndown.  I should also mention that for our dinner, they got us an 8pm reservation in the most romantic room of a restaurant that some wait months to get (and they did it one week before our trip).  I can't rave about this place enough - we refuse to even consider any other hotel in London.",5,2017,01,07
137,Best Hotel ever,Amazing . Could not fault them at all.Hotel was lovely and presented beautifully. Staff were attentive and went out of their way to make you comfortable and really took care of you. Would definitely return for anther stay.,5,2017,01,07
137,Beautiful hotel,"I stayed at this hotel for the 1st time. It's a good solid spot. The rooms are elegant but they have everything you need. 
The area is great lots of street art, bars and restaurants, 5 min walk to the subway.
The staff are friendly.
Stayed December 2016",5,2017,01,05
137,Absolutely amazing in every way,"This hotel is simply the best!  Its location is incredible, the hotel is beautiful, and the staff is on par with some of the best hotels in the world!  

We stayed over New Year's Eve for four nights, and everything was perfect - The check-in process was fast and pleasant (which was appreciated as we had just gotten off a 11 hour red eye flight from Colorado).  The room was immaculate and ready early - all of our special requests were granted, and the concierge was even able to find us premium theater tickets on short notice.  Within an hour of arrial, we were already beyond pleased.

I could go on for paragraphs - the food/snacks in the lounge were amazing, the bar was incredible, the wines were tasty.  Every one of the staff members was fantastic (special kudos to Stephen, who helped us find some interesting places to check out in the city that we would have never explored on our own) - we just can't say enough!  

We look forward to staying there again in the future!",5,2017,01,05
137,New Years Stay,"This was our second stay at this property. We stayed for two nights in a regular room and then three nights in a Junior Suite. What actually sets this hotel apart really isn't the physical rooms, as admittedly they are quirky (and in the case of the regular room, very small) and unique. It is the level of service that is provided here, which is pretty unmatched to any other hotel we have stayed in all over the world. 

Case in point, they gave us a free bottle of champagne when we checked in to the regular room, but we did not consume it for a few days. The entire time they replaced the ice in the bucket until we actually opened it on the third day we were there. Also, we are a same-sex couple and when they left slipper bags by our bed, on each side it said ""his"" as opposed to ""his"" and ""hers"" and we thought that was an amazing attention to detail.

We can't review the breakfast, as we aren't typically hotel breakfast people and did not order it while we were there, but the remainder of the food we had was tasty.

As some reviewers have stated in the past, this is in the same building as the Reuben's Hotel and is owned by the same hotel company. It is run as a completely separate hotel, however, and you do feel like you are in a small, well-run boutique hotel.",5,2017,01,05
137,Hotel 41 has given me a terrible problem!,"There. That was an attention seeking title, and I'll bet you'll wonder at the 5star rating?

This hotel does service so very well that there are few places that come close, and as a result this means that a search for hotels in other cities can be a trial. 

Our most recent visit to 41 was for a weekend in the run-up to Christmas and,boy, did we 'do' London Christmas. 41 provided a calm and serene oasis away from the madness of the capital whilst being attentive enough to meet all our needs. 

I am continually impressed by the staff and the lack of staff turnover and how we are greeted by name as returning guests. There are lessons in customer service right there. What they do is not difficult or unique but it is hard to find any other place doing it consistently and therein lies the secret.

So. Why do I have a problem? I have a problem because I'd like to visit New York and ideally I want 41 to have a sister hotel there. They don't, and, in any case I think it is the staff and not just the hotel group which makes this place special. 
We'll be back to 41 for sure. ",5,2017,01,05
137,Lovely hotel,"My self and my wife visited hotel 41 for our anniversary the welcome was amazing the staff were so helpful and the hotel was small but very very intimate perfect for us. 

We were upgraded which was very nice and a complimentary bottle of champagne was in our room lovely touch, I would have been happy to give 5 stars but the bar service was not up to scratch our cocktails were not well made and on 2 occasions they didn't have basic ingredients for our drinks, this could have been because we stayed just after the New Year which was a bank holiday and maybe they had run out without a chance to replenish.

Great hotel lovely food great staff thanks to everyone.",4,2017,01,04
137,Believe all the accolades about Hotel 41!,"My husband and I, along with our teenage daughters, have stayed at Hotel 41 three times, and each time is a wonderful revelation.  The rooms are lovely, the staff is gracious and helpful, and the hotel is quiet.  We enjoyed delicious complimentary snacks and appetizers in the lounge before seeing a show--the lounge is a wonderful pre-evening or post-evening place to relax.  The staff each time has ensured that our stay in London was outstanding.  If you think the quality of your hotel experience cannot substantially enhance your vacation enjoyment, you have not been to the Hotel 41.",5,2017,01,04
137,"Great Location, Impeccable staff, Incredible service, Superb treats.","Previous to staying here I could not believe the “Excellent Reviews” on tripadvisor for Hotel 41 could be accurate / truthful. WELL THEY ARE ! ! 
We’re from Lincolnshire,,, We’re cynical,,, We’re sceptical,,, We’re wary,,, We’ve been disillusioned too many times.
If we had not witnessed the excellent service, the pristine cleanliness, the friendliness of ALL the staff, the superb decor, the wonderful facilities with numerous delightful  touches for ourselves we would have never believed such a place could exist. I’ve said for long enough there is a need for somewhere like this, well here it is ! !
Even though Hotel 41 is the number 1 hotel for the whole of London on tripadvisor we never encountered one member of staff or other guest who was snooty, intimidating, plain obnoxious or trying to be clever. We were made to feel completely at ease.
Instead of me going on and on please read all the best parts of the other 2,065 (as of 1/1/2017) excellent reviews to learn what a place this is. We WILL be returning ! !",5,2017,01,04
137,"I Have Been Ruined By Hotel 41!!  (part 1, for part 2 please see Ashford Castle, Cong Ireland)","For the rest of our lives my husband and I will say 'it's no Hotel 41' every time we visit a hotel/inn. Every other place (except the Ashford Castle, Cong Ireland) now seems ill kept and lacking a personal touch.  While I would theoretically love to visit other properties in London, I don't believe we will ever be able to pass up an opportunity to stay at the 41.  We stayed for 5 nights and I could give many examples of why it is special.  One example is our friends checked in and were asked which newspaper they preferred to receive.  Our friend said 'anything with a crossword puzzle'.  The next morning there was a crossword puzzle book tucked into her paper. So thoughtful! During our stay we saw three regular King rooms and all were different but charming. The 'plunder the pantry' was fantastic and a perfect thing for those of us suffering from jet lag. I'm sorry, I don't remember names right now, but we were very impressed by the staff.  I asked for a coffee on my first day and didn't have it again until the last but the person serving me remembered how I liked it!  The cocktails and bar master were fantastic.  We were also impressed that though the rooms were incredibly clean and turndown service was great...I never once saw a cleaning person or a service cart.  How do they do that?  Funny.  Well, in any event...stay at the Hotel 41 but prepare to be disappointed by all other hotels for the rest of your life.",5,2017,01,03
137,Almost Overwhelmingly Excellent,"I must confess that 41 represented a bit of an extravagance for us, but my wife and I wanted a special place in London and 41, of course, is at the top of the list, so we called and luckily got a room in this small, elegant, and luxurious hotel. From the start, we were totally impressed by the service. Nicole at reception not only helped us with the booking but also provided travel tips and helped us get situated. Lauren at check-in was friendly and helpful as well, but the highlight was the champagne served during check-in by the most wonderful Steve, master of the opulent lounge area. Our room was smallish but exceptionally well appointed in black and white and 41 all over, a complementary bottle of Roederer Brut Premier awaiting us. The room was spectacular, really, and the bath as well. The lounge is a major feature of 41, with daily food and drink services available in this cozy room. We did not take full advantage of this amenity but we enjoyed our visits. The commitment to service is apparent in every aspect of the operation, from housekeeping to turn-down to the lounge and concierge service. Frankly, we found ourselves a bit intimidated by the levels of service and luxury but in a very good way. We loved our brief stay at 41 and we are most thankful to Nicole, and Steve, and everyone else for  making our stay so memorable. I do hope we have the opportunity to visit again. This is one experience that proved well worth the extravagance.",5,2017,01,03
137,Luxurious and discreet.,"Our go to hotel in London when we want a quiet stay. The service is flawless from the second you walk in, champagne on entry and free food, drink, ice cream etc for duration of your stay helps make it a memorable one! Its as if the staff are on your shoulder at all times to top your drink up or assist in any request but they manage it without making you feel awkward, almost as if they are invisible until needed! Lounge area is great for a night cap around the fire.",5,2017,01,02
137,Book well in advance. Not a spec of dust,"This hotel is unreal. Everything is posh, clean and clean again. Polished floors, clean windows and friendly staff. Great location, great london prices and definitely a place to unwind by the fire in the big leather chairs with a whiskey and a book. I couldnt fault Hotel 41 ",5,2017,01,02
137,love this place,great rooms and excellent food available throughout the day combined with very helpful staff and extras such as champagne at breakfast and hot water bottles so good we have booked for next year.The executive lounge is a great place to spend a little time and the location of the hotel next to Buckingham Palace is extremely useful,5,2017,01,02
137,Outstanding!,"Stayed for four nights and could not be happier with our choice. Every aspect of the stay was fantastic from the booking through to checkout. To say the service was phenomenal would be an understatement. Each and everyone on the staff at Hotel 41 provided distinctive service with an attention to detail and guest satisfaction. PHENOMENAL is more like it. Highly recommend Hotel 41, especially at the holidays and definitely on New Years Eve!",5,2017,01,02
137,Excellent,"This hotel is more like a private home with butler service and superb chefs at your service 24/7. Rooms are good and fine but nothing special, apart from comfy beds and all the normal five star attributes, but the thing with 41 is the lobby/library section which really feels like your own living room. I will definitely go back again and again.",5,2017,01,01
137,Love love love!,"Staff was phenomenal! It's not often that you get a hotel with such great service! I was here with my hubby for a week, and I fell in love with it! I will most certainly be back in town to visit! Loved it!",5,2016,12,30
137,Christmas at Hotel 41,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for  a 3 night stay over Christmas. I can't imagine having more friendly attentive staff throughout the stay who could not have made us feel for more welcome and special throughout our stay. 
The rooms and lounge were to a exceptional standard. The food and treats on offer in this lounge are the best I have experienced in executive lounges thought out the uk and overseas. We were more than happy to pay for the drinks in the lounge. The lounge is a real chill out area with lovely snacks and a great chess set. Food at the hotel was amazing, the breakfast hash  browns were to die for and our Christmas Day meal of rib of beef was beautiful.
This hotel is a must for anyone wishing to spend a few days in total luxury with such care and attention given from all the staff. This was a Christmas treat for my elderly parents who loved every minute of the whole Christmas package that we had booked. So a huge thank you to all the staff. 

",5,2016,12,28
137,Hotel 41,"A difficult hotel to review without sounding all to gushing.

In the little time I spent at this hotel, unfortunately only a single day and night, has led me to the conclusion that it is without a doubt the single best hotel experience I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing.

From the moment we arrived the service is impeccable and it seems that every care has been taken to make your stay as comfortable as poaaible.

The champagne and canapés on arrival and the subsequent food that is lavished upon you at a moment's notice as well as the overall level of service really do leave you with lasting impression of quality and hospitality that is second to nonw.

The rooms from what I saw are finished to a very high standard and toiletries and accoutrements in the room are of a very high standard.

Overall I could spend all day gushing about this hotel but instead I will simply have to return again and show my appreciation by selfishly enjoying the hotel a second time around 

P.S. If your having a drink they make a mean amaretto sour that I can't recommend highly enough.",5,2016,12,28
137,Essence of British Luxury and Service,"I cannot say enough about how wonderful the service, food and accommodations were for our pre-Christmas trip to London.  Hotel 41 will be our choice on our next trip unless someone can irrefutably prove to us that there is something better in London - a feat not likely to occur.

Service is simply perfect.  Attention to every detail but without undue imposition.
Cleanliness was impeccable - seldom seen at any hotel at any price.
Value for the over-the-top experience was frankly a bargain.

This is a 29 room boutique carved out of the larger Rubens Hotel in the same building but this little gem has its own private entrance and elevator that only goes to the 5th floor where this is located.  One common room impressively comfortable for meals and drinks and conversation.  Some guest rooms have fireplaces.

Be sure to ask for a room that does not have a lowered ceiling.  Our first offered room because of our early arrival was large and well laid out, but my wife felt uncomfortable.  They gave us a selection of rooms being readied and moved us over without fuss, making a potentially uncomfortable matter no matter at all.

Wait until you have the turn down service - I will keep it a surprise but hint - it epitomizes the staff's focus on an uncompromising stay.",5,2016,12,27
137,"I could come to London, never leave Hotel 41 and be happy!","My first stay at Hotel 41 was with my husband on our first trip to London. It was such a delightful experience there was no question where I would stay in London on this trip. This trip was with my daughter (14) and a friend. The hotel arranged a suite to accommodate all of us. The service, food, room and atmosphere were all superb. London was lovely and Hotel 41 'made' the trip for us. The staff was helpful and they knew who we were. Such great care was taken of us. Have tea there, such a treat! Thanks for everything.  ",5,2016,12,26
137,Superb service,"Our first Hotel 41 experience was simply wonderful and exceeded what were already very high expectations. It began even before our stay with support and ideas about possible evening entertainment. Our visit began with a warm welcome by the doorman and some hot chocolate and friendly conversation at the ground floor reception, before an effortless, champagne-pampered check-in on the 5th floor and the wonderful surprise of a suite upgrade. We enjoyed a variety of delicious inclusive food and snacks during the day and had a relaxed evening plundering the pantry in front of the fire in the lounge, before a beautiful romantic turndown and a great night's sleep in a surprisingly quiet room. Our stay concluded with the best full english breakfast I've ever had (highlights were the amazing bacon and hash browns).  All of this pampering was made doubly special by the genuine warmth of every member of the Hotel 41 team who made us feel so welcome during our short stay.  Such apparently effortless excellence takes huge skill and dedication by a team at the top of its game. We can now see why Hotel 41's reputation is so richly deserved and we hope to return soon.",5,2016,12,23
137,Perfection,"Our third time back at Hotel 41 and it was, again, wonderful. From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel so welcome. We were greeted with champagne and although we were very early for check in, the staff still managed to prepare our room, ready for us to settle down straight away. This was our first time staying in a junior suite and it was lovely! We loved the separate living area, the bedroom upstairs and the spacious bathroom. It was sheer perfection. 

After fairly busy days in London, it was lovely to come back to the executive lounge and spend our evenings there. We throroughly enjoyed plundering the pantry and sampling the different drinks on offer. 

The one thing that made this hotel so special were the staff. They were all so attentive and we liked that they enquired about our day and stopped for a chat wherever we were in the hotel. They simply couldn't do enough to make our stay special. With a particular mention to Andrew, Mitchell and the French drinks waitress (we didn't catch her name). 
Thank you for another outstanding stay. We have left feeling completely relaxed but also a little sad that our stay has come to an end. 
See you next year! 
",5,2016,12,22
137,Surprise birthday weekend,"We stayed at Hotel 41 last month for one night as a surprise for my husband's birthday. We had a wonderful time - all of the staff are so friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble. I had mentioned when booking why we were coming and we were surprised to find a delicious and beautiful-looking birthday cake waiting in the room when we arrived. 

The room itself was comfortable and spacious but the fireplace made it feel very cosy. I had ordered the romantic turndown as a surprise when we got back from dinner which was a lovely extra treat.

All of the food at the hotel was very good - I almost wished I hadn't booked dinner as we were too full to plunder the pantry in the evening! Having told a couple of the staff on arrival that we had tickets the following day to see the Harry Potter plays, we were presented with our own Harry Potter cupcakes when we checked out which was a very thoughtful surprise. 

We both had a brilliant visit and can't wait for an excuse to book a return visit- it's worth every penny!",5,2016,12,22
137,Speechless... In a good way!,"Amazing stay. Such a quaint place! Customer service and attention to detail could not be faulted at all. My partner proposed to me in the conservatory suite and it couldn't have been more perfect. He had liaised with the hotel staff who he provided a romantic turndown service. We were even brought a ""congratulations"" cake afterwards! Plundering the pantry was awesome and staff were so friendly. I did struggle without a full length mirror in the room, and the pressure of the jacuzzi bath was very variable and fluctuated. Still, I couldn't have asked for a more special place to get engaged. The icing on the cake was the lovely plant that was delivered to our home today from Hotel 41, congratulating us on our engagement. It's thoughtful and personal touches like this that have made Hotel 41 my favourite place to stay in London. ",5,2016,12,17
137,Short Christmas holiday in London,Our second visit as we just had to return.  Great location to explore central London.  We love the lounge area. Have Steve make you a REAL martini with some great conversation.  This is a very private hotel so very peaceful and elegant.  Not for children in our opinion. When  you finally go to sleep you'll appreciate the wonderful linens and comfortable beds.  great service.   A must try,5,2016,12,16
137,"No better hotel on earth, genuinely!",This Hotel is truly special. The service from the staff is absolutely incredible. They were absolutely amazing from the second we stepped foot in the door to the moment we walked out. You are made to feel like a millionaire and the price of the visit is worth it. Magnificent.,5,2016,12,15
137,Trip ,Amazing trip found this hidden gem the best way by word of mouth. My partner loved it we would definetly return and stay for longer next time. Maybe even a full weekend away with the girls! Great location ,5,2016,12,14
137,Perfection ,"My husband and I stayed at hotel 41 for our 3 year anniversary and we couldn't have asked for a better place to celebrate. Whilst booking they were so helpful allowing us to check in early because we had lunch reservations. Upon arrival they were so friendly and helpful, champagne on check in with nibbles by the fire, so romantic. When we got to our room we had chocolates and a little cake saying 'congratulations' which was so cute. Taxis were all booked for us, they even made sure we had an umbrella because it was raining. The late night buffet was just what we needed after the  Theatre with hot chocolate at the front door too. It was the best place I have ever stayed in. Every customer gets treated like royalty. So caring, generous and helpful. You will not be disappointed with your stay here. We will be back next christmas. Thank you so much hotel 41 for such a lovely couple of days. Happy Christmas.  X",5,2016,12,14
137,Superb ,"Thank you hotel 41 for being attentive whilst providing a personal and professional balance of individual needs, all requirements are catered for without being over bearing.

Staff are outstanding, positive and upbeat and enjoy the task of ensuring all guests are comfortable and enjoying your stay with them.
My husband had a coughing bout which was noted by a member of staff, Dominic suggested hot water, ginger, honey and lemon to soothe his cough. Which was promptly served to our table, this gesture of utter attentiveness goes towards their guests feeling welcomed and cared for.

One note of criticism, which I have not marked the five star to four as it can improve with a little elbow grease (which I have commented directly to the hotel).

All in all I would suggest if you want a warm, quirky and attentive stay welcomed by utterly amazing service and attention to detail from front of house staff. Then this is without question the hotel for you!!!!!!!
",5,2016,12,14
137,FAULTLESS!!!!!,"The attention to detail in this property is amazing. 
Trust the pictures that you see, it is absolutely amazing here. 
The staff, accommodation, everything is completely and utterly brilliant and it can't be praised enough. 

Highly recommended. All the staff were exemplary...",5,2016,12,13
137,Amazing ,"Absolutely amazing hotel and staff. Couldnt ask for anything more. Even though a lot of redevelopment in the area we didnt hear any noise once!

To summarise would stay again everytime Im in London. Perfect.",5,2016,12,10
137,WoW!,Wow factor is guaranteed! Unique and luxurious! It was not only comfortable but a whole adventure. Staff was highly qualified and helpful in every occasion. Location is fantastic. Feels like you're in Buckingham Palace. Wish you great experience ;),5,2016,12,10
137,I LOVE IT !!!!!,"Are you special? Then stay at the 41!
We went to London for a short 2 nights trip. I choose the 41 because of the TripAdvisor reviews and all of them are true. The 41 is out of this world, its just amazing. The location, the staff, the food and its got an help yourself bar. Yes, a bar where you can mix your own drinks. That's just amazing. I loved it. It reminded me on my student times when i was a part time Bartender. My wife still talks about the 41 and our stay there. For sure, when we are back in London, we stay at the 41 again.",5,2016,12,09
137,Perfect stay,"We treated ourselves to a nights stay at a weekend having found this hotel on TripAdvisor.
Right from the start we knew we were in for a treat.
The girl at the initial front door reception was friendly/ very chatty but in a polite way.
At the main reception on the 5th floor we got checked in and had a glass of champagne.
Our room was a split level junior suite which was superb.
The lounge had great snacks.
It is well situated and we walked up to a Covent Garden.
Breakfast was excellent.
Staff always at hand and very attentive.
Really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend.

137,unique!,What a fantastic place in a beautiful city! I really loved the staff here as they knew how to treat us! We will definitely return here in the future!! The location was amazing and everything else was so easy to get to!,4,2016,12,07
137,Luxury break,"Well worth pushing the boat out for this Hotel. Customer service is excellent, a nice glass of champagne in the lounge on arrival, and few little extra touches along the way. As other people have said, its a fairly intimate, not like other Hotels, you are greeted as you walk in and then walk along the corridor to the lift at the end. This will take you up to the 5th floor where the rooms and lounge are situated.

Our room was fantastic and the best bed we have slept in. The bathroom had a walk in shower along with a second shower in the bath, so we could both get ready at the same time. The turn down service was also special as they left a hot water in the bed for us, and nice tea lights with rose petals scattered around.

Don't hesitate to book this Hotel.",5,2016,12,06
137,The best hotel I've ever been to,"I stayed at 41 Hotel London for 5 days to attend a conference held in Brighton. The hotel was conveniently located to use the trains from London Victoria station. During the stay, everything was perfect. I didn't feel like going out due to the comfort of the hotel. Although my English was not fluent, every staff was so kind and friendly that they always made effort to listen my poor English. Thanks to them, I really enjoyed my second trip to London.  Especially I'd like to appreciate Cyprian (sorry if I mistake the spelling...) for his kindness also to my pregnant wife who wasn't there at that time. I'm sure I'll be back to 41 Hotel in the near future with my family.",5,2016,12,05
137,A perfect special experience,"As a family we stay in London regularly for weekends, so when it came to organising a weekend to celebrate our 25th anniversary, somewhere to stay as a couple, my wife and I wanted to find somewhere special, somewhere different to the excellent chain hotels we normally use. We couldn't have found a better place to stay.

From the moment we arrived the personal service achieved exactly what we wanted - the feeling of a special weekend just for us. Our bags were whisked off to our room, we were introduced to the lounge area and shown the various facilities for drinks, food, etc.

We stayed in an executive suite that was beautifully furnished with the highlight being, for me, a very large bathroom with a separate bath and shower. The bed was wonderfully comfortable and very large. We loved the welcome cakes and chocolate treats - we would like to apologise now for not eating the cake, we did appreciate it, we were just unable to eat anything else after the magnificent afternoon tea! Which brings me to the lounge - probably our favourite aspect of the hotel, we spent many hours relaxing in here. There are drinks and nibbles available through the day, with a ""plunder the pantry"" selection of hot food, meats, cheeses, etc. available from 8pm. For us this gave us exactly what we were looking for - an excuse to stay in, enjoy the hotel, and relax in a special place right in the centre of the city. Breakfast is also served here - a much more intimate setting than a typical hotel dining area. By the end of the weekend we were starting to feel like the lounge was our lounge.

The staff were fantastically helpful, especially Mitchell and his colleagues in the lounge. Attentive without being intrusive, easy to attract their intention or to just enjoy our privacy. The breakfast was a great start to the day - no special order too much trouble, excellent coffee and I particularly loved the hash browns.

This is, we agreed, the best hotel we have ever stayed at and will undoubtedly be the first place we think of for whatever we are celebrating next - or whatever excuse we make up just so we can return and enjoy it again.",5,2016,12,05
137,"Boutique, personal and elegant.","We stayed for x2 nights 10 / 11 November in an executive King room with lounge access. We stay in London often, always for leisure, and try different hotels. This was lovely. Very elegant and romantic and worth trying if you're after something a bit different in a really good position in London. 
The rooms are not large but they are well laid out for both business and couples. The bed was uber comfortable for us. The hotel doesn't have all the gadgets some other top hotels have but everything is well laid out, easy to use and elegant. Reading lights, well positioned mirrors, robes, kettle and plenty of pillows. We particularly enjoyed coming back to the room and the 'open' fire would be lit and a hot water bottle in the bed. We are always too warm so enjoyed the effective air con once we had turned off the fire. A beautiful and romantic touch though. 
The most wonderful thing about this room was the mirror on the desk in front of a window with plug sockets nearby. Heaven.You have no idea how many hotels do not have this basic facility.
The bathroom is good, old fashioned and quaintly elegant. The shower is ok.
There was a complimentary drink of your choice on arrival including champagne but all other drinks, even with lounge access, are charged. Complimentary canapés were served early evening and at about 8pm (I think) more complimentary food was put out in the 'butlers pantry'. This food was fabulous. A hot and cold buffet, desserts, chocolates and ice-cream. Marvellous. We didn't bother with dinner the second evening. 
We also had the afternoon tea which is served in their elegant reception / lounge. It was £35 per person and was freshly made and incredibly filling so I would recommend that for a treat although we then couldn't manage any food in the evening.
Our thanks go to each member of staff we met and for being just smiley and well trained and not obsequious. A special thanks must go to Steve who tells fabulous tales whilst pouring you another drink.",4,2016,11,29
137,Wonderful Ruby Anniversary experience,"Hotel 41 was one of the best hotels we have stayed in . From the minute we arrived we were looked after by the extremely friendly and helpful staff. The hotel is beautifully decorated and our room was amazing . There was so much attention to detail and nothing was too much trouble . Our children and grandchildren joined us for a superb carvery lunch in the Rubens hotel next door (part of the same group) . The hotel was in a great location , very close to the palace and also within easy reach of the theatres and shopping . We would definitely highly recommend this hotel . Don't miss out on a fabulous experience. Can't praise it enough .",5,2016,11,29
137,Better than I remembered,"We were torn as to which hotel was our favorite in London, Hotel 41 or Chiltern Firehouse. Unfortunately, my husband and I are still divided. I love both hotels equally, but my husband slightly prefers Hotel 41 because of the incredibly comfortable bed, the complimentary ice cream bar and the best shower in town. That said, I am 50/50 on which I prefer more, but I will say that Hotel 41 is definitely an extraordinary hotel, which I always enjoy staying at.",5,2016,11,29
137,Awesome...,"Stayed at the 41 for 3 nights.
The hotel is just amazing. The drinks are a bit $$$, but who cares. No money, no fun!! You can help yourself at the bar 24hr. Never seen this before. 
The staff are very friendly and think out of the box.
I will return in January to the 41.
Keep up the good work.",5,2016,11,29

It was the most pleasant experience we've ever had at a hotel and we certain would recommend staying here. The decor of the hotel is very pleasant and everything worked as expected, but what made this stay wonderful was the staff. Everyone was extraordinarily professional and helpful and went out of their way to make sure our stay was perfect. We'd like to thank Florent, Magdalena, Nicole, Marta, Dominic, Maria, Jonathan, Mathilda, and several others whose names we didn't get for the wonderful experience. It's also conveniently located near Buckingham palace which made it easy to walk to a lot of interesting historical locations and restaurants. It was also easy to get a taxi, bus, or train to any location we wanted to travel. I can't say enough nice things about this hotel.",5,2016,11,27
137,Second to none!,"Absolutely fabulous hotel and couldn't recommend it more.  Service by the staff from the time of booking throughout our entire stay couldn't have been any more exceptional.

For my daughters birthday, staff were friendly , the room was nice  and the service couldn't be knocked at all! the location of the hotel was perfect for anyone after a city stay , and transport was fine !

137,Outstanding!,"We stayed as a family (with our 2 sons ages 7 and 9) for 4 days from November 3rd - 6th, 2016 to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary. Staying at Hotel 41 literally made our trip. It is in a fantastic location, close to the sights at Buckingham Palace, walking distance to the London Eye, etc. The service was impeccable. The staff knew who we all were upon arrival and made every effort to help us feel at home. We stayed in the Balmoral Suite, which offered the ability for my kids to sleep in an adjoining smaller room. The hotel has an old world charm but offered every amenity we needed. The bed was very comfortable and sheets and towels clean and fluffy.  The lounge was a favorite, we ate there twice a day, breakfast and dinner were delicious and my kids loved ""Plunder the Pantry"" with the 9 different ice cream flavors at night.  For the adults, Steve Jones manned the Lounge bar and served refreshing martinis and cocktails to help us unwind. Every single member of the staff was so friendly and helpful, we would definitely come back. We frequent Ritz Carlton, Peninsula and Four Seasons properties but our experience here easily equals and in many ways exceeds that of any of the other luxury properties we've stayed at.  We all agree, we'd stay there again. Thank you Hotel 41!",5,2016,11,16

The hotel is absolutely amazing, down to all the little details from the champagne on arrival, to contacting the restaurant we were visiting in the evening to confirm our booking, to the little treats left in the room. 
When we got back to the room after a celebration dinner our room had been decorated and we had been left a bottle of champagne and a congratulations cake (again organised by the wonderful Florent!). 
From the moment you arrive at this wonderful hotel you are thoroughly spoilt, the only thing I would change would be to go for a longer stay next time to enjoy it even more and really plunder the pantry. ",5,2016,11,15
137,Outstanding London Hotel,What makes a stay is the service and support that you receive from the staff. This is the best hotel experience. We stay here often. Wish we had one of these hotels in the states. Great location for tourists. Updated rooms and many extras.,5,2016,11,15
137,What an amazing hotel!,"My husband and I stayed here for our 10th Wedding Anniversary, from the moment we stepped into the building we were made to feel so welcome and special by the excellent staff and beautiful surroundings. Quite honestly I could go on and on about how wonderful this hotel is but to keep it simple- champagne check in /constant supply of complimentary snacks/ lovely rooms/ fantastic staff-friendly, attentive, nothing was too much trouble. For us the feeling that we were somewhere special and yet made to feel so at home, is why we would love to return in the future! 
For a bit of perspective we also stayed at the Shangri-La Hotel in The Shard this weekend- this was also a lovely hotel with a beautiful room, fantastic city views and friendly staff. But if you asked my husband or myself which hotel we would return to if we could only choose one, without any hesitation we would say 41!!",5,2016,11,13
137,Wonderful ... but,"This is a special hotel, small and intimate with staff attending to your ever whim.  If you book direct you get  a £50 credit, although I didn't notice till checkout.
We stayed with our grown up son and booked two executive king rooms, felt they were on the small side and every surface was taken up with 'information' making it difficult to put your own belongings anywhere, a bit too fussy for us.  The rooms were immaculate and well maintained, the beds comfy and even a hot water bottle at turndown.
The 'centre' of the hotel is the executive lounge which doubles as the restaurant, bar, meeting area and check-in.  Food which is included in the tariff is available all day.  It's very pleasant but doesn't provide an intimate area, as at anytime people can be at the desk checking in/out or arranging concierge issues.  With our stay only lasting one night maybe we didn't get the full benefit of the area.
The breakfast, which we had on the upper section of the executive lounge was excellent, we were happy to be 'upstairs' as the main area was crowded, the tables are quite close together, we had to go downstairs for fruit and cereals, not a problem for us.
If you want to be pampered in a hotel at the top of it's game then it's unmissable, if you like some of your own space and don't like being smothered you might be disappointed.",5,2016,11,13
137,Perfect!!!,"My husband and I had a great time at the hotel. The young receptionist was very welcoming and our room was huge (London is famous for not offering very big rooms) 
The toilet was shiny and fancy.
Will definitely ho back!",5,2016,11,13
137,Excellent,"We have had a recent stay at the hotel for my husbands birthday. Lovely 5 star hotel which is conveniently located to see the main visitor attractions.
The hotel staff are attentive to your every need with nothing seeming to be any trouble at all. Attention to detail is exquisite and well thought out and executed. Wide choice range for breakfast and snacks. 
Our room was big enough for the two of us, was comfortable and clean. We have experienced many a turn down service in different hotels over the years but this one was special so well done. 
We will return a gem of a place well done",5,2016,11,13
137,Hotel 41,"World class 5 Star luxury, white marble floors with black inserts, dark wood doors and accents , beautiful plants and lobby with lavish furniture. The staff is professional and knowledgeable on everything about the hotel and the city. They have restaurants, shops, gym, suites, jr. suites. I had a room it was on par with the size of rooms in US. It had white walls, art work on the walls, fireplace, desk, bar, leather chair, TV, mini bar, comfortable bed and quite. The bathroom was well equipped. If you left your room you could go to the executive lounge. If you left the hotel it was a great location in the city, and it was near the tube. I was overnight only on way to a cruse, will never get another stay, it cost three times what I normally pay.",5,2016,11,12
137,Best hotel ever,"Never have I stayed in a better hotel.My husband and I stayed here for our 30th wedding anniversary. From start to finish it was fantastic. Not just a hotel but a huge part of our holiday. Hard to drag ourselves away. 
Every little detail has been thought of. Staff are welcoming and friendly. Rooms beautiful. 

Real 5 star luxury. We won't be staying anywhere else now 
Thank you",5,2016,11,11
137,Luxurious rooms and charming atmosphere :),"Couldn't find a single flaw in this hotel. Absolutely recommend it to anyone. The service was really kind, everything was clean and the food was also great! There is no place for disappointment here! Would visit again.",5,2016,11,07
137,Best hotel in Londn,"This is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. The room was large, stylish and beautifully furnished; we were treated like royalty at breakfast, the service were impeccable; a wonderful location and the well appointed bar encouraged us to stay in hotel. This hotel certainly has the formula right.",5,2016,11,05
137,Family celebration,"A huge rush to return to our London home - Hotel 41 - as we prepared for our granddaughter's christening.  Our son flew in from his home abroad and we were reunited in the Executive Lounge, where the team discreetly poured champagne as we happily embraced.  We spent the day catching up with family matters and relaxed royally in the front of the fire with canapes and later Plunder the Pantry laced with Walker Bay - a wonderful white wine - as we chattered.  A good night's rest in perfectly arranged rooms - thank you, housekeeping - followed by a sumptuous breakfast, and we set off for the christening.  Team 41 are beautifully presented -  as well as smiling, helpful and aware of every little thing that could or should be done for guests.  Attention to detail is their creed, and we loved every moment of our visit, being spoilt by each and every one of them.  You run a tight ship, Team 41, and you do it quietly, elegantly and with style.  Well done, and thank you.   You never let me down.",5,2016,11,02
137,Staff goes above and beyond-extraordinary service,"Creature comforts galore-hot water bottle in your turned down bed, candle lit in bathroom, perfect pillows, sheets and duvets, saran wrapped remote controls,  clean relaxing room, plenty of product, beautiful lounge for guests of ""41"" only. Lounge is stunning, quiet, with nice wines, liquors and munchies if you're hungry.  
Staff can't do enough for you from start to finish and make it clear they are available to take care of your every need.  
Wonderful, comfortable, caring, loving very small boutique hotel that makes you want to come back-really soon",5,2016,10,31
137,Delightful stay.,"We stayed in the 41 Hotel seven nights in August. The experience was excellent. The hotel's location was ideal for us with easy access to the tube and easy walking distance to restaurants and shopping. The staff and their overall service was wonderful. I generally hold the impression nice hotels in Europe particularly in European cities and especially in London are very, very expensive, however, after taking everything into consideration offered by 41 during our stay I must admit it was a good value and I would not hesitate to book there for our next visit.",5,2016,10,30
137,Fab!,"Amazing hotel! 
All staff are very welcoming and helpful. Especially Steve the bartender, very good service and friendly! 
Room was lovely and clean. Food was great! 
Perfect location. Staff helpful at getting you a round the city. 

 ",5,2016,10,30
137,Luxury Weekend ,"We chose the 41 hotel based on its tripadvisor status and were definitely not disappointed. An excellent, intimate hotel, with lovely staff. 
Make sure to make the most of the executive lounge, the constant supply of delicious food means you really get your money's worth! 
The rooms were beautiful too, luxurious and spacious, just right. 
Definitely looking forward to coming back!",5,2016,10,30
137,Absolutely great hotel and extremely friend and helpful staff,"We booked this hotel as a birthday treat for my daughters birthday. When arriving there the hotel is easily missed as there is only one real marker on the street showing its location. That would be my only minor criticism.

On arrival our, we were greeted at the front desk (not the check in desk as this was in the executive lounge on the 5th floor). Our bags were taken to our rooms and we were taken to the lounge. Checkin was complete by an open fireplace with complementary champagne.

Our rooms were exceptional. Ours even had a working fireplace. My wife seemed to be amazed that they even had a hot water bottle for us to use if needed. The rooms were well equipped, and considering we were in the heart of London, the traffic noise was not noticeable. In fact my wife even commented on how quite it was.

Breakfast and room service was excellent. They do have complimentary snacks and water which is always offered as you leave the hotel. Even after we checked out and collected our bags later that day, we were offered bottles of water and snacks to take with us.

One of the things that really made our break extra special was that the staff could not do enough to help. They are extremely friendly to the point that they all greet you by your name. They really do make you feel very special.

Highly recommend this hotel and we will most definitely be returning to it again soon. ",5,2016,10,29
137,More than  first class ,"My daughter booked  this  hotel for us as a special  treat for my birthday and oh my this is a very special place. I have never experienced service like this. From the moment  we  entered  the  hotel we were welcomed with warmth and smiles and birthday wishes. Our luggage was whisked away from  us and we were escorted by Mitch to the 5th  floor to complete the check in process??? Well I have over the years  stayed in numerous  hotels in London  and  around  the world but never have  I sat in a comfy  chair and been served  a glass of champagne  of my choice whilst completing registration forms woww. A review could never do this hotel justice, from the complimentary food served throughout the day and into the night, that unfortunately we were unable to take advantage of due to a busy schedule, to the lovely birthday cake waiting in our room  for me, the bed turned  down at night complete with hot water  bottle warming the bed, slippers by the bed, candles lit  in the  bathroom. I truly could go on and on. The staff go more than the extra mile I am sure they  would run the London marathon for you. Thank you so so much.
 
 ",5,2016,10,28
137,Loved our stay here!,This was one of the best hotels that we have stayed at. We felt welcome from the moment we drove up. We were offered a glass of champagne or water or coffee upon arrival.  We requested early check in and our room was ready at 10am when we arrived.  The staff was  friendly and attentive and truly nice people.  The rooms were clean and cozy and had wonderful amenities.  Breakfast was included and plenty to choose from.  Our stay was only for two nights but we loved it so much we didn't want to leave.  We highly recommend it and will be back.,5,2016,10,27
137,Omg where did I just stay!!,The staff here are helping caring and so kind I felt at home once I just stepped in. It's quality of the room are really amazing I fell asleep at once. It's not a lot of money at all for such high quality. It is placed in a good area. If you go to London you have to go her!!!,5,2016,10,23
137,Top hotel,"Stayed at this hotel for a long weekend through a deal on travelzoo, 
Executive King at a very good price, 
Overlooking a busy street but very quiet inside,
Luxury comfort and attentiveness what more can you ask for.",5,2016,10,21
137,We miss the Hotel 41!,"We’ve recently returned from our fourth stay at the Hotel 41, this one for 9 nights.  Incredible hotel with wonderful staff. We miss them all so much!  

The location right across the Royal Mews and mid-way between Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station is perfect. The hotel itself is beautiful and has the finest amenities. The Executive Lounge is beautiful with gorgeous woodwork, a fireplace and a gorgeous glass skylight. We are casual people and don’t feel at all out of place. At night with the candles lit, the ambiance is perfect. Meals are served here as well as evening canapes and then Plunder the Pantry. This feature alone makes a stay at the Hotel 41 worthwhile! Tasty hot entre, breads, cheeses, seafood, salads and desserts are all part of Plunder. The last evening of our stay there was fantastic shrimp on skewers and lobster. It was a feast for the eyes and mouth! 

My daughter requires gluten-free and the Hotel 41 did an excellent job of having items available for her. GF pancakes at breakfast and GF snacks and items for Plunder. She loved it!  She pronounced her GF burger to be the best she had ever had.  

Our stay at the Hotel 41 wasn’t problem-free. We had an issue with a broken refrigerator in our room, our A/C stopped working one night, and there was an issue with an incorrect item on our bill. All were taken care of promptly. 

It is the staff that make the Hotel 41 the wonderful experience that it is. Adele – we thank you again for everything that you did for us. You are incredible. We also give a special shout out to Dominic, Steve, Gina and Nicole. Everyone at the Hotel 41 is friendly and efficient, but you all made our stay extra special. Thanks to Andrew for the sign wishing us well on our departure! And we much appreciated the snack bags that we received for our long trip home. 

I admit – when we plan a trip to London anymore, we come 50% for London and 50% to stay at the Hotel 41! We love this hotel and its staff and highly recommend a stay here.",5,2016,10,19
137,What a gem!!,"We booked this hotel as a stop over in London on our way to South Africa and because we really like Red Carnation Hotels. We were not disappointed, the excellence of the facility, staff and location were exactly what we have come to appreciate with this hotel group. The lounge was a delight to be used and savoured with a quality of service without compare. We will be back and keep up the very high standard.",5,2016,10,18
137,nice stay in a exiciting city,"We had a nice couple of nights at this hotel me and my wife.
Breakfast was served in a nice restaurant with cozy atmosphere and the service overall was really great.
Rooms could be bigger and the beds a bit softer.",3,2016,10,17
137,"Beautiful decor, amazing staff","We visited for 2nights back in August, the location is excellent and the rooms were luxurious! The staff were very attentive and helpful, for example when we asked for extra pillows and clean sheets they arrived instantly as if they were waiting outside the door. We will be coming back for sure!",5,2016,10,17
137,One of the finest hotel experiences in the world,"I have stayed in many 5 star and luxury hotels.  Most were memorable and some quite sublime.  Service is the foundation of any good hotel.  I know that sounds obvious but pulling it off is no easy task.  Hotel 41 does ""service"" unlike any place I have ever stayed in and they do it brilliantly!  The staff is friendly, earnest, funny and attentive to your smallest need.  Their staff is always present and ""in the zone"" when they interact with you.  The smallest detail or request is expertly accommodated.  This place is a gem!",5,2016,10,16
137,Ultimate comfort and great service.,"We stayed for two nights in September.  The hotel's location is excellent, the staff really do care about their guests.  I, unfortunately, was sick on the day we arrived and was given a room to rest while our room was being prepared for us.  This was the best bed, the best bedding, the best pillows, the best shower and bath.... I could go on.   A real treat for us.",5,2016,10,15
137,A place where luxury & privacy both mainatined,"Hotel 41 became one of my favorites on the first visit. Recently I spent 2 nights 1 day there. The hotel is so luxurious and service is outstanding. My room was clean & tidy and in perfect condition, and staff showed excellent professionalism to detail in preparing for my arrival and in housekeeping services every day. Thank you.",4,2016,10,15
137,Very special place..,"An absolutely fabulous experience.  We recently spent 3 nights at Hotel 41 and it surpassed our expectation in every way.  It's a lovely boutique hotel with very elegant and tasteful rooms, but the best part of our experience was the highly attentive and friendly service. Virtually every member of the staff immediately knew us by name, and bent over backwards to insure that no detail was left to chance.  A truly memorable stay.",5,2016,10,13
137,Needs More to be called the best hotel in London!,"There is not question that 41 offers a lot. You are greeted with a choice of champagnes and pastries My room was lovely and the help tried to be accommodating but the concierge had to go to the internet for information, There is food almost all day included in your room rate,.  But I t is hard to determine when you pay for a cup of tea and when it is included.
I knew more than the concierge -  no crossed keys. I was given incorrect opening times and luckily I had another place to go. Nobody opens the door or taxi, and if the person at the desk is on the phone and you have a bag you may have a problem getting in.
This is related to the Rubens hotel next door, and frankly that has people who are more knowledgeable about what is going on and how to run a 1st class hotel.",3,2016,10,12
137,Amazing Botique Hotel,"Hotel 41 is a luxurious experience. I highly recommend that you stay here. Wonderful, attentive staff and a great location. The library is beautifully appointed and they attend to your every whim. Get the yogurt for breakfast....it is the best I have ever had.",5,2016,10,11
137,Excellent 41,Nice hotel situated in a beautiful place . The hotel having a wonderful management team ...all the staffs are very good even the ground staff also. I really appreciate all of them for making the hotel as heaven . I thank them to give me all the helps ....,5,2016,10,11
137,Hotel 41,"The door in question is on Buckingham Palace Road, next to the Rubens hotel, which Red Carnation also owns. Although it feels separate, 41 occupies the Rubens's former offices on the building's top floor, and a lift from 41's striking black and white lobby whisks you up to its striking black and white bedrooms. Front-facing rooms look down into the Royal Mews opposite – heaven for American guests. The former boardroom of the Rubens is the heart of 41, a mahogany clad ""Executive Lounge"" with conservatory roof, honesty bar and complimentary light buffet 24 hours a day. Black-suited staff hover, with red carnations in their buttonholes.",5,2016,10,10
137,Brilliant - absolutely amazing.,"Sometimes we get to experience something so unique - so special - that it rocks the foundation about what we thought to be true. Such was the case with my recent stay at Hotel 41. While I thought I knew what excellent service and attention to detail were prior to this visit, I now have new definitions for those words as they relate to hotels.

I traveled to London on a special trip with my eight-year old daughter. From the moment we stepped into the lobby, we were treated with care and made to feel as if we were the only guests staying at 41. Staff went out of their way to make my daughter's experience one she will never forget, and were incredibly helpful booking tickets to local attractions and even helped with Eurostar to Paris. The food was fantastic. High Tea was incredible. And every single member of the team went out of their way to make our stay relaxing and special.

It is also clear to me that the team really enjoys working with each other and feel respected by their employer. They treated each other with the same level of respect as the customers and went out of their way to help each other out.

For those looking for a hotel that will redefine what excellence means, I highly recommend Hotel 41. I will definitely stay here again.",5,2016,10,10
137,Quality!,"Fantastic hotel - 5 star quality and service. I can't say enough about Hotel 41. The staff were outstanding down to the smallest details. Our room was impeccable, truly no complaints. We stayed for 5 nights and thoroughly enjoyed the executive lounge (which really feels like a library/gentleman's club). We had fantastic breakfasts in there every morning with cocktails and snacks in the afternoons and night caps after our evenings out. Highest quality drinks and food - a remarkable home away from home. We will definitely stay here again next time we are in London. The location couldn't be more convenient either. Well done Hotel 41!!!",5,2016,10,09
137,Great - Comfortable Stay!,"What a Gorgeous Holidays! happy to have found an outstanding discount for this Hotel! at - is.gd/gothotel 
The food in general was great, mouthwatering and pleasant! with lots of choices!

Their personnel were very friendly and helpful - throughout the whole stay.

The room was clean, big, and precisely arranged, Good sized bed and big bathroom.",4,2016,10,06
137,Great hotel!,"The staff was very polite, food was fantastic also. All in All I would rate this hotel 5 out of 5 stars! I was with my family, everyone liked the environment, people were friendly. We spent hours in the cozy lounge area. The hotel is tastefully and thoughfully decorated.",5,2016,10,06
137,ONE OF THE BEST BOUTIQUE HOTELS ANYWHERE 5 STAR TO THE MAX,"from the moment you arrive, the friendliness of the staff, the hard wood antique beauty of lobby and room is so magnificent and very british.......hardwoods,etc. the executive lounge was so inviting and the food and and drink were first class in every sense. The staff could not be more accommodating. I could not be more pleased and give this property my highest rating.",5,2016,10,05
137,Perfect honeymoon destination,"I booked a 3 night stay as a surprise for our honeymoon and was dubious about staying at the Hotel 41 as thought that it may be 'over the top' however, everything was absolutely perfect.  As previous reviews had suggested the surroundings are more like a gentlemans club.  On first impression, our room didn't seem very big however this had more I believe to do with the non standard shape, we soon got used to it and it turned out to be fine.  Everything was of the best quality, as you'd expect, for a 5 star hotel, we weren't disappointed.  All members of the team made us feel really special and seemed genuinely interested in us and our plans.  We were 'wowed' on several occasions by special touches including returning to our room one evening to find rose petals and candles.  I liaised with Flo when making our reservation and he kindly organised a couple of tickets for us to go to see The Phanthom of the Opera. Hotel 41 was the perfect honeymoon destination.",5,2016,10,05
137,Perfect !,"People say it doesn't matter where you stay since you don't spend a lot of time in your room when you're on vacation. Staying at the Hotel 41 will change that perspective.  It was such an elegant, yet ""home-like"" atmosphere that we looked forward to our return each day to have a drink, chat with the staff and just sit back and enjoy our time at the hotel. Florent, Andrew and Dominic felt like old friends.  They tended to everything...whether we needed it or not. They anticipated things before you had to ask....really amazing !   Now I know why this is rated the best hotel in London.  I was sad to leave and will definitely return when we visit London again.  
Room advise: We booked the Junior suite which has an upstairs and a downstairs.  it was nice to have the extra space but a regular room executive or deluxe room probably would have been fine since we didn't end up using the downstairs very often.",5,2016,10,04
137,Wonderful!,"Words can't really express how wonderful this hotel is, but I'll try!  We stayed one night before going on the Orient Express to celebrate my aunt/uncle 50th anniversary and our 25th and this was the perfect start to the holiday.  We were surprised and delighted to be upgraded to suites which were amazing, clean and so comfortable and with  lovely anniversary cakes waiting for us.   The decor in this hotel is beautiful and the lounge is elegant yet so relaxed you don't want to leave it.  All the lovely little touches such as the glass of champagne on arrival, the 'plunder the pantry' treats make Hotel 41 special and unique and yet it is somehow a relaxed luxury.  But without a doubt, the staff are the best ever.  The wonderful doorman/concierge, the lovely reception and management staff, the staff in the lounge -  without exception everyone was truly professional, welcoming and warm.  We can't wait to return!",5,2016,10,03
137,MADE MY BIRTHDAY TOP NOTCH,"I was worried about staying at a Hotel I was not familiar with.  This Hotel was the biggest surprise & delight one could imagine.  The staff knows all about you within minutes,  they want to do everything to please you,  I do not think I will ever stay elsewhere!!!
Just absolutely lovely!!!",5,2016,10,02
137,Memorable stay,Spent 4 nights here recently and all I can say is that the reviews are spot on! The hotel offers immaculate service and products. Truly special and a must-try for those who are on the fence. Highly recommended!!!,5,2016,09,29
137,Can't wait to come back!!,"No wonder this hotel has the accolade of 'the best hotel in London' ! Every single thing , from the champagne on arrival, to the complimentary treats always on offer, is tailored to make your stay here as pleasant as possible. The staff are absolutely fabulous, really genuinely helpful and always smiling and friendly. The room was a good size, comfortable, spotlessly clean with many lovely additions all designed to give maximum comfort and luxury .  Check out the salt beef sandwich in their cafe next door (B Bar) and the cocktails in their sister hotel- Ruebens on the other side !
Loved it and thanks for a fabulous time ! See you very soon 😊",5,2016,09,29
137,Should be called Hotel #1,"I thoroughly enjoyed every part of my stay at the Hotel 41.  The stay starts with an easy check in, made easier by the champagne being poured while you sit in a comfortable leather chair and get introduced to the hotel and shown to your room. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was adequate. Every night little treats showed up ranging from chocolate to mind quieting pillow spray to recovery eye cream. Nice treats. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful with anything you could ever ask for. Special shout out to Steve Jones who poured our champagne upon arrival and engaged at other times in excellent conversation. Breakfast was always good and sometimes too much food to finish. Great location, just steps from Buckingham Palace. I could go on and on. I would highly recommend a stay and can assure that I will stay again when I return to London.",5,2016,09,27
137,Beautiful Boutique Hotel,"Hotel 41 was the perfect way to start our honeymoon. We spent 3 nights in London before traveling on. After landing at 7 am after a full day of travel we were greeted with a glass of chilled champagne in the plush lounge. The staff acclimated us to the hotel and services provided. Then, we were shown to the spacious beautiful room. We were thankful it was ready for us so early. Every evening people would gather in the lounge for ""raid the pantry."" It was a wonderful way to wind down from our busy days. We highly recommend this adorable gem of a hotel. ",5,2016,09,26
137,#1 for a Reason,"My wife and I arrived to find out I had a reservation for October!!! we had arrived a month earlier! The team in the hotel didn't turn me back, worked miracles and managed to accommodate us despite my mistake. Everyone was helpful, really friendly and accommodating. We loved the lounge area, like an oasis away from the city hustle. So from a potential disaster - Hotel41 turned this around into a fantastic weekend break.
Special Thanks to Adele, Lauren, Mitchel, Florent and all the names I forgot!!!
Hope to return soon!",5,2016,09,26
137,Only one word : perfection,"Perfect from the first step to the end. Downstairs, when arriving, the welcoming is great with fruits and sweets proposals as well as tea and coffee. Very friendly check-in in the lounge with a glass of champagne or tea (with home-made cookies) or whatever. The Executive lounge is within a library with beautiful ancient books and a very cosy wood area. In the afternoon, you have a small buffet with nuts - sweets - drinks - cookies and delicious ice creams. For afternoon tea, perfect warm scones. We were upgraded in a suite and it was perfect (2 levels). Everything was great from the quality of the bed to the coffee and tea set, from plenty of amenities for the bathroom to the welcoming sweets....(one week before our arrival, we received a mail asking us what we like to eat and if we need special pillows, yoga mat.... I said chocolates and shortbreads and when arriving we found 4 tablets of best chocolates and 10 shortbreads + cakes and chocolates). For dinner, the buffet is not big but enough and to be honest everything is so good quality (fruits - tarts - hot dish - fish....). The room was really quiet. Perfect breakfast with delicious fresh fruits (they propose all over the day) - good bread - viennoiseries - yogurt.....well, everything was perfect. I already plan to come back soon. Perfect location too.",5,2016,09,26
137,Hotel 41 Lives Up to the Fantastic Reviews,"We chose this hotel based on other Trip Advisor reviews and we weren't disappointed. This hotel is amazing - it's a small hotel with beautiful rooms and the service is top notch. The staff here is professional and attentive.  We started and ended each day in the executive lounge -- this made our stay!  Wonderful breakfast, great snacks, drinks and desert in the evening - it all made for such a great experience.  Yes, the hotel is expensive but its truly worth it.  We had a fantastic time and would love to stay at Hotel 41 again!",5,2016,09,25
137,Unexpected perfection,"My husband and I just returned from a short trip to London and this time we decided to try a different hotel. We are so happy we did, what a truly five star experience. We love the small boutique feel of this hotel and the staff always went above and beyond (which I can't say always is the case in the U.K.). 

The lounge had a very welcoming fell, we had a few meals here and other than the food taking a while to come out, was perfection. 

We'll be back!",5,2016,09,25
137,Probably the best hotel I've ever stayed at,"The entire staff is fantastic. We arrived early and were provided with a courtesy room as our room wasn't ready yet.  No hotel has ever done this for me.  We were also provided a courtesy room after checkout to bridge the timegap until we had to leave for our flight.  Amazing service. 

The black/white style is very nice. There are delicious complimentary snacks available all the time.  There were two showers in our Executive King, and they both had ample pressure and heat.  They even had a real door unlike many European showers.

I don't think I'll bother looking for another hotel in London.  If/when we return, we'll be coming back here.",5,2016,09,25
137,Faultless ,"Subtle attentiveness from the onset! 
There was a fluidity of service which made our stay both comfortable and homely without being over bearing. 
Without going into too much detail this was quite simply one of the best hotel experiences we have had to date. We are looking forward to discovering what the sistering hotels have to offer. ",5,2016,09,25
137,Best Hotel stay ever!,We loved every aspect of our stay. We are already planning our return visit. This hotel is worth every penny- we had the experience of a lifetime. The staff was thoughtful and attentive to every detail. We loved one stay and we will be back without a doubt!!,5,2016,09,24
137,Unreal !,Loved this place. Could stay forever. What a beautiful architecture and design within the illustrious corridors and walls. The art deco theme is unforgettable. They also have a lot of history and tour guide books within the hotel for those interested in it.,4,2016,09,24
137,"Five stars, frankly, aren't enough","Simply cannot say enough good things about Hotel 41. From the minute we set foot out of the cab until we left days later, this team of people anticipated and exceeded every thing we wanted or needed.

The rooms are lovely. Beds perfect. Appointments wonderful. It's quiet at night.

The Executive Lounge started and ended every day - with breakfast impeccably prepared and served.  Pre dinner cocktails were relaxing and welcoming.  Special recognition to Steve who leads this part of the experience.  We much enjoyed our quickly developed relationship.  His recommendations for dining were well thought out.  Wine suggestions spot on.

The team of folks who are part of the front desk/concierge are friendly, efficient, thoughtful, helpful. Always available.  Maria & Adele, in particular, went above and beyond for us - securing play tickets, solving our ticket printing issues, reserving tables for dinner. 

Make no mistake, this isn't a cheap stay.  Also know that the environment and service is worth what you will pay.  Just a wonderful experience.  May we be so lucky to return one day.

Five stars aren't enough...",5,2016,09,24
137,Totally Perfect,"This hotel would be worth visiting for the ambiance, quality of decor, standard of rooms, superb array of day long treats and food in the lounge alone, BUT should NOT be missed when in London to experience the service provided by the AMAZING staff. Every single person shows exemplary professionalism and provides a standard of customer service not experienced in any other luxury hotel anywhere in the world. 
I could write pages giving examples of the above but my title says it all - ""Totally Perfect""! ",5,2016,09,24
137,What a gem!,"Had an amazing nights stay - treated my hubby for his 60th birthday ! We were upgraded to a suite which was fabulous! There is nothing to fault about this little gem in the heart of London!  
Every member of staff offered a first class service - nothing was too much trouble! 
Cannot recommend this place enough - it really is special - you will not be disappointed ! I am saving again and can't wait to visit again but next time for longer !!!",5,2016,09,22
137,Best Hotel Ever ,"Booked Hotel 41 after reading about it in the times some time ago.
I wanted a special place to bring my
lovely Daughter who has just finished her Masters. They spoilt us from the moment we arrived with champagne. We where upgraded to a lovely Suite. The decor and furnishings totally luxurious. Then began three days and evenings of total luxury and indulgence. The staff are so lovely. I have never come across so many kind helpful and simply amazing people in my life. 
Hotel 41 is not just a hotel it's an experience. Full of surprises everything done beautifully.
Thank you for the thoughtful touches the congratulations cake.
The Harry Potter hats and fruit, the gorgeous Flowers you sourced for me. So many thoughtful details. 
And plunder the pantry a grazers heaven. 
If you want to spoil someone or yourself. This is the best hotel I've ever been to and I am pretty well 
travelled.
Thank you to every one for such a delightful memorable stay. 
Mrs P & Heather

137,Great Luxury Hotel,Hotel 41 is a great boutique hotel in a great location in London. The service was second to none. We enjoyed having the 24 hour snacks and bar service. Every staff member was well informed and friendly.,5,2016,09,22
137,Perfect Romantic Hotel,"After getting wed on the Southbank I'd booked this Hotel for the evening - not realising after that it was perhaps a little excessive for such a short stay, but it was worth it.

Arriving around 11.30 pm we were welcome with Champagne at the check in and quickly made to feel at home - after dropping off  the bags in the room, we took advantage of the midnight larder, enjoying a nice warm dish and some selections from the meat and cheese boards.

The room was split level and had a nice fireplace, all decked out with fine pictures and nice furnishings through out. Very comfortable room and a cake had been left with Congratulations written on it and scattering of rose petals around the place.

Breakfast in the morning was a veritable selection of whatever you wanted, more champagne, coffee and fruit juices along with traditional and continental cooked breakfast options.

Sadly we had to check out about 10 to head back to the other side of London, but it was memorable stay at Hotel 41.",5,2016,09,21
137,stunning hotel in london,"I really can't say enough about the quality of attention and service given by the staff.

During my 1 week stay I had one minor complaint about the temperature of the hot water in my room, and they had it fixed by the time I came back from dinner.
Excellent hotel .excellent service ,excellent to my trip
thanks alot",5,2016,09,20
137,"WOW, WOW, WOW what a stay!!","The staff was brilliant and welcoming. Truly engaging at all turns, and made you feel like you were a guest in their personal home. The wonderful ladies at the front desk were so helpful and even assisted with us booking a train to see High Claire castle. 
The room was small based on US standards but was adequate and well appointed. The shower and bath pressure were amazing! Like nothing I have ever experienced before. I would also be refreshed after taking a shower! I wish we had that type of pressure in the states. 
Location couldn't be beat, two block walk to the tube which takes you everywhere in London. Just an FYI. Also remember to use black cabs vs Uber in London. The black cab drivers have to spend on average 3-4 years studying the areas of London before taking ""the knowledge test"" to become a cab driver. They take this craft very seriously and the experiences we had in the cabs with the drivers really made travel that much better. 
One final note on the hotel, they offer a service for the butler to pack your bags b4 departure. How amazing is that? This really put this hotel over the top for us, and solidified why it's #1 on tripadvisor. We will most definitely be back to hotel 41 when we are in London!! 
",5,2016,09,19
137,Second time ,"Second time at 41 and it was just as lovely and service just as attentive 

Lots of little touches that make your stay special 

Personal unhurried service and calming surroundings 

A quality stay and we look forward to a third stay soon ",5,2016,09,18
137,Immaculate Service!!,"From the moment we entered Hotel 41, we were warmly greeted by the hotel staff who are all top notch and will go above & beyond to make sure your stay is nothing less than perfect. Great location. The hotel is located within a short walk of most of the top sights in London. The gem of the hotel is the executive lounge which is great for breakfast, afternoon tea, and drinks in the evening. The lounge has a wide array of food & drinks that are readily available to all guests and are constantly being interchanged throughout the day. The desert selection at night was our personal favorite. Would highly recommend to anyone and we will surely being looking to stay with Hotel 41 again on our next trip to London.",5,2016,09,18
137,Mrs 30th,"Lovely hotel can't fault it, yes it's expensive but worth it, the only thing that annoys me is air con turned right down over night, other than that can't fault the place, when we were out they bought brownies to the room and wrote happy birthday in chocolate, amazing, rooms are very clean ",4,2016,09,18
137,Very special ,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for two nights as part as our trip to the UK.
Before we arrived we knew it was going to be special, we received a hand written letter thanking us for our reservation and looking forward to our stay. We live in Sydney! Such a lovely lovely touch. 
There is a desk downstairs where you are greeted and you are then taken upstairs via a lift to the main reception area which is also in the dining area. At first this seems a little disjointed however it is just quirky. As you check in you're warmly offered a choice of any drinks soft to a selection of chilled champagne and the service is just continues from there. It's hard to put your finger on what Hotel 41 does differently to other 5 star hotels however it is different. You just know  they've taken a note of your likes and dislikes , that they can professionally pre empt your require or needs before you even really know what you need yourself.  That comes from experience and care to detail and it feels genuine. I overheard one of the breakfast team asking another guest if they enjoyed Matilda whilst another played dolls with a young girl.
The Hotel itself feels like a lovely members club and not in the pretentious way, just that you feel secluded and away from all the noise  in your space ( much to do with the aforementioned 'quirky' spacing 'The rooms are a good size , immaculately clean with a very comfortable bed , handmade chocolates waiting for you in your room and your bags ready for you as you enter.The rooms are decorated black and white with some gold. For my personal taste perhaps  a bit bold and a couple of the finishes were not as good as it could be. However these are minor minor details. 
The breakfasts were delicious and the pantry area where you could help yourself was a lovely touch. 
I also adore the use of a trust bar. Having the option to help yourself and just make a note as you go along I think offers a lovely  connection with your guests. I would not hesitate to stay here again for the service, location, experience and attention to details Hotel 41 offers.",5,2016,09,17
137,Best Hotel Experience ever!,"This hotel is amazing.  The location is excellent, the rooms are great but truly the people made the difference.   Everyone, and I mean everyone went over and above to make you welcome.  The staff was amazing. The location is right outside Buckingham Palace and a five minute walk to Victoria station.  Fifteen minute walk to Bond and Regent street.  The breakfast was excellent, and the evening appetizers was well done.  The executive lounge was a great place to relax after a long day. Try the ginger ice cream!  This hotel is well worth it and we will be back.  Thank you for an amazing stay.",5,2016,09,17
137,Celebration of Husbands 60th,"For my husbands 60th I surprised my husband with a trip to London and Paris, with my sister and her bf. I researched hotels/B&Bs/rentals. I read some great reviews of Hotel 41 and booked on Booking.com. Wow!!! What a great find!  The Hotel is next to Buckingham Palace and convenient to many great areas! But, the most important thing....the Hotels Staff was beyond FANTASTIC! They started by making us feel welcome from the start...champagne anyone?
When we got to our room...they had a special chocolate cake with Happy 60th Birthday on it waiting for my husband! I didn't ask them to do that....I just indicated we were coming to London to celebrate his 60th. What a wonderful surprise!My husband was floored.
The rooms were fantastic and nicely appointed and clean! Spacious and pretty! His and Her robes and slippers. They turned down the bed every night and left little surprises for my husband and me. Along with the turn down they left beautiful music playing in the room to welcome us home.
The staff learned our names quickly and was always on hand to meet our every need and/or desire, from drinks, food and or suggestions and helpful information. 
We all agreed, this was the BEST Hotel we have ever stayed at...Ever!!! The staff really made us feel special. I will stay here again when we visit London in the future. This Hotel should get 10 stars for accommodations, food, drinks, location but most of all the wonderful staff!!!!!",5,2016,09,16
137,"Outstanding service, facility and location.","We had a wonderful time at 41.  The hotel is a beautiful facility, the room was very comfortable, the lounge was convenient and fun but the most outstanding part of all was the excellent service from all the staff.  They really know how to make you feel at home and anticipate your every need.",5,2016,09,16
137,Best ever,The reviews are true. We have never had service like this before - not just excellent but so friendly and totally warm. The breakfast and complimentary food in the pantry are wonderful and everybody knows you by name. We were only there one night - how do they do that! Perfect visit for a birthday surprise. ,5,2016,09,15
137,Brilliant,This place is one of the best hotels in the British Isles. The first thing is the exutive lounge is very comfortable and a good place to have a drink or two. Another thing is this place has a fantastic view of Buckingham Palace. This hotel is more of a private club than a hotel. The conservatory suite is beautiful and a different experience. The romantic turndown was brilliant. The room had a breathtaking view of the Royal mews. The red rose petals were gorgeous. The complentry snacks were great and given out by the best staff in the world. The champagne they gave out was brilliant and I was quite amazed when they offered me it. I will certainly pick the Red Carnatation hotels in the future.,5,2016,09,14
137,Brief Visit Home 9/4-9/6,"Great and lovely hotel by far the best Britain has to offer. Concierge and hotel staff are wonderfully polite and often greet you, and there isn't a need they won't fulfil. Probably one of the best representations of British hospitality I've ever actually encountered and as a first time visitor here earlier this month I will definitely be back.
",5,2016,09,14
137,Wonderful hotel,This gem is perfect! Small with an unassuming entrance just down the road from Buckingham Palace. The entire visit was enjoyable. Food is amazing and staff outstanding. The even have a list of staff who will exercise with you. Just ask!,5,2016,09,12
137,BEST hotel in the world,"Without a doubt, this is the most incredible hotel I have ever and probably will ever stay. Nothing will ever come close. Florent and the rest of the staff are world class. Absolutely anything you need is taken care of by them. I stayed here for six days with family and they treated us like we were part of theirs. Relaxing in the lounge every night felt like coming home after a long day of touring/shopping. The rooms were gorgeous, and the location cannot be beat. We were so sad to leave. I don't know when I'll be back, but I can't wait! If you're planning a trip to London, look no further!",5,2016,09,12
137,Simply the best ,"Words cannot begin to describe how amazing this hotel is.  You were greeted after a long flight with a glass of Veuve Clicquot, which pretty much sets the stage for the rest of the stay. There isn't anything staff wouldn't do for you, and They will always do it with a smile. The rooms are impeccable, timeless, contemporary, individualized, and gorgeous all the same time. All the food we had there was delicious. The service was second to none, and they took excellent care of our entire family, including our five-year-old son, whom they made honorary manager. Don't stay anywhere else in London, you will not be disappointed, I have stayed in many 5 star resorts throughout the world and this was honestly our favorite!! Enjoy your time there!",5,2016,09,12
137,The BEST Hotel ever ,"We have just stayed 3 nights at this wonderful hotel. Traveling with my husband and sister. Her room was ready when we arrived, but ours was not so they put us into a courtesy room where we could freshen up and take a little nap! That was the beginning of 3 days of being spoiled rotten!  The hotel executive lounge is a constant food fest. There are always snacks out in addition to more substantial fare. The staff new our names from the start and by the second morning knew what we liked for breakfast!  Our friends joined us for breakfast one morning and they set us up in a private little room!! Every night there was s little surprise on the pillow and when we got back to the hotel after seeing ""Wicked"" there were Wicked themed cupcakes waiting for us!  The hotel was clean, comfortable, and so personal. We'll never stay anywhere else in London!",5,2016,09,12
137,Probably the best experience ever at a small hotel,"This review is a little late since our stay was in March 2016, but I want to do it because I think the hotel deserves the accolades.  

My 14 year old son and I stayed here for a week at Easter. I have never felt so safe and so pampered at any hotel. If you want a big hotel with a lot of amenities, don't stay here. If you want a small hotel where everyone knows your name, knows what you like and anticipates your wants/needs, this is the place. 

We stayed in a junior suite which has two levels. It's not the most spacious set up (a little too small in the bedroom area) but the room was beautiful nonetheless. The bathroom was huge with a big soaking tub and separate shower. Lots of natural lighting. Beds were super comfortable and the hot water bottle under the sheets when returning to the room at night was so nice. We loved the fruit and candy in our room (constantly replenished). The Plunder the Panty was great...food was delicious and plentiful. The snacks during the day were just what we needed. The executive lounge is cozy and a wonderful place to read a book or the paper, hangout and have a drink, etc. If you have small children and are concerned about disturbing others, it might be a little uncomfortable because it is a quiet lounge. (Note..I do NOT think that the staff would ever make a family with children feel uncomfortable.)  

By far the best thing about the hotel is the employees.  Florent, Marshall, Maria, and Nathaniel!! I wish I could have taken them back to California with me!!  Everyone was friendly, gracious, and extremely helpful. They made us feel truly welcome and I knew they cared about our comfort and safety. I seriously cannot write enough positive things about the hotel and the wonderful employees of Hotel 41.",5,2016,09,11
137,A different experience ... In a good way!,"My husband and I stayed at the sister hotel (The Rubens at the Palace) which shares some staff and several walls snd (hidden) doorways. As we often do when traveling, we asked for a tour at a hotel of interest. We were graciously shown around by a charming young man (whose name escapes me) who had the most delicious Scottish accent. (Honestly, he could have been reading a grocery list and I would have been happy!) 

The hotel is tiny and was fully booked, but he showed us what he could, and we liked what we saw. 

The GM for this hotel is the same as The Rubens, and he and his staff have got game! It's so refreshing to see an operation that knows and cares about what they're doing.",4,2016,09,11
137,A breath of fresh air,"Moved here from another nearby hotel where the welcome wasn't that warm, the room was tiny and the bed uncomfortable  and was needing a lot of love and found this on a price comparison site.

What a difference 

Lovely warm welcome, friendly polite staff, spacious room, lots of hot water, nice little touches in the room, a can-do attitude and a great location. 

Would thoroughly recommend as it was also a very decent price. Loved it",5,2016,09,09
137,"If you're looking for a hotel in London, look no further.","This was one of the best hotels I've stayed at worldwide. The location is perfect; 5 min walk to Victoria Station, Buckingham Palace and Green Park. The service is nothing short of amazing. My parents, husband and I felt right at home. My parents don't speak much English, but there's some staff that speak Spanish and those that don't are very patient. My brother occasionally stopped by (stayed at a nearby hotel) and everyone was so kind to him. The hotel is beautiful; decor very British and classic. The rooms are comfortable, skin products are placed every evening on your bed and the toiletries are top-notch. There's complimentary treats all day with yummy food. I don't eat red meat and it was good to see plenty of fish options. One advice: eggs are overpriced. Eat what you can from the breakfast bar. Coffee is a bit strong; if ordering a latte ask for the coffee on the side. Thank you Lauren, Mitch, Maria and all the wonderful staff for making our stay a most magical one! Will definitely come back when returning to London :) ",5,2016,09,08
137,Number 1 in the world,"What can I say: brilliant! This is the most beautiful hotel I have ever stayed in. There may not be much real estate but they certainly make up for it with service. Don't get me wrong. The rooms are lovely and roomy. But the service is second to none! Verve on arrival. Daily fruit basket in the room. Snacks all day. Beautiful breakfasts. Free water. Even a lock for my suitcase upon departure. It is the little things that make the stay so much more pleasant, lovely and comfortable. It is worth every dollar. I would like to come back just to stay here.",5,2016,09,07
137,Amazing Service ,The service at this hotel is phenomenal with the staff making you feel like a regular from the first minute you arrive. The food and location are also great with the only minor drawback being the small rooms. ,5,2016,09,06
137,Best Hotel in London,"Hotel 41 is by far the best hotel in London! If you are looking for top notch service, a stunning room, excellent staff and amenities this is the hotel to stay at. Right next to Buckingham Palace it boasts pure elegance and is close enough to everything you want to see. I will definitely only being staying here the next time I am in London!",5,2016,09,05
137,In a different league  !!,"It really is a cut above the others that I have visited.  The service is outstanding from start to finish.  Welcomed with free Champagne on check-in ( choose from a menu with all high end bottles on offer ) then showed to the room which had 3 bathroooms. The complimentary pantry is a nice touch in the sitting room  as was the bottle of chilled  champagne awaiting us in the room on our return from an evening out.
A special visit to a special hotel.",5,2016,09,05
137,Wonderful anniversary and birthday celebration,"My husband booked a weekend at Hotel 41 for my birthday and our first wedding anniversary celebration. It was magical. The other reviews describe it perfectly - impeccable service, lovely rooms, amazing rooms. The pantry was awesome. The value (I think) is excellent because you get lots of complimentary treats. The Penhaligon toiletries were divine, so much so that I went to the store to buy some the next day. Unfortunately they are made especially for hotels...oh well, looks like I'll have to book another stay! Thanks to all the staff, especially Mitch who was super friendly and always remembered our name.",5,2016,09,05
137,First trip to London,"We chose Hotel 41 for our first trip to London and we couldn't be happier with our decision. This hotel was perfect for our family. The accommodations were impeccable and no detail too small. The employees went out of their way to make each of us feel comfortable and special - every single day for nearly two weeks! Andrew supplied our 11 year old daughter with Dr. Who details. Several staff members enjoyed talking Harry Potter with her on a daily basis. Once we returned home, we missed Stefan's stories as well as Edgar's late night drinks and company. We are still talking about the friends we made at this hotel. It's just that personal. We've never stayed any where quite this special - except for maybe home. ",5,2016,09,04
137,Worthy of It's Number One Rating,"I can't really say a lot more to emphasize this place is perfect as a small hotel.  Elegant, beautiful, outstanding service, great location.  Rooms are gorgeous.  Staff is friendly and fun, much more so than their stuffy competitors, The Connaught and Claridge's.  Entrance is a bit obscure and we had sort of a hassle unloading our rental car in front because of construction cones blocking the front entrance.  Go. Enjoy.",5,2016,09,04
137,The Best Hotel in Town,"For style, service, fine wine, excellent dining, perfect location, comfort, exclusivity and total spoiling of the dogs this hotel can't be beaten.  We will certainly be staying again and can hardly wait.",5,2016,09,03
137,Simply devine,"After a trip around australia with my mum, returned to a new life in London and whilst awaiting our apartment to be ready spoilt ourselves with a stay at 41.  Just spectacular!  The hotel is just beautiful but it is the service that is standout.  A pleasure to be addressed by your first name when coming by staff, attention to detail is amazing.  Rooms are specious and the use of the executive lounge was a bonus.  

I will miss my home in Sydney and weekends away in the beautiful HunterValley but with hotels like this nearby- I will certainly be taking some regular  Fabulous London urban getaways at 41.  ",5,2016,09,03
137,Retirement surprise for my wife ,"It's hard to pick out highlights from a 2 night stay that was a continual highlight. Everything was faultless. The level of service was something I hadn't experienced before.  The warmth and friendliness of the staff was outstanding (in particular, Adele and Andrew, and Siobhan and Frank from The Rubens).  If you want to experience the best, stay at Hotel 41.  ",5,2016,09,02
137,Just wow. Live live a star ,This hotel really has it all if you want to feel pampered. Yes it's very expensive I booked in advance and my room was still £350 for a night. However don't let the price put you off. The finishing touches are immaculate and it really feels like being on a movie set. Also the added extras like snacks and so were nice. Staff were very helpful and I didn't come across anyone unwilling to help ,5,2016,08,31
137,"Perfect Location, impeccable staff, incredible service.","We stayed at Hotel 41 for our 5th wedding anniversary.  We have stayed at other luxury London hotels over the years, but on this occasion we wanted to stay in a smaller more intimate luxury hotel.   This hotel is amazing !  The suites are not the size of other luxury hotels but the service more than makes up for this.  The building and rooms are beautiful and well kept.  But it is the staff and the quality of service that makes this place so memorable.  I cannot recommend this hotel enough.",5,2016,08,31
137,Fantastic Hotel,"41 has to be the best hotel I have ever stayed at. The staff will consistently go above and beyond to ensure you have a good stay, and are just generally pleasant. The room was fantastic, the bed was very comfortable and the decor was luxurious without being forced. I opted for the romantic turndown service for our arrival night, which helped turn an otherwise stressful day/commute into a wonderful evening. There were so many little things throughout our stay that just made the weekend perfect, I just cannot recommend this hotel enough. If you're going to stay anywhere in London, make it 41.",5,2016,08,31
137,Victorian,"Bit expensive, but with what you can feel and have there it is absolute cheap... character is like Victorian type..cosy furniture. Good service./.grate food... feel like you staying in a palace. go and stay there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1",5,2016,08,31
137,Amazing intimate hotel,"I have never been pampered and catered to as I have been at Hotel 41.  I was traveling alone and they made me feel important and comfortable.  I was greeted by name from the moment I checked in.  The rooms are nice size, tea and snacks really great.  
I recommend Hotel 41 without reservation.  ",5,2016,08,30
137,Superb hotel,"My husband and I visited Hotel 41 for 1 night for our 20th anniversary. From the minute we arrived we felt welcome and valued. It really seemed that the staff were happy if we were happy.
We had a glass of champagne and some snacks in the lounge upon check-in then we were shown to our room where there was a cake and some small treats waiting for us.
Everything about the room felt luxurious. Everything you could possibly need was there; from the toiletries in the bathroom to pens, paper, envelopes, stationery, 2 TV's  and so much more.
We went back to the lounge for afternoon tea which was just lovely. Again, the service was impeccable.
We went to a show in the evening and were asked if we needed directions, water to take, even an umbrella.
When we got back there were candles lit in the room and rose petals spread around with Elemis products on our pillows - we were so pleased with this. Back to the lounge to 'plunder the pantry' - we found a delicious hot beef pie together with cold meats and cheeses with cakes and ice cream. We slept well, had a full English breakfast in the morning which was very good and before we left booked again as we loved it so much we must return!
The hotel felt like a little hidden piece of luxury where the staff are excellent at what they do; quite rare for us to find the kind of service we got here. Thank you for a memorable stay.",5,2016,08,30
137,Wonderful Hotel!,"We have just returned from 4 wonderful nights at Hotel 41. We chose the hotel purely based on Tripadvisor reviews and we are so glad we did. What a fantastic hotel! It's small just around 20 or so rooms but the service is second to non. From the moment you arrive and are offered a choice of champagnes to celebrate your arrival, the staff really can not do enough for you. Whenever we sat down in the Executive Lounge at any time of the day, immediately there is someone there ready to get you what ever you need. The lounge is a wonderful relaxing space that we enjoyed often during our stay. So tranquil you really can forget you are in the centre of a busy city.

I've stayed at many 5 star hotels but it's really the service that sets Hotel 41 apart. One afternoon Florent the Assistant Manager noticed I was trying to find a magazine to read from their collection in the lounge. He asked if there was anything specific I was looking for and I mentioned Vanity Fair. Five minutes later I was in possession of a brand new copy of the magazine. He had sent someone from housekeeping out to get it right away. Later that day we discussed other magazines I liked and the very next day there they where, waiting for me. It's this attention to detail and the customers needs that really set aside this fantastic hotel. All the staff where excellent, kind, helpful and generous. No task to big or too small. Get them to book your tickets to various attractions, its so much easier than doing it yourself and do walk down to Westminster Abby and the Houses of Parliament and pay them a visit. It's well worth it so is Buckingham Palace. As someone who lived in London for years I can't believe I have never visited these historic buildings. So glad we did this trip. The hotel is so well placed that my husband and I literally walked everywhere. To the West End, the London Eye, Parliament, Harrods, Oxford Street etc. Walking might not be your thing but it does show you how well placed the hotel is if you do fancy strolling through the streets to your destination.

The room we stayed in was lovely, spotlessly clean with an amazing comfortable bed. In the evening before going out we would have drinks in the lounge and each time we were served complementary canapés and mini croque monsieur bites that were to die for. The breakfasts were second to non and they have this wonderful area in the lounge where you can help yourself to complementary hot and cold food and deserts in the evening, all of a high standard. Saturday night after a show we just ate at from this area for free. It was all delicious. What a great option to have if you don't fancy eating with the crowds.

It's not super expensive for a 5 star hotel, we thought the cost was very reasonable and more importantly worth ever penny.  We can't wait to go back and visit Flourent and his brilliant team.",5,2016,08,30
137,The most incredible hotel!,"I chose Hotel 41 as the place to stay in London for my proposal weekend and I have to say that genuinely, I have never stayed at a hotel that delivers such exceptional service. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, everything was perfect. The room has amazing, the food available and served was incredible, the décor, the atmosphere and every single member of staff we spoke to were amazing. It is no surprise that this hotel has such a great reputation. Couldn’t fault anything during our stay and absolutely can’t wait to come back. The attentiveness and passion the staff deliver is out of this world. Thank you so much.",5,2016,08,30
137,Superb!,"Our first time at Hotel 41 we normally use the Savoy however on the back of Trip Adviser I thought we'd have a change for a surprise Anniversary weekend treat, I'm so glad we did. This hotel is superb but the thing that makes it above the rooms or executive lounge or the little things like a coffee or water on your way out is the staff. We cannot fault anyone they were amazing every single one! I honestly felt they were absolutely genuine and were completely interested in what you were or what you had done that day and it just makes the hotel. This is were so many other hotels fall down yes you can have the dazzling interiors etc but do you honestly feel valued every time you come in or leave?!. Simply amazing thank you Hotel 41 for a fantastic stay and we will be back!.",5,2016,08,29
137,Worth every penny! Best hotel I have ever stayed at...,"I have five years experience from a five star hotel, where the level of service was a huge priority. Going the extra mile was rewarded with cash bonuses! Nevertheless, I was immensely impressed by the service offered by the staff at Hotel 41. It always seemed genuine, relaxed and very proactive! Steven Jones and ??? particularly made us feel welcome, but all of the staff delivered excellent service.
It is expensive to stay at Hotel 41, but I can vouch for both the food, the beverages, the rooms and the service. You get what you pay for :)",5,2016,08,29
137,Undoubtedly the best,"We had been eagerly anticipating our stay at Hotel 41 due to the fact that our daughter had stayed there earlier this year and had nothing but the highest praise for the hotel and staff.

We arrived with high expectations but soon realized that those expectations would be exceeded due to the level of service provided by those that work there.

On arrival we were escorted to the 5th floor where we were quickly provided with two glasses of chilled champagne, greatly appreciated when the temperature outside was over 90F.

Check in was seamless and we were soon shown to our room. We were celebrating our silver wedding anniversary and had very kindly been upgraded to a split level suite. The suite was excellent, beautifully decorated and with every amenity you could wish for. There was already an anniversary cake, a bottle of champagne and some petit fours in the room for us. 

The executive lounge was very comfortable, a haven of tranquility and somewhere where it would have been easy to sit for hours on end without even leaving the hotel. 

We dined out that evening but when we got back to the hotel, there was an array of food available in the lounge. There was even a freshly made fish pie that we would have loved to have tried but we were still full from our evening meal. It was all beautifully presented and I am sure it would have tasted as good as it looked.

After a really good night’s sleep we went to the lounge for the best hotel breakfast we have ever had. Eggs benedict and another complimentary glass of pink fizz.

All too soon it was time to leave and at that stage we realized that we should have booked a longer stay. Having said that it does give us a reason to return.

Our experience was first class and will long live in our memories. However, it was the warmth and friendliness of all the staff which really made our stay special. Nothing was too much trouble and we both genuinely felt that everyone was doing their utmost to try and ensure we enjoyed ourselves. We cannot speak too highly of them and would recommend this hotel without hesitation. We have been fortunate to stay in some of the best hotels around the world but this was the best hotel experience we have ever had.",5,2016,08,29
137,Consistently Outstanding ,"This particular trip was unusual in that we had a few minor problems during our stay but so well were they handled, even this  experience merely highlighted how the very high standard of customer engagement by all staff at the hotel set create the type of differentiation that capital investment in the facilities alone cannot create. Florent, one of the front of house team rains a great asset to the hotel.",5,2016,08,28
137,"Stellar Hotel, Stellar Staff","If you are looking for old world charm and service, this is the hotel! #1, it is gorgeous. Black and white flooring and carpet, huge leather chairs, a library which has a buffet bar with lovely finger snacks and amazing  desserts. You will be greeted and have the door opened for you by wonderful staff. You will be treated with champagne upon check-in. Your room will have a lovely fruit tray, every morning and a paper in whatever language you choose.(upon request, which they inquire about upon check-in) There was always a little gift on the bed every day, sometimes a beauty product or a candy of some sort There are candy bowls at the front desk and also water bottles you can take as you head out to see the beautiful city ofLondon. The staff is SO wonderful; they all felt like family the first day, and we were actually sad to leave after 5 days. Any request is taken care of within 10 minutes. The staff will book tours for you, and have your receipt and info ready for you as you exit the hotel. The staff has a desk at the front of the hotel and also one in the executive lounge, which is on the floor the rooms are on, making info seeking a breeze. We stayed in the 2 level suite, with a Louvre-esque skylight...it was amazingly! This skylight allows you to look at the stars as you lay in bed, but also has a shield that can be closed to darken the room for early morning sleep. I cannot say enough great things about this hotel. If you have the means to splurge on a hotel that is a block from Buckingham Palace, look no further.",5,2016,08,27
137,Unadulterated Luxury,"The moment you reach the door of Hotel 41 you know you are in fora luxurious experience. From the warm greetings at the door to the attentive front desk staff on check in everything went really smoothly.

Our room was gorgeous, with deep soft pillows and the comfiest mattress I have ever slept on. The Hotel is only a 5 minute walk to the nearest station and there are lots of amenities close by.  Because we had reservations elsewhere we didn't eat here.",4,2016,08,25
137,Luxury all the way,"The hotel is very luxury with a lot of important details to be in perfect condition in comparison with other good hotels, were we have stayed. They take care of everything so much that you feel that you have to do while youa re there. It is a nice place to visit at least once when visiting London, as the price was quite, although we stayed only two days.",5,2016,08,24
137,Prepare to be stunned!,"Prepare to be stunned indeed, as soon as you enter this extraordinary hotel you will get the wow factor straight away.  Very near Buckingham Palace you yourself feel like royalty in these grand surroundings.",5,2016,08,23
137,Live like a Queen,"Hotel 41 will impress from the moment you are greeted at the door. Stayed here for two amazing nights in London. Make sure you put some time aside to enjoy the executive lounge. The room was perfect, can not fault the hotel and all the staff. Made my stay in London fabulous. Great Location. 8 minutes to the nearest train station. Hop on/off bus stop directly outside hotel. 30 min very easy walk to some great sites. If you have a special occasion or just want to splash some hotel 41 will not disappoint.",5,2016,08,22
137,Welcomed back like old friends,"If you ever need to feel special and have an amazing couple of days away , look no further than hotel 41, set next to Buckingham Palace , in the centre of London , the moment you walk through the doors you are treated and made to feel like a member of the royal family , 

Nothing is too much trouble and from the room cleaners through to the management of Lauren you could never bet made feel more special ,

Steve in charge of the daytime drinks etc is a star explaining how and what goes into your cocktail or letting you know where to eat and drink or socialise in the city, 

Thanks again and we will definitely be back .",5,2016,08,22
137,Wonderful Boutique Hotel,"41 Hotel is right behind Buckingham Palace and it is well situated for walking to any location in Central London.
The hotel is small and intimate. As such the staff know you from when you step inside the small lobby. All rooms are on the same floor with a hub called ""The Executive Lounge"". This is the where breakfast is taken, and drinks, snacks are constantly available. The concierge staff are truely wonderful to deal with. Restaurant or tour reservations were made with aplomb.",4,2016,08,22
137,Anniversary delight,"My husband and I spent our 11th anniversary here, while watching the cricket at the Oval.  It was a wonderful stay.  The rooms are spacious and clean, complimentary snacks in the lounge and the staff were second-to-none.  They were highly attentive: addressing us by name, asking about the match, and couldn't do enough for us.  Despite being hard-working, they also took the time to chat and make us feel welcome.  Plenty of friendly banter with Andrew in particular!
We would love to come back again soon.",5,2016,08,21
137,Wow!,"My wife and I were staying over two nights in London at the conclusion of a Baltic cruise, and I wanted a nice hotel to enjoy.  Reading reviews on TripAdvisor, I selected Hotel 41.  Best decision I ever made.  This hotel is AMAZING.  Not only is the location perfect (across the street from Buckingham Palace and two blocks from Victoria Station), but the lodgings are exceptional in size and furnishing.  Our room was the largest hotel room we have experienced.  And beautifully furnished in quality fixtures and a lovely black/white palette.  The executive lounge is open 24/7 and provides complimentary snacks, along with breakfast and complimentary evening munchies.  If you want to REALLY enjoy London, include a stay at Hotel 41 on your itinerary.  And the prices are not unreasonable!!",5,2016,08,20
137,The best hotel experience we have ever had.,"Without a doubt the experience at this hotel was amazing. Not only is the decor of hotel stunning, but the staff is undeniably the most attentive, professional, friendly, well informed staff I have ever encountered while traveling. My husband and I are a bit of what I would call hotel snobs. It is important to us to stay in nice hotels when we travel. I chose this hotel on trip advisor reviews. Specifically, one reviewer wrote, ""just book this hotel now, you won't be disappointed!"" Thank you very much to that reviewer because my experience at this hotel has made my trip to London a amazing! Starting from the door man walking up the block, seeing us exit our taxi with luggage, but due to construction, we were a small distance up the street. He escorted us into the hotel entryway, and then we were quickly and friendly escorted to a check in desk in the lounge, where we were promptly given champagne. The conversation at check in was friendly, open, cheerful. 
We were escorted to out room, and it really was stunning. The decor is a fusion of old english library and modern class. 
The hotel is very well located, within walking distance to almost everything, and the few things we didn't want to walk to, hopping on the bus was as easy as walking out the front door. We took a taxi on our theatre night , due to high heels, and that was easy too. 
The executive lounge is a lounge area where there is always something to munch on, and variety wines, alcohols, beers, and champagne. We had breakfast here every morning and the omelets are wonderful! Order a cafe late, it is perfect! We would come back to the lounge in the evening after a full day of exploring London and have a glass of champagne and desert. 
I want to thank Hotel 41 for making our vacation an amazing memory for us!",5,2016,08,19
137,Best kept secret,"I found Hotel 41 after a lot of searching for accommodation in London and I must say I picked the perfect place! Great location, wonderfully presented, friendly and helpful staff with an amazing level of service and attention.  Part of me would like to keep it a secret but my husband and I were so wowed by it that we have been telling everybody what a wonderful hotel it is. The staff really went out of their way to look after us organising theatre tickets, train tickets, late checkouts and even access to a courtesy room on our final day.  It met and exceeded all our expectations and was well worth the money.",5,2016,08,18
137,Loved it!!!,"Best service, perfect rooms!! The hotel itself was beautiful, clean and welcoming. Thank you for making our stay amazing. Me and my husband will be looking forward to be back soon. Best Hotel to stay.",5,2016,08,18
137,Probably the best Hotel we have stayed in,"We kept looking at this Hotel before booking, partly because TripAdvisor had rated it No. 1.  We could not agree more.  Everyone was great to us & our Family.  We had Grandchildren with us, ages 10-13.  They loved the Hotel also & the Executive Lounge where there were free snacks all day!  The Staff was absolutely great & attentive.  If we are back in London, we will be back.",5,2016,08,17
137,Absolutely Stunning.,"When I knew I had business coming up in London I decided to extend the trip and take some extra time to explore the city with my girlfriend (who had never been to Europe.) In order to ensure she had the perfect experience I began to research various accommodations and taking recommendations from friends and colleagues. It became evident very early in the process that Hotel 41 was the perfect location. 

The staff contacted us prior to arrival to ensure we would feel as comfortable in our rooms as possible. They were polite, personable and professional (which was a welcome change from feeling like ""just another guest."") Each of the staff members remembered both my name as well as my girlfriends and greeted us each day in passing and at the arrival and departure from the hotel. Wait staff in the executive lounge were impeccable as well, ensuring each of our needs were taken care of promptly. 

The hotel itself was beautiful. Clean, decorative and welcoming, it certainly set the standard for the rest of the trip. A very short walk to Buckingham Palace as well as many of the city's Royal Parks was perfect, especially given our impeccable weather. 

I can honestly say I would not have changed a thing. While London itself is an amazing trip Hotel 41 was the perfect compliment and made the trip that much more perfect. Thank you to the staff and we look forward to returning shortly!",5,2016,08,17
137,Never been so well looked after,"Have to admit this place was amazing, nothing short of the best place I have ever stayed in. Thank you for making our holiday so special  by looking after us with first class service  always with a smile and we hope to return one day soon. Anyone wanting to stay in London then go no further than here 
 😊
",5,2016,08,16
137,Amazing,I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff of this hotel for the warm and care they gave me during my stay her. Rooms are clean and spacious. Its very luxury treatment and luxury style of life. So great experience that will be a memorable time for me.,5,2016,08,16
137,One week of pure joy,"From the time we entered the front of the hotel until the final day's departure, we felt like the staff really tried to make our stay enjoyable.  From the breakfast (which was included with our room) to the assortment of newspapers to the staff continually asking if there was anything that they could do for us, such as offer maps, directions to nearby points of interest. Believe me, there are plenty of points of interest, many within walking distance. One thing that stands out to me is the shower.  There is so much water coming from the shower it feels like someone dumping a bucket of water on your head.  It seems that the hot water comes on immediately and one does not have to wait for it to warm up.  Another thing is that the location is great.  It is only a couple of blocks to Victoria Station (one of London's larger subway stations),  We took it to Kensington Palace (for tour of the palace and a tea at the Orangery),  We took it to the British Museum and also to a theatre.  We purchased the Oyster Card (for travel on subway (tube) or bus and just before leaving we went into Victoria Station and got a refund for unused travel on both of our cards.  We were walking distance to Westminster Abbey, Churchill's War Rooms, the Thames River (for a river cruise) and the eye.  The amount of tourists in all of these locations were sometimes crushing but everyone seemed to be having a great time.  Crossing the streets were sometimes challenging since they do drive on the left so on the streets at crossings many times there were marked on the pavement ""Look left""  or ""look right"".  On streets that were more or less straight you could walk across even if light was red, however, many times the streets had a curve and one could not see so far and on those, it was better to wait for the light.  We purchased a bus trip to Warwick Castle, Stratford Upon Avon and Oxford and were picked up in the lobby of the hotel.  It took nearly the whole day but was worth every penny (pence?)",5,2016,08,15
137,Service beyond expectatoins,"I can not tell you the last time my partner and I were pampered with this amount of quality service. The minute we checked in to the minute we checked out, the service was impeccable. Classy and sophisticated. The staff was friendly, knowledgable and the best in the hospitality industry, they were there to assist at every need. The executive lounge was a treat in itself, a place to relax with a cocktail and a light snack and a place to meet new friends. Our suite accommodations were clean, tastefully decorated, as was the complete hotel. I will certainly choose Red Carnation Hotels in my future travels. As for the location, you couldn't get any closer to the Queen's Buckingham Palace, right across the street. We found it to be centrally located for our travels.",5,2016,08,15
137,A Palace across from the Palace!,"If you are looking for a hotel where you are treated like a King & Queen, you have found it here! My husband and I are returning from a 5 night stay at Hotel 41 and hands down this is the best hotel we have ever experienced. From the 5 star service, staff attentiveness, pristine cleanliness, warm hospitality, and exceptional experience you are looking for Hotel 41 is the Palace across from the Palace. The afternoon tea, evening happy hours, and Belgian waffles at breakfast were an added touch. Just be prepared to make your hotel stay an annual trip, you won't want to leave.",5,2016,08,15
137,Amazing from start to finish,"My husband and I booked the 'Night to remember' package in honour of our wedding anniversary and birthdays as a romantic break. From the moment we were sat down in the executive lounge with a glass of champagne to register, until we were loaded up with water, sweets and an extra cake to take home and share with our young children when we checked out, the hotel exceeded every expectation. 

This hotel has managed hit the nail on the head in every single area. The rooms and lounge are decorated beautifully without being ostentatious, the atmosphere is relaxed even you know you are staying somewhere really special and the staff are extremely attentive without being intrusive. The food in the plunder the pantry was absolutely wonderful, and the extras we got as part of our package were lovely - little presents, chocolates, champagne and romantic turn down with candles and roses and the afternoon tea we had was just divine.

It was the staff that really made the experience unlike anything we have ever had in a 5 star hotel previously - they were not only friendly but they went above and beyond in every respect. Without us even having to ask they printed us out directions to the theatre we were going to, offered to get us taxis, anticipated very need we might have as well as providing us with a bag for sweets to take home for our children. 

We have already planned to go back next year but stay longer!",5,2016,08,15
137,Fantastic experience,Where do I start this hotel is just incredible from the luxury rooms to the attentive and friendly staff stayed here in December 2015 and wasn't sure what to expect. From the moment we arrived we felt like royalty such a beautiful place with excellent staff that couldn't do enough for us . Champagne on arrival chocolates and cards in our room we where up graded to a junior suite which was beautiful. After spending the evening out we returned to our room to find the fire lit and classical music playing slippers layed out by the bed and night cream on the pillows this place is very special. Throughout the day you can graze on canapés fruit and snacks which are fab all included with your stay we even had hot white chocolate given to us on our way out for a morning walk this hotel has thought of everything for the perfect get away hope to return again someday highly recommend this for that very special occasion .,5,2016,08,14
137,Treated like royalty,"My husband and I are trying to remember a time we've ever been so taken care of.  We've traveled to some of the best hotels all over the world and have yet to find a place that made us feel so over the top luxurious, yet so warm; much like staying in someone's home.  The staff is phenomenal, the rooms and accommodations cozy and chic, and all the treats and food divine.  We cannot wait to return.  We find no other reason to stay anywhere else in London.",5,2016,08,11
137,Boutique Beauty,"If you are looking for awesome customer service, location, impressive decor you are looking in the right place. Our 3 night stay at Hotel 41 delivered all this and then some.  We had a 2 story king bed suite and it was so sophisticated.  This hotel is on the 5th floor of a building attached to another hotel and an excellent restaurant. The Executive Lounge on the 5th floor is bright and warmly decorated just as you would expect of a British living room.  The ""bbar"" restaurant next door has wonderful food, drinks and very cool decor.  Service here was just as great at next door at Hotel 41.  Another great feature is the location, right on the back side of Buckingham Palace.  Nice walking distance to some many pubs and super people watching.  Would definitely recommend this hotel to all.",5,2016,08,11
137,"Amazing location, amazing service","If you like a full-service experience, this is your place. Wow. I've never experienced anything like it. They offer service beyond compare: want tea outside of the normal hours? Want your bags packed before you leave? Want your car brought around, gassed up? We didn't test them, but as far as I could tell, there was nothing (legal) this staff wouldn't do. They were so friendly, to us and to our kids--and so ridiculously helpful. Oh, and that afternoon tea is amazing. They even have gluten-free scones. Breakfast buffet wasn't big, but had a wide variety of things. Don't come to this hotel if you are looking for big hotel service (impersonal). This is a relatively small hotel, located on one floor of a building (with an entrance on the street level). Gorgeous interiors. Comfortable bed. Air conditioning that actually worked well. Housekeepers that know how to clean. Candy/snacks available 24/7 (really, what else do you need? :-)). I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,08,11
137,THE BEST HOTEL IN LONDON,"My First impression of this hotel is the staff , they will ""WOW"" or more than ""WOW"" you!! Then when you settle in the room the ambience of the room, preparations made for you, welcome gifts, cleanliness, products & everything else in the room are just exceptional. The ""WOW"" service starts from the moment you book this hotel until you leave the hotel.
The location of this hotel is very central and walking distance to everywhere. It is a definite that i will come back to this hotel as they are so call ""THE BEST IN LONDON"" in my hotel stay list. It is rather weird that i don't feel sad to leave London but i am sad to leave Hotel 41 during my departure back to Singapore. All travellers out there if you are looking for an accomodation in London this place will ""WOW"" you!  

Regards,
Mr Loh.",5,2016,08,11
137,Best of the Boutique Hotels,"This was the first time we brought our teenage girls to Europe and feel Hotel 41 set a high bar for future visits.  The rooms were relatively large with beautifully appointed black and white decor.  Neither room had much of a view (we had interior courtyard rooms), which didn't matter since we were out touring during the day.  What sets this hotel apart from any other we have stayed was the SERVICE!  This hotel should be a template for every other hotel to aspire.  First, there is a front door/lobby that is always locked and requires one to be buzzed in.  It is right across the street from Buckingham palace so the area feels very safe.  The rooms are on the 5th floor, which is the top floor, so you ride the elevator up to be checked in and led to your room.  Since there are no other floors above you so it is extremely quiet.  The staff to guest ratio seems high and they learn your name quickly.  We were running late due to a flight delay so they met us at the street with our Buckingham palace tickets and took our luggage from the taxi all with a quick and simple call.  Our daughters loved the food at Hotel 41 and requested to go there for dinner one night after sub-par meals from the local restaurants.  Their favorite part was the free ice cream cups that were kept in a community refrigerator in the lounge.  They also have an ""honor"" bar that is open 24/7 and where you write your name in a book with your drink selection.  All throughout the day they had food available from popcorn, nuts, candy, olives, to small appetizers that included delicious croque monsieur.  Stefan, the manager, was a delight and very personable, as was the whole staff.  Our package through our travel agent had wine when we checked in and a little something every night.  One night we had brownies with caramel and another night candles with Crabtree and Evelyn soaps.  We continued on to Paris after London and I have to admit, the girls were hoping the high bar would be maintained but while it was still high, it was comparable to Hotel 41.  The hotel is not inexpensive, but like most things, you hope to get what you pay for, but many times it fails to deliver - not Hotel 41.  We had a very special trip and we owe a lot of it to the team at Hotel 41. ",5,2016,08,10
137,Beyond Expectations ,"I knew from previous postings that the service at Hotel 41 was going to be superlative. What I didn't expect was that our experience would be the best three night stay we'd ever had anywhere in the world. We arrived from the US after a long, tedious flight, almost two hours in customs, and a driver from a car service who decided not to wait for us and left us stranded at the airport.  We walked into Hotel 41 tired, cranky and disheveled at about 10:00 am, and immediately everything changed. Our bags were taken for us and we were guided into the executive lounge where we were made to feel as though we were the only guests in the hotel, or at least the only ones who mattered. We were seated in comfortable chairs and immediately offered a choice of four lovely champagnes, including Veuve Clicquot and other comparable labels by Stefan, a charming fellow, who along with Andrew, another staff member, joked with each other and had us laughing and relaxing in no time.
All good hotels offer outstanding amenities, but never had we been anywhere that offered us a courtesy room until our own room was ready. This courtesy room turned out to be a smaller room in the hotel where we could shower, nap, clean up, etc. and all of our bags were waiting for us in the room as well. What a Godsend! In our exhausted state, it took about five minutes before we passed out, only to be woken two hours later with the news that our room was ready.
The room was gorgeous and both the tub and shower were filled with wonderful toiletries and amenities such as a heated towel rack, dental kits, a shaving kit, etc.
When we returned the second evening, the room was lit in soft tea candles surrounded by red rose petals and soothing music coming from the Bose stereo.
I would be remiss in my review if I were to leave out a discussion of their ""plunder the pantry"" option, which essentially provided a complementary buffet of hot and cold appetizers and desserts until midnight or so. That buffet was better than just about anything else we ate while in London.
There was literally nothing that the staff wouldn't do for us, from replacing my curling iron to getting theater tickets to facilitating both our arrival and departure. There's a reason these folks keep winning the top honors in TripAdvisor and Travel and Leisure. If we're ever lucky enough to get back to London, there's no where else I'd rather stay.",5,2016,08,08
137,"Great hotel, amazing staff","It's not just the comfortable beds, soft linens, fluffy towels, excellent coffee and countless other amenities that make this a great hotel.  It's the remarkable staff.  From the moment we ""checked in"" we were treated to warm, greeting smiles.  Check in isn't what you typically experience in a hotel.  We were escorted to the 5th floor where we sat in comfortable chairs and discussed what we wanted to see and do.  Somewhere during that time a credit card imprint was taken.  We enjoyed champagne and snacks while we planned our activities.  The restaurant recommendations were spot on as was their suggestion that we tour Buckingham Palace.  The staff at the 41 truly enjoy what they do.  We'll be back.",5,2016,08,06
137,"Still Exceptional at ""41""","It was 2 years since we had our first memorable stay at Hotel 41.  Back then we wrote about getting what you paid for...which was a very attentive staff and attention to detail and it being worth the ""splurge"" though you could easily do math to justify it not being that much more expensive than alternatives for what is included.

Today I am writing from my Hotel 41 room before we leave after a short 1 night layover prior to a longer vacation.  This update is even more positive than our 2014 visit.  After 25 years of travel, we had the misfortune of our airline not having our luggage join us on our international flight.  We were facing a 12 day vacation with nothing but the clothes on our back!  Clearly not the way to start a trip.  The 41 team didn't seem to care this was a 1 night room stay and acted like it was their own missing luggage and took it very personal.  We really felt like we had people in our corner to try to solve the problem.  I won't belabor the details.  In the end the bags arrived a few minutes ago, about an hour before our planned checkout.

We were sad to hear a few of our ""friends"" from 41 had moved on since 2014 (I hear turnover is not common at this hotel), but our other friends (e.g. Florent and Stefan) remain and new ones (Adele and Steve) have joined the team and are really standouts.  I really can't imagine coming to London in the future and not staying at this ""home away from home.""  The warmth that exudes from the entire 41 team (too many to call out by name), will never be lost on my wife and me.

Don't hesitate, just book this hotel, don't look back.  Don't expect glitzy, modern or hip.  Just high quality, classy, attentive friends who treat you like family and take your satisfaction incredibly personal.",5,2016,08,04
137,An oasis of luxurious calm.,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for two nights as part of our Ruby Wedding Anniversary (40 years). From the greeting at reception to the organisation of our departure taxi, amid the chaos of local road closures, everything was perfect.

We arrived just before midday and our room was ready a few minutes after check in and a welcoming drink. We unpacked and returned to the executive lounge for some lunch including a delicious wild mushroom ravioli and 
snacks.

After spending the afternoon with our daughter in Richmond and a lovely Italian dinner we returned for further snacks and ice cream before sinking into the large comfortable bed.

Breakfast was freshly cooked and very tasty with lots of choices. Pocket snacks and sweets loaded we were ready for a walk to the British Museum... we are keen walkers! However we met with a few diversions caused by Bike London but it was a lot of fun.

Back in time for freshly baked scones and home made jam with clotted cream in the lounge with a few other nibbles..

Freshened up in the sumptuous bathroom suite we took the chilled water offered in reception for our walk to the Piccadilly Theatre to see Jersey Boys, one of our favourite shows, for the third time.

After a great show we walked back with a diversion around Green Park caused by a security alert which was well handled and not a problem.

On arrival back at our room we found that the hotel had decorated our room with rose petals and candles and had made us a rich chocolate cake and butter cream Victoria sponge cake to celebrate our special occasion. Very kind of them and much appreciated.

A late visit to the lounge for supper of roast beef, salmon lovely bread and some drinks and a take-away ice cream finished a great day.

Our departure day gave another opportunity to sample the breakfast menu followed by a walk round the shops of Regent Street, Carnaby Street and Oxford Street before strolling down Park Lanne back to Green Park. Passing Buckingham Palace just as they were changing the guard we had time to freshen up before our final taxi departure.

Congratulations to all the staff for their commitment and enthusiasm which created great memories for my wife and I.",5,2016,08,03
137,The best hotel we've ever stayed in!,"The second you step foot through the door, you know you've made the best decision of your life to stay in this Hotel! The staff are exemplary and nothing is too much trouble (and I don't think we've been called Sir or Madam so much in our lives!). 

We stayed at the Hotel as a surprise for my Husband's birthday and from the welcome champagne to the romantic turndown service (which they instead organised for us for when we arrived instead of at the end of the evening) we were totally blown away by it all. 

Our room was a King room, the bed so enormous and so comfy as well as the pillows which allowed us a welcome night's sleep away from our children! It was impeccably clean and spacious. We loved the laid back atmosphere of the Executive Lounge with all the wonderful touches such as sweets and the plunder the pantry!

However the highlight for us was all the staff we encountered. Everyone knowing our names as we passed by them in the corridor, the cheery smiles, the funny stories and bend over backwards service was nothing we've ever experienced in our lives before. We have stayed in a few ""5 Star"" properties but never witnessed service like this - for us it was 6 Star all the way.

We cannot wait to stay again and would absolutely recommend this Hotel to anyone wanting the best that London can offer.",5,2016,08,03
137,Nothing is a problem!,"We travel to London quite often, and we've tried many luxury hotels.  Nowhere could you find better service than at Hotel 41.  Everything was superb, but an example of the service is breakfast on our last day.  We had a cooked breakfast included in our room rate, but we needed to head for Heathrow by 6:00 a.m.  We asked if a box of rolls, fruit, etc. could be made up for us to take with us.  The staff member reminded us that we could have a cooked breakfast, but we said we didn't have time.  He asked what time we would need our breakfast and we told him we would have to eat by 5:30.  This was not a problem, he responded, as the chef arrives at 5.  He took our order.  The next day we seated ourselves in the lounge at 5:25 a.m., and exactly at 5:30 a staff member appeared with our breakfasts.  Unbelievable!

We know that if there is any issue, the staff at the 41 would be happy to assist us.  We are booked for the end of this month for four days and cannot wait to be spoiled again!",5,2016,08,02
137,"Best Hotel, Best Service and Best Hotel Staff Ever","We just concluded a stay of 9 days in this fine hotel. We had stayed at another Red Carnation Hotel in downtown London 6 years ago, but the #1 ranking of the 41 Hotel caused us to book at this fine hotel. We booked a junior suite, which has a main floor sitting room with TV and fireplace and an upstairs bedroom with ensuite bathroom and desk. The junior suite was simply lovely and comfortable. But, what clearly makes this hotel a #1 ranked hotel is the extremely high level of professionalism, service and friendly demeanor of all hotel staff, which were extremely helpful regarding recommendations of restaurants, tourist sites and our questions in general. Of all the hotels we have stayed in, we feel this is the highest quality staff of employees we have ever experienced. 41 Hotel / Red Carnation Hotels have found the key to hiring and training relatively young staff, who know how to treat high level customers. We also believe that the number of hotel staff to guests is the highest we have seen, including the reception area at the front  door, the reception area in the main room, wait staff attending to food and drinks, maids, valets, management and many others. All in all, our overall experience was an extreme joy and the staff of 41 Hotel should be congratulated on the extremely high level of service they provide to hotel guests such as ourselves. We send our sincerest thanks and gratitude to everyone at the hotel, for a very lovely and pleasant stay at the fine 41 Hotel. Red Carnation Hotels should also be very proud, since they have the #1, #3 and #80 ranked hotels in the top 100 hotels in London.",5,2016,08,02
137,BEST HOTEL EVER,great customer service. best hotel i have stayed at in london. From the amenities in the room to the executive lounge they more than exceeded my expectations. Everyone had a smile on their face and went out of their way to help make my trip the best it could be,5,2016,08,02
137,Absolutely amazing,"Hotel 41 was absolutely amazing. The service was top notch.  Rooms were very clean and the staff very friendly and really catered to your every need.  We arrived early in the morning and of course our room wasn't ready that early (9am), so they put us in a temporary room to be able to get cleaned up, nap, whatever while our real room was being prepared. That is what I call amazing service. No other hotel has ever done that. Food was amazing. Breakfast, snack, dinner snack--all amazing. They would also give you water on your way out for your day travels as well as snacks!  The service was impeccable. They knew you by name, which adds a personal touch. Location was perfect and there is a money exchange place about 10 minutes away that will give you THE best rate that I found anywhere--including Paris and Rome. I would give this hotel 6 stars out of 5, if I could.",5,2016,08,01
137,Fantastic Stay!,"During the week of the French Open I had the opportunity and pleasure to stay at Hotel 41, booking two rooms for four days total. I have stayed in London four or five times over the last six years, though this was my first visit to Hotel 41. I can only say my visit was the best I have had in London. The staff was amazing from start to finish. We were made to feel welcomed the minute we walked through the door. The room was exceptionally clean and comfortable. The television remote was a bit hard to navigate, definitely a user issue. :-). Plunder the pantry? - more like plundering a gourmet meal. There was never a need to go out for dinner, the food and treats were exceptional. The seafood pie and the pistachio deserts deserve special mention. I am returning to London next year and will stay at Hotel 41 again!",5,2016,07,31
137,The best little gem in the world!,"I have traveled to London before, but the one place I wanted to revisit and introduce my son to Hotel 41.  I had a visit there earlier with my sister and daughter. I believe it is a place that one has to experience in order to understand how truly special it is.  It is not just a hotel. It is a place you can call home - a place to relax, a place to unwind, and a place to feel uniquely special.  The salient feature is the staff.  They are efficient in their job, caring, and personnel. I always look forward to seeing one of the managers - Florent.  He exudes warmth, passion for his job, and true interest in his guests. He always makes us feel so special and my son noticed it right away. I barely mentioned how my son't birthday was coming up in a few days and me arranged a beautiful cake to be made in his honor.  It was such a great surprise to both of us and it truly made our night.  The warmth and hospitality exudes from every staff member. We enjoyed many meals, as well. The lounge area that the meals are served in is quaint and welcoming. Breakfast is delightful, tea time is scrumptious, and dinner is relaxing and delicious. After a long day of touring London, we looked forward to returning and enjoying some leisure time at Hotel 41.  A perfect place to be at the end of every day.  I look forward to many returns.  A special thanx for everyone that made our trip so special.",5,2016,07,31
137,Unique,"Simply the Best. If You want personal 24 hour service in unique envinroment, this is the Place to go. Staff is just for You and You only. Near everything You want to go in London. Just ask the Staff, they will fix everything for You.. Be relaxed and enjoy Your staying.",5,2016,07,31
137,Game changer! ,"We have just spent the most perfect two nights at Hotel 41. From the moment you step out of the cab the whole experience is amazing. The staff are truly unbelievable, friendly, helpful, engaging and will go the extra 100 miles for you. We were made to feel really special for the whole stay and this is an experience we will never forget. We were treated to the master suite with an incredible glass ceiling, lounge area and dressing room. Unbelievable! The hotel lounge area is like being in a cosy, seriously well decorated livingroom and the pantry is like a dream! We had an amazing few days exploring the city and found ourselves really looking forward to going ""home"" as we called it! This is what this place is like...a home away from home. Perhaps we will sell up and move into Hotel 41!! So if you were wondering if it lives up to the hype...it does...and then some! Enjoy!! ",5,2016,07,30
137,A True Gem especially for people who love quiet,"We prefer staying at boutique hotels and this one is the epitome. The staff is exceptional. It was the best choice we could have made. 
The bed was so comfortable and the bathroom was spotless and beautifully white. 
Florent (Flo) helped us with reservations including Alain Ducasse. He was a valuable asset to us on our London leg of the trip. 
The best part of this hotel is stepping off the busy, energized and loud London Street into this beautifully quiet cocoon. ",5,2016,07,30
137,There and Back Again..... with trophies!,"After a gap of several months while recovering from my surgery, we happily entered the portals of 41 to a warm welcome home.  We stayed in a delightful room with easy access for (my temporary) disability, sitting area and a bathroom with low (for wheelchair) fittings, walk-in shower and adjustable support rails for the loo.  We were not going anywhere on this visit.  We just needed to be pampered and that is exactly what happened, as always.  Our arrival champagne was to hand, and we had a short rest in the bedroom before emerging to join residents in the Executive Lounge for evening drinks and canapes, which were delicious.  An extended chat with long-standing friend Stefan, and a visit from the GM, Malcolm Hendry ensued, and then we chose items from the complimentary Raid the Pantry and retired to our room.  A few moments after we had settled in the sitting area, three members of staff entered bearing our chosen dishes of sweet and sour pork on rice followed by a cheese plate and accompanied by a good South African red wine.  The feast was further enhanced by fruit and chocolates, and we stumbled into bed replete and happy.  A slumber of  peace and tranquillity ensued and we awoke next morning ready for a delightful breakfast of crispy bacon and baby vine tomatoes (him) and perfect scrambled eggs on wholemeal toast with English sausage (me).  Visits from Lauren and Adele and Andrew to renew acquaintance at the table, and it was time to leave once more.  

We overheard a mention of awards:  Awaited were trophies from the Travel and Leisure Awards in New York.  Hotel 41 has won against such goliaths of the industry - The Goring, The Lanesborough and 41’s sister RC hotel, The Milestone - to come top of Hotels in London.  Team 41 should be justly proud – and we are proud of them.  Well done, all of you.  See you in next month, and monthly from then on as usual.",5,2016,07,30
137,A fantastic place to stay!,"Or room (a suite) was just wonderful and relaxing, the location is great, and the staff was the best!  The lounge is a great place to have afternoon tea, or dinner and was great for prepping to go out!",5,2016,07,29
137,Worth the splurge!  Can’t wait to return,"We had an absolutely wonderful one-night stay at 41 at the end of our 2 week UK vacation.   My husband and I have demanding jobs and are rarely able to take time away, so when we vacation, we really like to splurge on relaxing experiences.  We felt so pampered from the minute that we entered 41!  We knew from the hotel description that this would be wonderful, but we were really extremely impressed with the whole experience.  The entire staff at this hotel are extremely warm and friendly – genuinely so, and not just putting on a show.  You are greeted by name by all the staff, and I was amazed that they all remembered details of our conversations, and would ask how we enjoyed the activities or meals that we experienced during our stay.  We were offered a glass of champagne on arrival (from a selection of 5 different styles of Champagne!).  They have an amazing buffet of complimentary snacks, desserts and an ice cream case, as well as a full bar (not complimentary), on offer at all times, with really impressive selections. The breakfast was excellent, and the executive lounge where all the meals are served was so comfortable and relaxing.  They also seemed to be able to anticipate our every desire, and would take care of things before we even thought to ask – such as refilling our drinks and transporting our luggage to and from the hotel’s front door – and all without being intrusive.  The room (4108) was a little small (not unusual for European hotels), but it offered an actual King size bed (American-sized King, and not the smaller European version of a “king” bed) with high thread count cotton sheets that had been impeccably ironed for the ultimate in silkiness.  Very nice rain head shower with excellent water pressure.  The hotel is also very well situated across from Buckingham Palace, and easy walking distance to parks (Green Park, St James Park and Hyde Park), parliament, Westminster Abbey and the London Eye.  My husband enjoyed a great morning run through the parks.  I really wish we had been able to have a longer stay at 41 – we will definitely be returning!",5,2016,07,28
137,Hidden gem,"Great place to stay with fabulous service. The luxury starts from the moment you arrive with a lovely welcome. Special mention to the lovely Andrew and his brilliant conversation, made us feel at home. Afternoon tea was a scrumptuous delight and the lounge was a great place to relax. All the staff that we met were brilliant and made us feel at home. Highly recommended ",5,2016,07,28
137,Best Service and Staff Ever!,"We stayed here a couple of weeks ago for a week, because my husbands' bucket list was Wimbledon. The staff here was the best ever from any hotel we have ever stayed at. We have stayed at many Four Season's resorts and have to say that the staff here was even better. Adele and Stefan and Florent went so far above and beyond any expectations. The breakfast with Stefan was always the best and his personality was so refreshing every morning. He always had great advice for us. For dinner Adele and Florent and the rest of the front desk staff was always so happy to help us and what we wanted. They always had great recommendations for us. We loved staying there. The food was always the best. I loved the breakfast tea and the tea any time of the day. From now on anytime we go to London, we will be staying here. We used to stay at the Charlotte Street Hotel and the location and service at Hotel 41 blows it out of the water. I love London and this hotel makes me love it even more! Thank you for making our 20th Anniversary extra special!",5,2016,07,27
137,An outstanding experience,Hotel 41 is one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed at.  The staff were very gracious and went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable.  The location was very centrally located.  I would almost go so far as to say that it was worthwhile to visit London just to stay at the Hotel 41.  Thank you for a wonderful stay.,5,2016,07,26
137,"Lush, plush and totally wonderful","I've stayed in many hotels, world wide, in my life but Hotel 41 was by far the nicest experience ever. It was obvious the staff really enjoyed their jobs and that enthusiasm showed in their pleasant attitudes, whether it was early morning or late at night. The attention to detail was fantastic... but best of all... BEST of ALL... were the Lindt lindors you could have all through the afternoon and night! My favourite chocolate ever! Oh yes... if you love quality, good service and chocolate, then this is the place for you!",5,2016,07,25
137,Fantastic place to stay while exploring London,"It was our first trip to London so after reading the rave reviews of others we went for Hotel 41 - wow. It was perfectly situated near Victoria station, and I can only echo every other reviewer in our praise for the staff and hotel itself. We will be trying to perfect the signature pre dinner toasted sandwich snack until we are lucky enough to return. The staff were great at recommending things to do and places to eat. Tip - absolutely book tickets to the Book of Mormon while in London, amazing show. We will see you again next year! ",5,2016,07,25
137,Outstanding....,"As friends were getting married in London we decided to make a long weekend of it. We spent ages looking at hotels and kept coming back to 41. Not cheap but amazing reviews and ideally located. So we decided on 41. Boy are we glad we did. Absolutely amazing service from the minute you arrive until even after you have checked out. After a short flight down from Edinburgh and a hot trip on the Tube from City Airport we were warmly met at the front door by the concierge who was expecting us and welcomed us by name. Great start which got even better. Left our bags which later appeared in our room. We were shown up to reception where the first question was.... white or rose champagne - bliss.  Our room was even better than we had anticipated. On the first night our room was turned down beautifully with candles, rose petals and petit fours . Every night we had a simple His and Hers pressies left on our pillows. The night of the wedding I received temple balm for sore heads - brilliant. We were asked which morning paper we would like and jokingly said as a Scotsman would not be possible the Telegraph would be fine. Well we  turned up for breakfast and there was Andrew with Scotsman in hand. It would be unforgivable not to mention the Executive lounge where all the food delights take place. Three words - plunder the pantry. Stay at 41 and savour the delights. Finally a small but welcomed final touch. We checked out at 12 and as we were going for a walk in St James Park the hotel agreed to keep our cases. When we arrived back to collect our cases we were offered coffee and snacks before we set off. We had freshly squeezed orange juice with no question of being charged for this. Every member of staff was friendly and professional. How did every member of staff know who we were .... Top class service and simply the best hotel we have ever stayed in. We will be back. ",5,2016,07,23
137,A London Jewelbox,"The Hotel 41 in London is a small hotel with the ambience of a private club.  The staff create an atmosphere that is welcoming (starting with a glass of exceptional champagne at reception), friendly, unobtrusive and consistently helpful in every way.  The goal is to exceed guests expectations and that was accomplished repeatedly during our five night stay.  For anyone looking for something special in London, this is it.",5,2016,07,23
137,Anaphylactic Egg Allergy ,"Quite simply, this is the greatest accommodation we've ever had. The hotel itself is beautiful, wonderful rooms, exceptionally clean, amazing location, etc, etc. However, what makes 41 truly amazing is its staff. 

The people that work here are the most warm and welcoming people we've ever come across. Every single member of the team from the front door, to reception, to food and bar staff or cleaning staff - all the same - kind, professional, wonderful people. In particular, Florent, was our contact with the hotel for months prior to our trip and was accommodating to our every need. My wife and I were traveling with our 1.5 year old daughter, Hunter, who has an anaphylactic allergy to egg. When we mentioned this to Florent before our arrival, he personally took it upon himself to ensure that Hunter was taken care of while we were staying at 41. Florent had special meals and snacks personally prepared for Hunter, packed her safe and healthy lunches for days we went out touring the city. Florent took our daughters health and safety as seriously as we do, and I can honestly say, my wife and I never had to worry because we trusted him so much. Furthermore, he also bought her a stuffed Corgie from Buckingham Palace - now named ""Flo."" Even though Florent was our main go-to at the hotel, I certainly must mention a few others who were just as caring to Hunter: Magdalena, Stefan, Andrew, Gina, and really, every other staff member. 

We absolutely loved our time at 41 and hated to leave. It's one of our favourite places in the world. 

Matt, Lindsay, and Hunter (From Canada). ",5,2016,07,21
137,40th wedding anniversary treat,"What a wonderful unique experience. All hotels should be like this. Most can only dream......

First of all, the ultimate in civilised champagne check in 'event' (made to feel as important as if signing an Act of Parliament!) and accompanying delicious food attended by smartly dressed staff.

Room immaculate with great showers. So quiet given that you're in the heart of London.

Stayed for 2 nights and took advantage of the sumptuous buffet for our evening meals. Just like having a 3/4 course meal in a smart restaurant.

As good a hotel (if not better) as we've ever stayed in. Can't compliment the staff enough. Lovely to see people really enjoying being at work. This has been a real treat.

Thank you.",5,2016,07,21
137,Top class,"What a wonderful place. If you want excellent personal service where nothing is too much trouble balanced with a genuine warm welcome this is the one for you. Extremely comfortable rooms, fantastic executive lounge, superb quality food and drinks and that personal touch. Perfect.",5,2016,07,21
137,There are not enough words...,"You know how you read reviews on Tripadvisor that eulogise somewhere, and you think ""yeah, right, it can't be that good"". Well. When people praise Hotel 41 to the heavens, tell you the staff seem to be mind readers as they meet needs you didn't even know you had, little personal touches and surprises just for you, the friendly professionalism of every single member of staff, the plundering the pantry - oh my.  Hotel 41 exceeded my very high expectations by some distance.  We love staying in 5 star hotels, but this small, intimate, luxurious, comfortable and welcoming hotel beats them all.  Whoever is in charge of choosing staff and then training them: bravo!  I cannot wait to return. ",5,2016,07,18
137,Luxury with Superior Friendly Service,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for two nights.  From the moment we arrived, the staff was so friendly and welcoming.  We were greeted downstairs and then escorted to the executive lounge for champagne and check-in.  Our room had been upgraded to a junior suite, and we found welcome sweet treats and a personal note.  We had asked about the train strikes as we were going to use the Gatwick Express to the airport, and they kept us apprised of the situation.  Breakfast was very nice.  Full English was included with our room, but we just opted for the continental each day.  I wish we would have had more time to spend at the hotel to take advantage of all the wonderful treats/snacks they provide throughout the day in the executive lounge.  They even have an ice cream freezer!  The location is very good as well.  Adjacent to Buckingham Palace and walking distance to many attractions.  We even walked along the Victoria Embankment, across Millennium Bridge to the Globe.  A wonderful 5-star luxury property whose staff makes you feel at home - Bravo!",5,2016,07,17
137,You can't ask for more,"Hotel 41 is by far the best hotel I've ever visited. The staff is amazing. Everyone knew our names and what we had done that day, even if we had never met them before. They offered suggestions for fun things to do during our trip. They got us multiple restaurant reservations at great places as well as fantastic Wimbledon tickets. They did everything in their power to make sure we had a great trip. Will definitely stay here again when I come back to London, because after staying here, there is nowhere better. Special thanks to Andrew, Mitch, Cyprian, Lauren, and everyone else! Y'all are the best!",5,2016,07,16
137,Best Hotel Ever!,"We needed a hotel near Buckingham Palace as we had been invited by the Queen in recognition of winning the Queen’s Award for Enterprise. Being top of Trip Advisor, I was highly delighted to discover that Hotel 41 was within 5 minutes of the Palace.  I was a bit worried that it might be a bit pretentious, but thought we deserved a special treat and it sounded wonderful. I must say, that I have never stayed in a hotel like this ever and it was wonderful. Not pretentious at all.  The staff are wonderful; they all know/remember your name.  Nothing is too much trouble.  I am gluten free and my husband is dairy free, I advised them of this before we arrived and I didn’t need to say again, all the staff knew and remembered.  I have never experienced that before.  

We had a lovely afternoon tea the day we arrived, with lots of gluten free goodies, oh and delicious pink champagne.  As others have mentioned there is always food on hand, sweet nibbles during the day and plunder the pantry in the evening, with savoury nibbles, cheeses and a hot dish.  No need to eat out!  I can highly recommend Jude's salted caramel ice cream.

When we returned from the Palace we had a bottle of champagne and a gluten free cake in our room. What more can you ask for? If I ever have to go back to London, will definitely stay here.  In fact I have just purchased a gift voucher for a staff member who celebrates 5 years with us, they deserve a special treat and know Hotel 41 will deliver that. I am also looking forward to trying other hotels in this chain, just hope they live up to this one.",5,2016,07,16
137,The best there is...,"I am a Ritz girl and believe it or not this is better than the Ritz or any other hotel I have ever stayed at . The food is five star and so is the service. I wish there were a Hotel 41 in every city I visited. I wish I could live here. The location is very convenient , near the Victoria Station.",5,2016,07,14
137,luxury,"I think one of the best hotel I visited. My room was comfortable, clean, no noise..
Staff very kind! the price is not so cheap but if you want to stay in the best hotel in London.. you have to spent..
I'll be back!!!",5,2016,07,14
137,Nothing to Improve Upon,"I spent a week at Hotel 41 for vacation and had a magnificent time. Everyone I encountered seemed truly pleased to work there and took great pride in making me feel welcome and accommodated. The staff immediately knew my name and quickly learned my favorite beverage, without being overly-solicitous. The hotel is small but luxurious. My room had a sitting area that was quite comfortable. Breakfast was included so I ate there each morning- never-mind the menu, just ask for what you want and it appears. The lounge area has the feel of a mansion library- wood paneling and elegant furnishings. There are complimentary snacks presented throughout the day culminating in ""plunder the pantry"" which is perfect if you are not up for a heavy supper. Because the hotel is small you see the same servers just about each day- I'm terrible with names, but there were three primary servers- a boisterous South African, a smooth gentleman who looked like he would be at home on a yacht, and a sweet but poised young lady. More than anyone they made me feel at home at the hotel. But truly, all of the staff are fantastic and so pleased if you ask for their help with anything. The location is terrific- just a block away from the Victoria Underground station and around the corner from Buckingham Palace. The entry is secure and you are buzzed in (although they rush to meet you at the door as they are buzzing!) the front door, then take an elevator to the 5th floor. I had been reading the TripAdvisor reviews of Hotel 41 for a few months before my trip and I really wondered if it could be that great or if maybe they were encouraging people to write these reviews. Well, it really is that great! I've stayed at fine hotels around the world including Four Seasons, Mandarin Oriental, Ritz Carlton, Peninsula, and so on. Unless you prefer a large hotel where you can be anonymous, Hotel 41 outperforms all of those places. As for the review, no one mentioned TripAdvisor. I was presented with a simple feedback form near checkout which asked me to rate the hotel on a number scale and if I had any comment. My comment was that there is nothing Hotel 41 could have done to improve my experience. It was perfect. Well done, Hotel 41.",5,2016,07,13
137,Worth Every Single Penny,"We spent three weeks in Europe, staying at some of the best hotels; All three nights at Hotel 41 was perfect and the highlight of our trip!
Apparently 41 is the equivalent of the concierge floor for the adjoining Ruben Hotel, taking up the building's 5th floor with a private entrance on the 1st floor.  The Ruben has rooms on floors 2-4 below the Hotel 41 rooms.
The rooms are VERY comfortable, well appointed, and have all the amenities one expects from a fine luxury hotel, although as a comment to management, I would upgrade the quality of the Wifi internet service in this high bandwidth digital age.
One of our rooms was the split level conservatory suite which was a gorgeous and unique experience.
What distinguishes this hotel from most other luxury hotels was their very special, spacious and elegant executive lounge, made exceptional by the many professionals staffing the lounge. No request is too small nor too large.  I needed to change a dinner reservation I made independently (secured by a credit card) and despite the restaurant's reluctance to cancel, the 41 staff politely insisted with good results.
Everybody, from the maid, to the concierge staff, to the food preparers and wait staff in the lounge made it clear that their primary and sincere goal was making sure we were both happy and satisfied.  I got the feeling they all took great pride in their capabilities and professionalism, It was evident and truly appreciated.
The BBar bar & restaurant, next door to the Hotel 41 and owned by the Hotel 41's owner was also very good. Skeptical at first, that they were just trying to up sell this restaurant, I found it's food both interesting and very delicious, well worth it for a casual meal.
We got an excellent recommendation for a nearby former Indian dining experience.
These kinds of exceptional experiences don't happen by accident... ""hats off"" to all the fine folks at Hotel 41.  You can bet we'll see you again when we come back to zLondon!",5,2016,07,13
137,Best hotel in London,We stayed here for 3 days during our visit to London. We loved everything about it. The stay at 41 was actually part of the London experience and was a destination experience in itself. From the minute we arrived the welcome was genuine and the service exemplary. The welcome champagne was beautifully presented and explained and the check in process a pleasure.  What we got was perfect.  The rooms were beautifully decorated and equipped. This was a small hotel with fantastic staff and excellent service. We didn't want to leave and will certainly return!,5,2016,07,13
137,Hotel 41 is like no other!,"My husband booked our 4 night stay at this hotel through Costco travel.  He booked it and then told me about how special this hotel was going to be for us and our stay in London.  He told me it's just around the corner from Buckingham Palace.  I trusted him and thought, ""right, just around the corner!"" ...well, he was right on both, Hotel 41 was a pleasure and a dream to stay with and Buckingham Palace, the front, is right around the corner.                                                                                                                              Because I had never experienced hotel service like this before, initially I didn't quite understand why we had interaction with 6 hotel staff persons from the moment we first walked into the hotel to the hotel desk and why.  This specialy hotel really strives to make you feel like you are special and so you get the sense of having your personal server or butler always at your service.
This trip was our Anniversary gift to each other and it couldn't have been a better experience for us.  We loved the quaint feeling, the decor, our room, the hospitality, the whole package.
If you get the chance, be sure and stay at Hotel 41, you'll love that you did!",5,2016,07,11
137,A delight,"Ideal location, beautiful hotel, gorgeous room, comfy bed - but it was the whole team of staff who took it to the next level.   Their service and attention to detail is absolutely spot on.  We have stayed in hundreds of hotels, but this is by far the best hotel experience we have had.  Perfect!",5,2016,07,11
137,A very Special Place to Stay,"I've stayed at Hotel 41 twice now. The first time while on business was such a great experience I had to stay with my wife when we visited London for pleasure.

On this visit we stayed for two nights so that we could attend Wimbledon.

Our welcome was superb. Greeted on the ground floor and directed up to reception where check in had just the right level of formality - a glass of champagne on arrival is also a treat. Having Champagne flow throughout our stay was even better.

Our room was quirky with a lounge with a staircase up to our bedroom.

The bedroom was sumptuous. The bed big, deep and comfortable with great linen. The bathroom was well appointed.

The staff were all attentive, friendly and the service exceptionally good.

The plunder the pantry concept is tremendous. What a selection! 

The lounge had great decor and is just the right size to provide privacy with a sociable atmosphere.

Breakfast is from a good menu and cooked to order. Brilliant.

Location next to the Palace and a short walk from Victoria is ideal for a city break.

Without doubt one of the best hotels we have stayed in and well worth a visit for anyone. A very special place to stay.",5,2016,07,10
137,24-hr. executive lounge and order- off- the menu breakfasts,5 minutes from victoria station subway stop.  Large well-appointed room.  Sumptuous breakfasts.  Exceptional service from a genuinely friendly staff.  Champagne available 24-hrs. a day.  I would go back without question.  This is the best hotel I have ever stayed in.,5,2016,07,08
137,There is a reason . . .,"this hotel is the finest hotel I have ever stayed at -- service, service, service. When my wife returned, we planned a trip to London and Paris -- no expense was spared.  Even after 4 years, she still talks about her stay at the 41.  From ""raiding the pantry"" to an afternoon reading and sipping Veuve Clicquot in their library.  Truly a one of a kind experience.  Chapeau 41!",5,2016,07,05
137,Couldn't recommend enough!,We stayed here over the May Bank Holiday weekend and my husband had booked it as a surprise for my 40th. The service and welcome you receive is unparalleled and we were treated as if we were the most important guests in the hotel (I am sure every other guest felt the same). They even left a birthday cake in our room as a surprise - such attention to detail is hard to find and I would urge anyone looking to book a special trip to book Hotel 41.,5,2016,07,05
137,Extraordinary,"My wife and I came to Hotel 41 with high expectations.  We have stayed at virtually every 5 star hotel in London, love several of them, and were curious how a 30 room hotel just down the street from Victoria Station could possibly wind up at the top of Trip Advisor’s list of London hotels year after year.  The answer is service and attention to detail.  Admittedly, the hotel does not have the curbside appeal of the Dorchester, Mandarin Oriental or Claridges, but once you step inside, it really delivers.  The staff knew our names almost immediately, and remembered them for our entire stay.  The Executive Lounge at the center of the hotel serves as check-in desk, bar, and restaurant, and everything they do is wonderful.  The staff will remember your drink order from the previous day, and they provide free goodies throughout the day.  The furnishings are plush throughout the hotel, and the beds are extremely comfortable.  I can’t say enough about the service – when my wife and I retired for the evening on the first night there, the staff had covered the bed with rose petals and lit candles in the room.  So romantic, and completely unexpected.  Various staff members enquired about our plans, gave us some great suggestions, and even got us into one of the hot new restaurants.  So, so nice.  The location near Westminster is great for tourists, and its central location permits you to easily get anywhere in town.  And if privacy/security are an issue for you, it has both of those  -- you can’t even enter the front door unless they buzz you in.  Naturally, this sort of experience does not come cheap, but it is noticeably less expensive than some of the grand hotels in town that do not have the same level of service.  I would highly recommend this hotel, and we definitely will return.",5,2016,07,05
137,Sublime!,I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this hotel :) the staff are brilliant! Their attention to detail is unequalled! They always look after us without us asking.  It's our home away from home always :),5,2016,07,02
137,Best in London,"We stayed here for 3 days and were amazed by the service, just splash out and do it. Fantastic suite with a very relaxed feel.  Lovely staff that do there very best to look after you. I can only repeat what many others feel and say. If you want to be spoilt, this is the place.",5,2016,07,01
137,Never had this experience!,"Sometimes you just HAVE to have that experience of a lifetime and this is it!  From the moment you walk through the door to the moment you leave; it is 5 star service all the way.  Starbucks delivered upstairs while we unpack; complimentary paper, tea, snacks in the morning, snacks in the evening, jars of candy by the front door, bottles of water.....the list just goes on and on.  The staff never seems to sleep or need it because they are always there smiling and trying to anticipate your every need.  We want to thank Stephan and his staff for a totally memorable experience-and then there was London:)",5,2016,06,30
137,Great nights sleep,"A very comfortable stay with all business needs taken care of quickly and efficiently - many thanks for looking after us and ensuring that all requests and visitors were dealt with discreetly.
I highly recommend room service - but be sure to ask for Damien; he was excellent.",5,2016,06,29
137,Suite Time at 41,"Hotel 41 in London remains one of my worldwide favorites and certainly the best in London. Two things set it apart--service and compact luxury. 

The hotel is rather small, occupying only the fifth floor of 41 Buckingham Palace Road.  When you arrive, you are greeted at the main floor entrance where you will be directed to the elevator and the Executive Lounge. The library-like lounge serves as the check-in area as well as the dining room and bar. Its warm tones and upholstered furniture make it the perfect place to relax.

41 provides complimentary afternoon snacks and a late night raid-the-pantry spread in the lounge. Each time I stay, the late night snacks seem to get more varied and tastier. Thick-sliced Serrano ham, seared tuna tartar, shrimp cocktail, Stilton cheese, chicken curry, salads, crusty breads, biscuits, a selection of sweets, and more!  Staff is always on hand to mix a cocktail or pour a glass of champagne.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that I was upgraded to the Balmoral suite. Although staying at 41 for only one night, I made good use of the extra space and amenities to adjust to GMT. 

No room at 41 can be called expansive. Each one I've stayed in is compact, efficient, and luxurious. The Balmoral suite is no exception. Long and narrow, it has two rooms. The sleeping area is like a studio apartment and includes a small table, a sitting area , a desk, a king-size bed, a pop-up television for watching from bed, and a wall-mounted television for the sitting area. There is a closet-sized shower cleverly built into what appears to be a closet, a bathroom with towel warmer, tub, and sink, and a rather generous walk-in closet. This is a wonderful closet if you are staying in London for some time and have suits, dresses, and formal wear.

The second room has a table that seats four, a two-person couch, and a wall-mounted television. It has its own full bath similar in layout to the bedroom, but with a rather nice tiled shower instead of a tub. All bathrooms at 41 has top-notch plumbing fixtures.

The suite overlooks Buckingham Palace. All rooms at 41 have a black-and-white decor, but each room I've seen is decorated in a unique and charming way. You'll get plenty of light during the day, but complete darkness at night due to the blackout drapery.

Balmoral Suite has every amenity you can imagine, and if doesn't have what you need, staff will assist you. They are some of the most accommodating in the business. They contact you days prior to arrival to see if need special arrangements or help getting show tickets and they are available in the Executive Lounge once you are at the hotel.

There is only one improvement I could suggest: Remove the wall mounted television in the bedroom. Because the room is narrow, it is easy for people my height and taller to run into the television. As there are two other televisions in the suite, I can't imagine why anyone would need three. A tasteful picture on the wall would make the suite even more charming.",5,2016,06,27
137,Perfection,"The number of hotel beds available in London is overwhelming. I made my choice by ranking hotels (using their websites and reviews) using three parameters. Location. Inclusions (wifi, breakfast, gym). Room comfort (size, noise levels, cleanliness).  Three hotels had equal scores so then I used price to make my final choice - Only two nights, without family, this was a big event!
Hotel 41.
To begin - welcome emails, invitations to arrange restaurant/show bookings, and a pre-arrival information sheet to personalize my room for my arrival. 
To follow - I arrived at 7.30 am after a 33 hour commute. I was greeted with such warmth and a strong coffee and nursed through to a courtesy room to use for as long as I needed however I needed. Bottles of sparkling water were pushed on me, offers of fresh juice and fruit. More coffee? Tea then?
On return after 10 hours of shopping/walking/culture - my bags were whisked away to my room. Champagne. Canapés (rice and butter chicken, 4 choices of salad, cheeses, olives, antipasto, pastries, chips, nuts, fresh fruit.... Ok really guys, this is dinner). In my room a welcome tray of petit fours, more sparkling water, warm towels, gentle lighting, Bose sound system playing in the background. The worlds most comfortable bed drowning under my preferred pillows. Beautiful dressing gowns. Thick soft comfortable slippers (sorry Lauren - I just couldn't leave these behind!) and everything else I had mentioned on my information sheet. 
The room isn't completely sound proof - creaky old floor boards simply add character and there was a small amount of street noise in this room, but I slept well. 
Don't forget about breakfast - Personalized service, using my name all the time, remembering my preferences. Continental (will that need to be renamed post Brexit) as well as a two page menu of a la carte. Real coffee, good coffee. Sun streaming through the sky light and smiling friendly familiar faces everywhere. 
Hotel 41 is small, personalized and perfect. Simply perfect. ",5,2016,06,27
137,An Extremely Lovely Hotel,"There isn't much we can say about this lovely hotel that hasn't been stated many times by other guests.  It truly lived up to and exceeded our expectations.  We want to send a special thank you to Stefan and Patrycja who made us feel like we were staying in someone's home.  They always enquired as to how our days of sightseeing had gone and what they could do to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.  We could not have been made to feel more special.  The plunder the pantry, evening canapés and fresh fruit in our room everyday were delightful. We will definitely be staying with 41 Hotel on our next trip to London.",5,2016,06,24
137,Hotel 41,I cannot say enough about this hotel.  The entire staff was very professional and helpful.  The lobby area is as comfortable as sitting in someone's living room.  The accommodations are excellent.  It a great location within walking distance of many attractions and also close to public transportation.  Would love to stay there again,5,2016,06,23
137,Absolutely Amazing Hotel,"This is by far my favorite hotel. My husband and I first stayed 2001 and my last visit in May was just as enjoyable. The staff is so wonderful and genuinely pleasant.  They go out of their way to see that your stay is the best possible. I have stayed in many hotels around the world and I am always drawn back to 41. This is a different hotel style. Some people prefer the large hotels but this is more like a club floor feeling, which I prefer. 
Food and beverage selections are outstanding. I loved just relaxing in the lounge area and chatting with the staff. The rooms are perfect for my needs. My favorite room looks out toward the royal mews.  Location couldn't be better.  Several times I have taken private tours (many good local tour companies) but also used the hop on hop off buses (with all the construction in London right now, these routes can take twice as long). 
Do try the restaurant next door BBar, fun place! 
I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,06,23
137,Better service than Buckingham Palace.....,"If you wish to feel like Lord and Lady Grantham, then this is the place for you. Service from another era. Highly recommended. 

The gold standard of service and responsiveness against which every other hotel will be judged. Simply could not have been better. 

They quietly go about trying to accommodate every wish and whim almost without you realizing it. My wife ordered bacon and got something that looked more like ham (British style bacon.) Before we knew it a quiet concierge had googled bacon and realized there are actually four kinds, British, Streaky, American and Canadian. They promptly brought out American style bacon. 

Stephan Otto felt like my personal friend and butler for our one week stay. 

I could go on. For the penultimate service experience go to the 41.",5,2016,06,22
137,Impeccable Service!,"Hotel 41 was definitely on of the top hotels on our list.We The hotel is elegant without being stuffy, extremely clean ( and I'm very picky!) and the staff is incredibly accommodating and engaging. We were surprised on our first night upon returning to our room, with candlelight, rose petals, chocolate covered strawberries and champagne in a bucket! Fabulous hotel!!!",5,2016,06,17
137,Still the best in London,"We made two visits here is June (before and after a week elsewhere in europe) and they are just as fabulous as ever.  

The staff is outstanding, helpful in everyway, even in things you could not have thought you needed.  They anticpate every possible need and do such a great job of making you feel at home in this hotel.  

The rooms are lovely, comfortable and luxurious throughout.  Breakfast is wonderful -- snacks and canapes in the lounge are decadent!  I always love the relaxing beverage in the lounge after a long day.. and it just feels like home away from home.

thank you for all that you do every time we stay!  We wouldn't stay anywhere else in London.",5,2016,06,15
137,Best Service,"The Best service I have ever experienced, with no One of.
I know many people were impressed by Hotel 41's warm, careful, detailed service, So am I throughout our stay. The greatest part happened when our trip ended, we found my whole bunch of keys were left behind in hotel room after 13-hours flight back home, it was a disaster..We call the hotel then received a message that the concierge who saw our keys left on desk put it into one of my stored luggage, and we found it there. You can image how grateful I was.",5,2016,06,15
137,As great as everyone says!!,"My husband and I stayed four nights during our visit to London.  I can't add much to what everyone else has said except that it is all true!!  We loved everything about it.  The only thing I will say is don't let the ""fanciness"" of the hotel intimidate you.  My husband and I are regular, middle-class people who indulged in 41 as a special treat.  I had been worried that we weren't ""classy"" enough to stay here.  I was wrong.  For one thing, what I saw of the other guests suggested that most of them were also regular folks having a special experience.  And the other thing is that the staff is so professional and friendly that they made us feel totally at home and comfortable.

So just do it--you'll be glad you did!!!",5,2016,06,14
137,Hotel 41 London,"Home away from home. But better.
The level of customer service is unsurpassed. Our every need was anticipated and prepared for before requested. In fact, I didn't have to request anything. Everything I could have wanted was presented to me with a smile. I've stayed in many luxury hotels, but Florent, Magda and team at 41 went above and beyond to make the stay exceptional. The stay at 41 was actually part of the London experience and is a destination experience in itself. You and your children will be so spoiled, you'll wish the team could train every hotel's staff around the world.",5,2016,06,13
137,A wonderful stay,"My wife and I stayed at Hotel 41 on 11th June to mark the occasion of our 45th wedding anniversary.
If you want modern ""old fashioned"" elegance combined with astonishing levels of service and attention to detail then this is the place to stay. A fantastic experience",5,2016,06,13
137,17th Wedding anniversary ,"Where do I start? We stayed here 26th December 2015-1st Jan 2016 to celebrate our 17th wedding anniversary. With the help of  Florent, I was able to pull off a total surprise for my husband, it was perfect! We had dinners planned, a trip  to Paris, a visit to the shard, Christmas lights at Kew garden, a football game attended, New Year's Eve celebration watching the fireworks down at the eye. Everything was simply amazing! From the moment we were picked up at the airport, till the moment we had to sadly say goodbye, Everything and everyone were perfect. I could not have wished for a better place to celebrate our wedding anniversary and surprise for my husband. The staff were amazing. The rooms we stayed in were amazing. The fire was lit on an evening, with candles around the room. We had a celebration cake, romantic turn down, and I got the star naming package as we stayed in the conservatory suite. The room was amazing and clean everything was perfect I couldn't find fault with anything as I have already said. If you want an amazing and perfect time you must stay here whilst visiting London, you will feel like a king and queen whilst you stay here. I hope to one day stay here again. But will be stopping in to say hi for sure next time we're in London this summer.  
Romance for sure, easy access to all of London as it is right next to Victoria underground short walk away, the staff as I say are just amazing and go way above and beyond what you expect. Perfection in London at hotel 41. Can't wait to go back. Home away from home",5,2016,06,11
137,A hidden Jewel by Buckingham Palace,"Even before we arrived our experience began. An email asking pillow preferences, was there anything we specifically wanted or needed?, meant we had already been able to personalise our stay before arriving.From the minute we arrived the welcome was genuine and the service exemplary. The welcome champagne was beautifully presented and explained and the check in process a pleasure. As a family we had asked for connecting rooms. What we got was perfect. The 2 rooms had a main entrance to the corridor area and as such we could have both the room doors ajar in complete safety. The rooms were beautifully decorated and equipped. It was our 25th wedding anniversary and had requested the romantic turn-down. Candles, rose petals , champagne and other treats were provided whilst we were out for dinner. When we returned the room looked amazing. But the jewel in the crown (sorry for the pun as perfectly located by Buckingham Palace and walking distance to many attractions.) were the staff. Without exception amazingly professional, friendly and attentive throughout. We will be back and can,t wait to do so.",5,2016,06,10
137,EXCELLENT HOTEL - ALWAYS THE SAME HIGH STANDARDS,"This is the fourth time we have visited this hotel - absolutely love it.  This is a small hotel with fantastic staff who couldn't be more courteous and helpful.  I love the executive lounge, I love the service, I love the hotel and we will certainly return.",5,2016,06,08
137,Great Attention To Detail,The hotel has really got great attention to detail to make sure everything you need is right.  Staff are extremely friendly and courteous and make you feel very welcome.  The food bar and relaxed lounge is a real plus in the heart of busy London.,5,2016,06,07
137,excellent!!!!!!,"a luxury hotel with confortable modern rooms!!!! The stuff was very helpful and professionals and the location was perfect, close to the sub!The breakfast we had at the hotel was of a very high standard!! Totally perfect!!!!",5,2016,06,07
137,"Stunning rooms, fantastic service and an experience you will never forget!","We stayed at Hotel 41 as part of our honeymoon in London based on the reviews we read on Trip Advisor. We were not disappointed. We were led up to the executive lounge, the main heart of the hotel. Here we were given a welcoming glass of champagne to sip on whilst the set up of the hotel was explained to us. The lounge is absolutely stunning and feels so comfortable. The hotel has complimentary snacks such as ice cream, sweets, popcorn, crisps. This changes to cheese and meats and even desserts during the evening. The hotel has an honesty bar which sums up the whole feel of the hotel. Guests are trusted to log in a book any drinks they have helped themselves to from the bar. As a guest at this hotel you really do feel at home - just a far more luxurious version of home!

As part of our honeymoon we were lucky enough to be upgraded to a suite and found a congratulations cake and some stunning desserts in our room. The room itself was double story and absolutely stunning. It had a hot tub bath and a conservatory roof which meant you could lie in bed staring at the stars. This was such an incredible and unexpected treat and we couldn't help but squeal like small children with excitement! The room was finished to a very high standard and room servicing was exceptional.

All of the staff are so friendly and helpful. One night we decided we wanted to make use of our amazing room and watch a DVD. The staff got out a huge book of DVD's to choose from. The service managed to hit the perfect spot between exceptionally professional but friendly and relaxed. This meant that you felt at home but also like you were being spoilt.

Hotel 41 is a completely unique experience and well deserving of the high praise is receives on Trip Advisor.

The breakfast we had at the hotel was of a very high standard, the cooked breakfast had excellent hash browns and high quality sausages with mushrooms cooked to perfection! The location of the hotel is excellent - a very short walk from Victoria station. If at all possible I would recommend the suite room with the conservatory roof as it really was stunning. 

This was a part of our trip we will never forget and we didn't want to leave! I am sure when funds allow, we will be back very soon.",5,2016,06,06
137,An exceptional staff and property!,"We stayed at the Hotel 41 for 10 days on our second visit to the UK.   Our experience upon arriving at 10:00 pm to our departure 10 days later at 6:00 am was the absolute best.   The staff, from the concierge, to the executive lounge team, to the management, are amongst the finest we've experienced after traveling throughout Europe.   The staff is very attentive, helpful, engaging (personal touch which is much appreciated while traveling), knowledgeable and most important they are all very warm and genuine.  

We stayed in a junior suite and was so pleased with the accommodations.  The historic details in the room, combined with a ""western"" size bathroom and amazing shower were a plus.   

The Executive Lounge was open 24 hours and you had a full pantry of treats and drink available.   

Our overall rating 1-10 is a 20!   This is our new London hotel as from beginning to end we were treated as friends!",5,2016,06,04
137,"Charming team,first class accomidations","We were so fortunate to find hotel 41 for our recent trip to London.
The room was luxurious,location perfect,and staff totally charming professionals .
After an injury occurred they treated us like family.
That is only true if your family is really good to you!!
We will never stay anywhere else if they have an available room.",5,2016,06,03
137,Hotel that never ceases to amaze ,"This is a luxury boutique hotel with rooms in a monochromatic palette. The main social area is the executive lounge. 

This hotel is absolutely fabulous in every aspect. You will not regret a stay here and you will want to come back. The personalized service is utterly perfect. ",5,2016,06,03
137,Best in London,"We arrive in this paradise with some of my friends. The Rooms is big and comfortable, clean and with nice art decor. The staff is very help full and nice. We have our best time in London. Fantastic position, very close to the sub way and the tourist attraction. ",5,2016,06,02
137,Reality exceeds expectations!,"We stayed 3 nights at this hotel last week and had a wonderful stay. I picked the hotel because it was ranked #1 and our stay exceeded all expectations. The rooms were wonderfully appointed and we were surprised when we had rose petals on the bed at night without asking. 

The location was a perfect base for sight seeing. And the staff was willing to go out of their way to accommodate any request you may have. 

The best part of the hotel is the executive lounge. This is a beautiful room that they keep stocked 24/7 with free (and delicious!) food. They even have a small fridge full of ice cream. We came from the USA so we were a little off in our time and ended up at the lounge every night around 2:00 - 3:00 AM. I would like to give special thanks to Ivo, who is the night manager at the lounge. He was super nice and great to talk to. We really enjoyed his company and he went out of his way to make us feel at home. Thank you Ivo and we hope to see you again some day. ",5,2016,05,31
137,Relaxed and quiet with impeccable service. A real treat.,"A fabulous couple of days at this delightful hotel, where the staff look after you as if you were a special guest in their own home. We were made so welcome without any stuffiness or pretentiousness. The room and lounge were so comfortable and the food delicious. We can't wait to find an excuse to go back!",5,2016,05,29
137,Superlative. #1 for a reason,"We have traveled to a number of wonderful boutique hotels across the world and I am usually not impressed with the usual offerings of sweets in the lobby, turn-down service, etc...but this hotel is truly OUTSTANDING in customer service and deserves special mention. It is rightfully in my opinion #1 in London on TA for a reason.
Why? Because, quite simply, they listened and went above and beyond.
You know how you get that red eye flight from the US over to Europe just so you can arrive at some unGodly hour in the morning? We got in at 7:30 am from Raleigh. I always dutifully fill out the ""guest questionnaire"" beforehand and generally expect it to arrive in the trash heap. What I requested was perhaps use of a common bathroom to freshen up a little as I knew our room would not be ready to check in, and we had an all day walking tour of London starting at 10:30.
What I received was truly magical....our room wasn't ready, as I expected, but..they gave us a different ROOM to use for our very own to freshen up in, take a shower, nap, etc at our leisure before our tour...
WHO DOES THAT?? 
Someone who is at the top of their game in customer service.
Not to mention the selection (of very exceptional quality) champagne on check in, upgrade to a huge suite, and wonderful afternoon tea.
Kudos to the exceptional staff who made us feel welcome, welcomed us back a second time like old friends after our week in the Cotswolds, and a delightful (and decadent!) afternoon tea. I loved the hosts/managers and would like to give a special shout out to Florent--he is truly delightful.
Sure, you can splash out on the Ritz and get a bigger room for a whole lot more $$$$$ and get treated like a number, but coming here you will find it an exceptional value and lovely treat in the heart of sightseeing London. Would come back again and again.
Also, should note--location cannot be beat for sightseeing and very short walk to Victoria station on the tube. Taxis plentiful, too. Bravo!!",5,2016,05,29
137,A week in London,"What a great experience! so much to say about a weeks stay in London - the ENTIRE staff at Hotel 41 goes 'above and beyond' to make sure the stay is not only enjoyable but memorable. Breakfasts were soooo good. Book the room/stay to include and you will not be disappointed. While rooms were a bit small our upgraded too room suite, with two bathrooms gave us ample room. We quickly learned we packed too much so lesson learned. Located a block from Buckingham Palace, the Victoria Train/Tube station and within walking distance from restaurants and shopping on the West End make this an ideal location. When in London again, no hesitation on where we will stay!",5,2016,05,29
137,"Beautiful hotel, quite unusual - but a few disappointments!","We stayed here in March, for my husband's 60th birthday, it was a surprise treat for him that I'd been planning since November, so I was very excited when I gave him the details the week before. When you arrive, the area downstairs is quite small and you are taken in the lift up to the 5th floor where, when you exit, you enter the hotel properly and wow what a wonderful place, the lounge area absolutely beautiful with it's conservatory style roof and stunning decor. When we arrived the staff were very friendly and attentive and Adele showed us our room where they'd left petit fours and a lovely chocolate birthday cake for my husband. We stayed in room 4119 for 2 nights, it was beautiful and laid out over 2 floors - very unusual. We had booked the BBar restaurant for the 1st night, so after a pre-dinner drink ate there, and the food was very good with a very buzzy atmosphere and excellent staff. On the Saturday we did the Royal Mews tour, on the hotel's recommendation - very interesting, and had already pre-booked the Churchill War Rooms - excellent, so had a very busy day out.  On our return at 4:30, we stopped off in the lounge area for a cuppa and a cream tea, and were a little disappointed when we were only brought out tea and shortbread - having read that cream teas were served.  When we went back to the room, we decided to have a piece of chocolate birthday cake instead.....the cake had gone!!  Very strange, but we decided as the room was quite warm, that they'd removed it to perhaps give us on our departure?  The second evening we'd booked a show, so had a quick drink before we left and a couple complimentary hors d'oeouvres served by Steve.  It's a nice touch coming back in after the show and having their 'Plunder Pantry' as we were quite hungry by then, though to be honest there wasn't a lot on offer. Now we're definitely not greedy people and another couple there had obviously tucked in and had a banquet, but when we went up, there wasn't a lot of cheese left and not that much in the refrigerated area either! The breakfasts there are very good with an adequate choice, good service and of course in the gorgeous setting of the lounge area.  On our last day we went out and about again, did the Tower Bridge walk and the Walkie Talkie building with the sky garden - excellent better than The Shard we thought.  We walked back via St Paul's and then took a taxi back to the hotel, except that everything was going on in London that weekend, St Patick's day parades, demo's etc., and our taxi couldn't get us back past Westminster Bridge so, as our train was booked at 4pm, we ended up literally running back to the hotel for our luggage.  We were hot and tired when we arrived and explained what had happened, so they kindly made us a cup of tea. Again we were disappointed not to have been offered, at any time,and especially as we were leaving, their little 'snack box' as stated by other reviewers and on their website, so ended up having to buy a sandwich at Waterloo! It was just these little things we found irritating, but overall it is a very pretty place and the staff very friendly, but we felt you are really charged for the privilege.  We have stayed in some wonderful 5* hotels, Raffles, Mandarin Oriental, Shangri-la's  etc., and just didn't feel we got value for money here!  We never did get my husband's birthday cake - don't know what happened to it?  We never got offered their snack box and my biggest complaint and one of the reasons I marked it down,  is what they charged us for gin & tonics - more than at the Dorchester Hotel - £46.12 for 2  and we had this 3 times whilst there - totally outrageous 41!!!!",3,2016,05,29
137,Amazing luxury in the heart of London,"Hotel 41 is a wonderful intimate hotel in an excellent location, convenient to everything yet quiet and peaceful. Neither flashy nor loud, Hotel 41 is a perfect refuge with a refined, welcoming atmosphere. Every staff member we encountered was congenial and professional. My room was beautifully decorated and very comfortable; Wi-Fi worked great. 
The guest lounge area is the best set up I have found in a luxury boutique hotel, it was lovely and elegant, and we were so impressed by Stefan, the primary host, who was beyond exceptional. My triple cappuccino also awaited me each morning.  After working and walking all day, my colleague and I enjoyed cocktails and snacks each evening in the guest lounge - just divine.
Now that we have stayed here, we can't imagine staying anywhere else in London. I was sad to leave!",5,2016,05,27
137,"If you want to feel like home, this is the place to be !","We were at the Conservatory Suite under a roof in glass. From you bed you can see the birds fly over...what a lovely experience. But, concretely : the beds are wonderful, the bathroom is spacious with rain shower, regular shower and jacuzzi, there is a separate room to sit and enjoy a drink. Coffee and tea can be made. Breakfast is nice and is being served in a british/south african like lounge room. There is a buffet serving hot and cold dishes that you can plunder for free. Additionally there is ice cream that you can grab and a wide variety of drinks. If you want to be pampered and feel at home in a big city, than this is the place you want to be. Enjoy like we did !",5,2016,05,26
137,A fantastic find in London,"London is a difficult and expensive place to find a good hotel. Look no further than Hotel 41. Carved out of an old-fashioned hotel across from the Royal Mews, the 41 offers impeccable service, lovely rooms, well-appointed baths, and a family-like staff. The Executive Lounge -- akin to a lobby, but as intimate as a traditional London club -- has comfortable seating, an ongoing supply of food, and a convivial atmosphere.  The perfect place to retreat from the hubbub of the big city, whether you travel for business or pleasure.",5,2016,05,25
137,The BEST,"The hotel is small, but perfect. Rooms are decorated beautifully and have everything you might need. Food and drink is always available in the Executive Lounge which is the perfect place to relax before and after exploring London. The food and drink selection is excellent. The location is great too. The absolute best part of the hotel though is the staff- service is top notch; they are so friendly and helpful, willing to go above and beyond, and delightful to talk to. Hotel 41 is instantly one of my favorite hotels and I've stayed in many! Can't wait to go back!",5,2016,05,25
137,Great Hotel!,"I have stayed a the hotel a number of times now, the hotel is excellent, clean and tidy, staff were extremely polite and helpful. Highly recommend.... 
In terms of value for money, this hotel is amazing.",5,2016,05,24
137,exceptional stay,"The hotel is lovely, rooms are comfortable and the staff and atmosphere are excellent.  The hotel provides a cozy lounge for breakfast and for cocktails, It is an absolute pleasure to stay at this hotel.",5,2016,05,23
137,First Visit to London!,"Top Service.  Friendly!   Food Drink always available.  Helpful staff.   I thought the Suite would be fun, but my knee did not like the full staircase from the sitting room to the bedroom.
Beautiful treats left out for us each night.  Great cocktails in the Lounge for extra $$.  Champagne Bar next door.  Across from Buckingham Palace.  We easily walked to the Irish Guards' Museum.",5,2016,05,23
137,Very lovely.....,"My wife and I stayed for one night at 41, our first visit here, on a very rare evening away without the children!  Even though it was just a short stay for us it really was the perfect choice for a special and romantic night away.

The staff were all so friendly and attentive but never intrusive.  The service felt very personal and it is clear that the hotel takes great pride in ensuring its guests feel looked after and valued.  

The Executive Lounge is a great place to just unwind and chat over a glass or two of something chilled.  It's also really rather fab to return to after a night out with its wonderful choice of complimentary snacks to enjoy before bedtime!

We'd absolutely recommend if like us you want somewhere special, peaceful and romantic.",5,2016,05,23
137,Amazing! Just amazing! ,"Me and my wife came to London for our week holiday and this hotel was recommended to us by a friend. It doesn't make you feel at home, it makes you feel like you don't ever want to return there! Prices are more than reasonable for a room with this kind of quality, always bright and welcoming. The staff makes it all the better. We had an amazing time in this place. It made our holiday so much better. A must go! ",5,2016,05,20
137,Exceptional stay,"Hotel 41 truly is amazing.  It is a lovely boutique hotel with elegant rooms, wonderful linens, outstanding amenities, and the best executive lounge I have ever experienced.  I would have been pleased with just this, but Hotel 41 is so much more as well.  It really did feel like the entire staff wanted to make our stay truly remarkable--and they did not fail!  The staff go out of their way to provide their guests with the highest level of service; nothing is too much trouble.  We asked them to acquire a SIM card for us and it was waiting for us on our arrival--so nice that we didn't need to search out a 3 Store on our own.  Every time we came back to the hotel we were greeted by name.  The breakfasts were delicious. I looked forward to them every morning.  Afternoon tea was outstanding, and we enjoyed cocktails and canapés as well.  We never had to wait for our room to be made up--it just seemed to magically be done with no fuss.  And turn down service was so much fun to anticipate at the end of each day.  I got quite spoiled!  
Hotel 41 is a unique hotel with charm and service that almost seems to be from a different era.  They really do put other five star hotels to shame.  My husband and I are so happy we were able to experience this wonderful place.",5,2016,05,20
137,Magical,"We have stayed in many 5 star hotels across the world, but this little gem in London is by far the best.

From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave (begrudgingly) you are treated like the most important guest they have staying with them.

Our 2 night stay was for the Queens garden party and there were a few things we needed in preparation. My husband wanted a pink buttonhole and a wet shave on the day of the garden party. Not a problem. An appointment was booked for him at Trumpers in Mayfair (along with transport) and his buttonhole was delivered in pristine condition ready for us to leave. Nothing is too much trouble.

The executive lounge is the heart of the hotel and an absolute treat. Stefan and his wonderful stories are not to be missed and he along with all of the staff are what made this stay magical. They all remember your name, along with your likes and dislikes. They are there to serve your every need and they do. I really cannot put into sufficient words how truly brilliant they all are.

When I arrived home I said to my husband ""this must be the first time I haven't said, it's lovely to be home"". I cannot wait to return.",5,2016,05,20
137,Faultless,"I have never been so enamoured by a hotel. Everything about this hotel was perfect from start to finish. I would love to give feedback for what they could do better next time or went wrong but unfortunately or fortunately depending on how you look at it, I have nothing to say. You will not regret staying here. I will rave about this hotel for a long long time. Staff are pure professional excellence. Every hotel manager from all the hotels I have ever visited need to stay here to understand what 5 star truly means.",5,2016,05,19
137,heaven on earth!,"the loveliest  location and  the best service along with finest amenities....It makes for a dream holiday stay.
The rooms are well equipped and the bathrooms luxurious.  The central space  serves wonderful breakfast and great cocktails in evening",5,2016,05,19
137,Exceptional stay!,Everything about this hotel is brilliant. The location is perfect across from the Mews and allows for easy access to central London. The service here was truly one of a kind and they did everything they could to ensure every aspect of our stay was the best. The penthouse room is a DREAM!! The glass ceiling both day and night is like nothing you will find again! We cannot wait to go back again! Thank you for making our anniversary stay the best! Side note...there is a lovely Sri Lankan restaurant right around the corner! So good!,5,2016,05,19
137,41 is Number 1. All staff take a bow,"We first stayed here 10 years ago. It was super then and is super now.

This really is a fantastic hotel, with the best team of staff that I have ever come across in any organisation. They really were something from a by-gone era when Britain was renowned for it's service. There were absolutely no ""weak links"", so it would be unfair to single out any individual. I would suggest that the Employee of the Month Award would go to the Team.

Sumptuous surroundings, every last detail taken care of. Everyone went out of their way to make me and my wife feel so very special.

What a shame we could only stay for 1 night as we had to be home for my Mother's 95th birthday. We were down in London for a visit to a Buckingham Palace Garden Party and, although we were catching the train on the evening of our departure, they provided a courtesy room in which to shower and change upon our return from the Palace. And gave us free refreshments in the Executive Lounge!!!! 

I could understand such treatment maybe had we stayed for a week, but to be treated like that having only stayed one night is truly service par excellence. Very much appreciated

Anyone staying in London will find this place impossible to beat. We don't visit London very often, but when we do, there will only ever be one place to stay - 41.",5,2016,05,18
137,Home from Home,"The staff and service at Hotel 41 is what makes the stay so enjoyable. As the hotel is quite small all the staff know your name, they remember your plans and then are keen to ensure that you had a good time. Our room was quite small but it had everything you could possibly want and need. The beds are huge and extremely comfortable. The shower was the best power shower I have ever been in! The executive living/dining room is just like a very comfortable, well appointed front room - with free ice cream, hot and cold snacks and a great selection of alcohol available. The service is friendly and unfussy. Location-wise the hotel gets full marks as well, being just 20 mins walk from Piccadilly Circus and 10 minutes from Kensington & Chelsea - and the Queen as your near neighbour! We came for my wife's birthday and little touches such as a lovely bouquet of flowers for her and a handwritten note make all the difference to what was already a wonderful weekend. Would we go to Hotel 41 again? In a heartbeat.",5,2016,05,17
137,There is a reason,"There is a reason to visit again and again and the reason is the very simple fact that this hotel has service so well worked out that you just feel like you are in the hands of a welcoming family.
This was our third visit and we were no less well looked after. We had an executive King room and this was more than adequate and very well appointed. The 'pantry' is a marvel and I ate extremely well from it on the Friday night even to the extent of having a beer with my curry. I know I could have been in a curry house doing the very same but the infused service just made this all the nicer.
We will be back once again later in the year. Is there anywhere else like this? It doesn't matter because this works just perfectly. ",5,2016,05,17
137,Simply impeccable!,"My husband, daughter, and I stayed for 3 nights at Hotel 41 last week.  Everything about this hotel is IMPECCABLE:  service, location, food and drink, rooms, cleanliness -- I could go on and on.  We had reserved a junior suite but were thrilled to be upgraded to the Balmoral Suite upon arrival.   We received a warm welcome from Adele at check-in where we were provided complimentary glasses of champagne while waiting.  She also graciously made dinner reservations at Café Murano for us while we were checking in.  Our suite was spotlessly clean, beautifully laid out, and supplied with best-in-class amenities.  Even the smallest detail - like a really good hairdryer! - was top-notch.  I can't say enough about the staff.  They are completely professional but so charming and friendly.  Not only do they meet the needs of the guests, they also somehow have the gift of anticipating those needs!  Example:  After relaxing and reading a book in the Executive Lounge on the afternoon of our arrival, I returned to our suite.  A few minutes later, darling Magdalena appeared at our door with a tray of vegetarian canapes for me (yes, they had taken note of my dietary requirements), saying that she'd seen me in the lounge and thought I might like them.  Wow factor!!  The entire stay was like that.  We were made to feel completely at home.  We thoroughly enjoyed the fresh snacks provided during the day, along with the incomparable ""plunder the pantry"" spread in the evening.  Breakfast was also beautifully prepared and was delicious, particularly the eggs, waffles, and hashbrowns, all of which were served by the delightful Cyprian.  During our last evening there, Florent generously took the time to show us examples of other rooms in the hotel for future reference.  He also offered to have breakfast to-go boxes available for us in the morning, given our very early departure.  Again, just impeccable from top to bottom.  I cannot think of anything I could find fault with or would change.  We will absolutely stay here again!",5,2016,05,15
137,OMG just simply isn't enough to describe this property,"I have traveled a lot in my lifetime and there are no words to truly describe our recent stay (March 2016) at this Hotel.  From the moment we arrived until the moment we left, we were treated like royalty.  

I would have to say that the Hotel 41 was the best hotel, ever.  Ever!  Amazing service, amazing location, amazing staff.",5,2016,05,14
137,BEST HOTEL ON THE PLANET!,"I have never written a review of anything on Trip Advisor but feel compelled to let everyone know how fantastic Hotel 41 is.  The staff is simply unbelievable.  They are welcoming, gracious, friendly, funny, and took care of our every need.  The accommodations were beautiful but it was the staff who made our stay extraordinary.  We felt like royalty.  They know who you are when you come in, you never sign for anything throughout your stay, they keep track of everything, they provide anything that you need and more.   They booked tickets for us for a show, made reservations for high tea.  I can't list all the things they did, but the staff is just incredible and made our stay in London a perfect 10.  My husband and I both agree that it was the best hotel experience we have ever had.  A perfect 10.  Thank you everyone at Hotel 41.  We already miss you very much!  It was like saying goodbye to really great friends.  We WILL be back and we will tell everyone we know to stay with you.  Thank you thank you so much!!

137,Superb hotel,"

Having spent 2 x Nights at Hotel 41,Buckingham Palace Road,London,myself and my Wife would like to express our Sincere Thanks and Gratitude to all of the Hotel 41 Staff for their Excellent Service and Attention to Detail.
Our stay was thoroughly enjoyable indeed,the Accommodation,Food,Staff,Housekeeping and Overall Ambience were Genuinely 5 Star.
We very much look forward to a return stay in the near future.

137,super stay in super hotel,"We have just returned from a 2 week stay in London!We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.  We were upgraded on arrival, everything is spotlessly clean, staff extremely pleasant and always helpful.
We were eagerly anticipating this trip based upon the previous reviews we had read and we were not disapointed!",5,2016,05,12
137,Only wish I could add more stars to the rating!,"We just arrived home after our stay at Hotel 41 in London and haven't stopped talking about it.  I was a bit disappointed when I returned to my own home to find that there was no pantry to plunder or rose petals on my bed or filled candy dishes & fresh fruit in my room or friendly faces wanting to grant my every wish...but that is what made Hotel 41 so special!  Everything was so amazing during our stay, I even believe the staff had something to do with unusually sunny weather we experienced.  

We stayed in the Balmoral Suite and had trouble deciding between one of the THREE showers to use each day.  Did I mention the candles and aromatherapy pillow spray at turndown? There isn't a detail that Hotel 41 hasn't implemented.

Since we know we will return and I will most definitely write another review, I'd like to point out two extra-special touches from this stay.  

Our travel agent worked with the staff to make reservations for a celebration dinner at the restaurant MARCUS.  But more than that, they arranged for chef Marcus Wareing to personally sign a cookbook for us and leave it in our room upon arrival!  

On another evening we decided to go to Oxford Circus for some quick shopping and wanted to try the underground for the first time.  After receiving great directions from one of the staff, he asked if we had Oyster Cards (metro fare card).  My husband said we would buy them at the station and the staffer just handed us already pre-loaded cards to use as we needed.  Who does that???  

There is definitely a reason that Hotel 41 is rated #1 on TripAdvisor...I just hope word doesn't spread too much or we won't be able to get a room next time.",5,2016,05,11
137,Just as I remembered!!!!,"My first visit to Hotel 41 was two years ago with my sisters and mom for a very special birthday weekend for my mom's 70th Birthday - and everything was perfect as I wrote in an earlier review.  I loved Hotel 41 so much that I returned with my 2 teenage children and husband this past November for Thanksgiving week and we had a WONDERFUL TIME!  We booked two rooms that were across from one another with a door that locked to the outside - they were as adjoining as much as any European hotel could be.  Both rooms were wonderful and just as my prior visit - everything was perfect!!!! Hotel 41 is special and anyone who has stayed there knows this!  They treat their guest like royalty and even better - like family! If you want large rooms and a bustling hotel this would not be for you! I feel the rooms are big enough - and the hotel while not bustling - it is very lively and wonderful in every way.   We loved our second visit so much - we just booked another visit to Hotel 41 for June!  I look forward to visiting my London ""home"" with Lauren and everyone at the Hotel 41!  You will love this place!",5,2016,05,11
137,Welcomed like old friends,"We returned for our fourth visit to 41 and were given such a lovely welcome by Lauren and her team.  This really is a very special place.  If you are looking for a large, busy hotel with spa/gym facilities etc., then this is not for you.  However, if you are like us and enjoy a small, intimate boutique style hotel where nothing is too much trouble and you are made to feel special, then head to 41.  Yes it is an expensive treat, but you more than get what you pay for and the care and attention from everyone is just amazing.  We had a lovely surprise when we were upgraded to the Monarch Suite overlooking the Palace Mews - just perfect.  It was lovely to meet the new members of staff who were all absolutely lovely and delighted to see a fellow Glaswegian, Andrew, on board.  This is my fourth review and really cannot add much more, other than to say that we will definitely return.",5,2016,05,09
137,Exceptional service,"Had a 2 night weekend stay. Service was first class. Nothing too much trouble and everybody really friendly. Champagne on arrival a lovely touch and the larder is great for a snack any time of the day, though in the evening it's effectively a full meal - we had steak and ale pie on the second night. Go on -treat yourself...",5,2016,05,08
137,Made to feel at home.,"I first came across Hotel 41 through the reviews on trip advisor. After viewing the hotels website we decided to book the conservatory suite. We wasn't disappointed! 

The staff are great. I cannot fault them. Everyone was very friendly and couldn't do enough for us. They have the perfect mix of being there when you need them but leaving you to your own devices. 

After seeing some of the reviews on trip advisor I was slightly dubious as to whether the hotel might be a bit pretentious but I didn't find it that way at all. It was very relaxed but classy all the same. 

The room we had was spacious and had every amenity we could think of. We loved the glass roof, the large shower and bath. Not forgetting the huge and very comfortable bed.

The staff booked us into a very nice restaurant for the evening at short notice. We enjoyed plundering the pantry in the executive lounge later that night and the breakfast the next morning was spot on. 

On our day of departure, reception phoned our room and said we could stay in the room beyond the 12 o'clock check out time which was a lovely unexpected gesture and allowed us to enjoy the sunshine in London without having to rush back.

Superb hotel and well deserving of our 5 stars.",5,2016,05,08
137,WOW!,I booked this months ago for my husband's 'big' birthday and for a surprise day/night out in London. The hotel staff were fantastic from start to finish - I emailed them initially enquiring about the packages they offered. The communication was brilliant as my original package changed when Billy Elliot closed in April. From the moment we walked through the door the staff were amazing - I have never been anywhere like this and we have travelled to 5* + hotels abroad.  I cannot thank them enough - our stay was amazing. They upgraded us to the Master Suite (conservatory roof) and the room is fabulous - we wanted to move in! The pantry is amazing too and the food is so fresh. Breakfast was brilliant and although I can rave on I really think the staff make Hotel 41 the place it is. Thank you all for making my husband Jeff's birthday so memorable. We can't wait to return ...,5,2016,05,07
137,"Thank you, Mrs. Tolliver!","We chose Hotel 41 for an anniversary vacation and it was a wonderful experience. The hotel is beautiful, intimate, and staffed by the nicest people you will ever meet on a trip. They helped us with theater tickets, dinner suggestions and reservations, and surprised us with a lovely anniversary cake upon arrival and candles and rose petals decorating the room one evening. The breakfasts and snacks were bountiful and delicious and we loved sampling different British gins every afternoon. The beds and bedding are luxurious and guarantee restful sleep. The best part, again, is the staff. They were unfailingly friendly and helpful and I hope to be able to go back to this lovely place next year!",5,2016,05,07
137,Simply the best in London,"This is really the best hotel in London. I really enjoyed my room, the staff is simply incredibile!! Super breakfast with all that you need. It's not cheap, but hey, if you want the best just come here and pay IT :-) i will return here very soon. 5 stars ",5,2016,05,06
137,4+1 stars!!,"The worst thing about hotel 41, is that you have to leave!! 

Form the moment you walk down the Pall Mall and round the corner, to the hotel you know you're in for a treat... Everyone know's your name and you feel like a celeb! All the staff are kind, lovely, polite and chatty, the snacks are awesome, breakfast is spot on and the room is as classy as it gets! I just wish we could have stayed longer",5,2016,05,04
137,First class ,I must say that my stay at the Hotel was a very enjoyable one. The staff could not do enough for us. The breakfast was lovely and room more then you can expect. Will be recommending this hotel to all our friends. Thank you so much we will be back one day.,5,2016,05,02
137,Best hotel we have ever stayed in!  A+,"We had the most fabulous and memorable stay at Hotel 41.  It is truly one of the nicest hotel we have ever enjoyed.  The hotel is beautiful with luxurious accommodations, a wonderful intimate executive lounge, and special treats everywhere!  From the moment we arrived, we felt like royalty and as if we were guests in your private home.  We were greeted by name by all the hotel staff and felt extremely comfortable and welcome.  The customer service is wonderful- friendly, warm, and attentive.  Everyone went out of their way to greet us daily, ask us about our day's activities, offer recommendations, and seemed truly interested in getting to know us.  My 12 year old son had the time of his life!  We were celebrating his birthday, and we were welcomed with a special birthday cake, candy, and treats in our room upon arrival. 

The rooms are beautiful, spacious, wonderful soft linens and towels, and special touches throughout.  You will not need or want anything.  Everything is provided for and makes for a very relaxing and rejuvenating stay, especially after a long day of touring. Special treats at turndown, the open pantry with snacks, canapes, desserts, and scones, and wonderful guest service make this hotel the best all-around property we have ever stayed in.  Highly recommend- wouldn't stay anywhere else!  

And a very special thank you to concierge, Andrew, who went above and beyond any expectations I have ever had.  From the moment we met him upon arrival, his welcoming attitude throughout our stay was much appreciated. We want to thank him for personally getting us surprise tickets to see Matilda.  He truly made our last day in London very special and memorable. 

Wish we could have stayed longer...4 nights wasn't enough.  We truly loved this fabulous hotel.  Thank you to all the hotel staff for giving us the most superb experience in London. We hope to return one day soon.  Ps would give you more than 5 stars if I could.  Deserve Excellent++",5,2016,05,02
137,Simply superb,"This is a hidden jewel of a hotel situated right next to Buckingham Palace. 

We arrived at the hotel and were surprised to find a beautiful but very small entrance. The doorman took us up an elevator and through some wood paneled corridors into a sublime room at he hearth if the hotel where we checked in, had a welcome glass of champagne and were shown to our suite. It reminded me of the journey of Alice into wonderland!

Try staff were lovely, helpful and refreshingly characterful. They replied with s straight face to our request for a taxi with ""I'm afraid we cannot do that sir"", followed a second later with a beaming smile saying ""Of course! Where would you like to go"".

The room the the heart of the hotel served the best Eggs Benedict I've ever had. 

I've travelled a lot and stayed at luxury hotels around the world, but this is by far the best in my view. Treat yourself.

Note: the hotel is very grand and so while there would be no problem in being very casually dressed for breakfast (like the American guy I saw in tennis shorts and trainers) you would probably feel more comfortable if you made the effort the dress a little more like the English Royal Family! ;)",5,2016,05,01
137,"Boutique pampering, worth the cost","Stayed only 3 nites, wish it was 3 weeks! The hotel is the top floor of the neighboring parter hotel next door, but when you enter you are in a world unto itself. Very plush, more staff than guests. Everything we could want was provided, including last minute show tickets, dining reservations, recommendations, you name it. The food in the common room was excellent, we stopped having late dinners out and just ate there. Staff knows your name and preferences. The room was small but luxe, wonderful bed ad amenities. will def stay there again,",5,2016,04,29
137,Fabulous hotel,So we were the biggest supporters of the Firmdale boutique hotels which are fabulous but decided to try Hotel 41 as it is highly ranked on Trip advisor! Well it is well deserving of its high ranking! Lovely  hotel! Staff are all fabulous and the rooms are great. In the evening you get back and housekeeping have turned down the room and classical music is playing which is so peaceful and relaxing! When you check in they serve you a glass of champagne!! The lounge area where you can relax with a drink or have a snack is so cosy! They have complimentary snacks throughout the day too. The breakfasts are simply delicious! Highly recommend it!!!,5,2016,04,27
137,Amazing hotel with even more amazing staff,From the moment we stepped into the hotel we were welcomed with open arms.  The staff went over and above to make us feel comfortable and important. It was almost as though they knew what we wanted or needed before we did.  We feel as though we have made new friends and would definitely stay at this beautiful hotel on our next visit to London.,5,2016,04,25
137,Outstanding Service,"This was our second stay at Hotel 41 (previous being January 2015).  Both stays have been outstanding.  The location perfect for central London.  You are within walking distance of Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Parliament, St. James Park and Green Park.  
Our room for this stay was a split level suite.  The seating area on the lower level was perfect for reading and relaxing .  The upper level sleeping area as luxurious, cozy and comfortable.  The bathroom was quite large with a heated towel rack adding a nice touch.    
I would be remiss if I didn't mention the service and the Executive Lounge.  These two features are what set Hotel 41 apart from others.  Simply put, the staff is outstanding.  They are very helpful from the time you walk in the door until after you leave.  When you arrive in the Executive Lounge, they remember your name.  The canapés in the Executive Lounge in early evening were outstanding.  The atmosphere is elegant yet relaxed.  If you are going to London and want live in luxury for awhile, stay here.",5,2016,04,23

we spent a week with our children and grandchildren. it was a real priviledge.
adjacent to st. james park, across from buckingham palace, around the corner from #10 downing street--the location was ideal. away from the noise and bustle , but easily accessible anywhere--either through victoria station, always available taxi, or by foot.",5,2016,04,20
137,BEST SERVICE EVER,We spent four nights at Hotel 41 and wished it could have been longer.  Superior service.  The staff remembered our names from day to day and even our preference of drink in the evening.  Everyone there was friendly and helpful.  They truly tried to meet your every need. It is located near Buckingham Palace.,5,2016,04,18
137,Excellent service and beautiful hotel.,"We have just returned from a stay at Hotel 41 and we still haven't stopped talking about it. From the moment we walked in, we thought we were too early to check in and just wanted to drop our bags off, the staff could not do enough for us. A glass of champagne appeared along with a tray of nibbles. By the time we had finished our champagne our room was ready. The room was lovely and had everything in that you could possible need. Lovely toiletries and lots of them. We would like to say a big thank you to Steve Jones , who made sure we had everything we wanted and did so in a really friendly manner. The breakfast , late lunch and all of the ""pantry"" food we ate there was delicious. We are now planning when to return.",5,2016,04,17
137,Only visited!,"I actually only visited this hotel, meeting friends who were staying there. What a gem of a place, I can't believe I have never stayed there. The welcoming feel, staff so attentive ( even thou I was just a visitor). I will defiantly be using this hotel in the future. First rate  class hotel in the heart of London. I look forward to booking soon.",5,2016,04,16
137,Pretty amazing...,"if you've ever visited a stately home or watched something like Downton Abbey and wondered what it was like to live like that - I'm pretty sure a stay at Hotel 41 will give you an idea.

The place is beautiful - the lobby, the corridors, the Lounge and the bedrooms are all decorated to a very high standard.

The level of staff attentiveness is extremely high - whilst everyone was lovely we had more interaction with Andrew, Michael and Steve who were very nice guys.

Whilst reading TripAdvisor reviews indicates that this place is as close to perfection as it is possible to get, there are a few things to bear in mind. 

Whilst there is the ability to nibble away to one's hearts content, in actual practice we didn't use this to any great extent - all we had we had from the selection on offer whilst we were there was one ice cream tub! We eat fairly modestly so there is no point gorging just because its there. 

We had a problem with the room and the staff went in to action to resolve it, which is all we could ask. 

The headboard of the room seemed to be next to a door in a corridor which allowed some noise when it shut and when people were talking as they went through. 

We decided to have a drink in the lounge and the cheapest cognac was nearly thirty pounds and the most expensive almost four hundred. Yikes.

On the feedback sheet we said we would recommend it and would consider going back for a special occasion but in reality we are unlikely to do so - it was just a bit ""over the top"" for us. But for one night it was an experience that we wont forget.",5,2016,04,16
137,A gem in the heart of London,"Hotel 41 is absolute Gem of a hotel in the heart of London. I can only agree with all previous reviews that have rated this hotel with 5 stars.
We stayed just for one night on my wife’s birthday and she was presented with a lovely birthday cake upon arrival in our room, along with our welcome glass of champagne at check-in. Its proximity to Victoria station is ideal especially as a forerunner to any Orient Express or British Pullman trips as you will sample absolute luxury and great service even before you get on the trains! The staff, amenities and ambiance are first class, sadly we didn’t have sufficient time in the hotel during our stay. Next time, and there certainly will be a next time, we will make more time available just to enjoy the hotel!
",5,2016,04,14
137,Magnificent & fabulous stay! Best hotel in England!,"Initially, I picked Hotel 41 due to it's convenient location! But as soon as we arrived at Hotel 41, my son (7 year old) and I feel in love with the hotel straight away - home away home!

The staff was so welcoming and caring towards my son and me (travelling alone). And even organised a complimentary private tour with one of the managers - Andrew- to take us around Buckingham Palace, Green Park and St. James's Park. Again, the next morning took my son to Green Park to play football.

For the rest of the 2 days stay, the hotel staff organised our tours and activities: chauffeur city tour, Musical Concert tickets, London Eye Fast Track ticket and restaurant bookings!

We were spoilt, but at the same time felt very well taken care at a cosmopolitan busy city. Every staff at Hotel 41 was so incredibly kind and genuine.

Overall, I would definitely say this is the best hotel in England! Hotel 41 is not only a luxurious and exclusive hotel for couples, but also very family friendly for children!

Complimentary Executive Lounge: extremely beautiful Victorian chic cosy lounge setting! Constant change of snacks and nibbles throughout the day! This, was one of my son and favourite! Ice cream, Seafood and variety of canapés, homemade hot meal supper, desserts, cakes, cheese and biscuits....indulgence!",5,2016,04,14
137,Faultless perfection,"From start to finish we were looked after and pampered.  
This is a small hotel but luxurious, without a doubt.  It should be noted that even the black cabs do not know every hotel in London, so do not be deterred if your taxi driver doesn't know it.  Just ask for The Rubens hotel and then go through the next door lobby, clearly signed for Hotel 41.
Welcomed with champagne we decided to sit by the fire in the lounge before heading to our room.  Very restful.  Attended to for any requirements but not smothered.  Once we headed to our room we found our case inside, as promised when it was taken from us at the downstairs lobby reception (before we were escorted to the check in reception).  A bottle of wine was on ice, also as promised.  The bathroom, mini bar and wardrobe were all very well appointed.  We changed and returned to the lounge for a bite to eat and relaxing bottle of wine from their excellent selection.  The bar food was delicious and again, service was spot on.  Upon returning to our room for the night we found the gas fire had been lit for us and a lovely turndown service included elemis products.  
Very little noise overnight and the following morning meant we had a restful night in a comfortable bed.  We headed for breakfast and chose the mezenine for our table.  Service again was perfect.  The chef made a little change to my ordered French toast, which I was free to reject should I wish.  It was perfect.  Very nice selection at the continental buffet and the cooked breakfast was also of a very high standard.  Mine being the French toast and my husband having the full English.  
We will certainly be returning and like to think we have found our new favourite London hotel.",5,2016,04,13
137,A fantastic hotel!,"This is a really great boutique hotel in the heart of London. The amenities are wonderful, and the staff was so accommodating and nice it was like they were old friends. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. I highly recommend Hotel 41.",5,2016,04,13
137,Absolutely perfect in every way!,"All I can say about this hotel is Wow! We booked the hotel to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary and our stay couldn't have been more perfect! From the minute we arrived and gave our name to the lady at the door to the moment left we felt so relaxed and comfortable at the hotel. The staff are all so friendly and it would be unfair to single anyone out, they all knew who we were and the personal touch is fantastic. The executive lounge is such a lovely place to relax and enjoy a drink and the amazing array of complimentary food throughout the day is superb. We were blown away when we arrived back from our meal and the staff had decorated our room with petals and candles for our anniversary, it was such a lovely personal touch that continued the next morning when we were given a glass of Buck's Fizz with our breakfast. The whole stay was absolutely amazing and we are already planning to return again for my birthday in October! Thank you again to all the staff that made our stay so memorable!",5,2016,04,12
137,Unbelievable!,"After visiting another Red Carnation group hotel previously we thought we knew what to expect from this visit but we were happy to be surprised way beyond our expectations.
I agree with all the positive reviews and I have to say this is the best hotel I have ever been to. The check in was a delight and the champagne a lovely treat.
The executive lounge and continuous snacks make it seem like a home away from home and you never go hungry!
The staff were incredible and nothing was too much trouble. They were generous with their time and we never had to remember our room number or wait for anything. 
The room was extremely comfortable and spacious and there were luxurious toiletries to enjoy.
I can 100% recommend this hotel you will not regret your decision to stay here.",5,2016,04,11
137,Truly Outstanding ,"My daughter and I stayed at Hotel 41 for 5 nights this week.  First, let me say, that the quality of the staff here is unmatched.   Everyone was so helpful, friendly and always remembered our names.  Even my 13 year old daughter was impressed (no small feat!).  We loved the lounge in particular.  The location of the property is perfect.  It is central to everywhere you want to visit and very close to Victoria Station.  To give you an idea of the exclusivity of Hotel 41, even the London cabbies need help finding it!!  Side note:  Nathaniel's negroni's should be added to the permanent cocktail menu!!  Cheers.  ",5,2016,04,09
137,My new favourite place to stay in London,"What a find!! Smallest 5 star hotel in London I believe but big in stature and customer service. Staff are all wonderful couldn't possibly single one out. Cocktails, food and snacks  all excellent quality and plenty of them.",5,2016,04,09
137,Just brilliant - believe the reviews!,"This is my first ever review but our trip to Hotel 41 definitely warrants me taking the time to post a review.  We have stayed in many 5 star hotels but this hotel definitely delivers on personal friendly service.

From the moment my husband and I arrived we were greeted with warmth, friendliness and also a complimentary glass of champagne- happy days!  We had booked an Executive King room but to our surprise we were upgraded to the Conservatory Master Suite which was set over 2 levels and was gorgeous.  

The Executive Lounge is quaint and very welcoming and we just had to take advantage of the complimentary afternoon tea consisting of warm scones, jam and cream.  The complimentary pantry is well stocked and we were actively encouraged to take whatever we wanted.

After drinks in the Lounge they ordered us a taxi to take us onto our restaurant in Chelsea.  On our return to our room it was wonderful to see that it had been filled with candles and rose petals - such a lovely gesture.

Breakfast of Eggs Royal for me and a full English for my husband was delicious - service was attentive but unobtrusive.

All in all this is a great hotel - their philosophy being summed up on the button on the phone in the bedroom labelled ""Whatever Whenever"".

Just brilliant - we will certainly go back and next time we will take the kids as well as we want them to have the experience also.
",5,2016,04,08
137,Wonderful anniversary stay,"This hotel is just perfect. I cannot think of a single thing that could be improved!  The staff are friendly, efficient and thoughtful but low key. We really enjoyed talking to them. My husband really connected with one of the staff, Steve Jones and thought the world of him. 

The Executive Lounge where business is taken care of as well as having meals there was beautiful and so tastefully done.  It became our second home while we were there. We had most of our meals there as it was so convenient and the food was what you expect  in a higher end restaurant. 

The location was really handy across from Buckingham Palace. It is a  three minute walk to Victoria station then you can go anywhere in the city on the tube. Taxis are plentiful when needed and the hotel is more than happy to help.

The room was beautiful,  spotless and very quiet. 

Thank you Hotel 41 for making our stay perfect.",5,2016,04,07
137,Perfect,"Wow!!! This hotel is absolutely perfect...where do i start? It has a very good location. And From the minute we entered we already knew that we made the right choice. The hotel is very clean and stylish. We were brought to the lounge area with free food, dessert, drinks and impeccable service from the staff. They made me feel right at home. The staff seem to have this ability to know and deliver all your needs in style and cheer. The bedroom was amazing, we didnt get a suite but the space was more than enough for all our large metal rimowa luggages and carry on luggages. It was very well decorated and the bed was very comfortable. Airconditioner was good and works even in winter i think. Television was fantastic with over 100 channels. For those that sleep in late curtains are thick enough to cover enough sunlight but not all at the sides although i was still able to sleep till the afternoon. Bathroom was great as well. Im trying to remember if there was anything that bothered me about this hotel... But there is nothing wrong. Everything is perfect! Thank you for the stay

Will come back when in london ",5,2016,04,07
137,Mr,"Expectations of a 5 star hotel is already there, hotel 41 deserves them all, environment, design, food everything is superb, but there is one thing what thous it all, The Staff!!!!! Never had such a service in my life. All of you from check in to cleaning congrats💐👊🏼 simply the best
If you want a small luxury hotel stay here and I promise you, you will enjoy your stay
It feels like family who wants to take care of you
I will return to you!!!",5,2016,04,05
137,"The best hotel in London, and the Planet.","We stayed at the 41 for 8 days, and every day things would get a little better. The staff notices what you like throughout your stay and they start doing it for you. For example, if they notice that you turn the AC on during the night. They start doing it for you. 

Another thing that is great about this hotel is the service, and the people. Andrew was an excellent chap. He recommended the best restaurants which we loved. Everyone was so nice and very helpful to us.  Mr. Jones was also great to us as he bought me some Haribo sweets with his own money because he thought I would like them. Tea in the executive lounge was one of the most enjoyable things to do in London.

This hotel is not very expensive, it is small and exclusive and it has great rooms. It beats other hotels which are far more expensive in every category.",5,2016,04,02
137,Amazing stay for our first wedding anniversary!,"We stayed here for two nights on the 23rd March as part of our 1st wedding anniversary celebrations. I had been wanting to stay here for a while as it is no.1 on tripadvisor, and after staying, we can definitely see why it is no.1! 

Like so many others have said, the service is simply outstanding. All the staff were brilliant, for example, on check in, they knew our names, loved the handwritten welcome card in the room, I had a gift for my husband delivered to the hotel directly as it would not arrived in time otherwise, and the staff had safely kept it until our arrival...they remembered what type of coffee and tea we prefer at breakfast...anytime we asked for something in our room, they delivered it so promptly...helping me locate our uber taxi as I couldn't figure out the app as it was the first time using it! 

What really stood out for us was when we came back to the hotel one night, I mentioned briefly to a staff member at reception that I like making scrapbooks of memories so was wanting to see what souvenirs of the hotel they had...when we checked out they presented me with a bag full of souvenirs such as stickers, postcards etc! I really appreciated this, and it was so thoughtful of them! I was completely surprised that they had remembered it as I had just said it as a passing comment! 

I also appreciated being addressed by my actual name, as so many people assume you are 'Mr & Mrs...' once you are married, and for work reasons I have kept my name, and this has been the only place that have actually addressed me correctly instead of making this assumption! So I thank you!

I'm so sorry I can not list everyone's names on here, however, I remember chatting to Ivo whilst he was on nights as I was taking advantage of the 'pantry', and taking photos when no one else was around! He was so friendly, and enjoyed chatting to him. There was also another member of staff on with him, I'm sorry I did not get his name, but it turned out that he lives in the same area as my family so that was good to find out! Small world! Also Mr Jones was always friendly and chatty with us in the lounge :-) 

The hotel itself is beautiful, loved the decor, and I could not stop taking photos! Sorry if this was annoying! Got some lovely shots though! Loved our room, very clean, lovely decor and great amenities. The bed was so comfortable, and the shower was great, and as we are following the cricket world cup, was great to have the Sky Sports channel! I especially liked the remote control being sanitised! That was a great touch! And also, the hotel slippers are definitely the comfiest hotel slippers we have come across! 

My husband had booked the romantic turn down service and a cake for our anniversary, and both were fab! The cake was yummy, and much larger than we had expected! And also loved the petit fours in the room on arrival. 

Breakfast was great, I especially loved the pancakes, and had them on both days. The pantry is a fantastic feature and we tried the canapes in the evening and the hot food etc in the evening time and it was great. It is so unusual to have this service in a hotel, yes there may be executive lounges which provide food for a few hours, but nothing like this, for all day! Also loved the fridge full of ice cream, had the ginger spice!

The lounge itself is stunning, and loved relaxing in there. Was especially lovely on the second day when the sun light was streaming in through the skylight, and also looks amazing in the evening with the candles, and fire. 

For the second night we went to the BBar restaurant which is attached to the Rubens Hotel, and we used the £50 credit that you get when you book the hotel directly on the website. Thoroughly recommend the BBar, great food and cocktails!

Overall, definitely recommend this hotel without a doubt and we would love to go back! Maybe for a birthday! :-) Wish I had gone to the Red Carnation Hotel shop a few doors down though as I was looking for a fridge magnet/pin as I collect them, but unfortunately they were closed while we were checking out. :-(

Keep up the amazing work, all the staff are a credit, and the hotel is stunning :-) Thank you to you all for helping to make our 1st anniversary so special! :-)

Took so many photos but have attached some of my favourites!",5,2016,03,30
137,Best Service Ever,"Recently stayed for three nights.  While the rooms are nice, what really separates this place is the service, which is the best I've ever experienced at a hotel.  The staff strikes a terrific balance of being friendly and attentive without being intrusive.  The lounge (called the Executive Room) is also a wonderful feature, much like having your own Club in London.  Will definitely stay again.",5,2016,03,29
137,Amazing start to the honeymoon!!! ,"We do not know where to begin.  There's not enough words to describe the service and hospitality we have received.

We checked in after a very early start to day absolutely shattered after a long wedding weekend! We were both keen to begin our most awaited honeymoon. 

The staff knew who we were as soon as we walked they greeted us and knew that we were newly weds! The personal service this hotel and it's staff provide is out of this world! Walking in to the hotel, or walking in for breakfast there is always a smile to greet you as well as the staff addressing you personally by your name.

Staff are always on hand - no request seems to big for them! 

The two nights we spent there was a surpise for my new wife...she thought she was going to a Holiday Inn for two nights! The staff greated us with a nice glass of champagne while we were checking in... We were given snacks and nibbles to eat in the renowned executive lounge.  The executive lounge is the central part of this hotel. You can spend hours unwinding in there and there's a world famous pantry to indulge in. 

The waiters knew myself and my wife were vegetarian so would only bring out the veggie options for us. 

I originally booked the executive kings room but to our surpise we were escorted to the conservatory room which was nothing we had seen before. Downstairs was a sofa with TV and fire place and upstairs was a king bed with a huge tv...but the highlight of this room is the roof! Clear glass to see the sky while you lay down!  The bathroom was also spectacular with a large walk in shower and jacuzzi! We were also greated with roses in the room and a lovely cake and chocolate strawberrys and candles and classical music.

We have stayed in London our whole lives and travelled the world but we are yet to see a hotel like this and we probably will not as this is unique on its own.

We requested a late check out and help with printing our boarding passes...this was done without any problems and once again the staff were friendly and happy to help.

Five out of five stars doesn't do this hotel justice if I could they would be getting a load more.

Thank you for an amazing experience and it was just what we needed before we jetted off on our honeymoon after a long wedding weekend.

Mr and Mrs Halai",5,2016,03,29
137,Elegant hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for 4 days. Located next to buckingham palace, it is in a quiet neighborhood. Small boutique style hotel. We loved it. Very good service that totally pampers you. We had a two level suite that was small, but comfortable. It was located directly next to the dining area. You entered and on the first level was a small living area with tv and gas fireplace. Up a narrow stairway was the king bedroom and bath. The bathroom was luxurious with a bathtub and separate shower. I only wish the toilet had its own room. The ceiling height in the bedroom area could be a problem for some. Seemed very low!  
One restaurant in the building. The food was very English, which was what we wanted. They also own the hotel next door and we frequented that bar as there was more activity and entertainment. This hotel is definitely a place for couples, children would be bored here. Also very pricy. ",5,2016,03,29
137,No cliché here; abundantly exceeded any expectations,"There are addresses, materials, looks, and then there are people. We oftentimes forego the persons and impress ourselves on things alone. This hotel thankfully opts to focus on the former, not that it lacks any of the latter. And for that I have no option but to rank it well above various of its more pompous competitors, including traditional ones like the Connaught and the Goring. The level of attention to detail is simply unrivaled. Congrats friends at 41, the attitude is what distinguishes you; altogether an A team. JP and I thank every one of you for one very memorable stay.",5,2016,03,29
137,"Exclusive, friendly, super comfortable","We travelled as a family during easter 2016. I had reserved the hotel as a surprise for my hsuband, whose 40th birthday we celebrated. I could not have picked a better hotel anywhere in the world. All the arrangements before our travel went smoothly and I found everyone on the staff very helpful and attentive towards my wishes. On arrival, everyone greeted us warmly and knew the names and ages of our boys by heart. We were led to the executive lounge where we were served champange and soft drinks and a very beautifully set up table with various ""snacks"" (the word does not honour the very high quality of everything that was served). Our rooms were perfect, during evening turndown the fire was lit, radio played sof music and there were warm water bottles in our beds. We enjoyed the luxurious, fresh breakfast immensely. Everyone on the staff knew exactly what we were up to each day and asked us very nicely how our day had been. Our children, 6 and 9, felt like royal kids, and me and my husband as the royal couple. Thank You, everyone in hotel 41, especially the genious who guessed QPR was our favourite team in London and had got our boys the caps of the team! Every day new surprises, friendliness, warm luxury.",5,2016,03,28
137,The BEST hotel in London,"Undisputably the best hotel in London. This place deserves every 5* review it gets. I would actually argue that it's worth visiting London just to stay here.

Staff are attentive and observant, and understand exactly how much to engage with each guest. They are incredibly knowlegable of the local area and are always willing to arrange a table etc.

There's food on offer at all times, all of the snacks are free and you can help yourself whenever you want. Breakfast is fantastic, and very competitvely priced (always opt for it if you have time).

Rooms are well furnished, and have plenty of space - even in the standard rooms.",5,2016,03,28
137,Believe everything you have read,"The darling wife and myself have just spent the most wonderful, relaxing and spoilt weekend, courtesy of the staff at Hotel41. 

The service is beyond brilliant, but what makes it so good is the way that it is done in such and understated and subtle way. Two examples to explain this. Firstly, we had the most wonderful afternoon tea on Saturday. The tea was wonderful, but the fact that staff knew I needed more hot water for the teapot without me even asking was something else. Secondly, for our trip home the staff gave us a little 'goodie bag' to tied us over. We sat on the train and opened the box and found that they had packed it with the goodies and snacks that we had taken from the pantry during our visit. My wife had mentioned in passing on the Friday evening that she found the nuts moorish and the next thing we know is that there is packet in our going away pack. It perfectly sums up what Hotel41 is about. They know because they are bothered.

There is attention to detail and then there is the Hotel41 approach to attention to detail. Put simply, they have a knack of knowing when to leave you alone. For me, this is more important than somebody asking me every two minutes if everything is OK. 

Staff give a damn. Not because they feel duty bound, but because they care. I don't drink and on arrival my wife was given a glass of champagne while I was given a glass of orange juice. No big fanfare, they know their customers. On Saturday, we went out to the theatre and on our return staff wanted to know our thoughts and views. This was classy but the fact that staff working on Sunday morning were also bothered to ask about our evening was even classier.

I'm not good enough with words to explain how brilliant the Executive Lounge is. It feels like you're at home and you automatically feel at ease. The food and drink is something else, the pantry is mind blowing and I challenge anybody to say that there isn't something there to take their fancy. 

The room itself was perfect. The turn down service makes your evening finish with an even bigger smile in your face. Climbing into bed to find that somebody has put a hot water in there is one the world's greatest pleasures.  

I could go on and on and on. We have already booked again for October. If you get a chance to go, then don't hesitate and go. It won't be your only visit.

Brilliant and utterly, utterly perfect.

",5,2016,03,27
137,The ultimate 5 star experience - go now!,"Our stay was perfect, and we would definately go again.
The staff were the most proactive and friendly staff that I have ever experienced. They seemed sincerly  interested in us as persons, and was of assistance whenever possible. They knew our needs before we knew them ourselves.
The Executive Lounge of the hotel (which all guests have access to), provided the perfect place for relaxation, a pre-dinner snack or a romantic breakfast. The room was so beatiful, that you didn't wanted to leave (see pictures on hotel home page).
Our room was in perfect condition. The bed and the pillows were nice, and the soap and creme on the bathroom from Penhaligon lifted the bathing experience to the next level.
We would not consider any other hotels in London for a romantic getaway.",5,2016,03,25
137,Loved staying here.  Very thoughtful details throughout and really friendly staff.,"Definitely worth the price due to the quality of service, beautiful and comfortable rooms, yummy food and perfect location.   It is on the top floor and very quiet too.  The concierge is very helpful with up to date events and attractions.",5,2016,03,25
137,An oasis in the bustling capital,"A stone's throw from the hustle and bustle of Buckingham Palace, this hotel occupies an ideal city centre location. From the moment we pulled up outside and the hotel staff immediately arranged to valet park our car with a minimum of fuss, we knew the service provided here was special. It is easy to miss the entrance to the hotel as it does not declare its presence with gaudy show but, like most boutique hotels, has an understated entrance. On entry, once we had been introduced to a charming young man named Andrew, we were ushered to the 5th floor and to the check in desk. Here we were greeted by another delightful member of staff and offered a glass of champagne from a selection on the trolley. The staff are what sets this hotel apart. They strike the right balance with guests. They are interested and chatty without being overly familiar and they remember where you are going and what you are doing during your stay, whilst ensuring they provide you with everything you need to be able to do this as easily as possible. We were quick to avail ourselves of the sweetie and snack buffet, choosing from the selection of delicious sweets, popcorn, crisps and nuts. We had a dinner reservation on our first night and the staff supplied us with a map and directions to a able us to walk to the nearby location. 
Our junior suite was perfect for our requirements and had a good sized bathroom with an array of lotions and potions to use and the room was well appointed. Lovely touches in the turn down service included a hot water bottle and 'his' and 'hers' elemis treats. Our room was quiet and there was no noise from the corridor or neighbouring rooms. My only criticism would be the lack of view but we kept the curtains closed.
On our second night, we decided to eat from the pantry buffet (provided free of charge) after an evening at the theatre and we had a selection of cold dishes and hot fish pie which we combined with items from the menu. My husband declared this to be the best meal of the trip, despite having eaten an 11 course tasting menu the previous evening.
Breakfast consists of an enticing selection of continental breakfast items and a comprehensive menu of hot dishes, with an unending supply of toast and drinks. 
When it was time to leave, our bags were spirited to our car which was returned outside the door and we bade farewell with regret that we could not extend our stay. Our experience here was exceptional and we have stayed in some of the world's best luxury hotels. 
Whilst I understand the criticism of the desk being in the middle of the lounge area, this did not present us with a problem but may be an issue if you have any delicate matters you wish to discuss. 
We will return to London and will now only ever stay at this hotel, nowhere else will measure up.
Boutique hotels and not to everyone's taste and this is the reason there are the very few negative reviews on this website, but if you like the personal touch and the quiet calm of staying in a smaller establishment, then this hotel is perfect. Thank you for a wonderful stay.",5,2016,03,21
137,Awesome hotel in every way possible,"I am just back from London after 4 amazing days with my wife and family. One of the reasons it was so great was because of Hotel 41. All the things that one would expect from a hotel that advertises itself as a 5-star boutique are there. The room was spacious and well adorned (we actually had 3 showers in it), the food and lounge were great and the staff were friendly, attentive and genuinely willing to do everything they could to make our stay memorable. But moreover the intangible little things really set this place apart. 
You cannot go wrong staying at Hotel 41 in London.",5,2016,03,21
137,Absolute perfection - top notch service!,"Our stay here was absolutely fantastic.  It's a small boutique hotel - and the staff is really superb.  The room was on the smallish side but it doesn't matter because it was perfectly decorated, cleaned wonderfully and the little touches are what makes this place fantastic (nightly turn down service; amazing bath products; free water and snacks all day/night).  At one point I sneezed and a member of the staff nearly tripped running up the stairs to make sure I had a tissue - the staff truly goes above and beyond at all times.  We've stayed at five star hotels all over but the staff here makes you feel really pampered.  We really can't say enough about this hotel and have absolutely found our forever London hotel.  We will return for sure.  We only gave our name once when we arrived and throughout the entire stay every member of the staff knew how we were - my wife kept saying it was magic!  You never sign a bill or check - it just happens.",5,2016,03,20
137,Nothing but quality ,"Booked this hotel for my partner birthday last weekend. The hotel was pure quality with top quality fittings and fixtures. The bedding was soft as were the towels and the wonderful bathrobe. The bedroom had sparkling champagne, chocolates etc which was a wonderful touch. On arrival were were given champagne and nibbles. The hotel was ideally located for exploring and very close to the palace. Staff were very well presented and all very polite. We would certainly stay here again. ",5,2016,03,20
137,Perfection,"Great location for hotel it was very very good in it we spent a great time there saff if the hotel was very kind and happy. Clean rooms, its not expensive a lot, it was awesome in any look . i would visit it again",5,2016,03,20
137,Pampered in London,Hotel 41 is a small boutique hotel in the heart of London. We had a delightful 3-day stay. The staff was incredibly helpful and the amenities are superb. Breakfast was plentiful and delicious. Fireplace in the bedroom was lit when we came in one day: a welcomed treat after a long walk on a cold day.  Laurent at the reception was very attentive and knowledgeable about the city. We will definitely be back.,5,2016,03,19
137,"Perfect, we'll be back..","I booked Hotel 41 for my husbands 50th birthday based on the reviews.  Having stayed in some of the best hotels around the world with his job, I thought staying in a boutique hotel was a bit of a gamble but I needn't have worried.  The customer service surpasses any expectation, the staff are all working hard to ensure you have a great stay.  From the champagne greeting and birthday cake in the room to returning to your room at night to find scattered rose petals, candles lit, fire on, water bottle warming the bed and a little beautifully wrapped treat - there was nothing to be critical about as you will be made to feel like a VIP rather than one of many guests in a larger, bustling hotel.  Visitors to Hotel 41 will have a memorable stay and we shall certainly be returning.",5,2016,03,19
137,Wonderful stay in the heart of the City,"Upon arrival we were given champagne and Canapés, and sweets and nuts, the staff were absolutely fabulous couldn't do enough for you and offered us a room upgrade, which was a lovely surprise and far exceeded the room we had at Claridges last year.
We were staying for our daughters graduation, and we came back with our sons and her afterwards to celebrate with a few drinks, and we all enjoyed the tasty food and snacks provided free to all guests. We have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world and this is one of the best, and next time we are visiting our sons we hope to return and stay.",5,2016,03,18
137,Hidden Gem in the heart of London,"This 5 star boutique hotel is a real gem, from the moment of arrival until after check out the staff of the hotel make effort to make you feel special. Addressing you always by your name and checking that everything is OK at every opportunity. Arrive hungry and thirsty as the staff take delight in feeding you with tasty snacks and to pour as much complimentary champagne and other drinks as they can. The executive lounge that forms the centre piece of the hotel reminds you of the library of Henry Higgens from ""My Fair Lady"", it is a beautiful room, spacious, simply stunning with plenty of chesterfield chairs and couches. The bedroom,(I was upgraded upon arrival), comprised of a small lounge leading to a staircase to a second floor bedroom and bathroom. The room was full of luxurious amenities, best of all were the extra soft towels and towel lined silk bathrobes. Bed was kingsized and very comfortable. 
The only suggestion for improvement is to up the capacity and speed of the free WIFI.
I have stayed in many 5 star hotels in London, for me this is one of the best.
I definitely will pay them a return visit.",5,2016,03,17
137,Perfect Stay...,"Cute, english style, little 20 room boutique, greeted with a friendly staff, easy to check in totally professional. First class hotel there isn't anything negative about hotel 41 it deserved 5 plus stars. Great location for walking everywhere or on the tube, and no problems couldn't stop the staff from assisting and making it happen for me. will stay there again 100 percent.",5,2016,03,17
137,A real jewel in the city,"I’ve travelled to London many times and stayed at a good few 5 star hotels in the city, but I have to say, the experience my wife and I had at Hotel 41 was really amazing and unforgettable.
The staff; from meeting us at entrance, to the welcome at reception and check-in, to the staff serving us in the pantry area was just truly world class. It would be difficult to name just one individual.
The upgrade was unexpected, but really and truly appreciated.
I could go on for a while, the attention to detail in the rooms, in the lounge area and the breakfast buffet was incredible.

Thank you to you and your staff for making our stay so special.",5,2016,03,17
137,Christmas celebration,"Stayed for three days over Christmas with wife and Louis (the dog). Bit worried about lack of parking, but on arrival a space was found for us at rear of hotel, free over holiday period. Easy check in with Louis getting most attention....Lovely room with view over Buckingham Palace Mews. Dog given own bed and treats. Good breakfast in library. Light snacks available in evening. Louis always got his mineral water first when going to bar for a drink, how's that for service. Drank in the Rubens Hotel bar, attached to 41, bit more lively. Overall had an excellent stay, lovely staff, will be going back. Deserves its ranking....",5,2016,03,16
137,Nearly perfect,"One of the nicest hotels I've had the pleasure of staying at. Staff could not have been more helpful, including trying to find a dentist at 2am. The executive lounge was an unexpected gem. The only area that could improve was the standard of food on the dinner menu, not matching the excellence of the breakfast. would still be our number one choice of hotels in London though",4,2016,03,13
137,2nd stay for new year!!,"Stayed here in November initially, then booked again to stay for 4 nights starting New Year's Eve, 
just when you think it cannot get any better... It does!
We arrived at the hotel to be greeted like returning friends!
We got to our room to find a nice bottle of bubbly waiting,
We stayed in New Year's Eve and enjoyed the flowing drinks, cocktails also.
We then went up on the roof to watch the fireworks on the London eye, really nice touch. Special mention to Adele, she asked us if there was anything she could help with, I said we was thinking of visiting a spa, somewhere with a pool. 5 mins later she returned having found a perfect spa for us, she booked this and printed off directions if needed. Very fast service nothing was too much trouble for her. We bumped into Andrew also who we had many chats with on our first visit, he greeted us like old friends, such a nice chap. 
Our last day we checked out in the morning and was Invited back for a drink as our train wasn't until the eve, we booked a afternoon tea when we got back and upon asking for the bill we was told ""it's on us"" such a nice touch.. I cannot wait to book my 3rd trip to hotel 41--- Perfect!!",5,2016,03,09
137,Amazing,"We picked this hotel as it was number 1 on trip advisor, and I can see why! 
From the minute we arrived the staff were brilliant, checking us in with champagne and port. 
They could not do enough for us. 
Location is perfect easy access to the tube. Some lovely restaurants nearby. We dined at a local Italian that the hotel staff recommended and booked for us. 
The bedroom had everything that we needed. The food we ordered as room service was delicious. Full English in the morning was also superb. Throughout the day and night snacks were put out, in fact by the time I went our for our evening meal I was not hungry! 
Highly recommend this hotel for special treats and indulgence 😉😉",5,2016,03,05
137,"Stay at Hotel 41, London","We have stayed in this hotel as couple i.e. my wife and myself , father and son football trip. On both occasion the stay was excellent. In our family we have named this hotel as home way from home. The rooms are excellent and there is value for money compare to other hotels in Europe. The staff are excellent and amazing. They always go beyond excellent customer service. Everyone seems to enjoy doing their job hence this transfer to the staff excelling in their job. The moment you walk in into this hotel you are treated like a King or Queen. I don't know how they do it but the Red Carnation group hotels  (Oyster Box, Hotel 41 and 12 Apostles )that i have stayed in  have excellent staff. The hotel location is excellent and close of UK kingdom palace. There is also cosy lounge where you can relax, eat your food, have relaxing drinks and just relax. Most of the food is excellent and they are for free within specified time. You can also order if the food available is not preferred food. The lounge is one of unique feature about this hotel and differentiate it from all the hotels I have stayed in Europe",5,2016,03,04
137,Perfect yet again!,"I love this hotel so much! It's perfect for our annual romantic London getaway. 

The service is second to none the rooms are luscious with lovely fluffy pillows (they give you a choice). Its like being in Alice in Wonderland with all the black & white decor.

My favourite part is returning after a night out, sitting in front of the fire in the executive lounge and helping myself to a cheese plate a drink from the honesty bar. It is only small so you rarely see any other guests. 

I can't wait to return and it will be less than a year next time!",5,2016,03,04
137,Amazing Service,"We booked this hotel due to the reviews on TripAdvisor - and wow, are we glad we did.  

We were in London for three days to celebrate my 50th Birthday and the staff at the hotel did everything to be as helpful as they could.  From the moment we walked into the hotel with the welcoming chilled champagne, to the moment we were reluctantly sent on our way at the end of our stay with a hamper of goodies from the snack bar, we cannot fault the staff or the place.  The quality of everything in this hotel is fantastic - the rooms are spacious for London hotels - the location a few minutes walk from Buckingham Palace - the free snack bar a welcome change from having to pay for every morsel you consume - excellent choice of beverages all at reasonable prices for a central London 5 star hotel.

The staff were outstanding - everyone knew and remembered your name and were as attentive and friendly as they possible could be.  After we left the hotel, we received an email from the hotel asking us to complete a review on tripadvisor - even this was personalised wishing us the best for future events we had mentioned in conversation with the staff - I have never had that before from any hotel we have stayed at - attention to detail is great and it really makes you feel special as opposed to just another paying guest.

Hotel 41 has now become our preferred location in London - we will definitely be looking to return and will make a point of trying some of the other hotels in this group when we can.  We feel like part of the family now.

Highly recommend it to any and everyone (just hope it doesn't get so booked up we can't get a room next time we are in London)",5,2016,03,04
137,Excellent! ,"Theres something to be said about good customer service and this hotel certainly has that. EVERYONE we came into contact with was very hospitable, attentive, polite and assertive.  Although its rather open plan and cosy in the main dining room (Executive Lounge) it has that certain charm and relaxing feel to
It that makes you want to just wind down and enjoy the free champagne and nibbles. Hotel itself is very clean and has many nice touches and little extras.
Well worth a visit, even if for a night!",5,2016,03,02
137,"Honestly, amazing","This hotel is honestly amazing. The service is impeccable, friendly, relaxed. The staff truly seems to enjoy their work, and that makes is such a pleasure to be there. I'm a writer, so I usually try and avoid over-use of adjectives, but seriously, this hotel is great.

At one point, I was working in the lounge, and one of the staff got me an extension plug so I could work by the fire. I happily worked for 2 or 3 hours, while eating lovely food and drinking one of the best Rose wines I've ever had.

There was a major flood, totally unrelated to the hotel-- a water main broke on the street, and that night, the internet was down while I was trying to check into my return flight. I asked about it at the desk. Didn't really mind, as I was able to go to sleep instead of working more.

The next day-- the hotel comped everything extra. Everything. It was incredibly generous.

I will stay in this hotel on my next trip to London. Most definitely.

Thanks, Hotel 41!",5,2016,03,01
137,A gem of gems,"In short, you feel instantly as if you are amongst friends. The staff is attentive and very service minded. Absolutely loved it.
This has to be one of if not the best hotel I have stayed in of all my visits to London. The location is very close to Buckingham palace.
I will return again and again",5,2016,02,29
137,Simply amazing,"We stayed here over my birthday, and I can't even explain how amazing this hotel is, the hotel itself is truly luxurious and the staff are excellent! They done every thing they could to make our stay perfect without being too much! The perfect amount of attention. From the Champagne on arrival to the 'plunder in the pantry' to the room service everything exquisite! We didn't want to leave! All the extra touches to a birthday cake to a birthday card and even a little present! Everything was wonderful and we enjoyed every second! I want to thank all the staff who made our stay the best! We shall be definitely returning. ",5,2016,02,29
137,Outstanding Hotel,"Is it really that good? ""YES""

Hotel 41 is found opposite the Royal Mews on Buckingham Palace Rd.  The outside doesn't look very grand compared to other well known hotels, but the looks are deceiving.  Once inside a very smart lobby you'll greeted by a member of the team who quickly whisk you away to the lounge to be checked in.  Welcome champange was a loverly treat whilst filling in some paper work and told about the hotel and it's plentiful supply of treats.

The room was truly amazing.  A massive bed, everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel and more. Some really nice touches' that made us feel special.  Loved the turn down service.

The hotel in centred around the lounge area which to my taste felt like a old Englishman's  library/smoking room.  Nice leather sofa's, open gas fire, old bookshelves, every single spirt you can think of and fantastic service.  

What makes this hotel truly amazing is the level of service and it's staff, be it offered water/snacks before exploring, a thank you card left in your room, hot water bottle to warm the bed, sweet/snack box for the children for when we got home the list goes on.

Thank you Hotel 41 for the perfect stay.",5,2016,02,29
137,my favourite place,"This was my third visit to 41 and it was to celebrate my daughter 21 birthday .They decorated the room with balloons and a birthday cake .This time we were in a room which faced the royal mews and it was amazing .We were booked on the wicked experiance which include tickets and a dinner ,the seats were indeed amazing but given the fact that I use crutches and 41 are aware of this I was horrified to discover that there were 27 steps down to them as when I asked for the package I said I cant do steps . , this caused me immense pain and discomfort as I am not meant to climb steps .Once back at hotel I mentioned this to them and by way of apology they covered my drinks bill and gave me a cd of wicked which was nice .Another part of the wicked experience is turndown with cupcakes but these were dry and not great but then they were left in a room with a fire burning .We also had a 3 course dinner but this left me feeling underwhelmed as I had expected a actual dinner menu but no I got in house lounge menu and whilst the choices were ok it wasn't what I had expected .The steak I ordered was amazing cooked to perfection but the rest of the meal wasn't outstanding plus my daughter only had a main .Normally I rave about 41 to anyone and whilst my daughter had a magical experience for her 21 birthday I sadly cant say the same this time . I have 2 previous reviews on 41 so I know its amazing plus the staff and service were excellent as before but for me the wicked experience spoilt my enjoyment at being at 41 as wicked is one of my favourite musicals and I was looking forward to  . Because of these issues I don't know if I will return back to 41 for my birthday next yr  which is a shame as I know how amazing this unique hotel is .",4,2016,02,29
137,Wow ,"This has to be the very best hotel I have stayed in whilst staying in London.

The location is very close to Buckingham palace and I felt like actual royalty throughout my stay.

The staff could not do any more for their guests. They are perfection. You walk through the door and everything is quality. So beautiful is the decor it took my breath away.

The bedroom was a fabulous style and size. Layout worked very well. Attention to detail shows and the quality of fixtures and fittings is first class.

What a beautiful place to stay.

I cannot wait to go back here. It was perfect!!!!",5,2016,02,27
137,perfect for a 3-night stay,"I stayed at Hotel 41 for three nights. I find it a perfect base for theatre visits and daytime sightseeing; in my case re-visiting beloved spots. As a lone traveller it is a wonderful feeling to be welcomed at the end of the day and then again at the end of the evening, after the theatre.",5,2016,02,26
137,astonishing,"we had high expectations of this place having read all the previous reviews and wondered if really it could be that good for us more ordinary folks.  unfortunately I was wrong..... it was BETTER.
All the other reviews do a great job of describing how special this place is and how it makes you feel like royalty.  the hotel is small and unique in its design and is in a really great location for visiting lots of tourist sites.
however, what makes this place stand out so much is the staff who all were exceptional, though I should give special mention to flo who welcomed us with champagne and showed us to our room and then looked after us every time he was on duty.  Also Nicole who I understand has not worked for Red Carnation for very long but she was very efficient and charming and couldn't do enough for us.
there are so many reasons that we will always remember this hotel fondly, like complimentary champagne when we arrived, a box of our favourite cookies when we left, a welcoming fire to come back to on a cold February evening.  numerous small things as well like them preparing a map for us to follow when we happened to mention we were going to walk to a local restaurant.  all without us asking.
this has now become our number one treat place to stay when we want to celebrate or just made to feel special while we relax.   thank you all for going to extra mile, we will never forget how you treated us and made us feel.",5,2016,02,26
137,Amazing place and has everything you need for a perfect stay,"Incredible experience! It was one of the best stay that we had in London and we thoroughly enjoyed it. My husband had booked this stay for me as a birthday surprise. Once you enter to the hotel you're greeted like a celebrity or VVIP.. The entire hotel was decorated in Chic Black and White breathtaking decor and located opposite to Buckingham Palace. From Reception desk to reaching at our room, the staff was so so friendly and helpful. We loved our room. It was very comfortable, with built in fireplace and the the moment I entered the room there was a surprise waiting for me.. We were completely blown away by what this beautiful place offered to us. I will definitely stay here again. In addition to this there were some other perks such as champagne on arrival, free snacks and a basket full of great stuff in our room. Thank you to all Hotel 41 staff to made our stay very memorable and comfortable.",5,2016,02,24
137,Amazing Place and Staff,"Wow what an experience, all the great reviews do not do this place justice.

I had my stay booked for me as a 50th Birthday surprise and what a surprise it was.  My wife and I stayed in the Executive King room and we were greeted with a choice of champagne and treats whilst we checked in before being shown to our room.

All the staff are on hand to help and nothing is too much trouble, truly professional caring people.  We had a fantastic evening meal and the breakfast was excellent too. Every part of the hotel is pristine and the food is excellent but the things that really make the difference are the staff. 

We plan to come back later in the year and again for our 25th wedding anniversary next year.

An amazing place to switch off from the world and to be bathed in luxury
""Thank you Hotel 41""",5,2016,02,22
137,A gem in the heart of London,"Wonderful charming little gem , with fantastic staff.
No possible to ask more. Very confortables rooms, fantastic Lounge for breakfast, tea time and pre-dinner aperitif or post dinner last glass.
Every one totally committed to the guests",5,2016,02,22
137,What a tremendous staff!,"My husband and I were blown away by what a lovely hotel this was.  You are greeted like a special guest from the moment you walk through the front door.  The ""attention to detail"" is an understatement.  It was a dreary, cold, wet night our first evening and to climb into bed to find a hot water bottle between the sheets was amazing!  We loved all the staff but Adele was particularly gracious and helpful.  We dined in the amazing library as well as in room dining..everything was delicious!  As far as location..when your next store neighbor is the Queen of England, I say it's a great neighborhood!",5,2016,02,21
137,Amazing,"I'd heard about this hotel online and decided to book as a treat for my partner and I. From the moment we entered the hotel we were treated extremely well. The staff are really friendly and go out of their way to make the stay as comfortable as possible. The room was beautiful, everything was thought of. The food is brilliant especially the breakfast. We also enjoyed afternoon tea which was exquisite. What we couldn't finish was boxed up for our train journey home. The location is perfect for site seeing. We were sad to leave but we can't wait for our next visit. I really can't rate the hotel and the service high enough.",5,2016,02,21
137,Brilliant staff,We stayed for my wife's birthday. I love how the staff managed to make us so welcome & so helpful but without coming across as over bearing or too poncy! We're going again for my birthday. It's easy walking distance to the theatre district too.,5,2016,02,21
137,Excellent for Buckingham Palace atea,A haven close to train station.  Chose to stay here because of the connection to Orient Express departure.  Room and facilities were five star.  No view at all though so if that is important to you stay elsewhere.  Review against other five stars as I'm not convinced of value for money.  ,4,2016,02,20
137,Why is it number 1?! ,"If like us you're wondering why is Hotel 41 number 1 in London, this post is for you. For a small and intimate hotel this really does set the standard pretty damn high.

Before I get into the details, what I will say is that if you like a pompous atmosphere then you're better off going to the Dorchester or similar. 

Here at 41 people will speak to you, people will try and get to know you, to me that is the best part. Everyone is friendly, chats to you, gets to know you and adjust how they approach you and/or set out how to make your stay special, after all, everyone is unique. 

For us, it was a birthday treat for my fiancée, on arrival they had made it very personal and special, as soon as we pulled up they whisked our car away and parked it for us and gave us some champagne. Everyone knew our names and what we were doing in London. That really took us by surprise.

We were quickly shown to our room to be greeted by a freshly made, bespoke cake and hamper for my partner to say happy birthday. This went down really well and earnt me some browny points, thanks 41!

Once we had settled in we went to the lounge and continued to be filled up with champagne and anything else we might require. We were so gobsmacked at the staff doing that little extra, much more than they needed to do to keep us happy, of course they kept our drinks flowing and provided snacks and such, that you can come to expect at a 5* hotel, but what really makes you realise that this is a special place is the none pompous, friendly, normal staff. They tell you about their day, they tell you about their past/future/passions etc, as well as asking you about yours. We had many deep conversations which really made us feel like we were at a friends house visiting rather than at a hotel.

For me, the biggest shock was a very little token by the hotel but it's the small things that count right? My partner had a sore lip, she was conscious about this and really did not try to draw attention to it. In the evening we went out for dinner, upon coming back to our room we were absolutely amazed to notice a lip cream had been placed in our room for my partner, now I must say we never requested this, we never even mentioned it, the hotel must of noticed it and went out of their way to help. This to us shows just why this hotel is no1 in London, yes the place is beautiful, yes the food is awesome, you are treated like family but most of all, they will go out of their way to help you with or without your request.

Thanks hotel 41. We will see you again soon. Much love.

Mr Townsend",5,2016,02,19
137,NUMBER 1 HOTEL... FOR A REASON...,"Here it goes... Long story short... My husband surprised me with a visit to his hotel. Didn't know much about it. It was to celebrate our 15th year Anniversary together. Literally from the moment you walk in you have entered a whole different experience. Once you have spoken to the lovely people on reception you are greeted by more staff to take you upstairs where you are sat down by who I presume is the manager. The champagne starts flowing and the staff cannot seem to help you enough! Then the best part of the whole experience for myself and my husband was being directed and shown to your room. We walked in and was blown away. We had a guided tour of what turned out to be the Conservatory Suite which we was upgraded too. Our champagne was already in our room and there was a cake and more chocolates downstairs. Upstairs is the gigantic room and it obviously being the conservatory room the roof was all glass... The tour just carried on. We was shown the bathroom with the jacuzzi and shower with tv on wall. There were TVs everywhere in this room. I just could not believe it when my husband told me that this wasn't the room he booked and that this was the best room in the entire hotel. So to be upgraded to this room was UNBELIEVABLE. 
The drinks are just fantastic... The food does not end and my husband and I took full advantage of that in the evening, even after our meal out. Heading back to the room in the evening, the room has been changed. Candles and rose petals everywhere including some lovely Elemis products on the pillows. Not only that. We was given a £50 credit towards anything we wanted to spend it on. So we decided to use it for breakfast which was DELICIOUS... The most wonderful touch was when we had to leave. Hardest thing I've had to do. My husband found a book he liked and couldn't find it in the shops. He spoke to one of the ladies and asked if he could purchase it. They said unfortunately it's not for sale but when we went to check out, they wrapped the book up with their signature carnation flower and presented it to my husband as a parting gift. Would I go back... Tomorrow if I could... Do I recommend it... Silly question... If only I could take all the staff they have home with me... THIS HOTEL IS OUTSTANDING AND THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS... From The Hydes... ",5,2016,02,18
137,Valentine's weekend ,Fabulous hotel and services impeccable great few days . The hotel is in a great location for all things a tourist would be looking for we walked to most places . The hotel is very quite unlike the larger hotels and every member of staff is so helpfull and friendly and the rooms are immaculately clean .,5,2016,02,18
137,Get me out of here!,"Ok, so there is no point me talking about all the wonderful things in this hotel as all the other reviews cover these aspects in great detail.

There is no denying the good points- champagne, lounge, food, beds, showers etc.

However, if you are not used to such lavish luxury think carefully before booking here because the reality of it is somewhat uncomfortable.

Although the staff appear friendly, the conversations are so scripted, at times I really didn't think they were interested in our answers and to be honest, who can blame them...guests really aren't that interesting considering they all probably do the same thing.  When I tried to go back into the hotel in the afternoon I was asked in a rather abrupt way if I needed help. I obviously didn't look like the type of person who should be staying there. That made me feel pretty stupid, but this is exactly the kind of feel the hotel gives.

It is the type of place you feel like you can't breathe in, we felt constantly in edge. Then of course there are the other guest you have to be around, listening to how some spoke to the staff made us sick. But then again, they've paid that much to stay so they have the right to treat the staff however they want.

This hotel is for people with money who want to be around people with money and be treated like they are people with money.

No thank you!",3,2016,02,17
137,Wow Amazing Amazing Amazing 5* Hotel,"Just returned from a fabulous 3 night stay at this top class hotel to celebrate my husband's 60th Birthday.  Customer service is outstanding, the best we have ever received in a UK hotel. Every single member of staff is truly wonderful, friendly & nothing is too much trouble. Our suite was lovely & very clean. The food is amazing/delicious. We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. Thank you again for a very special stay. Look forward to returning at the earliest opportunity.",5,2016,02,16
137,I expect the best hotel in the world...,"Read the other reviews and you'll see the kind of things to expect whilst staying at 41.

Perfect Service
Delicious Food
Extremely Clean rooms

Nothing is too much trouble and at no point during the stay did any members of staff say ""no that's not possible"" or ""sorry, we can't do that"". The staff do absolutely everything in their power to make your stay perfect. Which I'm pleased to say, they did.

Outstanding.",5,2016,02,14
137,I cannot recommend this hotel enough,"We've just begrudgingly left Hotel 41 and its all round wonderfulness! There's a reason this hotel is no.1. 

From the great location to the gorgeous rooms to the simply fabulous staff, everything about this hotel is just sublime. Every single member of staff is an asset to the hotel and the impeccable service it offers. 

We stayed here as it was a special trip for my parents and the hotel went out of its way to make them (and me and my husband!) feel extremely special. 

The relaxing lounge and the never ending supply of delicious snacks is such that you basically want to spend all day and night in there. The way the team remember who you are and what your preferences are, etc. is the cherry on top.

I could go on and on about how fantastic this place is. All high end hotels need to learn from Hotel 41.

We can't wait to return!",5,2016,02,12
137,Outstanding,We recently stayed at 41 in London on our way to Tel Aviv.  We wanted our hotel to be part of  our London experience.  We were searching for a boutique hotel with character that portrays the elegance and proper standards that really represent London at it's finest.  This hotel was absolutely that and more.  Thank you for a fabulous stay!  Great location as well.,5,2016,02,12
137,A Magical Pocket of Perfection!,"My husband & i have been to '41' on many occasions  ~ Absolutely every time we stay at this gorgeous hotel we are SOO totally happy!!! We have stopped trying other hotels in London….. Nowhere else 'ticks all the boxes'. Terrific location, always the most fabulous reception the moment we arrive, lovely staff who make us feel genuinely & warmly welcomed.  The entire package is Amazing & having to leave is dreadful! 

We happily nest in the lounge for hours ~ Sink into the sofa beside the fire, served cracking canapés & warm mini ham toasties etc.  The 'pantry' is very exciting too, throughout the day x night it is bursting with Goodies… cheese/Deli gems, chocolates and sweets and fruit and…!  However, if you are still hungry and fancy some fresh air, walking is a pleasure in the local area and advice on which restaurant you may enjoy is taken care of too. 

In a nut shell ~ This slice of superness is First Class in every way, you are treated so beautifully and spoiled with many surprises. Perfect :-)",5,2016,02,12
137,A true boutique,"Hotel 41 is a place unlike most.  At 41, you get the service of a 5-star hotel, the décor of a proper London dwelling, and the feeling of being at home.

Unlike most places, the only people allowed into the hotel are the guests.  While at other hotels the elevators and lounge spots may be taken by persons off the street, at 41 the entire experience is about the guests.  The GM, Mr. Hendry, can be found in the lounge talking with guests and staff, ensuring the hotel is doing everything to accommodate needs you may have.  Lauren at the desk is astute and just seems to get it, anticipating what you are looking for and providing the exact right information or assistance.  And their staff work as hard (and are as kind) as any I have seen in my travel.

The best example from 41’s staff is Gina.  Gina represents what 41 is about.  Thoughtful, knowledgeable, and genuine, Gina has the ability to make her work look effortless while she does so much.  Great service at a boutique hotel is a balancing act; making guest feel at home while not overdoing it is a skill that not all boutiques do well.  Gina knows how to always be accommodating and assistive while still allowing you to relax and enjoy.  If you meet Gina, you will know – you will see the true boutique experience represented in her work.  She is a superstar.  She, like many of her colleagues, are what make 41 worthwhile.

It should also be mentioned that no hotel stay for me is without issue – I am far too picky to be entirely pleased.  And a boutique hotel always has its quirks.  For example, my room at 41 was lovely but had design flaws.  And not every member of the staff was on par with those mentioned above.  But this is the essence of staying in a small, unique hotel.  In the world of boutiques, it is not possible to have every detail perfect or every staff member an all-star.  The mark of a great boutique is not perfection, rather if the hotel gives you a unique experience while making you feel at home.  41 does so in wonderful fashion.

To clarify, a boutique hotel is not one you pick for its every amenity or massively large rooms.  You stay at a boutique for the comfortable feel and exceptional service.  41 gives the balance you are looking for, making you feel completely at home while still allowing you to vacation.",5,2016,02,12
137,Fantastic Stay,"We have just returned from a fabulous two night stay at Hotel 41 in London.  The hotel staff were friendly, polite, attentive and ready to assist whenever required.  We returned fro seeing 'Wicked' to find that the staff had arranged for the CD from the show to be playing in our room.  As we left, we were sent on our way with complimentary sweets and coffees for the journey - brilliant!!",5,2016,02,10
137,Amazing stay,"It was amazing stay. We felt like a king :) Our room was spacious, very well equipment. Bed was very soft and comfortable. The location is also very good - a few steps to Victoria underground station and to the Buckingham Palace. The staff was wonderful especially Polish ladies: Magdalena, Patrycja and Paula. It is really worth to be there and it's for sure our No 1:) in London. 

Paweł & Joanna",5,2016,02,09
137,Amazing stay - the staff are the stars,"This is such a special place, a unique little haven of calm in Central London. The minute we arrived, we were warmly welcomed and swiftly helped with all the chaos of our bags and small dog, to immediate calm. Even before arrival, with various phone conversations and emails, the service was excellent, and that just continued throughout our stay. 

The hotel itself is quiet and relaxing, with the Lounge the central area for checking in (the front desk staff here are so helpful and lovely), and for eating, drinking and relaxing (or working, if you have to). Steve and the rest of the staff here just make you feel so welcome, are genuinely friendly without being intrusive, and are always on hand to tempt you with the various delicious complimentary delights that are laid on throughout the day or night! It would be so easy to just stay there and never venture out of the hotel. But we had to. Breakfasts are also excellent, with a great range of freshly cooked choices and cheery, friendly service from Jess and the rest of the staff.

The rooms are so comfortable, quiet and spotlessly clean. The turn-down touches are also very thoughtful and a lovely surprise. Not to mention the wonderful touches for dogs. This was one of the most dog-friendly hotels we've ever stayed in. Our dog experienced as much excellent service as we did, and was as relaxed and happy as we were! I won't spoil all the surprises for anyone who is thinking of staying with their dog but I will just say that there are so many lovely thoughtful touches that were much appreciated and some souvenirs that will be treasured. 

An excellent, unique, small hotel in a great location, but the staff are what make it really special. They are a real credit. We very much hope to return in the not-too-distant future.",5,2016,02,09
137,A Private Retreat in a Great Location,"This hotel is excellently located next to Buckingham Palace and very close to Victoria Station.  It is the perfect retreat after a busy day in the city or to recover from a long flight.  

The library and lounge area surrounds you with quiet and graceful English elegance - you'll feel like you're in the library at Downton Abbey for a cup of tea with the Duke and Duchess.  The rooms are also beautifully decorated and well insulated from the sounds of the city which helps to provide for a good night's sleep. 

The staff and service is excellent and very attentive to your every need.

Advice: Finding this hotel can be a bit tricky since the outside is very understated.  I often have to tell the cabbie to go to the Ruben's Hotel which is next door to Hotel 41.",5,2016,02,09
137,Fabulous,"Worthy of the all rave reviews. We stayed for 2 nights and I could have cheerfully moved in!
 Quiet, friendly but exemplary service, super breakfasts, great complimentary evening supper courtesy of the ""plunder the pantry"" facility. Definitely worth booking in advance for the best prices and worth asking the team to source theatre tickets etc. 
We would stay again in a heartbeat.",5,2016,02,09
137,Perfect Anniversary,"This was a truly wonderful, relaxing stay. The staff were so attentive, nothing was too much trouble. We were thoroughly spoilt with champagne on arrival, a gorgeous cake for our anniversary, and a very quiet room. Considering this is central London, it was like an oasis, very relaxing indeed. We will definitely be returning to 41 !",5,2016,02,08
137,Amazing Hotel worthy of 6 stars,"My husband and I travel extensively and stay in hotels all over the UK, usually  of a four or five  star rating.  How this Hotel has not got 6 stars I do not know!  You will not be disappointed if you choose this Hotel.  Once you stay here you will not wish to stay anywhere else in London again.  
The welcome reception was really lovely with a drink and nibbles on arrival.  A beautiful executive lounge to sit in and relax.  
All of the staff are exceptionally lovely and nothing is too much trouble.  They really do make you feel very special.  
Our room 4101 was very comfortable with views over the Royal Mews.  The bed was huge and very comfortable, high quality sheets and pillows and luxury duvet.  
The bathroom had large bath and shower with ample Penhaligon toiletries, luxury bath robes and slippers and plenty of great big fluffy towels.  
The turn-down service was beautiful, we were celebrating our Wedding Anniversary and we had cake and chocolates left in the room with rose petals and candles everywhere.  The fire was alight and Elemis goodies left on our pillows.  We had a hot water bottle placed in the bed and slippers placed out for us.  Truly amazing service they think of everything.  
The pantry was also excellent, lots of snacks and exquisite canapes on offer including curry and rice until late, perfect for returning late from the theatre. 
Breakfast was also a real feast and freshly cooked to order.  
We had a final drink on departure and really did not want to leave.  We will be returning in the very near future.  
The service received was so attentive and we felt like Royalty.  ",5,2016,02,08
137,Simply fabulous ,"My recent stay at hotel 41 exceeded all expectations and I can see why the hotel is number one in London.

The two ladies that helped me at check in and check out were excellent and could not do enough for me.

The hotel is beautiful as is the room. The fire place in particular is a wonderful touch.

The drinks and snacks in the executive lounge were also great and the service impeccable. As was the food I ordered by room service, absolutely delicious.

All in all hotel 41 is an excellent place to stay and I would recommend the hotel to anybody who is going to London.

I hope to return soon.
",5,2016,02,08
137,Service beyond compare,"Our stay lasted a week, so we had the full experience and can confidently say their service is beyond compare. The main lounge is remarkable, being both elegant and comfortable; You can truly relax here. You sip cocktails by the fire and feel you are in the home of a good friend who just happens to make killer martinis. Having tea in the late afternoon? Be sure to leaf through any of a number of gorgeous coffee table books on Rock Gods or Fashion or Art & Architecture which you always mean to purchase, never do and turn out to be even more interesting than you imagined. This is where you will have breakfast and breakfast *is* the most important meal of the day. Every day my husband had something new and every day I had the same two egg omelette with toast and tea; Every day our food was perfectly prepared and arrived at the same time which is nothing short of a bonafide kitchen miracle. It's like they have Mary Poppins back there whipping perfection up out of magic bags. Our room was charming and the bathroom of the Jr. Suite is spacious with a full bathtub (essential to recover from miles of walking each day). The only pea in the mattress is the service corridor runs only a few feet away from the Jr. Suite's bed, so that room is not the best for lighter sleepers.",4,2016,02,07
137,Attentive Service,"Centrally located in a quintessential old-style London hotel. The service levels were incredibly high. In fact, I have never experienced this level of service in London. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,02,07
137,Perfect birthday ,"I recently visited hotel 41 for my birthday and it was the most wonderful stay. 
Everyone was so welcoming and friendly. 

I was greeted with champagne and a plethora of snacks throughout the day. 
The service is above and beyond what I expected. And as the reviews set out, definitely worth the #1 rating. 

Thanks again to everyone at the hotel. It was truly exceptional. ",5,2016,02,07
137,Beyond expectations,"We went for a short break to celebrate my wife's special birthday and there could be no better place to be. The hotel is accessed via a smart entrance off Buckingham Palace Road and a lift takes you to the hotel which is located on the fifth floor. The heart of the hotel is the executive lounge where breakfast is served and there are a variety of snacks available throughout the day. Nothing is too much to ask for and the polite, smart and professional staff were the best in the business. There are two young lads who are working in the hotel as part of their professional studies and they will no doubt go on to top jobs in their chosen careers. 

We travelled with our dog, Rocky, and he was treated like royalty. 

The hotel itself is only small, but the staff/customer ratio is impressive and everyone played their part in making our stay a memorable one. The location is excellent being just opposite Buckingham Palace and there are several excellent restaurants within easy reach along with many of London's top tourist sites.

It is not coincidence that this is the top rated hotel in London.

",5,2016,02,06
137,Phonomenal!,"We spent last night at Hote41 and it was quite possibly the most fabulous hotel stay we have ever had (and there have been a few!) 

The staff could not do enough for us, and the surroundings are beautiful. Our room was stunning, and every need that you could have, was catered for. The members of staff addressed you by name and made you feel truly important.

I would go back in a heartbeat!",5,2016,02,04
137,Believe the reviews,"Hotel 41 really is that good- the attention to detail is impeccable. We have had a hugely enjoyable overnight stay. Our mystery ""turn down"" lady came and went whilst we were at The Royal Albert Hall; we returned to a roaring fire, candles and rose petals which was a true pleasure to behold- she clearly took a lot of trouble to make it look wonderful and succeeded
Book a night- it's worth it!",5,2016,02,03
137,Best birthday & engagement celebration weekend!,"The staff and the service are what makes this hotel stand out above the rest, from the doorman opening our taxi door and carrying our bags inside, to the offer of bottled water for our journey home, and everything in between, our stay was nothing short of magical! The Conservatory suite has to be seen to be believed - a TV in the bathroom (along with jacuzzi bath and double length shower), a separate lounge area with a fire, TV and mini bar, and the most comfortable bed ever! Breakfast was superb - a choice of cooked or continental with such a vast choice of pastries, cereals, fruit, bread, meat, cheese.... Our suite included complimentary sewing kit, shoe shine kit, dental kit, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, bubble bath, tissues, cotton buds and cotton wool pads. Dressing gowns and slippers were provided, along with stationery items in the desk (post it notes, a highlighter pen and a hole punch amongst others). These guys have thought of EVERYTHING but most of all they treat you so well, like they never want you to leave! Luxurious surroundings and a personal service I could not fault; this was such a special occasion for us and the staff helped make it even more so. From remembering our choice of drinks to waiting to be invited into the room when they brought room service, they were genuinely so attentive yet still friendly, and nothing was too much trouble. We can't wait to return!",5,2016,02,02
137,Incredible pampering,"The entire hotel experience is guest-focused down to the last detail. From the moment you check-in, you're treated like the only customer they've ever had, and the staff is happy to meet your every need and whim. The rooms are very stylish and comfortable, the turn down service is delightful, and the nightly snack buffet was delicious. I especially enjoyed having an entire tea service brought up to my room and poured for me each morning - certainly eased the wake up process!",5,2016,02,01
137,A real VIP experience,"The building and your surroundings are absolutely beautiful but the staff are fantastic and make such a difference. This must be what it is like to be treated like Royalty.
What a fantastic experience. The service is 1st class and exemplary without being intrusive. The rooms are fabulous, the little touches make the stay extra special. 
The reception team were so helpful. I can not find a single fault with 41. If you get the chance go and stay here!",4,2016,02,01
137,Anniversary weekend,"Amazing, amazing, amazing....Everything you can ever want and more. Quite possibly the most attentive and helpful staff anywhere in the world. Amazing location, wonderfully appointed rooms.
The free food and drink are of the highest quality,The paid for food and drink is worth every penny.
I would be happy to live here for the rest of my life (finances depending) but otherwise I will just have to enjoy it when I can. 
Please go and find out for yourselves how great this hotel is!",5,2016,02,01
137,Best hotel I have ever stayed in for service,"The reviews on here are all excellent and justifiably so.

We stayed here the night after our wedding as we needed somewhere to stay before flying to New York the next day for our honeymoon. We treated ourselves to the Romance Package and didn't look back.

You truly are treated like a VIP from the minute you enter the door. The staff chat to you like they actually care and you can choose from an array of hot drinks or (limitless) champagne after you check-in.

The room, although on the smaller side, is immaculately decorated and very relaxing. It has all mod cons you would expect from a luxury hotel and not everything costs (i.e. proper tea and coffee on offer with biscuits, full Sky TV, really nice bathroom amenities). As we went for the romance package we were spoiled with massage oils, special pillows which was a really nice touch and something I've never had before. 

My advice would be not to go out for dinner and wait for the 'plunder the pantry.' We stupidly went for a big meal and then couldn't indulge in all the treats which are plentiful. There are savoury meals as well as sweet treats so really something for everyone. I was honestly heartbroken that I had no room for anything. The library area where you sit to eat and drink is wonderful. I won't spoil it but it feels so calming and relaxing. If we wasn't so tired from our wedding we would have sat there for hours.

On returning to our room we were treated to a beautiful chocolate cake to say congratulations and I really thought this was a very special thing to do. Our flight to NYC the next day was stupidly early and we were given hot drinks to take with us in the taxi.

The service is impeccable as is everything else about this hotel. I can't wait to go back!",5,2016,01,29
137,Truly amazing,"I visited Hotel 41 on New Year's day to propose to my girlfriend. I had the help of the wonderful staff, particularly Adele, Gina and Lauren who were extremely helpful throughout my entire stay. 

My room was upgraded to a suite and there was champagne and treats on arrival. After my (successful) proposal there was a surprise in the executive lounge where we were reserved a space by the fireplace and treated with even more champagne. The lounge is also wonderfully supplied with all sorts of goodies. All of the staff are attentive, friendly and they made the evening very special for us. 

It is by far the best hotel I've ever stayed at and I'm glad I decided to plan my proposal here.",5,2016,01,28
137,"Do you want to be treated like ""Royalty"" all the while staying across from Buckingham Palace ?","....then stay at Hotel 41 !!!
Be prepared...London will be a very expensive visit because of the exchange rate on our Canadian dollar.
But, for that once in a life time experience, save your bucks and stay at Hotel 41.
It is a boutique 5 star hotel right across from the ""Mews"" of Buckingham Palace. This means you will not be looking at the main building but will be facing the huge brick wall surrounding the outer buildings of the Palace. Believe it or not the wall is actually very impressive looking as it has huge spikes and barbed wire on it's top and it surrounds the Palace grounds until you walk around to the magnificent front gates.
I was told that if a person was ever stupid enough to scale the wall there are armed guards patrolling on the other side that would not hesitate to shoot you.
But enough about the Palace.
The minute you enter the compact lobby of Hotel 41 you feel that you have been transported into a bygone era of gentility. The hotel exudes the finest of traditional British decor.
The concierge is immediately at the front entrance and offers you refreshments while she fills you in on the Hotels facilities. There are only 28 suites in the hotel and the staff outnumber the guests two to one!
You are invited to the Executive Lounge for a champagne reception where you are formally registered. I stayed in  King executive suite which had separate areas for a desk, seating area with a love seat, fireplace and bathroom with shower and a soaker tub..and a magnificent king size bed with linens that I would be afraid to ask the cost of.
If you accidentally forgot all of your toiletries you would find everything that you possibly would need supplied...and all first class! 
There is an evening ""turn down"" service so that when you return to your room in the evening, you will find the fireplace on, classical music playing in the background and a lit candle in the bathroom....and there is a hot water warming bottle under the covers so that you do not get into a chillly bed!
Later in the evening you can ""plunder the pantry"" in the magnificent Executive lounge for free !! They provide an incredible array of snacks for you to enjoy at no extra cost. They even have small tubs of ice cream...be sure to try the gin and tonic flavour. If you want to take any of these things back to your room you won't be allowed to do it yourself....a waiter will carry them for you.
I did not try any of the evening meals on their menu but I did have the Eggs Benedict every morning for breakfast....the best I have ever tasted.
Please google Hotel 41 on any website to see for your self the rooms etc. You will be very very impressed.
The hotel is located very close to Victoria station where you can quickly use the underground transportation system to anywhere in London. 
Make sure you get the ""Oyster Pass"" at your airport for bus and underground and different express passes into London from your airport you will save a lot.
Enjoy London...and if you cannot stay at the Buckingham Palace, stay at Hotel 41 for the same experience !",5,2016,01,28
137,Simply the Best,"This was our second visit to Hotel 41 and our third to a Red Carnation Hotel (all fantastic hotels by the way).  There was a minor incident on our first visit that made us hesitate to re-book, but we were arriving late and the 24 hour Plunder the Pantry tipped the scales in its favour (the pantry is complementary and stocked with a large variety of high quality food items). I am very glad we stayed again. The staff are all so eager to please, the lounge has so much character and is so comfortable and cozy, and the room we were upgraded to was out of this world.  It is the epitome of hospitality-I only wish we could have stayed longer!",5,2016,01,26
137,Lovely hotel,"The hotel is fantastic. I loved everything about it. From their efficient services to the interior design of the rooms. Staff very friendly, they really look after you. Would come back here next year.",5,2016,01,26
137,5 Stars with a dog,"We wanted to go to London, go to a show and stay in a luxurious hotel that would accept our dog, Louis. The description and photos of Hotel 41 looked like it may fit the bill, so we booked online. The friendliness and efficiency of Hotel 41 revealed itself immediately we pulled up outside. Our baggage - and the dog were unloaded rapidly and we were signed in (after an offer of a glass of champagne) and shown to our room for the night. Included in the room was a welcoming pack for Louis which comprised a dog bed (perfect size) a toy, a tin of food, water bowls, a do not disturb sign (for the dog) and a breakfast menu (for the Dog!) This level of service indicated the attention you get if you only have two legs! that was soon verified.  Everything in this hotel is pristine, the rooms, the beds, the executive lounge and more importantly the service, with a smile and nothing is too much trouble. We will go back soon.      ",5,2016,01,26
137,the perfect is not always the enemy of the good,"hotel 41 for all its glamour and luxury and harry potter with a fashion sensitive upgrade executive lounge is all about the staff. They have hospitality down to a perfect art. That and the 5 star setting belies the adage that the perfect is the enemy of the good. The service was simply impeccable. We had a junior suite which had a small but beautifully set out sitting area downstairs and upstairs we had a large and beautifully set out bedroom and ensuite. Unfortunately my partner and I wandered the corridors every time we came into the hotel, like hansel and gretal we were lost almost every time. I am not blessed with a sense of direction at all but my partner is. Of course the staff who are always around are pleased to direct you but if you don't like to ask you will need to pay careful attention to your route within the hotel... or take breadcrumbs.",5,2016,01,26
137,The best little hotel in London,"Hotel 41 in London has to be the absolute best small hotel I have ever stayed at. The overall ambience is stunning, the staff are amazing - nothing is too much trouble. The room was above expectations - the bed 'perfect'. The location just behind Buckingham Palace made it very easy to get to all major attractions - Victoria Tube station was less than 5 minutes walk. The food was wonderful - especially the 'Butlers Pantry' offering a choice of food through the evening at no extra charge. If you are looking for a truly superior hotel in London, Hotel 41 should be your first choice. As with all hotels, the staff make the experience, and the Hotel 41 staff are truly at the top of the game. Nothing is too much trouble - ask for a hot water bottle at 11.00 at night and it is delivered within minutes. Ask for lemon, honey and hot water and it is delivered in minutes. I cannot speak too highly of Hotel 41. Of course such luxury comes at a price, but I believe that their rates reflect the overall quality of the experience.",5,2016,01,25
137,FANTASTIC HOTEL,"A friend and I spent 3 nights at Hotel 41, and we would have happily stayed there for a month.  The hotel is quiet and charming, and on arrival we were sipping champagne on a comfortable sofa, while checking in. The rooms were lovely, the staff was absolutely amazing, and the food was fantastic. I highly recommend this hotel and would love to return.",5,2016,01,25
137,Beyond fabulous,"We have just returned from a night at 41.  What a fantastic experience.  From the moment we arrived to when we reluctantly left we enjoyed every second.  The service is exemplary without being intrusive.  The rooms are fabulous, the little touches make the stay extra special.  Whilst the building and surroundings are wonderful it is the people that work there that make 41 stand apart from other 5* hotels.  I would highly recommend a chat with Steve as he pours you champagne on arrival, great guy.
The reception team were so helpful. I can not find a single fault with 41.  If you get the chance to, stay here!",5,2016,01,24
137,Fantastic Attention to Detail,"Having stayed in many hotels in London it was an absolute pleasure to find this little gem of a hotel.  From arriving at the front door, to champagne whilst waiting to check in and a room of the highest standard, there is not a single thing that I could think of to improve my experience.  All of the staff made my experience exceptional and the hotel is to be our base for all future London trips.  A great job, well done and many thanks",5,2016,01,24
137,Fabulous Hotel,"Our daughter booked us in for a night for my husbands birthday in January.  I can't praise it enough. The level of service from ALL the staff was exceptional, lots of smiley faces.  The room and the bed were extremely  comfortable, even rose petals and tea lights when we gotback to the room.  The tea was an added treat, homemade cakes and scones.  Would cetainly make sure to go back again.",5,2016,01,24
137,AMAZING,"My partner & I visited Hotel 41 over the Christmas period to celebrate her Christmas Day birthday and our 20th anniversary, which I mentioned while booking. 
What an amazing hotel, we were enchanted. The level of service we received from Team 41 was incomparable.  We have visited many 5 star hotels in Europe and USA but we have rarely encountered such a level of friendly, professional attention as we received from the Team 41 staff.  We were warmly welcomed on arrival with a much appreciated free glass of champagne whilst checking in and when we were taken to our room our bags were already there.  This level of service continued throughout our stay and we were struck by the Team's genuine wish to provide us with a highly comfortable and enjoyable experience.  It was the little touches which made us feel special, for example the delight in returning late to our room Christmas Eve and finding a scattering of rose petals and candles, a tray of chocolates and the fire lit, and also the placing of a hot water bottle in our bed every evening.  Much appreciated, and totally unexpected. On Christmas morning we were surprised to find a lovely Christmas stocking hanging on the door handle...such a nice touch. Throughout Christmas Day every single member of staff took the trouble of wishing my partner a happy birthday, they arranged a birthday cake and surprised her with a birthday card and gift, making her birthday even more special. How lovely the hotel remembered and made such an effort for her birthday. Over our five-day stay the staff always enquired how we were and if they could help in any way.  The Team were charming, always interested in our plans for the day and happy to engage in meaningful conversation.   At the time of my booking I asked for recommendations for local restaurants and the hotel staff were happy to make reservations for us, in one case pulling strings to obtain us a table in an exclusive restaurant which had been fully booked for Christmas Day. Nothing was too much trouble, nothing was overlooked. My partner described her experience at Hotel 41 as being wrapped in a thick cosy blanket and hugged...a little fanciful perhaps but our stay was certainly fabulous and we hope to return later in the year.

Footnote:  We enjoyed the restaurant Quilon, about 5/10 minute walk from the hotel.  If you enjoy Indian cuisine, this is for you,  the food is excellent.  Quilon do not accept gratuities, even if you wish to leave one, their policy being that they hoped you had a good experience and wish you to return...an interesting approach which other restaurants could learn from",5,2016,01,20
137,Great Service but rooms needs some renovations,"This is #1 in trip advisor list and deserved that rankings based on service, amenities, guest service is superb , location is great only comment is rooms needs to be renovated, Concierge helped me to book very good restaurants .",4,2016,01,19
137,Best hotel we've ever stayed in! ,"We visited hotel 41 on the 16th Jan for my husbands 40th and from start to finish I cannot fault our stay. We stayed in the conservatory room which was a stunning room with downstairs lounge, big bedroom, wonderful jacuzzi bath and a stunning glass roof. The staff made us feel so welcome and made my husbands birthday so special, from the birthday cake in the room to the rose petals and candles in the room on our return (all totally unexpected). This 5 star hotel is welcoming and relaxing without any of the snobbery or up tight feel to other 5 star hotels. Staff are friendly, attentive and warm. We had ample complimentary champagne, delicious canapés and snacks from the buffet. In the evening we had booked a room at la caprice and we were handed a print out of walking directions in case we decided to walk back. A memorable and wonderful stay - cannot rate it highly enough.

137,Priceless,"Feeling at home when you are not at home...
We spent a weekend (first time with our baby) and everything was perfect. The staff was very helpful and we had a very good time.
Since a few years Hotel 41 is the place we book when we visit London. It has become like a tradition... Thanks!",5,2016,01,19
137,Best London hotel we've stayed in!,"Hotel 41 is a small hotel on the fifth floor above the Rubens Hotel. Enter by a private entrance and take the lift to the fifth floor reception Executive Room, everything seems so calm and smooth - a million miles from the madness of the big hotel receptions. 
No queue, only a flute of Veuve and a smooth registration in a split level library, more reminiscent of a twenties explorers club. Staff universally excellent, friendly without being over formal or familiar.
The rooms have a striking contrast of black and white, but it works. Spotlessly clean and well equipped with multiple Loewe TV's and a full Sky channel set viewed in sharp HD - not the typical chain hotel 'mush'. Large beds, crisp white 41 branded bedding, mattress toppers and unobtrusive AC give the best possible chance of a good nights sleep high (but not too high) above the London streets. 
Our room 4119 was a split level duplex, with a modest reception lounge on the ground floor where staff set out a (gluten free!) birthday cake and champagne on my wife's birthday together with lightly scented candles and rose petals - not a detail missed. The spacious upper level had a large Super King bed, large bathroom with full bath an separate shower cubicle...
But the real standout experience was down to the staff, from reception through to beautiful breakfast in a spacious library - no shoehorned tables in a wannabe canteen here! It's always dangerous to pick out any individuals, but Nathaniel who helped us relax in front of the warming fire after we returned from a dismal meal at the Ivy Chelsea Garden, is worth his weight in gold!
So much more on offer, the 24 hour complimentary 'pantry' area is a massive understatement, with sweets in the afternoon, gluten free ice creams through the day and a buffet in the evening coupled with free water, distanced our experience from that more typical of hotels. There guests are often left with the impression the sole purpose is to empty your wallet at every opportunity - whilst 41 is appropriately pitched for the quality offered, that impression was never present here - rather a quiet confidence, not arrogance that the tranquil oasis, so close to central London may well justify, as Tripadvisor suggests, the best hotel in London....",5,2016,01,18
137,"Perfectly Exceptional, Balanced Just Right","We found ourselves in a last minuted situation needing to find a hotel while visiting London. Of course checking TA first the obvious choice was Hotel 41. From the moment of booking through departure there was not a weak link in the experience. Having been fortunate enough to stay in many nice hotels in my lifetime, this easily ranks amongst THE best experiences thanks primary to the staff and people that take such pride in this small boutique 5 star hotel. The room, what everyone expects from any hotel, comfortable, warm, well equipped, safe and quiet. The staff, friendly, accommodating, genuine and caring without exception, You feel they really enjoy what they do and are glad you are there.  There is a very comfortable common area that you are taken to when you are checked in and also when you decide to have breakfast, drinks or just a quick snack. Always staffed and always with a fantastic selection of food and drink. The location is excellent, and although a busy area of London (Buckingham) once inside, you leave the hustle and bustle behind. 

This is a special place and well worth a visit. This will know be our go to spot when visiting London.",5,2016,01,18
137,Perfect from start to finish!!,"I recently celebrated my birthday with a trip to London staying in Hotel 41. On arrival we were warmly greeted by a member of staff, were relieved of our luggage and accompanied to check-in and a welcoming glass of champagne! I know all of this is promised on the hotel's website but the reality is more than expected. I can honestly say this was the warmest welcome I've ever experienced - and I've stayed in many luxury hotels around the world. The difference I think is that the staff appear genuinely happy in their work and that carries through in everything they do.
The hotel ticks all the boxes for luxury and service and there is little I can add to hat has already been said in previous reviews. In fact we were so comfortable and cosy on our last evening that we stayed in for dinner despite being in London with all it has to offer! We had a table set up where we wanted it in the lounge and shared a delicious dinner. The food was great as it was for breakfast and the endless complimentary options we sampled,available throughout the day.
We were unlucky with the weather - it was cold and wet for most of our stay - but to return from an evening out and discover a hot water bottle waiting for you in bed was  an unexpected pleasure!! 
I'd like to say a special thanks to Andrew and Mitchell who both sorted out our technical problems with phones. Thanks for your patience with two technical Luddites!!",5,2016,01,18
137,Outstanding service from an exceptional Hotel,Weekend away at Hotel 41 to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday. Booked based on the really great feedback on trip advisor and wasn't dissapointed. Exceptional sevice from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. Have stayed in numerous supposedly 5 star hotel in the past which have never lived up to their ratting. Hotel 41 not only lives up to its rating but goes beyond it in terms of the friendlyness and proffessionalism of its staff. Best hotel experiance we have ever had!!!!!!!,5,2016,01,17
137,30th birthday visit,"This hotel is exceptional from start to finish. The surroundings are stunning, the staff are fantastic and they go to the next level of detail to make your stay special. The location is also very central.

Hotel 41 made my 30th birthday a very memorable one. If you are thinking of booking don't hesitate, you won't beat this hotel.",5,2016,01,17
137,Words can't describe how you are treated in this hotel.,"A very close friend and I were extremely lucky to stay in this hotel in January 2016, I booked the room 7 days in advance for the price of 295 pounds, which, from the reviews I believed to be a reasonable price! We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by one of the nicest hotel workers I have ever encountered, unfortunately his name slips my mind however even his conversation and genuine interest in our situation was comforting and pleasant. We were taken to the executive lounge to check in where we were offered champagne which was complimentary! I was then charged 50 pounds for any items we may use while in the hotel however this was put back into my account promptly when I left the hotel after not using any of the extra items or services on offer. What made this stay incredibly special was the fact me and my partner were upgraded to the best room in the hotel, the conservatory suite, words cannot describe how we felt when we were shown this room, and were told we would be staying in it for the night for no extra charge, both of us were speechless and I cannot thank the hotel enough for this immense act of generosity! To conclude the staff at the hotel were kind and caring and I'm sure they would be happy to go completely out of their way I order to make their guests happy! The staff really do make this hotel incredibly special along with beautiful upkeep and decoration this hotel is simply perfect. Literally no flaws during our 1 night stay and if you want a special night in London, this hotel has to be your first choice. Absolutely amazing! Would stay here again without any hesitation.

137,bubble of luxury,"My boyfriend treated me to staying at hotel 41 and it's an amazing hotel, the staff can't do enough for you and there are lots of complimentary perks, champagne on arrival, canapes, fireplace lit and curtains drawn for your return in the evening being just some of them. 
Your in an ideal location for being amongst the tourist attractions London has to offer, but perfectly when you step inside the hotel you can even forget where you are and just enjoy being in your own bubble of luxury. 
I highly recommend a visit!",5,2016,01,11
137,Top place to stay in London,"Hands down, possibly the best hotel I have stayed in. The service is top notch...so welcoming, so helpful, and so professional. The rooms are quiet, clean, comfortable, and luxurious. During my visit, in which I was visiting while my husband was in London for work, the hotel placed us in one of their suites...it was incredible. The food, which we only had breakfast, dessert, and some snacks were good. For my first English breakfast, I loved it. One of the days we ordered a shrimp cocktail for a snack to our room and they came with a different (nicer) shrimp dish than the menu, which was awesome.  The location of the hotel felt super convenient to wherever we wanted to go. It allowed us to easily walk over to buckingham and through the parks to explore more of London.

My husband has stayed here numerous times while in London and would always tell me how much he loves it, I am so glad I got to see first hand what he was talking about.

If I ever get to visit London again, Hotel 41 will definitely be where I stay.",5,2016,01,11
137,Absolutely perfect!,"We stayed this weekend at this boutique hotel expecting a nice experience a the reviews were pretty good. I have to say that I and my friends were absolutely delighted with the quality of the service and the attention to detail. Rooms where wonderfully and tastefully decorated and any conceivable need was already taken care of. 
The food served at breakfast and through out the day was very good. we felt really spoiled and I would like to thank again the staff and their management for such a stunning performance.
Please note this is my first review ever! 
I have stayed in wonderful hotels in London but so far this exceeded my expectations and this is why I take the time.
To conclude, it is a wonderful place to stay while in London for short or long term so go for it any time your budget allows. You will not forget it!",5,2016,01,11
137,Luxurious honeymoon!,"We stayed 2 nights at this hotel. From the moment we entered the premise, we were greeted by our names, and refreshments.  My wife got her hot chocolate (Starbucks).  We were then escorted to the Executive Lounge at level 5 to check in.  Upon check in, we were served a glass of champagne and canapés, which were very nice.  

The room is big, clean and luxurious. My wife ordered a cycling bike and it was there in the room waiting for us! There was also a personalised card from the hotel and cake for us in the room. 

We loved the 'Raid the Pantry' in the Executive Lounge. There you can have as many ice cream, chips, tipbits, cheeses and drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic).

Service was thoughtful and personal. They were always there to help with anything. One thing special they did for us (that my wife loved most) was making the fireplace before we came back to room in the evening of the 2nd night.

Our stay was not cheap, but its worth every Ringgit! We will visit this hotel again when we come back to London in the future.",5,2016,01,10
137,Truly special,"My best friend and I stayed at Hotel 41 during our week-long trip to London to celebrate the new year. The experience was fantastic from the moment we walked in until the moment we checked out.

We arrived early in the morning on Saturday 1/2, expecting that we would drop off our bags and check in later when our room was ready. We were whisked to the executive lounge, where we were offered a glass of champagne and checked in. Andrew told us that we would have a temporary room to freshen up and relax while our room was prepared. He then proceeded to spend 45 minutes mapping out places to eat and drink while we were in London. 

Our room was ready at 1:00 in the afternoon, and it was really perfect. It was nicely laid out, comfortable, and quiet. The bed was excellent, and turn-down service included a hot water bottle in the bed to warm it up each evening. I slept like a rock the entire trip.

The hotel is beautifully situated - not far from Victoria Station, but also very central. We walked almost everywhere all week long. Hyde Park and St James Parks are really close - great for getting in a morning run. After one wet and rainy run, we returned to the hotel to change and were greeted with fluffy towels to dry off with at the front door. This was typical of the attention to great service provided by the staff.

The executive lounge was always stocked with great food for a sit down breakfast or a mid-day (or midnight) snack. The food was fresh, varied, and good. The staff was always friendly and helpful. We both felt so spoiled during our stay - it was really difficult to leave!

London is a fantastic city and Hotel 41 made the trip even better than anticipated. I will definitely return!",5,2016,01,10
137,All other hotels bow down to Hotel 41,"We visited here for my fiancee's birthday. It was a stop over while we saw Billy Elliot and did some retail therapy. When we arrived at the hotel we entered the building and proceeded to check in until the receptionist told us we don't have a booking.....I was devastated but luckily she said we are booked in their sister hotel next door. We had used the wrong door and were in the Rubens hotel instead (which loooked very nice by the way). Whoops.....panic over we entered Hotel 41. We were early but this didn't seem a problem for them. We were told to leave our bags at reception and were taken to the executive lounge. The lounge is lovely and a very relaxing place to be in between sight seeing, shopping and seeing a show. There is a complimentary buffet available all day till 1am including ice cream and sweets!! We were offered a complimentary glass of champagne while we booked in then we were told our room was available. This hotel is immaculate and the room was no different. We had an executive room which gives access to the lounge. What's included is above and beyond anything else we had experienced at a hotel (we don't stay 5* very often). The list goes on but to give you an idea......complimentary water, big bowl of fruit, his and hers dressing gowns, slippers, sewing kit, shoe shine, hot water bottle, iron, two umbrellas, shoe horn, Bose sound system with iPod docking, sky HD including movies, telephone in toilet, tooth picks, shower caps, ear buds, cotton pads, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, soap, toothbrushes, scales, pens and stationary, triple glazed windows (nothing is getting through there) blackout windows, air con, turn down service, rooms are cleaned twice a day! We felt so relaxed and pampered. I requested some roses and chocolates to be in the room with a note for my fiancee and they did no problem. They also added a cake with a personal message for her for free. They also provide transfers by taxi or range rover for an additional fee and will even pack your luggage. We had breakfast in bed which didn't disappoint! If money was no object the extras available are mind blowing. How the other half live hey? Word of warning......some champagne costs £150 a glass!! I would definitely recommend this hotel and I will definitely be coming back. Excellent service from all of the staff that dealt with us. Good job Hotel 41!",5,2016,01,10
137,Best of the best,"Many hotels say they have excellent service. This one does. There is a button on the phone console named ""any time/anything."" which says it all. The room we stayed in and the lounge were beautifully appointed.  Food delicious.  We were treated like royalty.",5,2016,01,09
137,A must when in London,"I stayed here for my birthday this week. The hotel, staff, service were all exceptional! They cannot do enough for you and the champagne on arrival was fantastic  as were the treats and and canapés.
As it was my birthday a cake were waiting in my room and the staff wished me happy birthday on many occasions.",5,2016,01,08
137,Superb,"Stayed here on a recent visit to the smoke for a concert at the O2, chosen really only from other TA reviews.
Nothing disappointed, the place is excellent, the staff are excellent and, as previously said by others, everyone goes out of their way to make you feel at home.
The buffet spread continually impressed and almost surprised us when it was freshened up after midnight one evening when most places would be thinking about packing away for the evening!
Even the hot water system was impressive with the hot water being instantaneous whenever you put a tap on!
Return visit? Most certainly whenever we visit London again for sure!",5,2016,01,06
137,James Bond like feel,Wonderful little hotel within the Rubin's hotel. Was the old ballroom but they converted it to one floor. All the rooms are on the 5th floor so you enter a small door and take the lift up. The rooms surround an executive lounge which is always full of treats and snacks In fact we ate so much from the lounge that it kinda ruined our dinner meals. If you looking for a hotel with plush and big lobby with spas and the like this isn't a ritz Carlton. It's small quaint and they wait on you hand and foot.,4,2016,01,06
137,Exquisite,"My partner treat me to an amazing birthday treat (in December 2014, however, TripAdvisor will only let us go as far back as Feb 2015) that included a stay at this gorgeous hotel! The interiors, rooms, amenities, location, food, service, staff were all exceptional. After being offered hot chocolates (at a door side hot chocolate table filled with many treats such as chocolates, cream, sprinkles, jellies and marshmallows) we were ushered upstairs to their lounge and welcome room to check in where we were also sat down with champagne (Gosset Grand Rose Brut). Our room was being prepare and our bags were taken up to our room so we were then seated by the fire with more pink champagne and some lovely snacks. 

Our room was an executive double with stunning and very chic interiors, excellent Penhaligon toiletries, warm and cosy bedding, lots of room extras and well stocked mini fridge. We were met with a deliciously creamy birthday cheesecake along with smaller sweets (mini florentines and jellies). We freshened up and decided to order two afternoon teas to our room before we stepped out for the evening. The afternoon tea was exquisite. My partner and I are both pastry chefs who own and run our own business so we're very fussy when it comes to food. 

We left the hotel a few hours after arriving and on our return we found that staff had included a complimentary turn down service with hot water bottles nestled under the duvet, the bed ready for us, lights dimmed, rose petals scattered across the room, and a full rose.

Then came the complimentary treats in the lounge... a beautiful spread of smoked salmon, cheeses, olives, crackers, meats, etc. You're welcome to return to the bar of midnight snacks as many times as you wish and the staff replenish everything quickly. 

In the morning it was unfortunately time for us to check out. We had our luggage stored away for us so we could do a little more sight seeing and shopping before having to catch our train. As an extra birthday treat (after the free turn down service - usually around £90) the hotel struck off our mini bar bill and our room service charges!

This was such a wonderful stay and we definitely cannot rate this hotel high enough!",5,2016,01,04
137,Bank holiday bliss,"We like to see a fair bit of theatre and therefore find ourselves in London on a reasonably regular basis. We have given thought to buying a second home there to allow easier weekends away in the capital. 

As everyone knows, property in London is fairly expensive and the costs of acquiring and maintaining a second home would be substantial. 

I'd like to tell you that this is not at all necessary as Hotel 41 can cater for all the needs you could consider. It is just so relaxing to stretch out in the executive lounge and know that everything you could want is just one question away. The staff are attentive and friendly without being intrusive or overly familiar. You simply get the impression that they enjoy having guests! 

Why would you buy another house or flat when you can have all this without complication and over the year the total cost would barely cover about one month's mortgage on a flat in Marylebone! 

This was our second visit and if I thought that the service was good on the first visit then I can tell you that they exceeded themselves on this visit! The room we had was a substantial upgrade and this had not been asked for ( I would consider it extremely impolite to ask for an upgrade in any case) , and must be one of the most iconic hotel rooms in central London. 

There's always more snacks than you could consume and on this visit I could finally get a chance to 'plunder the pantry' after the theatre, and what an enjoyable late night feast it was! 

We will be back and I look forward to being 'at home' once more",5,2016,01,04
137,Quite simply the finest hotel we have ever stayed in,This was our second trip to the 41 and it was absolutely perfect again.  The staff is excellent and the facilities are superb.  It is a very easy walk to Buckingham Palace and other shops.  The only knock might be that the restaurant choices are slightly limited but the hotel makes up for it by having great food and drink choices of it's own right in the hotel.  Without a doubt the best part of the stay is the staff.,5,2016,01,03
137,Home for the holidays!,This was our 4th consecutive Christmas at 41 and it was the best yet. Its a wonderful place and the team are always so friendly with a great sense of fun and genuine care for their guests.  The personal touches an attention to detail are second to none.  We'd always recommend 41 as the best place to stay in London and Christmas wouldn't be the same without a visit!,5,2016,01,03
137,Exceptional Service And Stay,"This was my fourth trip to London, however, on this trip my wife was joining me and this was going to be her first time to London.  With this in mind I wanted to stay at a very refined place that is different from the high-end chain hotels.  So, after some research I chose Hotel 41.  

A week out before our trip, the staff reached out to me to make sure our stay would be perfect.  Right after we landed at the airport we were picked up by private drive the hotel set up for us and whisked us away to the hotel in style.  As we arrived the doorman showed up greeted us and took our bags inside.  Once inside we were greeted again by a very friendly member of the staff (all members of the staff were very friendly and ready to help out), who took us up to the Executive Lounge for check-in and arrival drink.  After the staff explained the lounge use to us, they took us to our room.  We were staying in the executive king for four nights and the room was perfect and the bathroom was big and roomy.  

What sets Hotel 41 apart from other luxury hotels that I have stayed at is their exceptional staff and the level of service they provide the people who stay their.  Every time you meet a member of the staff they greeted you with a smile and asked if they can get you anything.  There was always a member of the staff at the entrance of the Hotel to greet you with water, snacks, call a taxi.  

The location of the Hotel 41 is perfect and is centrally located in center London and vey close to the Victoria Tube station.

Hotel 41 is the place that my wife and I will be returning to again and again.

Anthony Wells",5,2016,01,02
137,Best place I have ever stayed!,"From start to finish, our stay at 41 was perfect.
We did find it a little difficult to find the hotel to begin with as it's quite a small hotel so can get lost next to the grand entrance of the hotel next door. However, as soon as we arrived outside the hotel, a member of the concierge was there to greet us and take care of the parking of our car, the cost of of the parking and valet in total was £35, which we thought was very reasonable for central London. 
We arrived 1.5hrs before check in, which of course was our own fault, but the staff were so welcoming and made us comfortable until our room was ready by seating us in the Executive Lounge and offering us complimentary champagne and nibbles. 
Although it was no problem for us to wait in the homely but luxurious lounge, the hotel staff were so apologetic about our wait, we were upgraded the best room in the hotel (conservatory suite) free of charge!! I expect this was a stroke of luck for us as a result of probably a last minute cancellation, but none the less, a wonderful gesture. 
There is no other word to describe our room other than, spectacular. There was absolutely no more we could've asked for from a hotel room, they have thought of absolutely everything and nothing is too much trouble for the charming and attentive staff. 
The Executive lounge offers a lovely area to sit with a bar and complimentary buffet between around 7am-1am which is perfect if your peckish but don't want a big meal. 
Undoubtedly the best service I have ever received and the best hotel room I have stayed in. We never wanted to leave and I will not hesitate to return back to 41 next time I plan on visiting London. ",5,2016,01,02
137,Wonderful,"Booked to stay for 1 night at Hotel 41, and the hotel really blew us away.
All of the staff members could not do enough for us & it is a wondefully picturesque property.
Would recommend this hotel to anyone who's looking tostay in London!",5,2016,01,02
137,A Perfect Holiday in London,"Our family of four spent Christmas and New Years at Hotel 41 and could not have chosen a better property.  There are so many good things to say about this property, it is hard to know where to start.  The location is great and the rooms are perfectly appointed - everything you would expect from a 5 star property.  The Library (lounge) literally has snacks around the clock and is a wonderful, comfortable place to hang out.  Our family played cards there every night before bed.  It is warm and inviting.

It is the staff, however, that makes the property stand out.  They are helpful and gracious and thoughtful.  From Christmas gifts and stockings on Christmas morning, to an autographed commemorative after we saw Wicked, to assistance with so many other things throughout out stay -- their professionalism and thoughtfulness completely exceeded our expectations.  I cannot wait to return.",5,2016,01,02
137,"Incredible staff, Incredible service","Like all the reviews before you cannot fault the 41. We stayed 3 nights over New Year the rooms are beautifully appointed, the executive lounge is as you see in the photo's, stunning and the food throughout the day excellent. We also tried the bbar next door which is well worth a visit and being from the 41 were treated like royalty, excellent service and very good food. But the Jewel in this crown at the 41 are the staff, I can only say what beautiful people, there's a fine line of knowing how to look after people without being intrusive and this they manage to achieve. I would also like to pay my complements to the one's behind the scenes. Already planning to return.",5,2016,01,02
137,Absolutely fabulous ,"Hotel 41 is an absolutely fabulous place to stay. You are made to feel so welcome as soon as you enter the hotel. I came to stay with my brother and two friends on 31 Dec to 2 January and had an absolutely amazing New Years celebration. All the staff are so lovely, so helpful and absolutely nothing is too much trouble. You feel thoroughly spoilt from the minute you arrive at the hotel. The executive lounge is a lovely place to chill out and enjoy the plunder pantry, which changes throughout the day with all sorts of lovely goodies. I have stayed in several 5 star hotels over the years but I have to say that Hotel 41 tops them all. The attention to detail is simply exceptional, you have to stay at Hotel 41 to really understand what I mean. They really have thought of everything. Hotel 41 is just a really really special Hotel and I cannot recommend it enough. I will definitely stay again without a doubt. If you stay here you will not be disappointed I promise you. ",5,2016,01,02
137,Fabulous from the moment you walk through the door,"I rarely make reviews on tripadvisor, but i thought it was important that i express what an obsolute gem this is, from walking in the door to leaving, nothing is too much trouble. The staff are fantastic and make an effort to introduce themselves, get to know you and they really remember your name, which really does provide the personnal touch that is so often missing in the bigger hotels. The ongoing flow of nibbles/food in the lounge is excellent and literally you can stay there all night and just soke in the relaxed, classy ambiance. As for the room, top notch, again every detail covered.
Definitely a 5 star experiance.",5,2015,12,30
137,Our stay was excellent this year!,"We recently returned from a 7 night stay, our third stay at the Hotel 41.  We enjoyed an excellent experience this time and continue to smile over our great memories!

We had requested our favorite room overlooking the Royal Mews and were happy to be staying in that room once again. The room is nice sized and the bathroom with that huge, deep tub is wonderful. 

My daughter needs a gluten-free diet and this time the 41 met her needs very well. She was extremely happy with the options available to her this stay and that alone made us both want to return yet again. 

We both enjoyed the excellent breakfast offerings each morning. Those Belgian waffles - fantastic!  The dinner and afternoon tea which are included with our Costco vacation package were very enjoyable. Plunder the Pantry is always nice to enjoy at the end of a busy day. It's such a relaxing experience to dine in the beautiful Executive Lounge.  

The 41 is a wonderful hotel but it's the staff that makes it extra special. Everyone went out of their way to make sure that we were enjoying our stay. The staff at the front desk are pleasant, asking about our plans for the day or volunteering an umbrella if it's raining. Having hot chocolate available in the lobby on a cold winter evening is a treat!  It was nice having a quick visit with Malcolm each morning and getting some tips for things to do. The Executive Lounge staff are friendly and efficient. We enjoyed seeing them each day and having quick chats. Gina, Patricia and Nathaniel deserve a special mention for their attentive service to us.   

My daughter had contacted manager Lauren in advance to request a surprise for me. Lauren and staff went above and beyond creating this gift. We were both very pleased and my daughter said it far exceeded her expectations. Thank you again!  

I also very much enjoyed the Elemis products at turn-down rather than sweets. I thank Adele very much for her surprise of a few extra Elemis items that I couldn't find in stores!   :  )  

We had an incredible time this year. We had a few issues during our previous stay, but every one of them were corrected this time and we thank the 41 for that. We love everything about the 41 - the staff, the building itself, the wonderful food, the location. 
We felt like we were leaving friends when we departed this year. We love the 41 so much that we have already booked another stay for late next year. We can't wait to return!",5,2015,12,29
137,PERFECT in every way!,"After reading tripadvisor reviews, I booked the hotel as a surprise for my boyfriend to celebrate being together for 10 years. From the moment we walked in, we were made to feel that nothing was too much bother and as if we were their only guests. We were greeted with a choice of champagne (to check in with!) before being shown to our stunning room (Monarch Suite) and then spent the evening relaxing in the Lounge. The staff are not only attentive but very friendly in a professional manner. We had a truly magical evening and breakfast was excellent too. Every part of the hotel is pristine and the food is excellent but the people who really make the difference are the staff. For a special treat, book Hotel 41 as you won't be disappointed.",5,2015,12,27
137,"Hotel 41 The best unknown hotel in London, that does the exceptional like no other","For our 2nd trip this year to Hotel 41, Malcon Hendry  and his exceptional team decided to raise the bar on what can only be called sublime,

137,Perfect Weekend,"From the moment we walked in we felt more royal than the lady who lives across the road! We can only echo other reviews in that the staff are absolutely amazing, nothing is too much trouble. They are very attentive without being at all intrusive and all seem genuinely interested in you. The executive lounge is a haven of peace and tranquillity and the rooms have every comfort you could wish for. The real stand out feature is the attention to detail. This truly is an exceptional hotel.",5,2015,12,24

Beautiful interior including beautiful rooms. Very nice and helpful staff. Good breakfast and the complementary snacks and bites (until 1am) are a good reason for drinks in the hotel bar. 
Would go again 100%  ",5,2015,12,23
137,Brilliant,"Took my husband for his 50th birthday, the service was impeccable, the staff were amazing, we were made to feel very welcome & special. The whole experience was phenomenal & I would highly recommend to others.",5,2015,12,23
137,The Best Staff in London,"I stayed at 41 for the third time this year-- so clearly I am a fan.  Here are some of my thoughts. This hotel can compete on every front that most people judge a hotel. The rooms are very nicely appointed--classic English style, very tastefully done. The beds are very comfortable (you might need that wakeup call so as to not oversleep...I do) The rooms in which I have stayed have had the shower separate from the bath, a fireplace, an excellent television with full Sky premium programming amongst other amenities. That is the baseline. However, what makes this hotel shine so bright is its staff-- I cannot say that I have seen better in London. 

Firstly, the staff members are always beautifully attired and present themselves in a first class manner. They always seem to be aware of or anticipating  some need you will have before you actually realize the need yourself.  Anecdotally, I took special note of the pleasing fact that just about all of the staff I saw earlier (February) in the year were still there to look after me this time (December). In fact, I laughed when one of the woman staff remembered just how I like my drink--to me, that is indicative of what this hotel does like few other hotels can, which is to make a guest feel special.  

What I have also found is that all of the other guests seem to be very happy and content. (This you will see when enjoying  the 41 executive lounge, one of the most unique and comfortable in London.)  I believe this contentment is a natural reaction to the incredibly positive service character that this hotel's staff provides. 

TO close, I now use 41 as a benchmark for comparison when staying at other hotels around the world and look forward to my next stay there!",5,2015,12,23
137,1st class in all departments,"Went to London for Christmas shopping and a show with my wife
Hotel 41 was the icing on the cake
Treated like royalty from the time we went through the door until we left
Staff couldn't do enough for us
Will certainly be staying at 41 when we go back to London ",5,2015,12,20
137,Outstanding establishment ,"Stayed for Christmas and anniversary trip. Staff at 41 are better than anywhere else I have stayed, so attentive and everything with our stay was personalised to us! So thoughtful. Great location for London hotel. Fantastic stay and will definitely be back when we can! ",5,2015,12,20
137,London Style and Luxury,"The rooms in this lovely hotel are on the top floor and some have working fireplaces. I cannot say enough about the gracious staff. Every single person was fabulous and wanted to make sure all was perfect.  I particularly love the champagne offered upon arrival. My room was comfortable and spotless with a view of the Royal Mews. I appreciated the tasteful decor throughout 41.

I enjoyed  breakfast in the hotel, ""Plunder the Pantry""which gave me access to snacks throughout the day, hors d'oeuvres in the lounge in the evening, free ice cream and the perfectly stocked honesty bar. 

No request is too difficult. I asked for arrangements for a car to take me to the Royal Opera House and the staff was happy to do that or to call a taxi for me. I was given easy walking directions for the area on my first morning and they even sent me out with cookies in case I needed a pick me up. Restaurants are just downstairs but also plentiful in this area and easy to walk to. When I needed directions for a train to Bath, they helped me with that too and I enjoyed 41 so much that I shorted my time in Bath so I could spend more time in London. 

 I ADORE the Leopard Champagne Bar which is easily accessed from 41, being located in their sister property right next door. Cozy and charming and very stylish yet friendly. 

There is no pool or spa in this hotel but in this area of London, there are many lovely spas to book and many have indoor pools.  

When I travel, I tend to seek out a hotel that I can count on and use again and again on return trips. I want them to consider me a ""regular guest"" and look forward to my return.  Really, this boutique hotel gives the feeling of being a guest in a lovely private home. I prefer this feeling to the larger less personal hotels where no one really knows my name or personal likes.  

41 is my definite ""home away from home"" in London.",5,2015,12,17
137,This is a REAL Gem,"WOW, this hotel is AMAZING, our second visit to 41, equally as impressive as our first visit. Attention to detail is first class, great rooms, very comfortable and the fire is a real treat when you go to your room after a long day in London. The executive lounge, with its roaring fire and great food and drink selection is a must.

Very hard to fault this GREAT hotel & the staff are all FANTASTIC.

Can't wait for the next visit.",5,2015,12,15
137,Just when you think it can't get any better... it does!,"This is my sixth stay at 41. Again, I am lost for words as to the level of service provided by this property, the level of support, the degree to which the staff are willing to go. 
It is incredible and it is better than a home from home. It is an entire team devoted to ensuring you are comfortable and that all your needs are met- no matter what they are. It does not matter if you need an extremely rare object, they will look, or if you need someone to set up a perfect platter. Whatever it is, the staff will take wonderful care of you. 
For everyone considering Hotel 41 for their stay in London, I beseech you not to look elsewhere. Do yourself a favor and stay here- I have stayed in many of the world's finest hotels, including most of London's, and there is nowhere that can even begin to match the level of intimate yet completely unobtrusive service that this renowned establishment provides. The only issue is after Hotel 41, nothing else will ever do.",5,2015,12,15
137,No way can this be the best hotel in London........,"Yes its a nice hotel. The staff are excellent and the rooms are comfortable. But it doesn't compare with the luxury and facilities of the likes of The Dorchester etc.
It operates a mega expensive even for London honesty bar system. So don't get caught out at checkout.
The rooms are well equipped with various toiletries only what you would expect at the room rate.
Summing up. Its nothing special. If you travel a lot and have experienced some of the worlds leading hotels this is like a glorified B & B with good staff.",4,2015,12,13
137,Comfortable and friendly,"We had a faultless and very enjoyable one-night stay here. We booked a standard room but were upgraded on arrival to what was described as the best room in the house (4104) - it was on two floors, with a cost sitting area complete with flame gas fire downstairs and bedroom and large bathroom upstairs. The crowning glory was a large glass atrium over the bed, with a panoramic view of the heavens above! My wife arrived very early, well before check-in time (I had a meeting in town), and was offered every courtesy and full use of the comfortable lounge until the room was available. Throughout our stay the staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful. We were on a breakfast-inclusive rate and the breakfast was superb. We had an evening meal at the adjoining B-Bar (part of the same group, I think), which was also very good. After we checked out they held our bags for us while we enjoyed a day in London; upon our return to collect our luggage, we were again offered use of the lounge and complimentary tea and biscuits, even though we had officially checked out. We are already planning a return trip.",5,2015,12,10
137,Amazing customer service,"Have visited 5 star hotels all over the world and this without doubt was my beat customer service experience. Stayed for 2 nights over the weekend, on arrival all members of staff were very welcoming and we enjoyed some champaign. Not all my stay was perfect in the aspect the floors are very noisy when trying to sleep, so had a sleepless couple of nights. What i will say though is I still give this a five star simply for presentation and service from all employees, so for them to get me to look past this was fantastic. Each and every member of staff took a genuine interest in your days and plans and I would definitely be visiting the hotel again.",5,2015,12,08
137,50th Birthday Treat,"We visited 41 for two nights from the the 2nd to 4th December.

It was to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday and we had two rooms. One they set up as a twin for my two grown up daughters (4109) and a king size for ourselves (4105).

Both rooms were fabulous and have just about everything you could ever need.
The staff are absolutely first class and cater for your every need. I cannot fault the service we had from the moment we checked in to the moment we left so thank you to Andrew and the team......

It's probably the most I've ever paid for a room at a hotel but have to say it was good value compared to other top end London hotels and if in London again this is where we will stay.

If you want a peaceful, quiet hotel with top service look no further. ",5,2015,12,06
137,Wow! Absolute amazing and fantastically high levels of service!,"Recently stayed here for two nights, we arrived on Saturday around 8pm, taken up to the hotel level (floor 5).
We had champaign of our choice while we checked in.
We got shown to our room... Absolutely fantastic! A very nice fresh fruit bowl with a bottle of bubbly and a very nicely presented evening turn down.
Breakfast both mornings was absolutely fantastic! The best poached eggs I've ever had! Again with a glass of bubbly.
The plunder the pantry is fantastic.. Snacks all day. 
We even had a few snacks prepared for us to keep us going on our shopping trip.
We checked out at 12 but our train wasn't until 8pm... We was invited back after our day out for a drink and snacks before we leave.
I've never been to such a well run hotel. Never have I received such high levels of service... ANYWHERE!!
So much so we are returning for 4 nights in New Year's Eve.
All the staff fantastic! We had more interaction with Andrew.. Made the time for a chat ect felt like we had known him for a while, very nice chap, hope to see you on our next trip.",5,2015,12,03
137,Outstanding,"Well where do I start from the moment we walked into the hotel it was absolutely amazing the staff Were very professional and caring, especially Andrew. 
The room was beautiful and the little touches in the room with his and her slippers,sweets,fruit and the little elemis gifts each night was just wonderful. 
We enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere in the executive lounge you have the right balance for breakfast and then to enjoy a nice glass of champagne and cocktails during the evening. 
By far the most amazing weekend we have ever had. 
We can't wait to return to stay with you on New Year's Eve for 4 nights. 
I have not stopped talking about the hotel and recommended it to everyone",5,2015,12,03
137,Splendid,"Everything un this hotel is magnificent. The service is outstanding and the location is perfect. But the best they have is the people who work there, all of them are very kind and professional, always ready to solve any problem and arrange anything you could need. The best in London.",5,2015,12,02
137,NUMBER 1 FOR A REASON1,"We have just returned from staying four nights at this, a home from home.  From the moment we arrived, until the time we left we received fantastic levels of service from all the staff we encountered.
ALL staff were absolutely brilliant and whilst it may seem unfair to single anyone of them out, we encountered some more than others, by virtue of our time in the Hotel or their duties.  So, Andrew a massive thanks for your service, restaurant and travel tips and for being an all round lovely guy, and Steve for our welcome, champagne and we enjoyed our chat.
Anyone reading any review with regard to this hotel should have no doubt that you will be treated to a fantastic experience, the friendliest staff I have ever encountered (even in other 5 star hotels) and an outstanding quality of service.  If you encounter any problem they will resolve this beyond your expectations (as we experienced), it means so so much to them to ensure you have a fantastic time.
Believe me, if you are looking for a home from home whilst in London then this is it.
Room facilities have been the subject of previous reviews but a massive bowl of fresh fruit, water and the ability to ""plunder in the pantry"" will ensure you want for nothing!
The breakfasts are scrumptious and there is everything you could wish for :)

To the management and staff - thank you so so much and well done :)",5,2015,12,01
137,Still speechless,Wow. We fell in love with this hotel and did not want to leave. Staff is very attentive and friendly. Rooms are very comfortable. We felt like home! A perfect place to stay for special occasions. We will defintetly come back. The only problem: You will be tempted to eat and drink the whole day.,5,2015,12,01
137,Fantastic place!!! ,"I have just spent 1 night at this amazing hotel for my partners 50th birthday. Hotel 41 is 1st class, amazing service, amazing room, amazing food and great attention to detail. We were delighted with our stay, the staff were so helpful and nothing was too much trouble, with the manager even emailing us before hand to ore warn us of roadworks outside the hotel. Nothing here disappointedThank you so much for making my partners birthday such a special one. I can not recommend hotel 41 enough!! ",5,2015,12,01
137,Best hotel I've ever stayed in. ,Absolutely fantastic hotel. From the moment you arrive everything is taken care of. The staff are very friendly and professional. Could only stay one night in this trip but the next time I am on London I will be staying longer. ,5,2015,12,01
137,Perfection in every detail!,"We stayed here for four nights, as a Thanksgiving getaway.  We were a little self-conscious, not being super 'fancy' people, but we were treated incredibly well by every member of the staff we encountered, and truly had an amazing trip.  The room was amazingly comfortable, the service was incredible, and we loved having cocktails and taking advantage of the 'plunder the pantry' spread in the evening.  I definitely hope to return!",5,2015,11,30
137,Pleasure before business,Can't say enough about this hotel!  They are spot on with everything!  All the little details - from the welcome at the door with hot cocoa to the hot bag of water to keep the bed warm under the sheets at turn down!  Impeccable!  The staff were all super friendly and very helpful!  ,5,2015,11,30
137,Interaction with staff via email GREAT!,"I just wanted to let the Trip Advisor community know about my experience with these guys...My family had scheduled a trip to london as we visit England about 4-8 times a year to ""get away"" and when the Paris terror attacks took place I told my wife to reach out to our reservations to postpone because of the crazy travel situation that was just so fresh. Hotel 41 staff where amazing and took care of canceling the reservation right away with perfect understanding...When we head back to London soon, I will definitely be staying with Hotel 41 for a change. Thanks for seeing the big picture Marlen Wunschel and taking care of your guests! ~Steven",5,2015,11,30
137,Exceptional in every way,"Beyond the beauty of the hotel and the tremendous care taken in every small detail, it was really the stunning service that set our experience here apart. Without ever being intrusive, they worked to take care of us in every way possible, offering helpful tips, hints (and drinks!) -- and always welcoming us back by name at the end of the day. Given the small number of rooms, they can truly focus on every guest and his/her needs; honestly the service was superior to anything I'd experienced. And the ""snacks and drinks anytime"" policy is of course terrific. I can't recommend staying at 41 highly enough!",5,2015,11,27
137,Fantastic Anniversary Visit!,"My wife and I have just enjoyed a wonderful two days at Hotel 41 celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary .It is truly a magical place to stay and ranks with any 5 star hotel in the world and we have stayed in a few ! The staff led so ably by Manager Malcolm Hendry ensure you are cosseted from the moment you arrive to the moment you reluctantly leave. Everything is first class but it is the personal touches that makes this boutique hotel so special . As it was our anniversary the staff in the evening had spread red rose petals around our room , lit candles and the fire, provided a complimentary cake and put on romantic music - what a welcome on our return from the theatre.So a huge thank you to everyone at Hotel 41 for making our special occasion so memorable",5,2015,11,27
137,A 10 STAR Hotel!,"We stayed at the Hotel 41 for six nights. It was the most wonderful six nights in a hotel that we've ever stayed in. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were taken care of with the upmost care, professionalism and comfort. The executive lounge which is open 24 hours a day has delicious food, comfortable seating and the most attentive staff we have ever seen at a hotel. The location is terrific - just a few minutes away from Buckingham Palace! We cannot WAIT to return to London and this magnificent gem!",5,2015,11,25
137,didn't expect it but wow,"I have loved the place from the the very first moment till we left the place , price paid well deserved 

to be honest i didn't expect  to have such a pleasing experience, keep up the good job you do guys,",5,2015,11,24
137,Excellent Hotel,This was our first stay at this boutique hotel but it will not be our last. The standard of accommodation is very good. All of the staff were very attentive and welcoming without being intrusive. The whole experience from a glass of champagne on arrival through to afternoon tea and then a farewell tea + biscuits was excellent. We have no hesitation in recommending this small boutique hotel.,5,2015,11,24
137,This hotel is better than excellent it's outstanding in every way,"We stayed here to celebrate my partners birthday and we where so happy we did, the customer service at this hotel is outstanding from the second you walk through the door until the second you leave, we sat down at reception and received complimentary champagne which there are four to choose from they explain how everything works and tell you all about the pantry where food is available at different times of the day and night, we where then shown to our room which was an executive king room although in most hotels it would have been classed as a suite as it had a separate seating area with tv phone bose docking station and fridge and mini bar and then down a short corridor there was the sleeping area and bathroom with king size bed another tv with sky and there was also a dvd player.

The bathroom had a bath with shower over and also a separate shower which was great 

The evening turndown service was beautiful with scenter candles and red rose petals on the bed and in the bathroom.

Breakfast was included in our booking and served in the executive lounge buy a butler and two servers and the breakfast menu is amazing 

We had to call Down to reception a few times to arrange things and every time nothing was to much trouble 

My partner even managed to break  her hair clip and we phoned down to ask if they had one we could borrow....15 mins later a knock on the door and a brand new packaged hair clip was presented with a smile, oh I forgot to mention the bottle of champagne that was in the room when we got there that matched the one we had chosen at reception and also complimentary drinks from our hotel when we went out for dinner at the rubens hotels which is underneath hotel 41

Mr Hendry I cannot praise your team highly enough you could teach other hotels a thing or two, a massive thank you to you and your team ",5,2015,11,23
137,Ruby Wedding Anniversary Celebration,Celebrating our 40th Wedding Anniversary we stayed at Hotel 41 for a weekend from13th - 16th November.  We were very spoilt.    Staff were very helpful and attentive. We felt very comfortable so much so that we have booked to stay again.,5,2015,11,22
137,Taking care of clients,"I have stayed at Hotel 41 often on my visits to London and here are two more reasons why.  1. After a cancelled connector flight to catch a day flight to London I was switched to the next available which was 10 hours later and meant a very early arrival into that city. I e-mailed Hotel 41(after trying unsuccessfully online myself to arrange for a car downtown ) and they had a car and driver waiting for me on arrival at Heathrow.  How pleasant after a long delay and o/n flying.   2.  I arrived at the hotel at 8:30 am and they had my room ready to go despite the fact they were totally booked the night before. Heaven!    As always the service, the ambiance, the food and the attention to detail was at their usual five star standard. I love Hotel 41. If you are looking for a London club-like atmosphere and don't mind sleeping just down the street from the Queen, then this is the hotel for you.",5,2015,11,19
137,Great hotel!,"I was staying in executive king room for 2 nights. It was a wonderful experience! The hotel was well located just right behind the Buckingham palace and just 7 mins walk from Victoria station. Overall ambience was great, very unique. The room size was acceptable, the decoration was unique, the bathroom facilities was great. I love the mattress and bed linen here, very comfortable. However, my friend 
thought that the bed was too soft and she had back pain after our stay but i were totally fine. I also appreciate the hospitality from all the staffs.Everyone were very friendly and helpful. On our last day, we requested late check-out until 16:30. The hotel was very generous in giving us a courtesy room so, we could refresh and took a shower before our long flight back home. So, Thank you very much.

Just a comment on the food. In my opinion, the food variety and taste were average. I actually expected more food varieties from seeing the photos on the website. But overall, i did have a great time here. Thank you for such a wonderful experience.

",5,2015,11,19
137,Luxury boutique but pricey,"My husband and took a belated anniversary trip to London for a week last month and we wanted to live it up, so we booked an executive king room at Hotel 41 as part of an American Airlines vacation package. 

The cab from Heathrow airport nearly missed the hotel because it's on a busy street with no place to legally pull over and unload. Entering the hotel is like walking into a private home—dark wood paneling, black and white checkered floor, snack and light beverages, candy canes—and the staff is extremely attentive. While the foyer is on the ground floor, the rooms and Executive Lounge are all on the 5th floor. To check in you go up to the Executive Lounge, a gorgeous atrium library that is the ""heart"" of the hotel and where you can have breakfast, snacks, drinks, or just sit and read or watch TV. Since our hotel room was quite small by American standards, it was nice to be able to retreat to the Executive Lounge when we wanted more room and a change of scenery.

The hotel is located two blocks from Victoria Station and two blocks from Buckingham Palace. It was quite convenient and we walked everywhere the entire week. We only took the Tube once, but we walked to and from the Barbican Theatre, Kensington Palace, Hyde Park, Trafalgar Square, Picadilly, Harrods department store, Parliament, etc. London is a fabulous walking city and you really get a sense of the place from walking instead of taking cabs and buses.

My only real complaint about the hotel, which was accommodating in every way, was the way ""plunder the pantry"" worked. Plunder the pantry is the hotel's unique offering of free snacks and food throughout the day. There is always an assortment of beautifully wrapped nuts and candies, and bagged crisps (chips) that you can take with you, and at night they put out a spread of what is basically light dinner fare. All of the ""pantry"" food is included in the price of your room. You can ""plunder"" the pantry as much as you like, all day, every day.  It sounds perfectly wonderful, but in actuality it's not that useful. Maybe we just don't eat that much, but their light dinner offering was often a strange assortment of cold meats and fish, terrines, and warmed little bowls of food that had been left out too long. It was not appetizing at all. 

Yet, while the plunder the pantry food is all free, the only beverage included for free is still water. There is a little fridge in the lounge that has soft drinks, Fever Tree sparkling juices, and sparkling water, all of which are charged to your room if you take one. When I wanted a glass of orange juice, they were happy to serve me one, but it cost £4 (about $6). Maybe I'm in the minority but I was really irritated that a luxury hotel of this caliber serves unlimited ""pantry"" food, nuts, snacks, and candies (and even has a little cart of  luxury soaps free for your taking) but charges for non-alcoholic drinks. It is a stingy practice. Who wants free cold duck when I'm being charged $6 for an orange juice? Additionally, the prices for alcoholic drinks were  criminal. A small cosmopolitan cost £17, which at the time was $26. For one.

Aside from the food/bar issue, we really did enjoy the hotel. It's a very small boutique hotel, with 40 rooms total (all on the 5th floor). The staff is extremely attentive (almost too much so at times, but they are all so nice), and make sure you have everything you need and want (even if it costs you money). 

Would I stay at Hotel 41 again? Probably not. As lovely as it was, I'm not sure it was worth what we spent.",4,2015,11,19
137,"Live like a Queen!! (And King, too!)","Stayed three nights here. Literally next-door to Buckingham palace. Five minute walk to Victoria station.  I wasn't due to check in until 16 November, but I was caught in Paris during the bombing on November 13. I decided to change my plans and had to London a day early and they were happy to accommodate me.  They want her gracious and helpful. I was traveling with a fractured foot, and they helped me out getting around.

The accommodations were luxurious and relaxing. Exactly what I would expect from a five star hotel. The service was impeccable, and the food was delicious. They had a complementary evening snack bar,which was complimentary. 

Definitely a great way to treat yourself when you're in London",5,2015,11,19
137,Lovely place,"This was my second stay here, this time with my mum as she was celebrating her birthday, it's in a great location 5 minutes walk from Victoria so it's really easy to get anywhere. The room we had was a duplex which had a lovely sitting area with a TV and comfy sofa downstairs and the bedroom upstairs, there was plenty of space in the bedroom, with a large wardrobe and a bathroom with a separate shower cubicle as well as a bath. There was an enormous bowl of fruit in our room when we arrived plus a birthday cake for my mum which was yummy, you also get a glass of champagne as you are checking in which is a nice touch.
My favourite thing about the 41 is their ""raid the pantry"" service which they have in the evening, we had spent a long day on Friday at the good food show so didn't want to go out and eat a big meal, we had cheese, biscuits, deli meats and seafood from the selection available plus some very tasty desserts and it's all included in the price of the room. 
The staff are lovely and all extremely helpful and the breakfasts very good (although the service was a little slow)
I will be back.",5,2015,11,17
137,As Advertised,"They have an extension on the room phone labeled ""Whatever Whenever"". This in essence describes the level of service at Hotel 41 London. The entire staff was truly exceptional. If you want to be treated the way everyone should always treat each other, then this is the hotel for you.",5,2015,11,16
137,Brilliant Service exceeded expectations.,"The Hotel 41 is a decadent property minutes away from Buckingham Palace, Harrods, pubs and restaurants.The accommodations and surroundings are as expected for a hotel at this address, but the staff and management are superb. The service was outstanding,attention to detail;impressive and the custom made treats and snacks; delicious. Steve Jones, in particular, was brilliant.
We followed his schedule to ensure the stay of all 8 of us was perfect. He suggested shops, places to eat, shared in the laughs but truly never lost sight of the service level expected. We will return because he was the difference. The Hotel 41 exceeded expectations.",5,2015,11,16
137,Brilliant,"Couldn't have been better, would recommend to anyone who wants to have a great time.

Staff was really friendly, food great, cocktails are great and I love the fact the you have access to the executive lounge. Overall would defiantly come back again",5,2015,11,15
137,truly superb,"Given all the excellent reviews, expectations were high and yes, 41 and the team delivered. Even before we arrived we got help in making some difficult to get dinner reservations, once we were there we were taken care off so well we did not want to leave. Location great, lounge so welcoming and comfy, coming home to the logfire and rose petals in the room was almost too much :-) and we loved plunder the pantry for an inbetween snack. Overall truly superb!",5,2015,11,15
137,"Wonderful, wouldn't stay anywhere else in London","Second time back at Hotel 41 and won't be our last. The rooms are beautiful but it's the staff who make this hotel so unique with their warmth and charm. They really can't do enough for their guests, highlighted perfectly by the "" whatever, whenever"" button in the rooms! Amazing!",5,2015,11,15
137,The most amazing hotel in the UK,"One of the best hotels you will ever stay in central London

Not only the best in London but probably the best you will ever stay in FACT

Staff were awesome, food next level... And I cannot stress just how fabulous this hotel is...

From an exquisite interior and lounge area to Buffett food options...

Hotels suites are about average for London at £500 a night but room service at 2am for a chap that wanted a burger and chips after a night out on the town...

Could not be more accommodating and a rare find in central londom",5,2015,11,14
137,Lived up to expectations,We spent 4 nights at Hotel 41 to celebrate my 50th birthday. Firstly the location is perfect - a few minutes to walk to Buckingham Palace (we wandered along and saw the changing of the guard by accident!) and a 20 minute walk to Piccadilly Circus.  The staff was fantastic - friendly and helpful.  The room although not big was so comfortable and the best equipped room I have ever stayed in - if you needed it the chances are it was there!  The executive lounge was where everything happened!  The breakfasts were lovely although we stuck with the continental 2 of the 4 days as there was a great choice and we took full advantage of the 'plunder the pantry' one evening - we had eaten in a Michelin star restaurant the evening before and my other half actually thought the hotel food was better!  Our only regret was that we packed so much into our 4 days that we didn't have the chance to spend more time chilling out in the hotel.  But we know to do that for our next visit - hopefully sometime soon.,5,2015,11,14
137,Perfect for families!!,"First, i should say that i traveled with my wife and our one year old toddler (sofia).

We have been to all kind of luxury hotels (al maha, conrad maldives, etc) and this is one is one of those. You can say, that it's different, i agree, but still a luxury resort.

Even though you do not have amenities such as pool, spa, etc, their first amenity is their hospitality, second their attention to details and third their service. 

It was our anniversary, and they not only provided a cake but they also decorated our room with candles and rose petals.

Service. Whenever we wanted a reservation we contacted front desk and they did all reservations for us. That's a big plus. Whatever we needed for our baby they provided in matter of seconds. 

Room: its a big size room, with an extremely comfortable king size bed. Every day they provide sweets and other amenities to your room. 

Breakfast/snacks: during the day they have 24/7 display full of cheese, hams, bread, etc. breakfast was delightful. I do not agree with other reviews that said that their breakfast is limited, we even ate egg benedicts and full english breakfast, among others. They also provide carry out lunch box. If they do not have something they go their extra mile to buy or find it.

Baby: before arriving to the hotel, they contacted us and informed us all the amenities they had for our baby (microwave, monitors, baby bath and toys, shampoo, plate, spoons, snatizer sterilizer, among others). Those products were new. All their staff provided particular attention to my daughter.

At last, i read on previous reviews that they have five steps on their lobby and that makes difficult moving around with a buggy. Certainly those steps exist, but there is always a bell man ready to help you pull those few steps.

Service; all their employees treat you as family and their always, but always, are willing to assist you. A frind of ours visited us at the hotel and they provided (free) with coffee and other treats and treat them as family.

Should you go with a family to london then this is the hotel you should book. Even though it is expensive they worth every penny.",5,2015,11,14
137,Wonderful and unforgettable stay at Hotel 41,"This was our second time at the 41, as we decided to celebrate my 40th birthday there. The staff is really excellent, attentive. They reached out to us days before our arrival to ensure everything is prepared for our arrival. I think its those little details that make a hotel stand out from the rest - they truly make you feel home. The room was beautifully decorated, rose petals, pralines, candles - it was a truly memorable birthday. We stayed for three nights this time, the only regret I have is that we were not able to stay longer, it was hard to leave. I definitely want to come back to the 41 on my 41st birthday.",5,2015,11,12
137,Superb hotel with excellent service,We stayed at Hotel 41 during our honeymoon. We loved our room and the friendly staff. Excellent location and a wonderful experience overall. Complimentary snacks and coffee were nice perks. Very glad that we extended our stay at the hotel.,5,2015,11,10
137,Home from Home,"In November we had the pleasure of returning to Hotel 41 for our sixth visit. This incredible boutique hotel has never let us down. It's uniqueness and classy elegance is obvious from when you pull up to the main entrance. Such a hidden treasure within the bustle of London. From our first visit we have been made to feel that we are truly members of the Hotel 41 family. The black and white decor within the corridors and rooms leaves me feeling as if Alice in Wonderland has tumbled along those walls; that the White Rabbit might run past you on the way to afternoon tea! Followed by the nostalgia of an era long past as soon as you walk into the welcoming heart of the hotel. An eccletic mix of reception, lounge, bar and dining. The panelled walls and fireplace immediately pull you into the calm and peace of a private library, whilst a glass of champagne is served upon checking in. The luxury starts from the moment you arrive. This hotel has to be experienced to be believed. Like any hotel though it is only as good as its staff. There isn't enough that they can do for you. Their smiling and welcoming faces are a sight for sore eyes when you arrive after a long flight. Each and everyone of them is personable, polite, knowledgeable and above all truly nice people who are happy to look after your every need, almost before you know it yourself. I simply cannot recommend this award winning hotel enough, you must experience it for yourself.",5,2015,11,09
137,The AMAZING Hotel 41 lived up to it's reputation as London's Number 1 Hotel,"A Hotel that provides 24 hours complimentary water, snacks and ice-cream, allowing checkout at 12 AND offering breakfast until 13h00 is a winner in my books!!! When most hotels charge for EVERYTHING, Hotel 41 is a pleasant surprise. There are 28 rooms all on the same floor, including the reception and lounge/restaurant.....in a nutshell the entire hotel is on the 5th floor (split over 2 levels). Everything from the beds to the rooms, to the decor, to the staff to the service was exceptional.  We will definitely be returning! Looking forward to my next visit!",5,2015,11,08
137,Excellent staff,"Staid here for two nights and one thing that can be said is that this place makes you feel at home! the location is perfect, rooms and facilities are charming though small and there's some good food. Most importantly though, the staff achieves almost perfectly this subtle balance between helpful without being intrusive.",5,2015,11,07
137,Great choice,"It's a lovely, charming boutique hotel located in a heart of London. 5 star hotel that is not pretentious. All is perfectly chosen, decoration is flawless. I think that the strongest point is its staff. Discrete, excellent manners and helpful. Recommend for a romantic getaway in London! ",5,2015,11,07
137,Perfect 60th Anniversary Experience,"I chose Hotel 41 based on the positive and the few negative reviews on TripAdvisor to celebrate my parent's 60th wedding anniversary; the hotel and staff exceeded expectations in every aspect during our six day stay.  I agree with most of the commentary supporting the 5 ""dot"" reviews and will add the photos of the lounge do not capture the beauty of the facility.  

From entering the building, I was welcomed as Mr. Robsster and our entire party was treated as royalty throughout our stay.

I will say that the lounge is arranged for couples, however, the staff makes it all works. The staff effortlessly accommodated our party of four and the challenges active 84 year olds experience that us younger folk do not. 

Our package included breakfast, an afternoon tea and a three course dinner at the b-bar restaurant.   

The printed menu at the b-bar does not do the South African themed restaurant justice, as I was expecting a hamburger restaurant that has steaks based on the menu and neon in the window.  We encountered a staff that was very proud of the the food and drink they provide and their service was top notch. Try the Bobotie spring rolls as they were perfectly seasoned...and the steaks were prepared just as ordered. A couple of bottles of South African wine and some of Mrs. Tollman's cheesecake wrapped a near perfect meal. 

Breakfast and evening snacks served in the Executive Lounge were wonderful.   About four in the afternoon, our family began to eagerly anticipate the evening canapés that were elegantly served.  Plunder the pantry was appreciated after our nights out on the town. 

We took our Afternoon Tea at the adjacent Reuben's. The finger sandwiches and sweets were superior to the Ritz where we sipped tea three days prior.  

The service and the feeling of being a guest at Hotel 41 is something special. At the Reuben's and b-bar, guests of 41 were given the extra special treatment, similar to when Mr. Robsster enters the business class lounge and upon inspection of credentials, is escorted to the first class lounge. 

I applaud the attention to detail and the individual approach taken with each guest. The staff appears to balance the level of attention based on the desires of the individuals, as some appreciate a great deal of conversation with the hotel hosts while others appreciated downtime with their special someone in a classy and intimate setting.  I appreciated the warm, sophisticated environment like that of a private club without the pompous attitude often experienced in such places. It is refreshing to experience the consistent and customized service of Hotel 41.   

Hotel 41 is an elegant, luxurious boutique hotel.  We spent six days and want to return!

",5,2015,11,05
137,Unique and Cozy Hotel - Fantastic Service and Character,"We spent two nights here to celebrate our anniversary.  The hotel itself is entirely on the 5th floor surrounding a very comfortable executive lounge.  The hotel is small (I believe around 30 rooms). The staff is attentive but not pushy.

Our anniversary was acknowledged by the person who checked us in when we arrived as well as in a card in our room which was nice. We were welcomed with a glass of champagne and there was a lovely fruit bowl in the room.  The room was attractively furnished and also remarkably comfortable.  Not only the bed but the sofa, chairs, slippers and robe were exceptionally cozy.  I have never had such thick hotel slippers! 

There is free wifi available in the rooms and executive lounge.

One of the most unique and enjoyable features was the complimentary snack bar which had ice cream, pop-corn, etc available in the evenings.  Really lovely if you want to get some snacks and watch a movie in your room.

Breakfast was delicious and worth staying in the hotel all on its own. Gluten free options are available. 

The location is central and convenient to attractions such as the Royal Mews and Buckingham Palace as well as restaurants in Belgravia. 

Bottom line - Hotel 41 is a fantastic place to stay when in London. Beautiful, cozy, comfortable and relaxing.  Absolutely recommend and we will be back!",5,2015,11,04
137,Looking forward to returning again...,"Always a pleasure to return to 41.  Whenever we return we are greeted like returning friends.  Although on a busy road the discreet entrance hides an array of stunning rooms and guest areas, wonderful service and a pantry available to plunder until contented.  On our last visit (to celebrate a new job and birthday) we were lucky enough to be able to have an upgrade, and what a suite it was.  The attention to detail they paid us was stunning and appreciated (and was liked by our numerous Friends on Facebook).  The only bad part was having to leave but this was made easier by knowing we will return, and we will.",5,2015,11,04
137,Courteous Staff,"They look after you. We had a couple of minor issues but the way they were dealt with was excellent. A very personal service. The lounge was very good with a permanent buffet, drinks were perfectly served.",5,2015,11,03
137,Wow Wow Wow,We stayed here on Friday October 30th after finishing a 2 week cruise and this was the highlight of our trip.  What a Beautiful hotel and they sure know how to treat there guest.  From the time you check in to you check out everything you could possibly need will be taken care of.  We also loved the 41 hotel because of its proximity to Buckingham Palace.  When we come back to London from Virginia we will definitely stay here.,5,2015,11,01
137,very special hotel even for teenagers,"I was staying at 41 for 3 nights with my 2 teenagers sons. I was al little bit doubtful...
But they already miss the hotel. We stayed at several luxury hotels, but this one they liked most: because of the size, because of the atmosphere, the personal attention...
The room size was oke for us, room decor very nice, the view depressingly... Unfortunately during early morning and late night we were disturbed.... by the ""talking floors"".....our room lay next to the reception, toilet and an emergency exit.... 
But.. we hope to come back soon!",5,2015,11,01
137,How is this #1??,"At time of booking this hotel was number 1 on TA.
Foolishly I thought we were in for the treat of a lifetime.
Sadly, while this place is very pleasant, in a superb location and very lovely there are many London hotels which would knock it hands down.
Staff looked after us very well if in s slightly cloying way. Main problems were the very noisy plumbing and a mysterious red light which prevented housekeeping from servicing the room. (To be fair though they had dropped in a note to ask us to call for service but we returned too late).
All in all a good, albeit a little dated, hotel in a very prestigious neighbourhood!",3,2015,11,01
137,Big birthday stay,"We stayed here overnight on Sunday 25/10/15 and everything I had read was totally true!! I booked it as a surprise for my husband's birthday (along with dinner at Heston's a short walk away - also fantastic!) after reading the fab reviews about its quirky atmosphere, amazing staff and great location. I was not disappointed with any aspect. The booking process was easy, check in was luxurious and a lovely change from the impersonal check ins at other hotels. We enjoyed a lovely glass of champagne then, as the room wasn't ready, which I had been told I advance and was not a problem, e left our overnight bag to enjoy the rest if the day in London. 
On returning to the hotel the staff were again wonderfully smiley and attentive, we went to our room - complete with gorgeous treats and a decorated cake - thank you! 
Plunder the pantry, room comfort and the overall experience was amazingly luxurious. Everything was what I had hoped it would be and more. A massive thank you to all the staff who really make this hotel. We will definitely be back again.",5,2015,10,30
137,50th Birthday Trip,"My wife had done extensive research on where to stay for my 50th birthday visit and I am pleased to say that she could not have picked a better hotel in the whole of London to spend our 3 days celebrating my 50th birthday earlier this week.

Where to start? Firstly the welcome is unbelievable. You are whisked from a very discrete lobby, via the lift up to the fifth floor where all the rooms are, to the exceutive lounge to check in. You are handed a glass of champagne immediately to help you relax and start to enjoy the stay. The staff made you feel so welcome and at ease - I will return to the staff later, although to call them that does all of them an injustice as they felt like friends!

Our room was stunning and so tasteful. There would be nothing I would change. The food was stunning - from breakfast, brunch, lunch, canapés and nibbles that were constantly and freely available, they were all of the highest quality and standard.

The location was perfect, not far from Victoria Station and just round the corner from Buckingham Palace. A short 15 minute walk and you were in Oxford Street ready to shop! 

But most of all it was the staff that made our stay so memorable. Everyone showed a genuine interest in ourselves and made us feel totally at home, relaxed, at ease and so special. This is not easily done and you could see the genuine pleasure in their faces knowing we had enjoyed everything that had been arranged for us. I need to thank everyone that follows (and all those I have not mentioned in front of house and behind the scenes) - Mitchell, Andrew, Marlen, Dickson, Steve, Jess, Lauren, Adele and Malcom as they all made our stay so special and memorable !  

We will be back and can't wait until we stay at the Fabulous Hotel 41 again!",5,2015,10,30
137,Perfect,"My partner and I stayed here for one night to celebrate our 5th anniversary. It was simply wonderful. 

When we arrived we were greeted with champagne and then shown around before being taken to our beautiful room. There was a yummy chocolate cake waiting for us which said 'happy anniversary' aswell as a plate of little treats. 

The room was comfy and so nicely decorated. It was a bit warm for us in the room even with the air conditioning on, but we are from the north so it was like our summer in London! 

We shared a bottle of wine in the executive lounge and were presented with canapés which were really tasty. After going out for a few cocktails, we went to 'plunder the pantry' which was perfect! We went away with 3 platefuls of food and felt a bit greedy, but the friendly chap said its open until 1am so we can come back for more! 

We had the romantic turndown which was so special. Candles, chocolate strawberries, rose petals, the lot. 

For breakfast, I had the smoked salmon and cream cheese bagel and my partner had the full English. We both loved it and went away full! The hot chocolate was amazing. 

All the staff were wonderful and I can't fault our stay at all. We will be back :)",5,2015,10,29
137,An amazing night away!,"I stayed here with my girlfriend for one night last Thursday and we were both bowled over by the Hotel. On arrival we  were escorted to the fifth floor where the reception is and Florent was very helpful and charming providing us with a glass of champagne after our travels. Check in was quick and we got a tour of the Executive Lounge which was very impressive and definitely felt 'exclusive'.
The Hotel itself is small but beautifully appointed with gorgeous rooms and you rarely run in to other guests giving you more of an 'isolated' feeling, perfect for us.
I proposed to my girlfriend that evening and she said yes and it certainly helped that the hotel turndown service was so impressive with champagne and candles, chocolates, music etc.
The honesty bar is very nice too, food is available pretty much all day and varies from scones to desserts and breads and meats. Breakfast is super, I would heartily recommend the 'Bad Boy' Breakfast butty. Special shout out to Dickson who served us with impeccable charm and manners.
The Hotel is not far, perhaps a 5 minute walk from Victoria station, not hard to find but be careful to to go in to the Rubens Hotel like I did, the door for Hotel 41 is small and you could almost walk by it.
We will definitely be back again sometime.",5,2015,10,28
137,A jolly olde week,"We returned 2 weeks ago from a lovely 7 night  stay at the 41 Hotel. The 41 was even better than we had expected  even after all  the glowing reviews we'd read about it. The location was perfect between Buckingham  Palace and Victoria Station.We were minutes from the Underground, but could also walk to many of the major attractions. Our duplex suite was roomy and finely furnished. All the food :  ""raid the pantry"", breakfasts, afternoon snacks including daily treats in the lobby ,wine and cocktails served in the lounge were delicious and signature touches that set this hotel apart., but the real strength of this hotel is their staff. There was no one who didn't seem to enjoy their position or who wasn't knowledgeable, personable and professional. They all worked to make our stay as pleasurable as possible, and they succeeded. We loved interacting and kibitzing with them on a daily basis. Their tips about the area were smart and helpful. So thank you to  Bastien, Magdalena, Florent, Dickson, Roberta, Marlen, Maria, Gina, Patricia and all the others who made our stay extra special. We would stay nowhere else in London.",5,2015,10,28
137,A wonderful experience and service that is second to none,"We stayed at this hotel for one night recently to celebrate a big birthday. Like a lot of people, we have been fortunate enough to stay in luxury hotels around the world and I can honestly say that the service here rivals anything experienced elsewhere. It feels a bit of a cliché to repeat the accolades given by other reviewers, but they are completely merited. 

The surroundings are beautiful and very relaxing. The staff are attentive, without being fawning or over-the-top, and seem genuinely to be enjoying themselves. Staff who come in for a special mention are Andrew, Steve and Dickson (A true gentleman. ""Tea in the morning, champagne in the evening"" was his motto for our stay, a man after my own heart!), although everyone we met went the extra mile, including one man who bent over backwards trying to get the perfect photo of us at 1am!

Like other reviewers, I'm a bit concerned that this stay has meant that I can't tolerate staying anywhere else in London now and I've definitely got the post holiday-blues after just one night, but I guess it's a price worth paying!!

A great choice if you are after relaxation and pampering. Bring your appetite for plunder the pantry at midnight. ",5,2015,10,26
137,Terrific!,"We loved this hotel. Quirky, charming and so comfortable.  The entire staff was so professional, upbeat and couldn't do enough for us.  We were also with two other couples and they even gave us our own private room for breakfast each morning. So many little touches and extras were included..  breakfast, tea and mini sandwiches, amazing hot chocolate waiting at the door, candies & ice cream at night, mood sprays at turndown.  It's rare to find this kind of hospitality. Stay here!",5,2015,10,25
137,Perfection ,"I was in town for 24 hours and this property is perfection.  It starts with a champagne greeting at check-in, yummy snacks, truffles in the room and lush linens and pillows for a restful evening.  Really a lovely experience and I think we'll stay longer next time.",5,2015,10,25
137,Best place to stay ,"Came here for my birthday, me and my friends stayed for 2 nights and it was perfect! The staff where so helpful and lovely! Also the food was amazing! We had no problems here and we will definitely come back when we are next in London, the room sizes where nicely sized too. ",5,2015,10,25
137,Absolutely phenomenal.  We had a few minor issues which were promptly addressed.,"Location:
Fairly central from as little as I know of London and only a 5 minute walk to the Victoria underground and train stations.  The choice of restaurants seemed to be OK.

Accommodations:
The building is certainly old but the rooms are very spacious (stayed in an Executive King).  The beds were very comfortable.  The bathroom was a decent size as well.  We had a few problems with our TV not working in the bathroom, however, no big deal.  They were able to fix it  after a couple of days.  Our sink and bathtub were slow to drain.  They were able to fix the sink and offered to swap rooms due to the tub drain, however, we only had one more evening and didn't want to bother.  Other than that the room was great!

Food and drinks:
The executive club was great and the food was very tasty.  Service was fantastic and everyone was very accommodating and attentive.  Evening canapes was also a very nice touch.

Staff:
Last but certainly not least.  Every individual we interacted with was phenomenal.  They gave us a complimentary bottle of wine for our troubles with our bathroom.  They were more than happy to bring some food from the club back to our room if we had a special request.  They were helpful in providing recommendations on local services and restaurants. Magdelena was amazing as well as she helped us out with any issues that we had with our stay and ensured that they were promptly addressed.

We will no doubt stay here again as our first choice when in London if there is availability. ",5,2015,10,23
137,A VERY SPECIAL PLACE TO STAY IN LONDON!,"This is our third stay at Hotel 41 and it has never disappointed us.  We stayed six nights in the end.We love staying here.

137,The finest service I have ever experienced,"I have stayed at Mandarin's, Peninsula's, Four Season's, Ritz, etc. and the attitude and service of the team at Hotel 41 made those other wonderful hotels seem like a Holiday Inn.  The common room, where food and drinks were available all day long made it feel like you were staying in somebody's home.  There were three couples vacationing together and this room and the service offered there made it an incredible experience.",5,2015,10,22

From the minute we stepped through the door to the time we left, we loved every minute. The attention to detail and the impeccable staff made this hotel such a special place. It was so much more than we expected and we will defiantly be back! Steve Jones needs a special mention, such a character and a real credit to the hotel. I could go on and on.....but do not hesitate to book this hotel, it's a real find.",5,2015,10,20

My dad loves the location so not many Saudis stay which is a plus point to my dad lol. Every is great room service is so fast no messing around............,5,2015,10,19
137,Best service I've ever experienced,"Would like to thank all the staff at Hotel 41, for making our visit the most memorable hotel we've stayed in.
The customer service is second to none! Absolutely flawless.

The conservatory room was mind-blowing. A roof that opens above the bed, truly one of a kind!
I gave no instructions, except mentioning that we were celebrating our anniversary - so what the staff created was unbelievable.

Champagne, a fruit basket and a signed cake on arrival.
We left, unannounced, to see a show, and upon returning to our room we discovered that it had been covered in rose-petals, had candles lit, and classical music playing.
It was incredibly romantic and the thought and care that goes into the running of this place is just amazing.
Breakfast was also delicious and well prepared.

I am a huge skeptic of 5-star reviews, but Hotel 41 deserves every accolade that it receives.",5,2015,10,19
137,Truly amazing,"We were lucky enough to be treated to an evening stay at the amazing 41 , The Staff are exceptional in every way and the hotel has truly got to be the best we have ever stayed at, 

The food on offer through out the evening and breakfast were of the highest quality as was the whole experience ,

If you get a chance spoil your self or some one special you would not be disappointed",5,2015,10,19
137,Special stay in a special place,"My wife and I stayed in London one night on the way back to the states. We picked Hotel 41 based on TripAdvisor reviews and were not disappointed. It's hard to tell how special the hotel is based on the website and reviews. It is completely like a club atmosphere and not a hotel. All the rooms are on the same level (5th floor). The common space is an executive lounge that is intimate, comfortable and inviting. All of the staff seem to go out of their way to know your name, attend to your needs and make sure you are more than satisfied with your stay. We found Flo, in particular, to offer exceptional service. Checking in with a glass of fine champagne and enjoying mimosas for breakfast was fabulous. We didn't see any children, but the hotel assured us they love children. If you want a hotel with a big lobby, big restaurant, and lively bar scene, this is not it. If you want to feel spoiled by service in an intimate setting and a great location, we would highly recommend Hotel 41.",5,2015,10,19
137,Great stay,"My wife and I stayed at Hotel 41 in early October, 2015.  It was like staying in a private home with concierge service.  There is a common room which serves breakfast and tea as well as complimentary food throughout the day until 1 a.m.  The staff was very helpful in arranging dinner reservations, obtaining theater tickets, providing directions and information. Also, because the hotel is small  the staff knew who you were and  provided personalized service. The rooms are cozy and comfortable",5,2015,10,14
137,An Amazing Birthday Present!,"I booked a room at Hotel 41 for the night of my birthday on account of the excellent reviews and was not disappointed! From the moment you arrive, to the moment you leave, you feel like you're part of something special. I've stayed in a number of 5 star hotels in London, which don't compare to the experience at Hotel 41. Staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough for you. I enjoyed the champagne on check-in and the canape's on offer. It was enough food that I didn't need to have dinner. I was fortunate enough to receive a complimentary upgrade to a suite which to my surprise contained a lovely birthday cake and desserts! I appreciated having the Nespresso machine, as well as the fabulous toiletries and slippers. I unfortunately missed out on experiencing 'plunder the pantry' as I was out late, but it's something to look forward to during my next visit! If you're wavering about staying here, don't. Treat yourself! You won't regret it!",5,2015,10,12
137,Absolutely perfect,"If you are visiting London for business or pleasure, be sure to stay at this hotel. It offers everything your heart desires: Very nice and courteous staff.

Even in dinner, they switch my main course due to I just said it was different than I though, therefore they gave me one what I expect! Endless memorable details brought to me! I strongly recommend this hotel to those who loved nicely British decoration and pay attention to staffs services. I could say it's most personalized services in my life! More than 5 stars! Hopefully we could be back there very soon! By Mr Yuan and Miss Chen",5,2015,10,09
137,First Class Service,"Hotel 41 is first class in all aspects but particularly the service delivered by each and every staff member we had the pleasure to deal with. We have stayed at a lot of top-end hotels where service is great but this hotel is exceptional. From attentiveness to every detail of your stay, to knowledge of London and things to do, to everything else in between. Nothing was too much trouble.  

Excellent location, close to all the best parts of London. Loved the hotel decor, the quirky artwork especially.

We were sad to leave. Definitely worth paying extra to stay here.",5,2015,10,09
137,Great stay at Hotel 41,"Great location (Victoria Station), great staff, wonderful service. The quality / price ratio is often terrible in London hotels but that's not the case here.

137,Service was spectacular!,"There's nothing the staff could've done to make us feel more welcome.

Thank you everyone!!",5,2015,10,09
137,Perfection on our Honeymoon ,This hotel is even more spectacular then I expected.The accommodations are the best & we have never felt so pampered in our lives. Thank you to ALL of the staff & to the manager that brought me to tears of joy for such hospitality. We will stay here again in our future travels. ,5,2015,10,08
137,Not Possible to Top This Hotel,"Everyone was helpful, the room was a delight, the breakfast excellent, the round the clock buffet marvelous, even the ice cream was different and exotic.  When we went to get in the cab to go to Heathrow, one employee took our luggage and another held an umbrella over our heads!  There are two excellent restaurants on each side of the hotel!!  If you're coming to London, come here!  ",5,2015,10,08
137,"Swans and rose petals, candles on final night!","Hotel 41 is a boutique Hotel on one floor next to (between) Reubens (?) Hotel (4 star?) and a restaurant in Buckingham Palace road. Reception is on ground floor and rooms and the Executive Lounge (meals and snacks) on the fifth Floor. It is 5 star, with very attentive (even flattering) staff. On the final night we impend the room door to find two towel swans snuggling next to the pillows with candles and red rose petals trailing to the bathroom. It is a motif of the owners and their Hotel chain, explained in a leaflet.",5,2015,10,07
137,Great Experience,"From the excellent location to the personalized service, we immensely enjoyed our experience at Hotel 41.  The casual, club like atmosphere with personalized service made us feel like pampered guests.  Dickson was especially a riot! The rooms meet our needs and the bathrooms were very nice. The only hiccup was our final bills for us and our traveling companions were not ready at 4:45 AM when we needed to leave (we had a personalized wake up call and vehicle coming at 4:45 AM to make an early flight out of Heathrow to connect to our cruise ship in Rome) which the hotel was or should have been aware of.  I was able to quickly get my bill taken care of, but the other party was downstairs in the van ready to leave, so they have had to finalize their bill after returning home to the U.S. today (apparently they don't keep the credit cards on file for security purposes, so you have to physically check out when you go so they can run the card again, unusual, just so you know).  Anyway, I would definitely stay there again.  A memorable experience.",5,2015,10,06
137,Outstanding service!!!!,"
After our arrival from an overseas flight at 9.30am we expected to have to store our luggage and wait to check in at the usual 2pm, however the hotel check in staff could not have been more accommodating, our room was ready within 30 minutes. During which we could enjoy breakfast in the executive club lounge if we so wished.
Our room was extremely comfortable, immaculately clean and tidy. Slightly above average  size and everything needed was to hand.
This really was like a home from home with an added bonus of the staff exceeding every expectation, nothing was too much trouble. 
Great location too!!!
Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,10,04
137,"Perfection, Luxury and Perfect","We stayed here for 2 nights in April. The hotel was amazing such luxury and they even do a turn down service in the evening, breakfast and evening meal was gorgeous. Perfect location and staff are more than helpful.",5,2015,10,04
137,Like A Private Club,"Perfectly located, adjacent to Buckingham Palace, the Hotel 41 feels more like an exclusive private club rather than a hotel. The staff, dressed in formal attire, may at first glance appear stiff and stuffy but in reality are very nice, accommodating, and most anxious to make your stay wonderful. Upon check- in, we were immediately invited to a complimentary afternoon tea in the hotels's ""library"". The library was just as you would expect. An imposing mahogany room with a central fireplace, oil paintings and tapestries. Small tables were carefully set with English china. A cornucopia of tea-sandwiches were offerred to us by an attentive white-gloved staff member. The rooms are all smartly decorated in a handsome black and white motif. The sheets and comforters were soft and luxurious and the thick white over-sized towels were plentiful. We loved the way the hotel is run. The housekeepers were quiet and discreet and the Concierge had excellent dinner suggetions for us. When we left, we met the hortel's Manager, Malcolm Hendry who obviously works very hard to make sure every guest's stay is perfect. Our stay certainly was!",5,2015,10,03
137,The Best Hotel,"My wife and I stayed at the ""41"" from 14 September to 20 September. We have done a lot of traveling and have stayed at some great hotels but the ""41"" has to rank as the best hotel we have ever stayed. You will read many reviews on Trip Advisor that say the same thing.The photos that you see on the hotel website do not do the place justice. It is absolutely beautiful. There are only 28 rooms and they are all located on the fifth floor of the building which also occupied by a sister hotel ""The Ruebens"". The location is right across the street from The Mews of Buckingham Place. We walked to the Palace, Parliament, the Horse Guard, the Churchill War Rooms, #10 Downing Street, and some nice local pubs and beautiful parks. Upon arrival, after an overnight flight, we were given a room to nap in and freshen up while our room was being prepared. The rooms are fairly large for Europe and are quite luxurious. Our king room, 4114, was quiet. The bed was very comfortable. All of the appointments were first class. The lighting was elegant and gave you many options for creating the environment you would want. The room included a beautiful fireplace and sitting area. The bath is large, towels (heated) are fluffy and changed twice a day. Breakfast, afternoon tea, and evening snacks are served in the Executive Lounge which also serves as the main desk/concierge area. The Lounge is an exceptional space, beautifully decorated, elegant, quiet and peaceful. The service for breakfast is not to be missed. Our server, Dickson, was a wonderful young man who warmly addressed us by name each morning. His attention to detail, friendliness, and level of service was outstanding. He also provided us with many suggestions for sightseeing and restaurants. The food was terrific especially the waffles and omelets. There are also many fruits, cereals, meats, fish, and pastry's to choose from. Stop in the Lounge for a drink or ""raid the pantry"" later in the evening for more treats (excellent gelato) and great service. The concierge service the hotel provided was excellent. Making reservations for dinner, providing directions, of securing a taxis were all handled with warmth and efficiency.  I would whole hardheartedly recommend this outstanding hotel and its wonderful staff. I look forward to staying at other hotels in the Red Carnation chain in future trlps.",5,2015,10,01
137,Prepare to be spoiled.,"We stayed for 4 days and never tired of the attentive service. The rooms are well appointed, if quirky in layout. [Each suite has 2 floors]. As we understand it, the ballroom floor of the adjacent Rubens Hotel was renovated by the Red Carnation Group to create a boutique executive hotel. From check-in to executive lounge, no thoughtful touch was overlooked.

The linens and furnishings are of the highest quality. Cleanliness was A++. Service in the 24 hour Executive lounge was impeccable, with excellent breakfasts as well as hors d'oeuvres. 

41 surpasses any experience we have had in a hotel. University Hotel and Hospitality programs should require an internship here.",5,2015,10,01
137,Perfect London Hotel,"I cannot say enough good things about this hotel, which was one of the highlights of our visit to London.  That is saying quite a bit as we just came from a suite at a luxury hotel in Paris the day before.  Not only is the service responsive, thorough and professional, it is also friendly and personalized.  From the moment we walked in we felt welcomed and at home.  From there, the wonderful staff remembered us by name, what champagne we preferred, what room we were in and how we liked things at breakfast, just by recognition.  The big things are easy for a quality hotel to get right, but it was the little touches that blew us away. 
Our room was quite large by European standards.  It had a fireplace, what looked to be original artwork and was dripping in marble and wood...Not to mention, the best shower I have ever used.  If you can afford it, you will not be disappointed in Hotel 41.",5,2015,09,29
137,are you looking for something special?,"Look no further.
41 will surprise you, every step of your stay. That starts at the intriguing entrance of this hidden gem. It continues on check-in, or should I call it royal reception, and of course includes your room. But most of all it is the overwhelming hospitality you will encounter. Should you then be as lucky as I was and be served by Dickson, then you will truly experience what it means to feel at home away from home.",5,2015,09,28
137,This is way beyond 5 stars!!!!,"OMG! Hands down the best lodging experience by far! I don't think I can be satisfied by another hotel ever again. Just stay here for a night and you will know. From the second you step in to the hotel from every interaction with their staff to everything you see, feel, taste, smell and experience is planned perfectly town to a tee. Boy do they have housekeeping down as an art. The food, snacks and tea there are also amazing! We tried all sorts of highly rated restaurants in London but at the end we felt nothing beats our own hotel's complementary offerings! You really feel like you are royalty, it is worth every penny.",5,2015,09,27
137,ABSOLUTELY OUSTANDING!!!!,"Oh my where do I start!  We spent our wedding night here and got upgraded to the most amazing Conservatory suite....it took our breath away!!

From the moment we checked in we were treated like royalty, such friendly staff who chatted and asked us about our day, champagne on arrival, chocolates and fruits in the room, rose petals on the bed and and jacuzzi bath run for us at night with floating candles

This has to be one of the BEST hotels I have ever stayed and I will certainly be returning, as for recommending I am not sure I can do that as I want this little kept secret all to myself :-)

Keep up the amazing work Hotel 41 you are truly the best",5,2015,09,26
137,Royal treatment,"Beginning at the less-than-grand entrance, then stepping inside into the small but beautiful downstairs lobby, you have no idea of what awaits you upstairs. It only gets better and better, believe me.
Our room (Executive King) was spacious by European standards, well appointed with ample closet space, lovely bed linens, quality vanity items, and spotless bathroom with shower and separate large bath tub. 
The lounge and dining area was very pretty with plenty of tables for meals and comfy seating arrangements for conversation and cocktails. It was a pleasant spot with first-class service. 
The concierge was helpful in arranging tickets to various attractions and plays, along with directions to walkable sites.
Overall we were thrilled with our good fortune to have picked Hotel 41 for our 3 night London stay.",5,2015,09,25
137,The best ever!,"We can't say enough about the Hotel 41.  Between the fabulous rooms, the best shower, ""plunder the pantry"" and the best staff ever, I don't know how to keep my praise to a few sentences.  Just let me say, if you stay here, you won't be disappointed.",5,2015,09,24
137,A Different Twist,"Perfectly located (along side of Buckingham Palace) this hotel offers superb service and a lot of it.  We had been traveling for two months and had stayed in many 5 star hotels during this trip, but ""41"" is a step above.  Love the fact that there are only 22 rooms & 6 suites and love, love, love ""raid the pantry"".  Having met friends for late lunches two days and the theater another evening, all we needed was a little bite in the evening and ""the pantry"" was there for us.  It was a perfect way to end a 2 month trip.  However, now I'm spoiled; I can't imagine staying anywhere else when visiting London.",5,2015,09,24
137,Perfection!,Best hotel we have ever stayed at by far. The hotel is pricey but the service is excellent! We have already booked our trip again for this year. Stayed at many 5 star hotels before and the uniqueness of the boutique along with the welcoming service does not compare! ,5,2015,09,22
137,Best hotel ever!,"We stayed one night at hotel 41. It was the last night of a 'once in a lifetime' holiday to celebrate being with my wife for 30 years and our upcoming 50th birthdays. We had taken the Orient Express to Venice which was opulent beyond our wildest dreams. We then relaxed in Venice for 2 days, afterwhich we returned to London to finish off with what we hoped would be a lovely stay at the hotel 41...but it wasn't lovely....it was fantastic... The best hotel I have ever stayed at....from the doorman to the manager to the waiters and waitresses.... They made us feel special. If I could repeat this trip again, I would start with a night at the hotel 41, go on the Orient Express then come straight back to stay at the hotel 41 again. Thank you for putting the icing on the cake that was our holiday...... We will be back!",5,2015,09,21
137,Overwhelming,"We recently stayed at Hotel 41 or our 10th anniversary. We would like to thank the entire team for making our stay such an amazing and unforgettable event. Everything was taken care of for us extremely well. All the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We would like to especially thank Mrs Monika Skrzynska for her care and detail, she made sure everything was set for our celebration throughout the entire time of our stay.  We stayed at the conservatory suite and our room was prepared in such manner, that we couldn't have asked for anything more.Comparing this to other luxury hotels we have stayed at we were extremely impressed. We will always remember our celebration at Hotel 41 and return in the future.",5,2015,09,20
137,Always exceeds expectations,This is the only place we stay in London.  They have truly exceptional service and the rooms are all wonderful and unique.  They never fail to surpass our expectations on each visit.  We look forward to visiting again each time we return.,5,2015,09,20
137,Truly a 5 star hotel,"Hotel 41, located right across the street from the Buckingham Palace complex was the nicest hotel we have ever stayed in.  It is a small hotel with a nice ground floor entrance with all the rooms are all on the 5th floor of a beautifully remodeled older building.  A real King sized bed, fireplace in the room, separate shower and tub.  Everything was first class.  We booked through Costco travel which included an extensive continental breakfast each morning and a free dinner at the partner restaurant next door.  The dinner even included all drinks.  The dining room looks is a beautiful mahogany wood room that looks more like a library in a multi million dollar home than the restaurant.  It is open all day and night with free snacks, meats, cheeses, etc.  

One of the most outstanding things is every single employee knew our name from the moment the door person opened the door the first time.  They were very helpful in everyday they could be.  Not sure how they do it but we had a great time and would highly recommend it to others.  

If you happen to be reasonably good walkers the location is perfect to see all the London sights.",5,2015,09,20
137,Amazing Wedding Night!,"We spent our wedding night at the Fabulous Hotel 41 and really can't praise them enough. The service really is second to none. From the first greeting to when we left everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful. Without asking they moved us into the conservatory suite which is a stunning room with rose petals everywhere!

Thank you so much for making the night so special... I couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough. In every way they go the extra mile to ensure you have a great stay.",5,2015,09,19
137,Simply the best hotel in London.,"We stayed at 41 for our 10th Wedding Anniversary and were absolutely delighted with our visit. The hotel and rooms were stunning and the staff were beyond compare. There was not one thing that I would change about the hotel. The staff made our special day all the more memorable with lots of extra little touches which elevate this hotel beyond any other I have stayed at. I wish we could have stayed longer! The service is highly personal, without being over-bearing and there is no silly pompousness that you sometimes get at other hotels. I can't wait to go back!",5,2015,09,18
137,Birthday treat. ,Amazing hotel. It's small and the rooms are not big either but everything had been thought of. Staff amazing and well trained. Not stuffy or pompous. Really welcoming especially with our four year old who was a bit of a handful on occasions. All staff exceeded expectations and nothing was too much trouble. Well done guys :0),5,2015,09,15
137,"Wonderful hotel, top notch service","We just checked out of this beautiful hotel.  The staff was very attentive.  The executive lounge is a nice touch.  A great place to sit, relax and enjoy a drink.  The ""raid the pantry"" snacks are fabulous.
We loved this hotel.  The staff was so friendly and helpful. 
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because our room wasn't made up until 5pm the first day.  We put our sign out everyday after that for it to be done earlier and it was.  The bathroom sink and tub did not drain well at all and kept threatening to overflow.  Just small things like that, but at that price we felt it should have been taken care of before our check in.  
I would definitely recommend it though and I would stay there again.  They were very accommodating and gave us an early check in as well.",4,2015,09,14
137,Amazing!,"The only bad thing about staying at Hotel 41 is that every hotel after that will never be as good. Our stay here was simply amazing.. We didn't want to leave! The staff is very friendly and professional and go above and beyond to accommodate your every need. The champagne upon arrival, the executive lounge pantry, the delicious breakfast, the afternoon tea, the sweet anniversary cake, the rose petals and candles turn down service are just a few of the wonderful things this hotel has to offer... they honestly make you feel like royalty with no detail going unnoticed. Perfect location for touring the city. Loved our stay here.. Can't wait to go back! ",5,2015,09,11
137,One of the best ,I can not say enough about this establishment. It is truly an excellent hotel. The staff are exceptional and anticipate every need - even the ones you didn't know you had. This was my husband and my second stay but our first international trip with our toddler. The staff treated our daughter like a princess. It was a fantastic trip and we will return. ,5,2015,09,10
137,Elegant and quiet ,"High class hotel in excellent location adjacent to Buckingham Palace.  Keep your eyes peeled...have passed many celebrities on the street near this hotel.  Delicious food, lovely breakfast room and restful classic wood-panel lounge for a cocktail or nightcap.  Nice staff.  Fresh fruit in the lobby.  A luxury, but worth it. ",5,2015,09,09
137,Amazing.,"My stay at this hotel was unparalleled. The service was sublime, and the breakfast was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend checking out the bar in the evenings, having a late night ice cream after you've come back, and chilling out around the fireplace. 
41 was the perfect stay. Couldn't have been better.
I won't be staying anywhere else in London.",5,2015,09,09
137,Nice and good location,"I stayed here for a workation a couple of weeks a go, verry pleased with my stay but was hoping for better breakfast alternatives. Good location, nice rooms and friendly personel. I would say you won't be disapointed.",4,2015,09,09
137,Just amazing!,"i booked this hotel as a surprise night away to London for my husband. We were not disappointed. On arrival we were greeted with a glass of champagne (and when that was finished offered another!). We had nibbles whilst we waited for our room to be ready, which was only 5 minutes. The staff were really friendly, nothing was too much trouble. If you want posh then this hotel delivers this experience, but if, like us, you like elegance but also not to feel like you have to stand on ceremony you can have this experience too. We felt comfortable, relaxed but with luxury too. The staff are more than happy to offer you ideas of what to do whilst you are staying.  There was always food and nibbles that we could help ourselves to in the reception area. Gorgeous little bags of sweets, nuts, chocolates but also snacks like 9bars if you prefer the healthier option at no extra cost. There is an honesty bar for later in the evening, although be warned these drinks are expensive, but then what hotel in London isn't! You can also 'plunder the pantry' later on at night, where foods such as mini chilli's, or little puddings are available after your night out. Again at no extra charge. Our room was gorgeous and when we got back from dinner we found chocolates on the bed, candles lit around the room and music playing. Was a lovely touch for our weekend away! Also a special thanks to Dickson, who served our drinks and breakfast the next morning. Was a real pleasure to talk to, always interested in what we had been up to, and made are experience feel very personal, nothing was too much trouble and my husband certainly enjoyed the bottomless coffee that morning. I can personally highly recommend the belgian waffles for breakfast! We have stayed in a lot of hotels across the world and have to say this is our favourite. We will definitely be back!",5,2015,09,08
137,25th wedding anniversary,"First of all I'd like to start with the positives the  welcome was absolutely amazing nice choice of champagne on arrival , check in very smooth had some nice scones on arrival from plunder the pantry .
Went to our room which was small but perfectly formed and they left a lovely cake for our wedding anniversary . Went and had a wander around  we live in London only about 20 minutes away from the hotel and this was just a treat for our 25th wedding anniversary we normally stay in the Goring or Claridges , so this hotel has a completely different feel to it because it is a small boutique hotel . When we had showered and had a rest we went in to have some canapés before going out for dinner this was the highlight of our visit very accommodating too our older children .
Breakfast was lovely.
The only downside was I left my phone charger in the hotel room I've got a somewhat antiquated old iPhone 4S and my phone only charges with that  charger,  I rang the hotel five minutes after leaving but I was already on the train they informed me that they have the charger and I was going to pop back in within the  next  days to pick it up, then I received an email from the lost property to say they didn't have it I subsequently emailed a couple of times but to no avail and I have subsequently now had to buy a new phone. Other than that it was a fantastic stay . ",4,2015,09,07
137,Prepare yourself for a stay at the coziest hotel in London :),"My wife and I decided to treat ourselves to a one night stay in Hotel 41, it was absolutely lovely. 

The staff were brilliant, the room was so soft and cosy, and it was only a couple of hundred meters from Buckingham Palace.

If you really want to treat your lady then this is where to take her in London.",5,2015,09,06
137,The experience just gets better,We have been lucky enough to stay in quite a few 5 star hotels over the years and none surpass the 41 experience. 41 have once again made a special occasion feel even more special. Many many thanks to Lauren and the wonderful team at 41. We will be back!,5,2015,09,05
137,New FAVORITE hotel in London,"My husband and I have been to London numerous times. Never have we been so ""wowed"" by a hotel as by their check in. 

There is only one floor to this hotel near Buckingham Palace. At first they escort you to the 5th floor and then they introduce you to their Executive Lounge. 

I was astounded. The service is 6 Star service. You feel welcomed from the moment you arrive. The environment is posh and inviting and Monika was delightful. They have a full bar of drinks, snacks and an ice cream and chocolate bar. I cannot recommend this hotel enough and wish I had found it sooner.",5,2015,09,03
137,Favorite hotel in London,This hotel is exquisite. The staff are so helpful. When you travel from the states it is early morning when you arrive. i was offered a room to rest until my real room was available. When i purchased an electrical appliance that was going to need an adaptor for US use they insisted I take one of theirs. Restaurant choices were excellent. i travel yearly to London and will never stay any place other than here.,5,2015,09,02
137,A perfect oasis in the big smoke,"Having read the many positive TripAdvisor reviews, we decided to pay 41 a visit to celebrate my Mum's 'significantly special' birthday. With high expectations, this amazing property did not disappoint in any way! The service is impeccable; staff are brilliant with phenomenal attention to detail, making every moment you spend there important and special - without being in your face and annoying. The breakfasts are top drawer, great choices of continental and hot made to order. The afternoon tea was sublime, and we definitely took advantage of the wonderful supplies stocked in the larder. This boutique hotel is a must visit property in London - you won't be disappointed. We will definitely be back!",5,2015,08,31
137,Very thoughtful!,"Stayed here on our honeymoon - the second week of our two-week trip.  When we arrived to our room after our first day exploring, we opened the door to a room full of rose petals, candlelight, and champagne!  It was a lovely touch.  Wonderful service, but I will say that for the price, I think we would have preferred a larger hotel with more going on.  It is a lovely place, but we found the staff to be a bit confused when we asked questions about getting around the city.  Also, the ""raid the pantry"" was nice, but not something we typically were in need of after a day and night in a city full of options.  It was clean, however, and the rooms well-appointed.  Nice breakfast, we liked the location right near Victoria station and across from Buckingham.  Quiet and romantic.",4,2015,08,31
137,Wonderful Celebration,"We have just returned from a 2 night stay at Hotel 41 to celebrate 30 years together. We had previously enjoyed a superb stay there celebrating our silver wedding anniversary in 2013. We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. The staff, without exception, were incredibly professional whilst maintaining a warm, friendly and welcoming attitude. We felt completely relaxed and very well looked after. In particular we were attended to by the lovely Gina who was attentive and wonderfully engaging. Little touches, such as rose petals and candles, and a celebratory cake left in the room really made it a special stay.  We are looking forward to returning for our next celebration.",5,2015,08,31
137,Bob and Pam ,"Wonderful hotel.  Outstanding in every way, food, staff, rooms.  There for Christmas Day and hotel had a tree in our sitting room and a stocking on our couch when we returned from Christmas eve dinner. Caution this hotel is about intimate quality, there is not a sports bar or a pool slide, in fact there is not a pool.  Just a elegant experience.  ",5,2015,08,30
137,One of the best,"Quite simply, one of the best hotels we've ever stayed in. Small and friendly, the staff are exceptional! Worth every cent - and the executive lounge is a great place to sit and have a drink after a day out in the city. The staff's advice about what to see and do was invaluable as well. Can't recommend it highly enough!",5,2015,08,30
137,Best Service ever,"In 35 years of luxury travel we have never had the total quality of service Hotel41 offers. Every member of staff seemed to be hand picked to be the best and provided us with stunning English service and incredible personal and friendly attention like being an honoured family friend.
Lauren your team is the world's best!",5,2015,08,28
137,Very special hotel.,"My wife and I have just returned from a one night stay at Hotel 41. 

Our short stay was an amazing treat and was better than we imagined, even after reading the reviews here. This was principally down the very high standard of service and the attentive friendly staff. I could write about the many little touches that made our stay special, but like many of the reviewers, I will leave it for you to have your own experience.

We are already planning our next stay.",5,2015,08,27
137,Wonderfull...,"We booked this hotel after reading several good reviews, but for us is was even better then we had expected. From the moment we entered we were treated as royals. 
The room, and bathroom was great and very clean.
Hotel is located near Buckingham Palace, and you can do everything by feet.
But what us pleased the best was the kindness off the staff. Nothing is too much...
Special thanks to Flo(rant), Dickson and Mitchell... Thanks for all you did...
We will come back very soon...",5,2015,08,27
137,fabulous experience,"I loved this hotel! Every time I turned around, I was being offered a glass of champagne. Luxurious linens, great food, beautiful decor, and all in the best area of London (across the street from Buckingham Palace!)  Best customer service - I thought they had mistaken me for a celebrity! Small and intimate. Everyone knows your name. I'm going back!

Keep in mind this is Europe and the rooms are not your standard cookie cutter layouts. We had an executive king which was a bed area and adjoining siting area. The bathroom had both a tub and shower, but the layout was one long room due to the existing architecture. It seemed odd at first, but we got used to it pretty fast.",5,2015,08,26
137,Simply the best,"We came to Hotel 41 for a bit of luxury for my wife's birthday earlier this year, and we were not disappointed. After we'd navigated our way in (via the hotel next door by mistake, who amusingly said they'd ""upgraded us to their 5-star hotel""!), the experience was exactly as promised - and more.

Service, champagne at check-in, the pantry to plunder - all perfect. The room was outstanding and very comfortable (and a free upgrade, a very nice extra birthday present!); best of all, having opted in advance to buy some birthday chocolates, the message I'd put down turned out to be delivered in cake form! A wonderful surprise.

Having eaten out during the day, the excellent food at the pantry was just right for a light supper. Breakfast was superb as well.

All in all, a perfect stay for my wife's birthday; planning to go back later in the year for mine!",5,2015,08,26
137,Amazing,"I booked the conservatory suite to celebrate our first wedding anniversary as surprise for my husband.  He was blown away.  From the moment we stepped through the doors to leaving, the whole experience was awesome.  All the staff provided us with exemplary service.  Whilst checking in, we were given a choice of champagne to choose from.  They serve a most wonderful brut rose champagne which we thought was smoother than some Cristal we have had.  We were shown to our room which was amazing with a small lounge area and steps leading upstairs to the bedroom with the glass ceiling.  The hotel had kindly provided an anniversary cake and some delicious petit fours.  We enjoyed afternoon tea in the cosy lounge area and again with the delicious champagne.  We went out for dinner and returned to enjoy some of the complimentary snacks laid out.  In hindsight, we wished we had stayed at the hotel to enjoy the fine wine & snacks.  Breakfast was delicious and even more so, served with champagne.  We cannot compliment Hotel 41 enough and the amazing staff who truly want you to enjoy your stay with them.  We hope to return on our next anniversary, if not before.",5,2015,08,26
137,First class,"Hi! When we arrived at Hotel 41 we were pleasantly greeted by the lady on the front desk. We were then shown up stairs to the Executive Lounge, which when you walk inside is simply stunning. The hotel staff had everything already organised for us including complimentary champagne yum yum! We were shown to our room (which had been upgraded) and wow! It was breathtaking. The attention to detail was second to none. And the added surprise was the jacuzzi in the bathroom!!!
After a few drinks in the city we retired back to the Executive Lounge where we nibbled on a delicious selection of foods and more champagne. The staff attended to our every need and couldn't have made us happier.
Our whole experience was brilliant from the moment we stepped foot inside to the moment we left. If only we could live there permanently hehe!
A big thank you to all the staff that made our stay so relaxing on Our anniversary.",5,2015,08,23
137,Perfect again,"Every staff member we encountered at 41 was friendly, helpful, and professional. The service was impeccable! Each morning we would call the front desk for our daily Latte, which would arrive within 3 minutes. One of our favorite activities was sitting in the Lounge for afternoon tea or a perfect drink.  We will return to London again simply for the pleasure of staying at 41.",5,2015,08,19
137,Beyond expectation,"I had read the reviews. I had looked at the website. I had no idea just how good the experience would actually be once I visited. My wife and I had a long weekend in London at the start of our holiday and made Hotel 41 our base. 

The Executive lounge is a brilliant concept and works so well as the 'hub' of this hotel. On arrival, as many have noted, we were offered champagne and we sat and relaxed for so long that we felt completely 'at home' in the lounge. In face it was over 2 hours after check in that we actually managed to find the room we had booked!

At breakfast Stefan made us feel very welcome and within a short space of time he felt like a member of the family rather than a member of staff. This is the secret to this hotel: detail. In our package we had a 'romantic turn down' and here they had listened to what we were doing that night and tailored the package to our evening! Truly amazing.

On the day of our departure I asked the reception for a fine-nib sharpie. I was staggered as I felt sure they had scoured both hotel 41 and the Rubens for one and were quite prepared to go out and buy one for me. They really would have done this and in the end it was possible to use something a little thicker but I know that they would have done 'whatever it takes'. Nothing is too much. Nothing.

There is now a huge problem. We are faced with the thought that if we need to stay in London again there really is only one hotel we can use and I guess we just have to face up to the fact that this is the case!",5,2015,08,19
137,MOST AMAZING HOTEL EVER!!!,"I cannot say enough about this hotel!! It is very small (I think only about 25 rooms?) because they want to be able to cater to your EVERY need. The staff is able to accommodate your needs better when the ratio is about one staff member per room. Not only is it very quaint and unassuming on the outside (as famous as this place is, none of the taxi drivers knew where it was?? I had to name the hotel NEXT DOOR, and then they knew where to take me) but it is beautiful on the inside!! Dark wood, rich fabrics, fireplaces. The common area is where you go every night to ""plunder the pantry"" (which translates to FREE FOOD!) cocktails and gourmet snacks. And the service could not be better!! Whatever you need, they will get it (even if they have to walk 6 blocks to get it elsewhere and bring it back). It's not cheap, but worth every penny!! Perfect location (walking distance to Big Ben, Buckingham Palace and The London Eye) Truly 5 star hotel!!!",5,2015,08,16
137,Simply the best,"Love this hotel. The staff, the rooms, the honesty bar, the champagne on arrival, the breakfast, the all day snacks to take out and the evening hot snacks, absolute attention to detail.  Brilliantly located next to all the sites. Personal touches were excellent as we had a special occasion on one of the weekends we stayed. 

Can't wait to go again soon

137,Outstanding Dirty Gin Martinis at the 41.,"The 41 is a lovely discrete boutique hotel. The staff are very friendly and attentive and they mix the best DGM (Dirty Gin Martini). The hotel has a genteel ambiance and it was great to be able to come back after a show and 'raid the pantry'. A wonderful 3 days and thank you for the bottle of bubbles on my birthday, very thoughtful.",5,2015,08,14
137,Back again ,What can i say about this hotel this got to be only of the best hotel in London and their getting better and better the rooms are very nice and very clean the beds are very nice and comfortable as well this is my second visit in a few month and it won't be the last ,5,2015,08,13
137,Simply delightful,"Our stay at Hotel 41 was delightful even before we checked in for a four day weekend to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. A few days prior to our arrival I received a preference questionnaire: Were we celebrating a special occasion? Did we want feather or foam pillows? Would I like some flowers delivered to the room? Would we like a car arranged to pick us up at the airport? This was indicative of the hotel's attention to detail.

The staff at Hotel 41 are serious about service. 
If you have a preference, they will oblige you and remember your choice. 
Rather than having a separate number for room service, housekeeping, etc., there is simply the ""Whatever, whenever"" button on your telephone. Why would you want or need anything else?

At breakfast our second morning, Dickson, who had served us the morning before offered my tea with just a bit of milk, as I had taken it previously. ""You know me too well,"" I said. ""This is your home away from home,"" he replied. And it was.

Additional ""extras"" included welcome champagne, served by Stephen, who has something to contribute to a conversation on nearly anything, but especially about wine. 
Delicious canapés and other light appetizers were served between 6:00 and 8:00 PM. Combined with the ""plunder the pantry"" fare available throughout the evening, one could easily forego a more formal dinner.

The hotel is centrally located, near Buckingham Palace, and is a short walk from the Victoria tube stop.

All together, our visit was delightful, and we look forward to a return visit.",5,2015,08,13
137,Comfort and Style !!!!!,"This is definitely the best Hotel in London! My grandson and I returned this past June for our yearly European Trip. We absolutely love it! This is our third year staying at the 41 Hotel. Upon our arrival we were greeted by the same wonderful staff who are so friendly and accommodating to us every year. The Hotel is very beautiful with it's black and white décor which is classy and elegant. I have traveled around the world and I've stayed in a lot of nice Hotel but this one by far is the finest and it is truly because of the staff at this hotel they truly pride themselves in excellent customer service and kindness.

137,Small and perfectly formed!,"I've had the pleasure of staying on 41 on a number of occasions now,  we had a wonderful weekend this month to celebrate our 21st wedding anniversary.

It's still a joy to walk into the hushed lobby and be escorted upstairs and offered a choice of fine champagne while you relax and check in. As a repeat visitor it was great that a number of staff remembered me from the last visit and it's like catching up with an old friend. The bottle of champagne provided by the hotel on hearing of our anniversary was a lovely gesture and really appreciated  - Louis Roderer, my favourite as it happens.

Everyone here is so helpful and it's always nice to see the GM at breakfast maintaining a quiet but approachable presence which is not the case at many 5 star establishments.

The balance between great hospitality and intrusion is a very fine one, especially with some more introverted guests or first visitors but the ladies and gentlemen at 41 pull this off really well. They interact with all their guests and take cues as necessary and it's a real skill to master.

There are so many lovely little complimentary treats and the highlight for me is still going into the lounge in my slippers to pick up a snack, drink or tub of ice-cream - home from home.

By the way, if you see visitors walking out of 41 with Starbucks cups and a smile, its's because they put something special in the cup - a little colder, more alcoholic with a bit of fizz. Genius idea!

It's a small boutique hotel, my home from home in the city and I quite frankly wouldn't want to stay anywhere else.",5,2015,08,12
137,Nice Stay,"Having read all the reviews on trip adviser i was really expecting something very special to other five star properties that i have stayed at over the years but this didn't happen
The Property is well maintained and the staff as a whole are great a special mention to Dixion who was fantastic however i thought the front desk as they did not have a separate conceirge was not as knowledgable as others i have stayed at.
The bedroom was well appointed with a nice sized bathroom and plenty of hanging space and well maintained 
The Breakfast was very good and the Burger for lunch is probably one of the best i have ever had
41 is small and intermit and we enjoyed our stay",4,2015,08,12
137,Service Perfection,"We spent a long weekend visiting London and made Hotel 41 our base. We stayied in the Conservatory suite. From the moment of arrival the service was exceptional. All the staff are very friendly, remember your names, take an interest in what you are doing and nothing is too much trouble. Excellent breakfasts, great afternoon tea and the most comfortable bed I have slept on, in any hotel, anywhere, ever. Highly recommended.",5,2015,08,12
137,Oh Dear--Too Good!!,"First time and had some expectations, but-WOW!--this establishment is both sophisticated, elegant, and yet, fun. Staff is excellent, the food first-class, the suite was exemplary in every detail (where are the nicks and scratches on the furniture, why isn't the carpeting stained, why is everything just right!?). I cannot say enough about my stay and it contributed so much to enjoying my London vacation.  Thank you, 41--I'll be back,",5,2015,08,11
137,Perfect in every way,"I can't be positive enough about my experience at 41. I chose it as the location for me to propose to my girlfriend and everything was perfect.

Within days of booking and leaving a note stating my intentions, I was personally contacted by a lovely guy called Remus, who proceeded to help me plan every details of the day. He was fantastic and really set my mind at ease and assured me all would be well.

When we actually arrived on the day, every single member of staff was lovely and seemed genuinely like they wanted to help. Nothing was too much to ask. They really know how to provide great service. I won't spoil any surprises, but some of the services that come complimentary with your stay are just top notch as well.

The room was pristine and luxurious with an enormous bed and everything else you need in a hotel room. 

There's no getting round it, a stay here is not cheap. However, it is 100% worth the money you spend. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to celebrate a special occasion, as I have no doubt that you won't forget your experience. I know myself and my new fiance won't!",5,2015,08,11
137,Treated like royalty!,"Hotel 41 was probably the loveliest hotel we have stayed in.  The staff were exceptional in so many ways. Knowing us by name right away, helping us with bookings and information about things to see and do, gracious service at the breakfasts and afternoon tea.  The room was so well appointed and spacious. A delicious birthday dessert in our room, a turn down at night with red roses and rose petals, plunder the pantry for late night snacking in the beautiful Executive Lounge.  We could go on and on.  The location across from Buckingham Palace is perfect!  I would recommend this hotel in a heartbeat!",5,2015,08,10
137,Royal Visit,"41 Hotel is beyond description!  It has to be the next best thing to staying at Buckingham Palace.  The service is truly exceptional--I don't think there is one thing the staff wouldn't have done to cater to our every need.  Excellent staff, excellent food, the closest hotel to Buckingham Palace, immaculately clean--newspapers from all over the world to choose from, etc.  Henry Malcolm and his staff are top rate.",5,2015,08,09
137,Amazing Place,"We stayed here for one night back in May, but wished we had booked longer. From the moment we walked through the door we were made to feel so at home. The staff are so friendly and attentive. The rooms were just so delightful. The hotel arranged theatre tickets for us and when we returned our room had been lit by candlelight and rose petals scattered around the room. 
The small lounge area is so lovely and the complimentary snacks are gorgeous. 

The location is great, just round the corner from Buckingham Palace.

We have now booked a stay in another of the Red Carnation hotels in Dorset because of the fantastic experience at hotel 41. 

We can't wait to come back.",5,2015,08,08
137,Nice,"Had friends coming from abroad and booked them here. No complaints all happy and fine.....could not see any issues or problems. Breaks aft did not try and other facilities most of the time in city and entertaing guests. However, no issues in hotel. ",5,2015,08,06
137,A wonderful and original hotel experience,"I had an exceptional 4 night stay in Hotel 41.  I felt like I was transported back to another time.  As wonderful and exciting as London is, I looked forward to returning to my hotel, every night.
What sets this hotel apart is the amazing service.  From my initial arrival, I was welcomed with class and a sincere and genuine care.  Several of the staff are simply amazing.  
The rooms are nice and well appointed (not gigantic) and it almost feels like you are on an upscale train or cruise.
The gracious lobby for relaxing, having a drink or a bite to eat, is in a class by itself.  
A very special experience and I hope to be back!
Thanks to the entire staff for a wonderful experience.",5,2015,08,04
137,Fabulous,"Just had a lovely weekend at this hotel.
From check in all the way to check out we were looked after amazingly with all staff making us feel very welcome.
Room was very clean and comfortable. Great value, Will definitely be back!",5,2015,07,30
137,Nice hotel,"Hello, I really love this hotel!!! Nice place, tasty food, the staff is friendly and quick!!! my lovely hotel in UK! I was there in this month for fourteen days and every day was amazing!!!! Highly recommended place!",5,2015,07,30
137,Small yet Mighty!,"My husband travels to England every so often for business.  Although we appreciate the larger business hotels, we wanted to try something a little more intimate and elegant.  Our research lead us to the Hotel 41.  It is a lovely place to stay and it's loveliness begins the minute you walk into the hotel and never stops until the minute you check out.  That type of consistency is hard to find in the larger hotels.  

Some details......the main common room of the hotel is absolutely elegant.  It looks like an old English library with very tall ceilings, tastefully wood paneled walls and lots of natural light.  This is where the concierge is as well as the small pantry area where there are complimentary snacks available all day long.  There are large grand chairs and small tables for you to sit and visit, order drinks, have breakfast or enjoy the complimentary early evening hor dourves.  There are also complimentary late evening items/sweets.  True elegance all the way.  The rooms are well stocked, very nicely decorated, and may be a tad small but so wonderful and comfortable.  The hotel itself is perfectly located.  You can walk 5 minutes and be standing in front of Buckingham Palace, 5-10 minutes in another direction you are in the middle of great shopping, and just a 15 minute walk from Parliament and Big Ben.",5,2015,07,29
137,A wonderful hotel experience,"We recently spent 3 nights at Hotel 41, before a long haul flight home.
It was a unique hotel experience, with beautiful black and white decor in our spacious room. The bed was extremely comfortable, with top quality linen. 
The lounge was quiet, relaxing and a great place to end our busy days of sightseeing.
 The service was really what set this hotel apart from others. Staff were extremely well trained, attentive and above all friendly. They appeared to really love their work, and nothing was too much trouble.
We enjoyed the lovely breakfast and evening nibbles and the ""Plunder the pantry"" buffet available after 8.00pm.
It was an expensive treat for us to stay here but we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and hope we can return one day.",5,2015,07,29
137,Simply Outstanding! Second time running!,"Having stayed twice now at Hotel41 my first review was appropriately titled 'Simply Outstanding!'. Second time round, it's still Simply Outstanding!

One of the best Hotels I have stayed in to date and truly deserves the #1 ranking for London. 

I really can't fault this Hotel, it's perfect in every way and delivers on ALL levels and exceeds expectations regularly. 
Hotel41 has that personal touch in everything they do which is evident in the way the staff engage and look after their guests which is what has us coming back for a second time and for future Holidays in London!
The Food & Drink are presented & served to such a high standard whether it be Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner or a snack / take away drink along the way. The Pantry is always incredibly well supplied and no request is ever too hard or too much for the team to help.
The rooms are generously appointed and have this 'home away from home' feel which also continues right throughout this incredible Hotel. 
It really is perfect and i do find a lot of this is because of the exceptional staff that work at Hotel41. 

Florient, Magda & Monika all deserve a huge thank you. Even though the last trip was just under two years ago, walking though the door upon on arrival we were instantly recognised which was impressive for one but such a nice feeling for two as it settles you in straight away.
Stefan who is on the floor of the Executive Lounge, never shy of a great conversation or story really helps in making any dinning experience there relaxing and you instantly feel like you a part of it all.
Lastly, Dixon, provided us with some great recommendations for what to do on certain days and has a great knowledge of what's what and what's going on when.

Simply Outstanding Hotel!",5,2015,07,28
137,Really simple - just book it.,"I'm not going to rehash the standard Hotel 41 review - because if you've read more than a couple of pages you'll pretty much have got the gist by now. Ignoring the odd (in every sense) reviewer who wanted the sky a little bluer - I guess that you'll be struck by the superlatives people tend to use in the descriptions of their experience and the emotional connection they seem to have with the hotel. I'd echo this - they were an absolutely integral part of making my wife's 40th birthday celebrations really special - so thank you to all of the team.

If you need it in terms of benchmarks - we have been really fortunate to stay in a number of 5 star hotels acoss the globe Shangri-la, Four Seasons, Fairmont etc and also the current No 3 in the TA top 25 in the UK (Rudding Park) and I can say without fear of contradiction that Hotel 41 is an absolute country mile ahead of all these in just about every way. 

It's really very simple - whether for just one night or more - it's just something you need to experience for yourself, trying to describe it just doesn't do it justice.",5,2015,07,27
137,Perfection,From the moment I walked in a could tell it would be a pleasant stay.   First thing they did was offer me some champagne while they explained the afternoon snacks setup.   The executive lounge was a great little cozy place to relax after getting in or before heading out.   Our room was very nice.  Spacious and clean.   The best thing about the hotel is their staff.   They all know you by name and bend over backwards to make sure your stay is as pleasant as can be.    There is no wonder this hotel is rated number 1; they definitely deserve it.  ,5,2015,07,27
137,"Brilliant birthday treat, which was made by the truly wonderful staff, service and impeccable food and drink!","We stayed at Hotel 41 for a wonderful birthday surprise! 

We arrived and were greeted with a beautiful glass (or two) of gorgeous champagne, and made to feel welcome in an instant! It is clear that the staff all love this place and their passion for service and hospitality is instantly apparent.

An upgrade on our room was just amazing and the room and facilities were first class! The bed, the bathrooms and complete ambience of this hotel makes it like a home from home, with all the luxury additions that you would expect from a hotel of this class.

All of our needs and expectations were met and exceeded! I cannot explain how wonderful this hotel is! A real experience!

Many many thanks! We will definitely be back!",5,2015,07,26
137,Pampered,"We spent four wonderful nights at hotel 41 earlier this week. I can't say enough about how professional their staff is. They found a way to promptly satisfy every need and request we had, regardless of the time of day. We were two blocks from Buckingham Palace and treated like royalty.A unique experience. We will return there on our next trip to London. Truly a 5 star experience.",5,2015,07,25
137,The Best Of The Best,We stayed at Hotel 41 for two nights and this was the second time we have stayed at Hotel 41 in less than a year.  It is by far the finest hotel we have ever stayed at.  The staff is superb and takes care of everything and really goes all out to make every minute at the Hotel very special.  They are just so very friendly and attentive and I cannot think of any hotel that excels as much as this one does.  We enjoyed it so much we plan to be back next year.,5,2015,07,25
137,'Best Hotel experience by far',"Its difficult to find words to describe this hotel, as none i can think of are good enough. this was my 2nd visit and hopefully not my last. this time i brought my mum and sisters.
The whole experience from the time we arrived to when we left was nothing short of amazing. ALL the staff treat you as if you are their most important guest, however a special mention must go to Lauren and of course Dickson, who just made our stay even more perfect. The Champagne afternoon tea was to die for. one of our party needed a special diet, all the staff were aware of this and we didn't need to ask, she had a separate afternoon tea that looked just as lush as ours.it is all the little touches that make this hotel the top hotel in London, (and beyond) it is everything in all previous reviews state plus a little more. 
A stones throw from Buckingham Palace, St James Park, Trafalgar Sq and more. Billy Elliot and Wicked 5 mins walk. close to Victoria tube. plenty of restaurants near by however the Hotel provided mainly complimentary treats, throughout the day.",5,2015,07,20
137,"Sorry, I didn't feel the love","I booked two rooms for my family of six at the Hotel 41. I chose this hotel based on the fabulous reviews posted here on TripAdvisor. Unfortunately, I didn't find that I was treated any better here than any other five- star properties I have stayed. I thought what set this hotel apart from other high end properties was the extra special personal attention one receives. My family and I were treated with kindness, and everyone was friendly and polite, but no extraordinary treatment was ever given.
My family was celebrating my daughter's wedding and my husband's birthday. There was never any mention of this at the hotel. When I returned to the hotel from my outing, I struggled getting my granddaughter's stroller up the steps to the elevator. No one was around to help. I told the woman at reception that I was taking my grandson to see Billy Elliot, and I had mentioned how important it was to him, but he was never asked if he enjoyed the show-no personal attention

The spit level junior suite I had was right beyond the reception desk/lounge area. Each time I wanted to exit, I had to go through doors and pass reception and then go out another door. My room was also in the back, so there was no view whatsoever.
The suite itself was attractive and clean, but it was also very small. For a couple it would be lovely, but when three are in the room, the space is very tight. 

This hotel is beautiful and well suited for single travelers and couples. It is not the best choice for families.  Maybe I need to return with my husband so I can experience the feeling of royalty others continue to have. For this trip, however, I didn't feel my stay was worth the price paid.",4,2015,07,20
137,1st Class Hotel,"What a fabulous time I have just experienced at Hotel 41.  Their customer service is exemplary, and if you are lucky enough to stay at the hotel when Mr Jackson is on duty, then you will have found the jewel in your crown.

Hotel 41 is the perfect place to unwind and relax, it does not feel like a typical hotel, it feels more like being a member of an exclusive private club.  

I cannot speak highly enough of Hotel 41 and their fabulous team, if you want to feel like royalty then this is the place to stay!  Breakfast is highly recommended.  

Enjoy!",5,2015,07,20
137,Simply stunning...x,"This hotel is pretty much as close to perfect as you can get. Unfortunately my stay was only one night but it was the most amazing evening and I wish I could have stayed longer. 

From the minute you walk through the door you are treated like royalty, Roberta at reception was so kind and sweet. Manager Remus is a true gent, charming and professional, he lead us through to the lounge where we had a quick glass of champagne before he showed us to our room. The room was elegant and stylish, bed so comfy and bathroom stocked to the max with gorgeous toiletries. 

We had breakfast in the morning in the lounge which was yummy, Dickson our server is probably the sweetest man on earth, perfectly accommodating and helpful. I honestly have nothing negative to say about this place, one of the most beautiful hotels I have ever stayed in and I cannot recommend it enough. Thank you Remus and all the staff at 41 for making our stay truly wonderful, I hope to be able to come again soon! x",5,2015,07,19
137,PERFECT ,This hotel is amazing!  The staff and incredible and really dote on the guests. This hotel is right across the street from the Royal Mews and a short walk to watch the Changing of the guards and the underground train. Great location.,5,2015,07,17
137,Exceptional,"This hotel breaks all the rules when it comes to exemplary service. They treat you like royalty from the time you book to the time you walk out the door. The rooms are well appointed but not huge by world standards. There is only 30 rooms in the boutique hotel and the staff help you believe you are the only guest that matters. The location is fantastic for walking to Buckingham Palace and just about anywhere else you want to go. I can not recommend them highly enough, but remember that this level of service and exclusivity does come at a price - however it is one I am willing to pay again. Just make sure you know the address when telling the cab drivers as it is a well kept secret and noone knew about it when we were travelling around (tell them it is next door to the Ruebens)",5,2015,07,15
137,Hotel 41 showed us impeccable service with such grace and kindness,"First may I say Thank you!! Hotel 41 showed us impeccable service with such grace and kindness. Truly this is a hotel that stands out above all others.  One important factor is the absolutely wonderful people that work there. All of them exhibited utmost professionalism and kindness. I would like to thank Stephan  for making our stay truly magical. His exemplarity service, knowledge and charm entertained us. Stephan’s recommendation of the B-bar was perfect for a magnificent dinner, and what a wonderful accompaniment to your property. Their staff and Manager exceeded our every need. Also, Dickson was another favorite that made our stay so enjoyable. I can’t say enough how everyone there was so attentive and pleasant. Thank you to the front desk, for as many times as we came and went they were so kind to stop what they were doing and open the door and kindly greet us. Housekeeping took the time each day to turn down our bed and leave such delicious sweet treats, light a candle and turn on beautiful relaxing music. In the evening we enjoyed the chef’s selection of delicious canapé’s before we left for the theatre and returned to have a wonderful selection of fruit, cheeses, quiches and desserts, and lets not forget to mention the amazing ice cream. We  highly recommend your wonderful establishment to our friends and peers. Together they made Hotel 41 a favorite place for us and we look forward to visiting again soon.",5,2015,07,14
137,Would rate above five stars if possible!,"London itself is amazing, but if you want to top off a visit by staying in an exceptional hotel, you should choose Hotel 41.  It's over-the-top . . . in service, food & drink offering, rooms, ambience, location -- we've stayed in luxury hotels in the Asia-Pacific having lived there for years and we'd be hard-pressed to find a hotel that surpasses Hotel 41.  We had one room for our teenage daughter and grand daughter, and the conservatory suite for ourselves -- our girls (and we!) loved the attention in the hotel's exec lounge where we had breakfast daily and ""plundered the pantry"" after our evenings out for shows and dinner.  The hotel recommended itineraries, shows, attractions, restaurants and set up everything for us.  This boutique hotel is not large, so personal, and we were always addressed by name. If rooms are available, book Hotel 41 -- you will not be disappointed!",5,2015,07,13
137,The best hotel anywhere,"I've lost count of how many times I have stayed here. I am simply spoiled and have to adjust my expectations way down for any other hotel, even some very nice and expensive ones. You will not find a staff anywhere that is more willing and able to help you. They remind me of my mom in the frequency of food and drink offerings. When they heard my boss's luggage was lost and they took over calling the airline to get it back. It's small but the decor is gorgeous, teeters on a very clever and luxe midpoint between the 19th century and modernity. It has its quirks, some of the rooms aren't really up to the size of the furniture, but nothing could take away from the service and the overall experience. On  a practical note, the food is also very good and they have free canapes and munchies almost all of the time; even though there arte plenty of restaurants withi a short walk, it helps a lot when you get back late and tired. Comparable to other hotels that bill themslves as high end, too, it's very reasonable. I booked a shabby Holiday Inn in the suburbs last-minute for almost as much as I pay here (and 41's never charged me more for last-minute!).",5,2015,07,13
137,They know how to do things...,"41 is the type of hotel you don't really want to review as other people will go there and you want to keep it for yourself, but it is too good for that!

From the moment you walk in the door you are treated like royalty (like the Queen who lives across the road!) 

All the staff were lovely and it felt like there was no limit to how much they would do for you. 

Delicious hand made chocolates on entry and a lovely little note that made me appreciate the tiny details this hotel put into every room.

Don't forget the Plunder in the Pantry from 8.30pm... some delicious snacks are available for all hotel guests. I would have been disappointed to miss it. 

The breakfast included in the room was HUGE - we actually couldn't eat it all. 

The room was spotless, the hotel must have an amazing cleaning team.

Quite literally no faults at all.

Go and stay here, you'll see what I mean!",5,2015,07,13
137,You'll only believe it if you try it for yourself.,"All the positive reviews for 41 still don't really portray the fantastic service you will receive. From the moment we arrived they couldn't do enough for us. We were attending a function at another hotel on Park Lane, my wife had a problem with one of her shoes very shortly before we were due to leave. She saw Stefan who dealt with the problem in a matter of minutes. 

The Executive Lounge is a lovely place to sit and it's very hard not to be tempted by the many complimentary treats that await the weal willed (such as myself). 

The bed and pillows were amongst the most comfortable I think I've ever slept in. 

I don't think I know enough superlatives to do 41 justice. All I can say is go and try it for yourself. I don't think you'd be disappointed.",5,2015,07,09
137,Absolutely Amazing,"Stayed here with friends for a visit to Wimbledon for three nights. The entrance is like going into a gentlemans club and your bags are seen to straight away. You check in on the fifth floor as these are the only two floors in the hotel and you are greeted with a glass of champagne. The rooms are amazing and nothing is missing from slippers at your bedside, robes in the bathroom to a full laundry service. The executive lounge is a large wood panelled room where you can just relax. There is a complimentary buffet and the food and choice is excellent.
The staff have to have a special mention and nothing is too much trouble even to the fact the couple we went with wanted to see a theatre show and only mentioned it to the  consierge and half an hour later he was informed the one of the staff had gone round and collected the tickets for them. I cannot praise this hotel and the brilliant staff enough. This is one of the special places you will always remember. If you want on the day of your departure they will even pack your clothes and make sure your vehicle is fuelled for you and a mention must go to Peter on the night shift, he is fantastic.",5,2015,07,09
137,Extreme Attention to Every Detail!,"Hotel 41 is as nice of a hotel as I've stayed in, but is still quite affordable. It's a young hotel, so the finishings are fresh. I expect the rates to climb quickly as this hotel gets discovered.

They did not overcharge for anything, and in fact through in a few freebies along the way (rose + candle turndown, a couple free breakfasts).",5,2015,07,09
137,Luxury at its finest!,"I usually stay at the Four Season or the Ritz Carlton, this hotel is over and above like no other......The staff treats you like you are royalty to start off with but it does not does stop there, the rooms supercede any rooms I  have ever stayed in......Pure elegance!!  The rooms are so incredibly beautiful, the decor is a combination of old English cozy, mixed with art deco! I usually do not write reviews but I was so impressed by this hotel in every aspect, I cannot truly say enough.....I fell in love and I want to go back just to stay here again!!! I The staff, each and every one I encountered were so very impressive, the way they cater to you!!!!",5,2015,07,09
137,Best Hotel Ever,"I have never posted a review on Trip Advisor, but am compelled to let everyone know how wonderful Hotel 41 was.  My wife and I stayed there for three days on a stopover to Italy.  We have stayed in many 5 star hotels but chose Hotel 41 because it was number 1 on Trip Advisor.  It was the best hotel we have ever stayed in!!! It did not have the best views.  It did not have the biggest or nicest rooms, It did not have the best food.  But everything as a whole was just perfect.  The room, the location, the food were all excellent and the staff was unbelievable.  I couldn't recommend it more.",5,2015,07,08
137,"Yes, it's all true!","We booked this hotel based on the reviews and they really are all true.  We've stayed at top hotels, like the Ritz Carleton, and 41 is absolutely the best.  The key here is the customer service.  For example, we indicated on our check in form that we were each celebrating a birthday and they arranged for a birthday cake in our room when we checked in.  They helped us move the rental car, retrieved the car upon check out and packed our bags in car -  we just walked out and left.  Since the hotel is small and intimate, the staff members all know your name and there are multiple staff to help you in every way possible.
    Really, I can't say enough about this hotel.  We want to return to London just to stay there again!",5,2015,07,07
137,International staff at the top of the game,All reviews are true.  This property is a gem managed by caring staff that is only visible when needed.  It is a bit like magic. The staff provide not only fabulous service but are able to do so in many languages. We were truly impressed by this perfect blend of the best of English traditions (think: private club) with a tech-entertainment-restaurant-outing-savvy staff that will make you feel at home whether your first language is English or French or Hungarian or German . . .and the list goes on.  We will definitely return.,5,2015,07,06
137,Great hotel -- Best staff ever,"Given how many reviewers give the Hotel 41 five stars, there's not much I can add other than my complete agreement.  It is simply a superb hotel -- location, rooms, amenities, dining are just wonderful.  And even better are the staff -- friendly, genuine, helpful.  Concierge, reception, dining area are all staffed by wonderful people.  The hotel is small.  Check in, lobby and dining are all combined in one area centrally located among the rooms.  However, there is never a crowded feel.  Instead, the hotel is cozy, just a wonderful place to relax between jaunts among London's many places to visit.  Food service seems to run just about all day -- excellent breakfast, scones, snacks and tea in the afternoon and a wonderful canape spread in the early evening. Next time I visit London, I won't consider any other hotel.",5,2015,07,03
137,Best Service Ever!!,"All of the reviews are true. Great location, great rooms and the best service I have ever had. You will not be disappointed!!!  You won't believe how wonderful it is. Free champagne at registration,  a butler to help you, plunder the pantry etc.",5,2015,07,02
137,"Like Mary Poppins - ""Practically perfect in every way""","Simply put, the best hotel I've ever had the pleasure of visiting. Every aspect of our stay was managed with care and attention, from check-in to check-out. 

The hotel is gorgeous on the interior - I've seen plenty of hotel websites with pretty pictures, but 41 actually exceeds expectations in person. 

As we were there for a special occasion, the 41 staff upgraded us to a split-level suite for the first few nights of our stay. While the smaller room was perfectly nice and would have been great for the stay, the suite was out of this world. A huge luxurious room with a bathroom larger (and nicer) than some hotel rooms where I've stayed. 

The staff was all friendly and personable - particularly Stef, who served us our check-in champagne and kept us laughing with his quotes and stories. Whenever we needed anything, the staff was not only accommodating, but went out of their way to ensure that we had everything we needed.

I've been to other hotels with ""plunder the pantry"" style offerings, but this is the first one where I've actually wanted to take advantage of it. Many nights we returned from dinner to settle in with a drink and some selections from the complimentary spread. It's a great touch and the lobby is a beautiful setting to close out an evening.

The location of the hotel right near Buckingham Palace made many of London's attractions an easy walk or tube ride away. Don't miss the Royal Mews right across the street, but Victoria station is right around the corner and many of the parks and gardens around Buckingham Palace are right at your doorstep for an afternoon stroll.

I can't say enough good things about our stay at 41 and I can't wait to return.",5,2015,07,02
137,Perfect stay,"Hotel 41 is the perfect place to stay when exploring or doing business in London. The hotel is the most hidden gem on Buckingham Palace Road. A short walk to Victoria Station as well as many of the treasured London sights. The staff are extremely attentive and always warmly welcome you back after each day's outings or as you wake in the morning. They are extremely adept at getting reservations at that ""impossible to book restaurant"" and know of all the best activities and events available during your stay. They have become a home away from home while in London.",5,2015,06,30
137,A peaceful haven in a busy city,"Every aspect of our stay here was outstanding from the warm welcome we received on entering the building. 
All the high praise given in the many reviews is well deserved. 
We were staying in London for a long weekend primarily for a concert but had decided to take in the many sights that we never get round to seeing. This hotel is a perfect base. It is so well situated for walking, tubes and even the hop on hop off bus if you so choose. 
The weekend was warm and it was such a welcome to return to the calmness of the hotel and to our beautiful air conditioned room. 
Nothing is too much trouble at this hotel. The staff and the service are truly first class. 
We stay in many hotels all around Europe and the USA and this hotel is now in our top three of all time favourites. 
With the help of Tripadvisor reviews and my own research I have  in the last few years begun to book into Boutique style hotels and generally find the quality and level of service superior to any of the larger hotels we stay in. 
We will most definitely return to this hotel for our future visits to London. 
",5,2015,06,30
137,my special birthday treat,"my wonderful husband booked this for my birthday on June 18th and it was out of this world. On check in you are led to a beautiful Hogwarts like library and ask which on of four champaignes you would like with canapes. The chap outside had already parked our car and our bags for the over night stay taken to our suite. 
The suite was fantastic, with a tray of chocolate desserts waiting for us.
We ate the the hotel restaurant and I was presented with a stunning chocolate cake with my name and happy birthday on the plate, so special and elegant. 
We had port in the librayr and more canapes then back to our room where the most preciaou husband in the world, had arranged rose petals, classic fm on the radio and floating candels. it was heaven, it really was.
The butler service ; impecable, we only called on her for fresh milk in the morning and on departure, they gave us a pic nic box. 
We WILL be back for Christmas and have started saving already.
THANK YOU 41",5,2015,06,30
137,Gem at 41 Buckingham Palace Road,Our party of four had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 for seven nights last week. We had two rooms and both were perfect in every way. This is a boutique hotel and the service is excellent. It is located in Belgravia just steps from Buckingham Palace. I highly recommend Hotel 41.,5,2015,06,29
137,"Amazing, Friendly, Perfection","What a fabulous hotel,
a stones throw away from the theatre we had booked & on the doorstep of Buckingham palace.. Thought the queen may invite us to tea, but no, sadly 😀
The hotel is small but the standard is unbelievably exceptional, the staff so friendly and interested in you & what you have to say, making it such a personal experience.. Extra little touches & treats at every turn. Full marks.
Cannot fault it in any way whatsoever & whole hearted recommend ",5,2015,06,29
137,"I visited friends in outer London and wanted a few days in central London to re-visit old haunts, museums and theatres.","This small luxury hotel is situated within walking distance of many of the London sights and museums. The hop-on-hop-off bus stops outside the door. Restaurants and bars on streets parallel to Buckingham Palace Road are many and some very good. My room was perfect - and although I always insist on a room with a view and here there was no view, I didn't mind. It's London centre after all. The staff was very friendly, helpful and efficient. Breakfast delicious. The South African touch was pleasant. The lounge buffet in the evenings reminded me of safaris in Africa, with sundowners  and after-dinner chats with fellow guests. I felt at home, and welcome, even though I was alone. 
The hotel also booked theatre tickets for me. I had selected a few plays (from internet)  and they booked them for me. It worked fabulously. All in all, next time I'll stay at the 41.",5,2015,06,25
137,Outstanding Experience,"My husband and I traveled to Europe for our very first time and as a part of our stay we booked several nights at Hotel 41. Based on previous reviews I had extremely high expectations and not only were they met, they were exceeded. This is not your ordinary hotel, this is an experience. The moment you walk in you know this is going to be something special. From the detailed amenities in the room, to the lovely breakfasts and afternoon cocktail hours you never want to leave. Do not look elsewhere, if you can book a reservation, do it now, you will not be disappointed.",5,2015,06,25
137,Wonderful,"My daughter and son in law booked an overnight stay in Hotel 41 as a 60 th birthday present to begin our trip on the Orient Express. What an amazing start to a trip of a lifetime. 
Luxury and excellent service Staff were wonderful. Food excellent ( loved the gin and tonic ice cream) Nothing was too much trouble. 
Will definitely book to stay here again",5,2015,06,23
137,Good service,Hotel 41 has very good service. Service in London can be very hit and miss in London and the rest or England. So it was very nice to have some personal service. The rooms are cosy but space in London is a premium. I noticed they took the time out to talk to guests especially the solo travellers and seemed quite genuine. ,5,2015,06,21
137,AMAZING! WONDERFUL! EXCELLENCE!,"This is the best place to stay in London. We were on a trip in honor of our 40th wedding anniversary.  We feel so fortunate we stayed at Hotel 41. The hotel went out of its way to make it a special week. We enjoyed a cake one night and a romantic candle lit room on another night! They provide a fresh fruit plate each day which really was nice. The executive lounge had snack during the day. My husband loved the ice cream that was available. We are just a middle class working couple but staying at this hotel is well worth the cost. We saved a long time for this trip and starting it off in London at Hotel 41 just reinforced our belief that this will be the vacation of a lifetime!  Thank you to all the wonderful staff. A special thanks to Mr. Otto who made my husband feel at ease with his sharing of hunting stories. You sure made my husband's week special. He will be telling all the family about you! All the staff wen up and above to get you what ever you needed. Again, thanks to all of you!!!!",5,2015,06,21
137,Truly Amazing,"We’ve recently returned from a 4 night break celebrating our 20th Wedding Anniversary and from the minute you arrive to the moment you (sadly have to) leave, you are treated like a VIP guest.  Attentive staff, attention to detail and immaculate rooms & lounge area make this a truly amazing experience.   The best hotel we’ve ever stayed in and now our number one choice for a London break – Hotel 41 has raised the bar!",5,2015,06,21
137,A perfect Boutique Hotel,"A wonderful stay...a very personal, small hotel.  A very nice accommodation, supported by a personable, professional, and helpful staff.  I know we are missing some names, but Magda, Lauren, Stephanie, and Stefan were a joy. The ""library"" area is most charming and relaxing.  We felt like a little of home.  It was a special treat since returning to our old London neighborhood from 10 years prior.  The ""bbar"" restaurant is excellent, and We would recommend Ffiona's French Bistro on Kensington Church Street to anyone who likes a small, intimate, and great food restaurant.",5,2015,06,20
137,Very nice hotel,"Very good hotel! we went there with my husband for our wedding anniversary and we had a great time. The hotel is great, people are very nice, and the breakfast is the best!! the only bummer was that they made us a reservation for an afternoon tea at another hotel, and when we arrived there, they had a long wait, so we had to leave, though this wasn't 41 hotel fault, they made that reservation for us...
but all the other thing were great!",5,2015,06,16
137,Service beyond any expectation,"I’m really torn on providing my feedback on this hotel.  My family and I just spent 4 nights at the ""41"".  I consider it more of a private club than just a hotel.  If everyone were to experience the level of service and genuine hospitality that my family did, then it would surely be everyone’s top choice to stay while in London, and my ability to get future reservations will be severely diminished.    If you want to stay at a large hotel where no one calls you by name, doesn't remember your favorite drink, and charges you for club access, then this is not the hotel for you.  If exceptional personalized service is what you are looking for, then there is no better hotel in London.  When in London this is where I will stay.",5,2015,06,16
137,"More than a luxurious hotel, it is the welcome home every traveler hopes to find.","We were greeted by friendly, warm people who offered refreshments (available all day) as we rested in the cushy leather furnishings of the lobby/lounge. There are substantial, old-world tables that look and feel as if they were created for the space where you can enjoy the excellent food and drink. Our room and bath were charming and beyond comfortable. However, the most outstanding feature of this hotel is the staff! Stefan, Stephanie, Lauren, and everyone else who helped us get tickets to plays, taxis, detailed directions, etc. we're fabulous. We will return to this amazing, unique establishment.",5,2015,06,16
137,"Classy, Old Style Hotel in the Heart of the City","A special place to stay when visiting London. Located almost across the street from the palace, this hotel offers old world charm, fantastic service and all day food and drink. All rooms are located on one floor so getting a room can require advanced booking. The rooms were well adorned and the service was above expectations.",5,2015,06,14
137,Like a Private Club,"We recently stopped over in London for 3 nights after a trip to Europe.  We totally enjoyed our stay at this outstanding hotel.  If you are expecting a grand lobby, multiple restaurants, hundreds of rooms and numerous amenities, you may be disappointed.  This is a small, say 30 room hotel, located within the Ruben's Hotel just across from the Buckingham Palace Mews.  It has the ambiance of a private club. The rooms and facilities are very nice and the location is perfect. What sets this hotel apart and made our stay very pleasant was quite simply the wonderful staff.  From our arrival to our departure the entire staff made our visit pleasant and enjoyable.  They provided excellent restaurant recommendations and tips on sightseeing. We would definitely return again.",5,2015,06,13
137,Impossible. ..,"It seems impossible to describe in words just how fabulous this hotel is.  From the moment you arrive,  you are treated as a special  guest.  Your favorite beverages are provided along with lovely appetizers.  The ""plunder the pantry"" option is the perfect way to end the evening.  Our room was spacious by London standards and furnished with every thing you might possibly need. The bathroom was quite spacious and light. 

I left the hotel less than a week ago and already I miss Stefan,  Mitchell, and Dickson!  Thanks for making our stay so grand! ",5,2015,06,11
137,In a League Of Its Own!,"So after 8 years of using Tripadvisor to give me all the best tips and information for all my trips without ever giving back to the TA community through reviews of my own, a hotel has finally come along that has given my lazy self no choice but to post.  

Hotel 41 is hands down the best hotel experience I have ever had.  Being a consultant, I have stayed at all the top branded 5 star properties and was truly blown away during my recent stay at Hotel 41 for my 1 yr anniversary. WOW! 

Many have said it before me, but what sets Hotel 41 apart is their remarkable client service.  Every single hotel staff you encounter will be dedicated to providing the best service they are able to and make it look so effortless.  From the minute I stepped into the doors until the minute I left I was blown away by the hospitality and the amazing attention to detail.  Here are the most memorable aspects:

1) The seamless check-in process which includes providing you a drink downstairs until someone comes to greet you and takes you up, champagne while actually checking in, and then a full personal walk-through of your room and all the amenities.  
2) Comfort within the room.  We were upgraded to a Junior Suite for our 1yr and was greated to personalized cake with message from hotel.  All ordered extras were also perfect and delivered on time throughout the trip.  Beds were the most comfortable I have ever had and V shaped pillows were magical. 
3) Attention to detail. - From the personalized preference form they e-mail you ahead of your stay, to holding doors open at the entrance when they are expecting you downstairs, to the very comfortable executive lounge, truly worth the extra $. 
5) Amazing location - 4 min walk from Victoria station and next to Buckingham Palace.
4) Amazing amazing hospitality - Stafanie, Gina, Remus, Monika to name a few but everyone was truly fantastic.  

Overall, was truly blown away and most importantly had the best anniversary I could have imagined.  Hotel 41 played a HUGE part.   I will definitely be back!",5,2015,06,11
137,An Outstanding Experience!,"Hotel 41 far exceeded my expectations!!  The staff was extremely helpful, the accommodations were beyond compare and the overall experience was more than worth the few extra dollars that it cost.  The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance of Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Parliament and many other sites.  I would stay there again.",5,2015,06,10
137,one of the best in London,this is so amazing. I really love it. the staffs are so professional. This is for the guests who love design and luxury style. facilities is so nice. I love everything about this hotel. I definitely come back here again soon.,5,2015,06,09
137,Wonderful Staff and Impeccable Service,"What a wonderful hotel. This is a real gem in London. It is the fifth floor of Ruben’s hotel (the converted ballroom), but it has its own private entrance and staff. We were a little concerned about the location (having previously stayed mainly in Kensington and Mayfair): it is close to Victoria Station, but also has another fine address close by in Buckingham Palace Road.  Although busy, the location was good, and it is only a few minutes’ walk to the underground. Our whole experience here was just perfect. From the time of arrival when you are met at the front door, whisked up the lift to the executive lounge where check-in is undertaken while drinking a lovely glass of champagne. Then escorted to your room where the luggage is already in place and a large bowl of fruit and bottles of water awaits. The hotel revolves around the executive lounge; it is the heart of the hotel and looks like a top class gentleman’s club of days gone by. In fact the whole hotel oozes with traditional woodwork, beautiful paintings, posters, and décor of something out of the 1920s, but with modern facilities. It is the executive lounge that drinks are served, cocktails made wonderfully well by Stephan, Dickson and Gina, who, with other colleagues, also serve a delicious breakfast in the mornings. There are snacks on hand during the day, and after 8pm, a delicious spread of food, all complimentary for that late night tipple after the theatre. At the front desk in the lounge, all is overseen by Monika (the assistant manager), Magda and Flo (and others whose names we can’t remember). This hotel is made perfect by the wonderful staff lead by Monika and her team. You are remembered by name, no need to sign checks for drinks, they know what you have had and the account on check-out was perfect. We felt like we were in a mansion being looked after by the most wonderful staff you could possibly imagine. The room (we had an Executive King) was a little on the smallish side but manageable, and the bathroom had a separate shower and bathtub. It would be very hard not to return to Hotel 41 when in London, it is very good value for money for a 5 star hotel, but it is the service and staff that will ensure we don’t go anywhere else in London.  Our many thanks for a wonderful stay go to Monika, Magda, Stephan, Dickson, Gina, Flo and the rest of the staff.",5,2015,06,08
137,Splendid! ! !,"The hotel is great!!!! I stayed for the second time and finally decided to give my review. Is one of those hotels that you don't mind what you'll pay at the end if the day. Because it deserves it all. Everything is so So SO amazing. The rooms,  the staff all the hotel areas and the location too. We were really glad that we had the chance to stay here again. We feel so lucky. That's what all the hotels should look and operate like. A stay will make you gain the same opinion. Thanks to the management and the staff for an unforgettable 2nd stay...!!!!",5,2015,06,08
137,Marvelous one week stay,We spent the last week of May at Hotel 41 and was thrilled with our stay. The service was impeccable and we enjoyed the cosy boutique atmosphere of the establishment. All the staff were extremely helpful and friendly and we felt like home. We were able to get last minute tickets for plays and restaurant reservation. It goes to show that what makes a great hotel is the ground staff who runs the premise. It is a hotel that we will certainly look forward to stay when we next visit London. ,5,2015,06,08
137,High quality throughout,"Had a great visit last week, my first stay.
Everything is just done to excellence. The rooms are absolute luxury as you would expect from a hotel of this rating. I will definitely be returning soon. The only thing I would do differently is stay longer.",5,2015,06,06
137,Simply the best hotel I have ever stayed in bar none!,"Without seeming to boast, I have stayed in some of the best hotels in over 45 countries and been blown away by a few, but nothing compares to 41. If like me you read the 'Terribles' first (Mostly for fun) you will understand that '41' is located on the 5th floor of the 'Rubens' hotel and has a separate entrance. No problem for us; in fact the uniqueness was intriguing and original which is always a good start. When you get to the lounge/reception, you enter a small club like environment and are welcomed by a choice of 4 champagnes whilst formalities are swiftly dealt with. You feel immediately welcome and individual.

You are looked after by genuine, engaging people (I cannot bring myself to call them staff) who really care that you enjoy your stay. If you are looking for the spa complex, big reception area, huge buffet breakfast and a choice of 4 bars then stay somewhere else. If you are looking for perfect refined service from interetsing people, and stunning rooms with linens to die for and original inspired decor then you must try 41.

Had we got the room we booked we would have be delighted, the fact we were upgraded to the best room in the hotel was totally unexpected. Yes it was a special occasion (25th anniversary) but the surpassed what I would regard a 'Normal' upgrade. They were genuinely pleased to be part of our special occasion. 

I could go on, but you get the picture. We loved it!",5,2015,06,03
137,Magic Stay in London,"Just spent a magical 4 days in London at Hotel 41. From the very moment we crossed the threshold of the property, special moment after special moments were created. Mr. Hendry and his team were welcoming and so accommodating with every request. We celebrated my birthday and our Anniversary on this trip which was noted by the team in so may ways. Room upgrade, sweet birthday treats in the room, romantic rose petal turn down. WOW, WOW. Do not hesitate to book your stay here. After staying in many luxury hotels, I can honestly say that this was by far the best hotel stay ever. Looking forward to staying here and other Red Carnation properties. ",5,2015,06,02
137,My stay,Fantastic staff service hotel food quality everything we could of wished for and a surprise to us an upgrade just a delight I want to go back.the staff where exceptionally professional.  Kind attentive a joy to stay in this hotel,5,2015,05,31
137,Just perfect,"We stayed for only one night and I didn't want to leave!

It was a special occasion, 10 years since our first date and my husbands birthday and it was absolutely worth every single penny.

The team who work at Hotel 41 are lovely, attentive and unobtrusive.  The hotel is gorgeous with the executive lounge being at the heart of the hotel.  The snack bar/raid the pantry is a lovely touch and very nice to nibble on whilst you have a glass of wine/champagne sitting (or curled up like I was!) comfortably on one of the sofas. 

The room was perfect, sumptuous and relaxing and the turndown service was just lovely - lots of little touches that make it memorable.

I didn't want to leave and a huge 'thank you' to the team for making our stay so special.  We will be back!",5,2015,05,31
137,Anniversary Trip,"The hotel had such a welcoming atmosphere! Sure it is a smaller hotel but we felt that added to it's charm and uniqueness. We have only nice things to say about this hotel. It was our favorite by far during our 3 week trip. (We also visited Paris, Venice, and Rome). There is no other hotel that comes close to the personalized service you will get at Hotel 41. We will definitely stay here in the future and highly recommend it!",5,2015,05,29
137,Pure indulgence,"Well what can I say except this hotel is amazing. We chose this hotel to spend our honeymoon and we were both completely blown away.

On arrival we were met and taken to the Executive Lounge to check in, during this time we were asked which champagne we would like to have whilst checking in. The atmosphere was relaxed and we had another glass and some snacks before being taken to our room.

Our room was sensational, everything was of an extremely high standard, could not fault a thing!! Truly perfect!!

We had asked for afternoon tea at 3pm,  we were both looking forward to it and again it exceeded our expectations, in fact we couldn't  finish all the cakes, so they kindly put them in a box for later!

The staff are all exceptional; they are both professional and friendly, we truly felt welcome by everyone.  In fact it really did feel like a home from home.",5,2015,05,28
137,Spoil yourself ,"We stayed 3 nights in April.
Everything that has been said in previous reviews is true.
The hotel is 5 star but difference is the number of rooms. With only 60 people staying in house at any one time the staff have the time to stop and talk and to help in any small way they can.
Nothing is too much trouble and make sure that you have high tea one afternoon.
It is fantastic. ",5,2015,05,28
137,i can't imagine a better hotel !,"This is simply the best hotel you Can imagine. Everybody is so friendly and unbelievable friendly. Noting you ask is to much. The decoration and look of the hotel is beautiful. Our room was very big for London standards. The executive lounge is so comfortable , with al the free snacks and delicious cocktails. Lamine makes the best Mai Tais ever ! I had about 8 of them en Lamine was my new best friend ;-)
This was our sixth hotel in London but from now on we will keep coming back here because you get the feelings that al the staff are your friends en we miss them already :-).",5,2015,05,26
137,An incredibly impressive hotel,"We first stayed in 41 a few years ago and experienced a level of service far beyond anything we had previously encountered, we had a wonderful stay and enjoyed every moment.  Naturally for our next London stay we chose 41 but I can remember being worried that our first visit was a 'one off' and that we could possibly be disappointed, amazingly it just seemed to be even better which I thought would be impossible.......we have recently returned from our fifth stay and this hotel never fails to impress, this latest stay was just amazing. As always upon arrival we were warmly greeted, Monika ( who is lovely and extremely good at her job) booked us in making sure we had everything we needed . Then as always the service was excellent from everyone, I'm sorry not to be able to remember all the names but I do remember Stefan and Gina who both were great. We are great fans of the Red Carnation Hotels, we have stayed in the Milestone and have had meals in the Acorn and Summer Lodge which are near to us in Dorset , every experience has been outstanding. I don't know how Red Carnation manage to keep such a consistently high standard but can only imagine its a combination of good staff selection, excellent staff training and good staff conditions, something I'm sure a lot of businesses could learn from. Our favourite remains 41 which fully deserves to be number one on trip advisor.",5,2015,05,24
137,wonderfuuuuul!!!,travelling to london was an experience of a lifetime! wonderfull place!! hotel 41 is the perfect hotel in order to have the best accomondation! we stayed there  week and we had one fore free!! it was the best choice i ever had!!!,5,2015,05,23
137,Very disappointed,This hotel did not live up to our expectations at all. We stayed here for three nights based on it being number 1 on TripAdvisor but I'm sorry fellow travellers and reviewers I just don't understand how the hotel gets the rating.  We stayed in a junior suite with an unnecessary television room downstairs. The bathroom was tiny and the room felt cramped and uncomfortable. I emailed staff prior to our stay on a weekend but because they were only working during the week didn't get a response for two days. Whilst there we asked staff to book a restaurant for us for lunch the next day at 12.30pm  only to turn up and find out the booking had not been made. When we returned to the room a couple of hours later we were called by staff to let us know they couldn't get us in at 12.30 but had made a 2.30pm booking for us which we were surprised about because the restaurant was actually able to accomodate us at 12.30pm. I asked staff to book me a hairdresser appointment closeby one day only to find out the booking had been made for me a 10minute cab ride away - not very convenient. The only good thing about the hotel was the champagne on arrival & food available in the 'communal' lounge room at any time. Sorry but we won't be returning.,3,2015,05,23
137,Highly Recommended,"Amazing place, good food, nice staff and beautiful location. Unfortunately we stayed here only a night and all we wanted was to stay here more. They recommended a sightseeing tour to us which was a good idea. The laundry is fast and efficient. The service always came with a smile. The beds are very comfortable and pillows are very soft. We were a group of four stay here in two interconnected rooms. We did not eat here but I am sure that they serve excellent food as their menu looks very promising.  It is good value of money at the same time a nice retreat for a much needed break.",5,2015,05,22
137,Best Hotel Service Ever,"Our recent visit to Hotel 41 in London was nothing short of amazing. From the moment we arrived we immediately felt at home due to the absolutely incredible hotel staff that went out of the way to make sure our stay was a splendid one. From the front desk staff to the lounge and dining (Stefan had some wonderful stories and we miss him already) everything was world class. The rooms were spacious and quiet and had all the amenities one could possibly need. Next time you visit London please do yourself a favor and have the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41, you will be happy you did!",5,2015,05,22
137,5 Star Luxsury with the feel of a B&B,I could not add much to all of the wonderful reviews of this Hotel. It is finds like this property that make Trip Advisor so great. They truly are a trusted source. We are a well traveled couple and this might have been one of the most comfortable experiences for us ever. I have never felt more welcomed or comfortable at a hotel. There was not anything we asked for that was not provide with an incredible sense of pleasure to be of service. The staff to guest ratio is incredible. The rooms are not large but very comfortable and well appointed. We had reserved a suite but we're also upgraded to a slightly larger suit with 2 full bathrooms. That was a real plus. If you want the big hotel experience this is not the place for you. If you want the very best personal service that you have ever experienced the Hotel 41 is absolutely a very high recommendations. ,5,2015,05,18
137,THE best hotel in London,"My third visit to 41 and the most special yet.  Having saved up over the last few months, we booked the Conservatory Suite, A Night under the Stars.  We arrived early at around 12 noon and were welcomed in her usual wonderful way by Lauren in the Executive Lounge.  A glass of rose champagne started of our luxurious visit and we decided to stay in the lounge to have a light lunch before leaving for the theatre.  As our suite was not ready for us (which we knew that it wouldn't be) we were offered a courtesy room to get refreshed.  We returned after seeing ""Gypsy"" at the Savoy Theatre (thoroughly recommend it) and, after arranging with Remus what time we would like to go up on the roof, were shown to our suite.  The ground level had been converted into a small dining area for our pre-booked tasting dinner and we were then taken upstairs to the most amazing bedroom with the glass conservatory roof.  Beautifully laid out with flowers, fresh fruit and some sweet nibbles - and the bathroom (with jacuzzi bath and separate shower) was just amazing.  Being a sunny day the room was extremely warm, however the air conditioning was on and did help a bit.  Special conservatory glass to control the heat would probably be a good addition, however the room is just so special.
After settling in, the wonderful Dilkson arrived to talk about dinner and both he and the executive chef, Nelson, produced the most perfect meal and wines we could have wished for. Exemplary service.
Following our dessert, Remus took us up to the roof to look over London.  What could have been difficult evening for me (the first anniversary of my mum passing away) was handled so thoughtfully by Remus.  We toasted my mum with champagne at exactly 9.20pm - she would have loved it.  Such a special experience that I will never forget.
The rest of the evening and luxurious lie in in the morning, followed by a delicious breakfast, were perfect.  
Thank you to all of the team at 41 - every single one of you makes 41 what it is - unique, caring and thoughtful.  A lot of other hotels could learn a lot from 41.",5,2015,05,18
137,Amazing !,"Wanted to treat ourselves to a great hotel in London for a couple of days, and picked the 41. Did not regret it for one second ! Was given a royal treatment from the moment we stepped inside this beautiful property. At the check-in counter we were offered a glass of champagne, we ended up emptying a bottle waiting for our room (we came with an early flight, so the 41 not to blame for the wait) All members of the staff very friendly and helping us with all our needs. Free afternoon snack very welcome after a long day walking in not too comfy boots ! Second night when we came back the room was turned into a romantic haven with rose pedals and candle-lights - adorable ! The heart of the hotel is a combined reception, bar and eating area that works very well. Our room was spacious (executive double) with décor fitting the rest of the hotel perfectly. For people that are used to, and prefer huge hotel receptions and big spaces, this hotel is not for them. But for the other of us that can gladly live in smaller, comfy and cozy hotels - 41 are at the top of my list !",5,2015,05,17
137,Amazing place,"This hotel is just wow, on arrival I got the warmest welcome from reception and given the lowdown on the building and surrounding areas. My room was nice and spacious and extremely comfy. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, I am pretty sure if I had asked for a dancing elephant with bells on it they would have tried their hardest to accomodate it. Seriously tho my stay in London was made perfect to the whole team here and I will be back. Oh I must mention, the whiskey I was given (I had to wait a few mins for check in) was absolutely stunning, I wish I had asked what it was.",5,2015,05,17
137,Absolutely the best hotel. Hands down,"I join the THOUSANDS of happy reviewers who think this was an experience unlikely to be repeated elsewhere. And along with everyone else not that the staff made this great. How did they find these people? I have never felt so taken care of !
You feel like you are part of an exclusive secret club, there isn't even a sign for the hotel outside.
My mother and I were in 4103 with a view over towards Buckingham Palace, but despite being on the main road the room was silent.
Interesting bonus feature: they have instant hot water and amazing water pressure. This may sound like a weird thing to compliment, but after 10 days in Italy with wimpy showers this was heavenly.
I learned from a previous reviewer to check with Costco Travel and this turned out to be GREAT advice! The bonus add ons: airport transfers, Tour credit (I think it was $300), dinner out, full tea, wifi, breakfast. This really adds up to major savings.
As to the tour... we did the 'historic London' bus tour which was HORRIBLE. Chose something else!! Also our return to airport transport never showed up. We waited an hour before going with UBER. The desk gal was amazing, she called the tour company (which also did the transfers) 10 times and felt horrible although it was totally not their fault. Bottom line: Avoid Golden Tours
Next trip to London I will be right back on their doorstep!!!",5,2015,05,14
137,Outstanding!! ,"Another amazing visit to the 41!  There just isn't a finer spot to stay if you value outstanding customer service. The room was absolutely stunning and the use of the private club lounge is unparalleled. The 41 team even arranged a private rooftop champagne viewing of the VE Day flyover.  

There is a reason this place is ranked the top.  They work very hard for it and it shows. 
",5,2015,05,14
137,A haven from the hustle and bustle of London.,I hope the staff at 41 realise how much their attention to their customers and the thoughtful detail to what is provided is appreciated. When one spends much of ones life looking after others needs it is so good to be look after in such a caring way for two days oneself. Thank you all at 41.,5,2015,05,14
137,Simply the best!!,"I stayed at this hotel for 1 night and loved it. Everything from the personal welcome on arrival, to the complimentary drinks and snacks, and the amazing 'executive lounge', was excellent. Hotel 41 is very well located across the street from Buckingham Palace and 1 block from the underground station, making it a great place to explore London. The hotel feels small and personal, and the staff are incredible friendly, attentive knowledgeable and courteous. Our room was wonderful with an extremely comfortable bed and a huge bath plus separate walk-in shower. All the staff went out of their way to make sure there was nothing lacking, incredibly attentive, knowledgeable and courteous. The breakfast was delivered into our room at agreed time; it was absolutely delicious (you must try the pancakes!). We will not be staying anywhere else on future trips to London and can't wait to return ASAP",5,2015,05,12
137,Excellent service as usual.,"I have had the pleasure of staying at 41 on a number of occasions now and the level of hospitality is always excellent.

It's quite important to understand what this hotel is, and what it is not when looking to book.

This is not a large hotel with statement lobby and public areas, spa, gym and restaurants on site. There are plenty of other 5 stars options in London to meet these requirements.

This is a place to walk around in your slippers, a cross between  a private club and your own home with exceptional hospitality. Perfect for my own needs.

There is still some building work going on in the area which can be a little intrusive so it's best to check the very latest situation with the hotel. I did comment on the noise level and Moniker acted immediately to remove some accommodation charge from my bill, as she was disappointed not to exceed my expectations. This is hospitality to be proud of.

I love this hotel but will check the latest build situation prior to my next stay.",5,2015,05,11
137,#1 Hotel in London Exceeds Expectations,"I stayed here for 3 nights and I had a group of 9 people booked on this trip (we had 9 rooms). Customer service is their mantra! From the moment we walked in to the moment we checked out, every single detail, things you don't even think of, were taken care of. You can call room service for coffee and it was pretty much at your room before you even hung up the phone.

Room: the size of the room isn't large but much larger than you would expect being in prime location across the Royal Mews. Very clean, orderly and the most comfortable bed and pillows I've experienced in a while.

Food: quality of food and the service at the lounge was great. I really enjoyed their breakfast. 

Executive Lounge: this is where you come to relax, eat, drink or have a quiet chat. This lounge was the second highlight (second only to their superior service). Always stocked with fresh snacks, drinks and ice cream.

Our group is extremely impressed with this hotel and have nothing negative to say. We thank the entire staff of Hotel 41 and a special thanks to Lauren who made us feel welcome at all times. ",5,2015,05,10
137,"Small size, great service and comfort","This gem across from the Royal Mews offers first class service from all the staff, top to bottom.  No question or request is too small.  Our room, though not large, was luxurious and had every thoughtful amenity, and the bath with large tub and large shower was elegantly fitted out.  Highly recommended if you love a small, quiet hotel with top notch personal service.",5,2015,05,09
137,Superb again,"There is a reason why this is the best hotel in London, the staff. Every member of staff from the concierge to the maintenance man offers the unobtrusive excellence in customer service that other larger establishments can only dream of. Our second visit, this time for my birthday, last year was for my husbands birthday, I cannot recommend Hotel 41 highly enough and we are already planning next years visit",5,2015,05,09
137,Simply the Best,"We have stayed at 41 for a number of years now on our frequent trips to London. This boutique luxury hotel is a gem.   Quite simply the best at personal service, atmosphere, and luxury.  Mr. Hendry's staff raises the bar on service to levels rarely experienced in any field these days.  The rooms are unique due to the nature of the building, and some reviews commenting upon size are unfair. The architecture, decor, and feel is that of London.  This is not a large property, and the small number of rooms allow for an intimate feeling of a personal club.  The staff focus on your personal wishes with discrete service that exceeds all expectations.  Every need is attended with professionalism and friendliness.  We can't wait to return!",5,2015,05,08
137,"Excellent service,ambience & anticipation","I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. I cant speak highly enough of the staff & their anticipation of my needs. Being a single middle aged traveller I was looked after incredibly well. The staff seemed to anticipate what I needed & action it to make such a wonderful stay. From the beautiful breakfasts to the liesurely late afternoon drinks in the lounge, everything was perfect.
The rooms are very comfortable & to return after a busy day, to sliced lemon, lime, olives & a bucket of ice & fresh water bottles was just brilliant.Just nothing was too much trouble, the best discreet, friendly service I have ever encountered at some of the finest hotels. Congratulations to the staff & management for making my stay such a wonderful experience.",5,2015,05,03
137,A relaxing oasis in busy London,"We recently stayed four nights at Hotel 41. When we travel we usually do not spend much time in our hotel, but the care and friendly attention we received at ""41"" enticed us to return each day.  The staff is outstanding (thank you Malcolm, Lauren, Monika and everyone whose name I cannot remember) and they all deserve the rave reviews they have received from other guests.  Every question, request or whim is treated seriously and responded to immediately.  After a long day of travel to London it was delightful to be offered a glass of chilled champagne while our bags were taken to our room.  Our executive king room was roomy (particularly for a European city hotel), comfortable, and extremely quiet.  The location between Buckingham Palace (across the street) and Victoria Station (5 minute walk) was excellent.  We received good advice on transportation options for our day trips, and excellent recommendations for nearby restaurants. Our next trip to London, there is no doubt in my mind that we will return to visit our new friends at Hotel 41.",5,2015,05,01
137,We very much liked this hotel,"We recently had the pleasure of spending three nights at Hotel 41.  The hotel is very well located across the street from Buckngham Palace.  The service could not have been better and the staff was friendy and very accomodating.  We give this ony 4 stars because of the size of the room, and the lack of a lobby at street level, but we would highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again when we return to London.",4,2015,04,30
137,The Mini Moon of our dreams,"My new husband and I wanted to spend a couple of special days together immediately after our Christmas Wedding (December 2014). London was our choice and we were given many recommendations from friends but we really wanted to stay at a boutique hotel and found some great reviews for 41. How could we resist 'the most romantic hotel in London'?
Our two nights at 41 were the highlight of our year and the most fantastic stay we've ever had at a hotel. The most perfect way to start our married life together. My husband and I were blown away by the wonderful service and attention to detail, from every single member of staff. We were addressed by name by everyone at all times and the welcome was lovely, with a glass of champagne. Nothing was too much trouble. We loved how the staff were so genuine and passionate about making us feel special. Had we realised we could bring our dog too, we would have!
We booked a mid range room to splash out with the Romantic Turn Down option (which was beautifully presented) - a special treat for the mini moon. We were so overcome when the Receptionist surprised us with a room upgrade as a honeymoon treat. The Conservatory Room was exceptional and the little details blew us away. I could not contain my excitement!
Special thanks to Magdalena, Lauren & Johann, who made our stay so perfect and looked after us so well. We will never forget it and hope to return for another special occasion!
I highly recommend this stunningly beautiful boutique hotel for a special occasion. You will not be disappointed.",5,2015,04,30
137,Nothing short of perfection,"Can I add anything to the excellent reviews already provided? No, not really but I feel that I am obliged to share our excellent stay with those who might be considering staying at the 41 - consider no further and go for it. You are very welcome there, genially welcome. Some of the rooms might be a bit on the small side (ours was great) but very well appointed and cater to needs you didn´t know you had. The staff is the best you come around in the hospitality business - nothing is to much ask, and by some miracle they manage to exceed the high expectations one has after reading the reviews. I read a small booklet they have on the RCH and as I understand the founder is very keen on her guests feeling special and happy about their stay. Well, Mrs Tollman, if you read this (which I understand you sometimes do) you can be very proud  of your team at the 41. I usually do not sign up for loyalty-programs, as I love to ""shop around"" when it comes to traveling (which we often do, both for business and pleasure), however as for London I need not look further and will most defiantly  sign up. We will be keeping the 41 for special occasions, but the RCH in London also have great properties catering for families and business. I look forward to visiting them in the very near future.  (Extra-tip - pick up the excellent book ""Life in Food"" by Mrs. Tollman, I read it while there but forgot to buy one on check-out.)",5,2015,04,29
137,top notch,"the attention is 5 star really, everything about this is pure class, it embraces the experience of the city inside its walls, the staff takes care of every detail and are really helpful, the rooms are stunning as well.",5,2015,04,25
137,Top Class,"So glad we chose to stay here it really is fantastic ,service is brilliant very kind and highly professional. Don't bother going elsewhere ,it's almost like having your own private stylish London residence in town. Excellent all round",5,2015,04,24
137,Excellent Service and Great Location,"We were not familiar with this gem of a hotel when we booked it but they exceeded our expectations!  The entire staff including Monica, Remus, Gina, Julianna & Norbert to name a few made us feel at home during our stay.  The little details such as warm towels, turndown service, great snacks in the lounge as well as the service, location and attention to every need made us sad when it was time to leave.  We felt like family at this wonderful property.  The last minute assistance with theater tickets which were hand delivered to me, made me feel special and appreciated.  Thanks to the team at Hotel 41, our first London visit will not be our last!  Tom S",5,2015,04,23
137,Unbelievable service!,"Based on the No. 1 rating on Trip Advisor, we decided to stay here for a few days following my wife's 50th birthday rather than fly abroad. We had very high expectations but these were not only met but exceeded on many occasions.
We have never received service that is so good and so sincere anywhere else. I can only liken this to staying at the home of a  good friend who goes out of their way to make you feel comfortable and welcome in their home.
There were so many things that made this special. From the time we arrived and were offered a choice of champagne from the champagne trolley to the time we checked out and were offered bottles of water for the journey as it was hot,  we were made to feel very special. We were surprised that a member of staff who we spoke to when we checked in had remembered the next evening we had said we were going to see the Wicked musical and wished us a pleasant evening and hoped we would enjoy the show. We were absolutely amazed when we returned to find a signed photograph from some of the cast in the show waiting in our room!
The lounge that is the hub of this hotel is very comfortable and relaxing and the range of complimentary snacks and food is of the highest order.
We will certainly return here again, this an experience not to be missed!",5,2015,04,22
137,deserve to be treated like royalty,"Hotel 41 in London is an experience that everyone needs to have once in a lifetime if not many times over. The staff treated each and every person with high respect and made your stay feel like home. Each staff member knew your name and always asked about our days adventures. 
Staying in the Conservatory Suite was amazing. We thank the staff for the roses, lit candles and rose petals on our return one evening - so romantic. We Will be back!",5,2015,04,19
137,Amazing stay in London,"Little did I know that this trip was the trip my now husband was going to propose on. This hotel is in an amazing location and the service was incredible! Extremely comfortable rooms, and the staff was very helpful with making recommendations and getting reservations for dinner, theater etc. I definitely want to stay here again when I come back to London.",5,2015,04,18
137,Distinctly average,"This is not a 5 star hotel. I don't understand why it's so highly rated. We came here for our anniversary based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews but I was really disappointed. It is VERY small and very dark; the lobby, the lift, the rooms... small enough to claustrophobic. The lounge is a nice respite from all the closed in dark spaces but still too small for me to properly relax. No pool, no spa, no gym...  The staff are very helpful - really lovely even, but this is just not a 5 star hotel.",3,2015,04,17
137,home-away-from-home,"Our second visit here. We just love this little gem. The location is great. The staff and all the special touches adds to making this our first choice when staying in London.
A beautiful lounge area, here you can find the best cuppa with all kinds of treats during the day. Breakfast is wonderful too.",5,2015,04,16
137,James Bond Might Hang His Hat Here,"We were in London for business and we started our stay at a traditional hotel in Chelsea for several days....deciding to upgrade our experience the final three days at Hotel 41.  This is the hotel for you if you seek top-notch service, elegant surroundings, and a central location for sightseeing. If it wasn't so pleasurable, it might be embarrassing to have so many staff members so warmly intent at meeting your every wish. As an example, we were enjoying a glass of champagne in the candle-lit lounge when I accidentally tipped over my champagne glass, breaking it and giving me a tiny cut in the process.  Within 60 seconds, our tabletop had been cleaned, I had a new glass of champagne in my hand, and I was wearing a bandage on my finger.  It was such a whirl of activity, I can't even tell you how many people took care of the situation. We've traveled the world and this hotel will make our top five list for the ambiance, service, and overall quality of experience.",5,2015,04,16
137,A hidden gem of London!,"The service at this hotel was the best I've experienced in Britain. Every staff member called me by name and were extremely friendly and polite. I had a wonderful experience at this hotel.  The hotel location was excellent, the rooms were nice and my overall experience was wonderful.",5,2015,04,15
137,My FAVORITE Hotel ever!,"We travel a lot and stay at lots of great places but this is the BEST experience I can remember having.  If you like to cruise and know the personal attention you receive from your attendants - this is similar.  The staff is amazing and couldn't do enough to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.  From the all day ""snack bar"" and drinks to rose petals and lit candles in our room - I can't think of one more thing they could have done.  I especially liked how even the tv remote and remote to the fireplace were in plastic sleeves marked sanitized.  They even have snacks packed for you to take with you on your long day tours.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone.  Wifi and breakfast every day made me feel like I wasn't getting charged for every incidental.  Hi Tea is a must if you haven't experienced it yet.  Simply wonderful!",5,2015,04,15
137,The best hotel ever!!,"Everything is amazing at Hotel 41 - very professional, attentive and friendly members of staff, perfect service, great room and executive loundge, complimentary drink on arrival and complimentary food all day long and very personalised sevice full of surprises!! Thank you so much for making us feel so special - Stéphanie and Olivier",5,2015,04,12
137,Another outstanding visit,"We stayed at the Hotel 41 three years ago and decided to return for another family vacation based on the fantastic service we had the last time.  I did not think it was possible that they could have exceeded our previous experience...but they did!  Monika, Florent, and the entire staff bent over backwards to make sure we had a wonderful holiday in London.   They truly pampered us and went out of their way to accommodate any request we had.  I can not say enough about this great boutique hotel in a prime area of the city.",5,2015,04,10
137,Exceptional,"We have never written a review on TA before; however, we felt that the fantastic experience we had at Hotel 41 was worth sharing. After being escorted to check –in, the staff were polite and friendly, affording us with their undivided attention. Prior to arrival we had put on our preferences form that our little stay at the hotel was a “mini-moon”, in response to this information the staff informed us that we would receive a complimentary upgrade to a suite, which was unexpected and a lovely surprise. The glasses of champagne that were served before going to our room enhanced the experience further. 

The trip continued in this manner…

Both the Executive Lounge and the suite were immaculately clean and well-presented. The suite was wonderfully spacious and the two bathrooms really felt quite opulent. The turn over service was discreet and completed to a high standard. On the Tuesday evening, we had arranged for the romantic turn-down, which was really quite beautiful. 

Room service was efficient and quick. The reception staff gladly arranged a reservation at a local restaurant and throughout our entire stay, they remained attentive. We were never left waiting and the staff really couldn’t do enough for us. 

Breakfast choices were varied and plentiful, added to that the “Plunder the Pantry” facility was fantastic. 

Overall, I feel my superlatives don’t really do the trip justice; whilst it is an expensive treat, we will definitely be returning and we have no hesitation recommending this hotel.",5,2015,04,10
137,"Wow, Wow, Wow amazing","Hotel 41 where do I start?
Check in- 10/10 superb a complimentary glass of bubbles
Room -10/10 was given an upgrade words can not  describe how lovely that was, fresh fruit, water, robes, slippers, everything you could possible want.
The hotel offers complimentary drinks between 6-8pm the service is fantastic and your glass is never empty. 
The complimentary food is fantastic so much to choose from hot and cold with deserts choices as well, again the service is second to none.
The lounge area is very relaxing, with free wifi, papers magazines everything you could wish for,
We were celebrating a very special occasion and when we returned to the room, there were candles lit, rose petals scattered around the room, soft music playing and a celebration cake provided, we certainly didn't expect this.
Breakfast -10/10 again the service is simply the best, nothing is too much trouble and the food is fab highly recommend the pancakes not good for the waist line.
Check out 10/10 again very efficient and nothing to query with the bill.
We left our luggage there for the rest of the day, on our return we were given a complimentary glass of bubbly and some food from the pantry which was very welcoming and certainly not expected, they remembered our names and made us feel very welcome even though we were leaving, I could have stayed a few more days .
I think to sum up it my husband said "" we always holiday in Dubai where the service is superb but this hotel has certainly exceeded those levels "" what a compliment. I highly recommend this hotel for couples, single travellers, but would not recommend for children. 
Location is good only a few mins walk from Buckingham Palace  and a very short walk away a lovely selection of shops.",5,2015,04,10
137,Wow -  A place I recommend to  friends,"When I stay in London, I stay at Hotel 41 - right across from Buckingham Palace. The staff is always excellent, they always help me get the best play tickets as well as dinner reservations at great restaurants. The rooms are spacious and cozy lounge is a great place to unwind after a busy day in the city. I have found the location to be excellent, coupled with excellent staff this is place in London I recommend to friends.",5,2015,04,08
137,Amazing Service,"Spent the Eastern week end (3 nights) at the 41. 
Fantastic service in a very cosy atmosphere. 
The concierge booked us different London restaurant reservation with great attention and professionalism.
I went to run with one of the team member who guided me in the different parks. The team has always a lot of attention for the guests. 
Can only recommand it.
Very weel located close to buckingham.",5,2015,04,07
137,Great customer service,"We were welcomed at door step and led to check in at the counter. Got a free champagne as the welcome drink. Room looks lovely and very clean. Traditional english style. First time received notes about the weather for the next day and recommendation of places to visit. Felt very good to see these little things done by the hotel. Well done! Staffs are very friendly and attentive, but for couples like my husband and I, we didn't really enjoy the attention. Overall, good quality room and service! Location is good too as we walk to most places for touristy visits.",4,2015,04,06
137,"In a world of fine hotels, this one stands out as one of the very best.","To celebrate a special birthday, a small group of friends traveled to London leaving husbands and families behind in the US.  I travel worldwide regularly for work.   To say that this was the finest service I have ever experienced is an understatement.  It is almost impossible to describe.    More important than the actual service was the sincerity expressed by the entire staff.  From the daily pillow choices, to the thought and attention to every detail- large or tiny- nothing was left to chance.   I would imagine leaders of countries do not  experience this type of attention and comfort.   Hotel 41 is a gem.  I will be back.

137,"Superb, attentive staff make hotel 41 magic","From the champagne reception to numerous other personal touches which went above and beyond our expectations, the  staff really make hotel 41 a special place to stay. We went away for a romantic night away and it was perfect. Thoroughly recommend this place and worth  every penny",5,2015,04,02
137,The best hotel experience I've ever had,"Once you stay at the 41, you will never want to stay anywhere else. Lovely rooms, impeccable service, all wants and needs cared for graciously.  The hotel took care of every dinner reservation, and provided a beautiful birthday experience for my daughter. A true gem. You will not be disappointed. ",5,2015,04,02
137,Above and Beyond,"I can't accurately describe the level of service that 41 provides for all its guests. From pots of tea on demand to your choice of pillows and almost any amenity imaginable in your room, you truly feel like there is nothing that they will not do to make you happy.

I loved being able to raid the pantry after a late night to get either small snacks like pasta or stew, or deserts and cocktails.",5,2015,04,01
137,"Marvellous value, all round brilliance!","I visited here with my niece and her husband last week and have to say that our experience was utterly faultless. We dined too. The staff make you feel like family from the offset and although they are clearly doing their jobs - by god they do it well. They really do go the extra mile. It's smiles all round and the rooms are just immaculate. We stayed for 2 nights in 2 rooms and I can honestly say we could've eaten our meals from the floor. I have frequented a few hotels in London at the upper end of the market, some of which are (or were about 4/5 years back) thriving on outdated and unjustified reputations. This one takes the prize. It's absolutely brilliant in every way. Food, service, room service (prompt and friendly) value and well, I just love it. Will without a doubt visit again.",5,2015,03,31
137,Its really nice.,"Probably the best hotel so far that I visited in London. Like in other boutique hotels the rooms are not too large, but this was big enough for a pleasant stay of one night. Everything is really top of the line. Especially the lounge is nice. Just great. Will come back. Maybe this tells everyone what kind of standard to expect: In the room was a questionnaire ""how did we manage? If you did not give us a 10 (maximum) what can we do better to earn it?""
Got it? thats the level to expect. Better stop praising this, otherwise the prices will climb more....",5,2015,03,31
137,Best hotel in London!,"When we first arrived at this hotel, I was a little leery because there was no lobby. The concierge is the first person you meet in a tiny little corridor. I was thinking to myself, what are we getting ourselves into!? We were taken upstairs to a lovely room where people were enjoying their breakfast. This room serves as the place to go for all of your dining needs. Great appetizers (complementary) at night and a nice selection of wines. You will not go hungry, their pantry is always stocked!

As we were getting checked in they offered us champaign. We were there very early from an overnight flight and they were able to accommodate us with a room immediately. We were so thankful. I can't say enough about the customer service. Every single person working there knew our names and were so friendly!

The rooms were comfortable. The bed was great as well as the nice size bathroom. The location is outstanding! You are a block from the train station and underground. You are also blocks from Buckingham Palace. This is a wonderful boutique hotel in which we will definitely stay again! I am thankful for TripAdvisor because I don't think I would have ever found this gem on my own!!",5,2015,03,30
137,Perfection!,"My 12 yr. old granddaughter and I stayed at Hotel 41 for 4 nights in the Balmoral Suites.
The staff could NOT have been more helpful and caring...Knew our names, what we liked.. when I asked a question the staff - not only had an answer but - immediately took care of it. eg., what time to the Hop On, Hop off busses start?  The staff person offered to get us tickets. Time and time again this helpfulness happened.. I've traveled the world (135 countries)  and this is THE BEST hotel I've ever stayed in - for service.",5,2015,03,29
137,Not just raising the bar - consistently holding it high,"I'm a huge fan of Red Carnation hotels. If you want quintessential British with all the trimmings then no other luxury hotel chain does it so well - without kicking up a fuss. Many people (even Londoners) have never heard of places like Hotel 41, The Milestone or The Chesterfield. They are consistently in the top slots on Trip Advisor. Not because they are high tech bling or 'in' but because they have nailed it will brilliant staff who have been trained in the fine art of customer service. Red Carnation hotels aren't cheap but if you seek consistent quality , look no further. Hotel 41 has a button on the bedroom phoned marked 'anything, anytime'. It just about sums up the ethos of the entire Red Carnation business",5,2015,03,29
137,Fantastic,"I can't praise this place too much. It epitomises going the extra mile. The location, room and general ambience were excellent, however it was the staff who really made the experience special. Nothing was too much trouble and their attention to detail was faultless.",5,2015,03,29
137,Unlike any other london hotel,This is a remarkable hotel......just a door off the street...no reception......booking in is accompliced in the executive lounge ....while relaxing and slurping a fine champagne ...the room ..the food are superb ...the attention to detail reminds me more of a far eastern hotel than  the normal london venue...then we get to the staff ...fantastic....my last word...just go,5,2015,03,29
137,Outstanding!!!,We stayed for just the one night for our anniversary. I was really looking forward to coming to the Hotel as the reviews are superb. They did did not disappoint.It was outstanding. I have not experienced service like this in a hotel in the UK. From the champagne when we arrived to the room upgrade I just loved the whole experience. Thank you to all the staff who made it very special. We will be coming back.,5,2015,03,27
137,Unforgettable Stay,"I had booked this hotel to propose my other half. I contacted the hotel several months in advance to see if they could assist me with arranging the music, roses, get our favorite champagne in the room and deal with numerous other details I was trying to get together. Their response from the start was amazing - every single thing was exactly how I had hoped for. They went for that extra mile by putting together a sound system that worked for my music - they didn't have this in place initially.

We got upgraded to a stunning room that was on two levels, had a lovely sitting area downstairs with a fire place and then bedroom and bathroom upstairs. Very large, super-comfy bed and two separate showers & large bath tub.

When we returned in the evening they had set everything ready as agreed - and more. My other half had no idea about this. When he stepped in the room there were candles everywhere, our song playing (absolutely spot-on timing!), fire on, roses and petals covering the room, hot bubble bath was ready with rose petals in... the bottle of the champagne I had delivered a week earlier was in a beautiful free-standing bucket, there were chocolate-covered strawberries... Oh wow just remembering all that gives me shivers!

Needless to say he said yes and was so impressed with all this - and so was I!

The breakfast was delivered into our room at agreed time, it was absolutely delicious (you must try the pancakes!), great coffee and big English.
Also their afternoon tea (I believe this is done at Rubens next door but nevertheless) is outstanding. Free flow of champagne to wash it down with too.

There is so much that happened and they did for us during our 2-night stay that I cannot even put everything here, however I am sure you get the picture.
Yes, it costs you an arm and a leg but I can honestly say that this is the best hotel I have stayed at, so personal, unique and beautiful. For special occasions like this it is absolutely worth it.

Thank you X",5,2015,03,27
137,Best stay in the heart of London,"We were spending a weekend i London, and Hotel 41 was a perfect choice both because of its location and the ""boutique"" interior. We were welcome with the glass of champagne by the friendly and professional stuff. The room was big enough and the bathroom very comfortable. Gorgeous classical interior of the launch was just a prick over ""i"". Loved everything!",5,2015,03,24
137,Two Nights of Indulgence,"Spent 2 nights here with my wife over the weekend and had an amazing time. The hotel feels small and personal, and the staff are incredible friendly, attentive knowledgeable and courteous. 

Our room was wonderful with an extremely comfortable bed and a huge bath plus separate walk-in shower.

We really enjoyed the welcome drinks, the pantry and the honesty bar. Breakfast was excellent.

Location-wise its practically next door to Buckingham Palace so a great place to explore London from. 

We have also stayed at The Ritz and The Savoy and this place is definitely up there with them, but with a bit more of a personal touch.",5,2015,03,24
137,Wonderful Experience!!,"My mother and I stayed at Hotel 41 for 3 days while we were visiting London and it was such an incredible experience. The room was delightful and large enough to accommodate both of us comfortably, the food was delicious, and above all, the service level provided by the staff was unparalleled. The staff is genuine, kind, incredibly attentive, and warm. They went out of their way to assist us with any needs we had (even going to lengths of going to the Starbucks down the street and picking out a mug as a souvenir for a friend when all I asked was if they could see if there was a Starbucks in the airport terminal) and to ensure that our stay was as pleasant and care free as possible. I really looking forward to returning to Hotel 41 and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a cozy stay and incredible service.",5,2015,03,23
137,Wonderful Birthday Weekend,"Cannot speak highly enough of this hotel. Everything about it was perfect. The service was exemplary - nothing was too much trouble. The room was fantastic, every detail covered. It was the little things that made it though.... The birthday cake in the room, the upgrade to a suite for our special occasion, the champagne on arrival, the lit fire when we returned to our room in the evening and the complementary tea and scones just before we left for our return journey. We WILL be back!!!!",5,2015,03,22
137,"Beautiful Accommodation, Great Location, Wonderful Staff","My wife and I spent four days last month at Hotel 41 in London, and very much look forward to returning!  Our room was attractive and comfortable.  The lounge was a great respite after a day of sightseeing and shopping with plenty to eat and drink.  The location was ideal whether walking, hailing a cab, or taking the Tube.  The staff was incredibly attentive, friendly, and helpful, whether with restaurant recommendations, directions, or virtually any question asked.  And they were wonderful to simply have a conversation with as well.  We had let them know in advance we were celebrating our anniversary and were very pleasantly surprised to find a celebratory cake awaiting us on arrival, as well as scattered rose pedals and votive candles throughout the room after dinner our first night.  My wife loves London, but loves Hotel 41 even more!",5,2015,03,20
137,A little gem,"Seleted Hotel 41 from Tripadvsor reviews and I can confirm it justly deserves its position on the list.On arrival were speedily shown to the 5th floor executive lounge where the check in process is completed.Whilst we were being checked in we were offered a choice of champagne .We then spent some time enjoying the ambiance off he executive lounge with complementary nibbles and more champagne.When we were ready we were shown to our room 4104 the conservatory suite.Everything in the suite was explained to us nothing was rushed .The suite was incredible , arranged over 2 floors with a sitting room on the lower level with a nice couch a mini bar and TV also a toilet.On the upper floor a massive bedroom with the conservatory roof so you can sleep under the stars or close the blinds if preferred.There is masses of wardrobe space and the bathroom is lovely.Fatastc shower and  also a Jacuzzi  bath.There was a lovely fruit basket for us on arrival and as it was my wife's birthday a cake was placed in our  room for when we returned late evening along with scattering of rose petals around the bed and in the bathroom.All the staff are lovely and genuinely want to make your stay as memorable as they can.We had a truly wonderful stay and wished it could have been longer.It is pure luxury and although as at any top. hotel the cost is high ,I believe having stayed at  Claridges that  we enjoyed our stay at 41 more.",5,2015,03,17
137,Fabulous and Personal,"Thank you so much to Hotel 41 for an amazing stay over my birthday. 
The room was stunning and made even more so with the fire and rose petals in the evening! 
Made our stay so special with all those personal touches, including theatre merchandise, roses, our fav magazines and a birthday cake! 
Breakfast was absolutely delicious, were still talking about it. 
Will definitely be coming back and recommending to friends and family alike!",5,2015,03,17
137,Cozy and Fabulous,"I have just spent a week in this  gorgeous Hotel. It is perfect in every way!
The staff make this  hotel, they cannot do enough to spoil you. The rooms are beautifully appointed and the breafasts are gorgeous! I could list far more than 41 reasons to stay!
Just book you won't be dissapointed!",5,2015,03,17
137,Fantastic service and stay ,"Stayed here with the other half, we both thoroughly enjoyed our time here. Service was fantastic and someone was always there when required. Room service efficient and not intrusive. The whole decor of the place was amazing felt as if we was in a different country and not in London. This is one of the best hotels in London at the moment. Will be back again in the summer. Thanks ",5,2015,03,17
137,A very special place,"From start to finish our stay was faultless. It's expensive but worth every penny. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. The location makes this a true hidden gem in the heart of London. We will definitely be returning
",5,2015,03,12
137,Unbelievable!,"I can not even begin to write a review that would do Hotel 41 and staff justice.  The suite was stunning with views of the Palace Mews out of our windows.  There was nothing better than returning to our room in the evening, after a long day of sight seeing, to a fire and warm bath.  The staff were always warm and welcoming.  No matter the request, they never batted an eye and fulfilled it wonderfully. Our stay here was more like staying with long time friends than staying at a hotel. 
The location was fabulous.  Easy walk to the underground, Victoria Station, Buckingham Palace, Harrods, The Victoria and Albert Museum, Big Ben and Westminster Abby.  Quick cab or Uber to other sights.  I hesitate to say more...I can't wait to return and don't want it to be fully booked!",5,2015,03,11
137,Hidden Gem next to the Royal Palace,"Look carefully to find the unassuming entrance door to this hidden gem.  My husband and I stayed here one night to celebrate our 25th Anniversary.  From the moment you step in the door you feel like you're stealing away to someplace special.  The service was impeccable with attention to the tiniest of details.  There is always something delicious to eat available.  I am most impressed and grateful, however, that when we returned at midnight, I asked if they might have a spare contact lens case because I forgot mine . . . and they were able to provide me with one!!  That was a lifesaver.  I wish we were able to stay longer.",5,2015,03,10
137,Magical place,"This time to hotel 41 my daughter and I were celebrating her 21 birthday and the staff made sure she had an amazing stay . On greeting her they wished her happy birthday and in our room we found cake plus a card and balloon . The hotel is unique , you know your in london due to location but once your through the doors its another world hidden from outside . The personal touches from the staff are second to none and they make your stay memorable . We saw billy elliot and on our return found cupcakes and a programme . The quality of everything is outstanding and its just perfect in every way for me from staff to room to food and drink . The communications from hotel 41 are excellent they go the extra mile on everything . I am very hard to impress but they did it . My daughter 21 was made more magical and we cant wait to return in 2016

137,beautiful,"This is my first time here, and the first thing i noticed is the hotel's nice decoration, especially at the lobby ... the kind of old school feel that i like! definitely suitable for all occasions ...",4,2015,03,03
137,"""Paradise Lost?"" I believe I have found it!","We were fortunate enough to discover Hotel 41 in February of this year. I can only endorse every positive thing that has been written about this hotel. The place is absolutely beautiful,the rooms are gorgeous and spotlessly clean, the food is fabulous, the location fantastic, I could go on and on! However in my opinion what really makes this Hotel truly exceptional is the wonderful staff that they employ.,it is hard to believe that one hotel has managed to employ an entire staff who are truly exceptional in every way. We did not encounter a single member of staff who wasn't smiling and genuinely interested in making sure our weekend was as wonderful as possible. Well ladies and gentlemen you succeeded! Thank you all so much for making us so comfortable , so welcome and making our stay such a great one. You are a great credit to your professions and we are very much looking forward to seeing you all in our next trip! I'm already counting down the weeks!",5,2015,03,02
137,Always a fantastic experience,This was our 3rd time at Hotel 41. Tube journey from Euston to Victoria a nightmare and the building work in Victoria horrendous and ugly. However the moment you step into the lobby of  Hotel 41 you  feel calm and so well looked after. Other hotels may be equally luxurious and well run but somehow  because it is smaller and individual you feel special. We are already talking about out next stay.,5,2015,03,01
137,One of the best ever.......,"I have just got back from a truly amazing stay at this fab hotel. We've stayed in some of the worlds best hotels and I can honestly say this was one of the best experiences we've ever had at a hotel. My husband booked this place as a birthday treat for me, after reading the reviews on here and I'm so glad he did. It was magical. On arrival we were greeted with a selection of champagne by the most attentive staff. We then had our room upgraded for nothing as my husband had informed them it was my birthday. We were given an amazing suite which was gorgeous in every way. The rooms really are exceptional. The decor & attention to detail is wonderful. They then arrived with a birthday cake (which was delicious) and fruit basket as a present. All of this in the 1st 30 mins! In the lounge area of the hotel you can help yourself to a wide selection of snacks throughout the day. We had afternoon tea in front of the open fire, which was amazing. The scones are incredible. As there are only a few rooms, it's never too busy & the atmosphere is very relaxed. The hotel arranged a reservation at a local restaurant for dinner & arranged taxis. There is nothing too big or small for them to help you with. We felt so special from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. They even sent us on our way with water, Hot chocolate & amazing Belgium truffles. The room we had was spacious with a separate lounge area & 2 bathrooms, with underfloor heating which was lush. The bed was huge & comfy with the best pillows. There's even a pillow menu with about 10 different options to choose from. They came in and put hot water bottles on our bed & scattered rose petals on the floor & lit candles for when we came back from dinner. Breakfast was included & it was delicious with a wide selection of everything you'd want. The location is great. Really near Victoria station. Although in a busy area, the hotel is serene & quiet. I would highly recommend this hotel & we'll definitely be going back.",5,2015,02,28
137,Perfection,"I stayed here with my good friend for my birthday treat and they really go the extra mile. It is my favourite place in the world. Nothing is too much trouble and the food, ambience, rooms, service and location is flawless. Thank you so much again for the best stay ever. We did not want to leave ever. ",5,2015,02,27
137,Everything about this hotel is first class. ," Everything about this hotel is first class. Have stayed several times and once again we were not disappointed. We really enjoyed our first stay with the hotel so much so that we extended it by three days! The staff was very helpful in particular. They were very helpful answering questions as well as making recommendations. There were lovely setting, clean and spacious room. Food is excellent. The spa is way above all others I have visited. I had great time. Also, there was a lovely afternoon tea. Thanks a lot and I will definitely come back.",5,2015,02,24
137,London's hidden flawless diamond,"The perfect London hotel. We spent the weekend with our two dogs, Archie & Gretel. From the moment we arrived, nothing was too much trouble and our every need anticipated - including those of Archie & Gretel - who enjoyed a freshly cooked breakfast!. I am accustomed to fine hotels - but the mixture of quality, atmosphere and general 'je ne sais quoi' of 41 is simply unmatched.",5,2015,02,23
137,perfect,"So this is it. The perfect hotel. A small 5 star, personal service, great bedding, a lounge area making you really feel at home. Admitted, all this doesn't come cheap. But compared to other London hotels and the experience on offer, it really feels like great value for money. Ps: try the breakfast pancakes with fresh berries ... Heaven. ",5,2015,02,22
137,A wonderful night away!,"My husband and I got married just before Christmas and are not going on honeymoon until June, so my new hubby treated me to a night here and a trip to the theatre.  I know he put a lot of effort into finding somewhere very special for us to stay and it really was special!

Prior to our arrival he liaised with the hotel to arrange for us to arrive a little earlier that usual so we could make the most of our night away from the kids and they were happy to oblige.

We were greeted with hot chocolate in the foyer...which in January was very much appreciated!

We were then shown to the main reception desk and presented with champagne...so the hot chocolate got ditched in favour of this!!  We were absolutely spoilt and upgraded to the Balmoral Suite, which was quite frankly the most amazing hotel room either of us have ever stayed it!!

Our suite had a living room/dining area and the main bedroom, 2 bathrooms and a shower room!  There were 4 tv's in total - including one at the foot of the bed which was a total hit with my husband!  There was a big bowl of fruit...and toffees!!  The suite was amazing...the attention to detail was fantastic!

The all day snacks were great too!  We had canapés on arrival, popped in later and loaded up on too many bags of sweets and chocolates.  Indulged in some afternoon tea.  Sadly we didn't get to try out the pre supper bits they had and I forgot to have some ice cream!!  

We arrived back at the hotel after supper and our show and my husband had organised, as a surprise for our room, to have a 'romantic turn down'!  We entered the room to rose petals and candle everywhere, romantic music playing, a bottle of champagne on ice waiting by the bed along with some chocolate dipped strawberries!  We also had an extra treat of a lovely cake waiting too!  It was amazing and the only thing to detract from the romance was me having to get photos quickly before pouring the champagne!

Breakfast the next day was lovely...although it only really takes a good Eggs Benedict on the breakfast menu and a big pot of tea and we are both more than happy!

The location of the hotel was fabulous too...we went out for a wander and the hotels 'neighbour' is Buckingham Palace!  We were blessed with beautiful weather for January, which was great!

I would go back here in a flash...I am trying to convince the hubby we should go for our anniversary each year..I might get time to try the ice cream then!

All the staff were so helpful and friendly...friendly but not in your face!  The main room (where reception is as well as the food/drinks etc) was lovely, with a roaring fire and floor to ceiling bookcases.",5,2015,02,22
137,Enjoyable and relaxing birthday visit,"To celebrate my husband's birthday we spent Valentine's weekend at ""41"".   We booked having read reviews on tripadvisor but were still impressed by how welcoming and relaxing the whole experience was.  

The atmosphere in the guest lounge reminded us of something of a cross between a club lounge and the library of a manor house.  All of the staff were attentive and friendly, and genuinely gave the impression that nothing was too much trouble.  The ""home from home"" impression was reinforced by the small touches - free ice cream and chocolate truffles turning out to be a particular favourite for my husband, for me it was the hot water bottle at turndown! 

We are already planning to return for another weekend later in the year.",5,2015,02,20
137,Outstanding!!!!!!,"I suprised my boyfriend for his 30th Birthday with a stay at this hotel, Id read the reviews about the hotel but I must say our stay here supassed all expectations I had. From the second We walked in the customer service was exceptional. There was not one single fault in our entire stay. If you are planning a special occasion I would reccomend this hotel and will be reccomending this hotel to all my friends and family. You can tell that YOU are at the heart of what they do. Its amazing words can not fully explain how impressive this place is. 
Thank you to everyone who made our stay such an enjoyable experiance.",5,2015,02,19
137,A hidden masterpiece,"When you travel in London and you use Black cabs it is unusual for the cabbie not to know your destination . Hotel 41 is one of these hidden gems in London . Exclusivity is their byword . Unlike a normal hotel lobby you have to be "" buzzed"" in . Greeted by a receptionist who takes your details and then calls someone down to escort you to the Fith floor where the hotel is situated . 
From the moment you arrive the service and attention to detail never ceases to amaze. Nothing was to much trouble for the friendliest staff I have encountered . 
An all day buffet , breakfast , lunch and dinner superb . Rooms extremely comfortable . This is like staying in a private club. 
One of the best hotels ever .",5,2015,02,18
137,Speechless,"It's taken me some time to find the words to adequately describe this hotel.  I almost don't want to write about it, so as to keep it my secret.  However, the property and people deserve the praise.  Unfortunately, my wife and I were only able to stay here one night.  We were finishing up an anniversary trip, and in that one night the staff made a lasting impression.  We were placed in the Conservatory Suite (complete with a special happy anniversary cake), which rendered us speechless.  The level of service, the professionalism, and the hospitality shown by all staff members is unparalleled.  From the moment we walked in the door, to the moment we left, we felt like we were royalty.  The Executive Lounge is the star of the property.  It's where you check in/out, enjoy afternoon tea, have evening cocktails and food, etc.  The quality of the food and drinks were incredible.  The location of the hotel is close to all attractions.  In short, I know that I will never be able to stay anywhere other than Hotel 41 on my subsequent trips to London.  I will judge all hotels I stay at in the future against this property.  Thank you to all the staff!!!",5,2015,02,16
137,A special celebration,"We had a wonderful stay in this small luxurious hotel.
With Victoria station near by it was easy to get to and handy for sightseeing.
The staff could not have been more kind and helpful which made our stay extra special and one to remember. 
The cooked breakfasts are very good.",5,2015,02,16
137,What a present!,Received an overnight booking as a gift. When we arrived we were greeted in such a professional way but made to feel like long lost friends. We were escorted to the Executive Lounge where we were offered champagne during the booking in procedures. We were delighted to receive upgraded accommodation to a suite and upon entry saw a celebration cake waiting for us. All that is written on the hotel web site and the gallery images give a true reflection of what is available. The food and service were amazing  We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to others.,5,2015,02,16
137,Outstanding!,"The location of this hotel is excellent. It's within short walking distance of Buckingham Palace and not far from Parliament Square. Easy walking distance (5 minutes or so) to Victoria Station. Gatwick Express takes 30 minutes and is about 40 pounds for 2 people. 

The service at the hotel is exemplary. The ""whatever, wherever"" philosophy lives up to the highest expectations. Staff are ready and willing to assist at any time. 

Continental breakfast was nice and also the option to order off the menu. 24 hour room service is available. Great snacks in the afternoon and in the evening as well in the executive lounge. 

The bed was comfy and rooms were large for European standards. We used our sound machine (which we use at home) and didn't find noise to be a problem. Higher end toiletries were found in the bathroom. 

Overall, we wouldn't hesitate to stay here again!",5,2015,02,16
137,This place is in a league of its own,"Just returned from a short stay the night before Valentine's Day.  My wife and I have stayed in most of the best hotels in London; this place is in a league of its own.

-Without exception, the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful.  Not American style feigned obsequiousness in search of a large tip, not intrusive over the top badgering, just genuinely nice and happy people. 

-The main dining room/lounge area had an incredibly relaxing vibe.  Imagine an old style stately home library with, during the day, the gently soothing music of a spa and at nighttime, equally relaxing piano jazz.  My wife and I arrived after a longish journey intent on checking in, going to our room, and not emerging until the morning - this place draws you in, and we ended up quite happily staying there for dinner.

-On about three hours notice (last minute booking), when we went to our room after dinner it had been filled with candles, rose petals, and, again, a well chosen softly playing musical selection.  Obviously this was very probably done because of the date, but its a measure of how much we were already taken with the place that we weren't totally sure that it wasn't just standard practice.

-The food was excellent.  For me, the barometer of a good hotel breakfast is the orange juice - if artificial, it shows a lack of care/willingness to cut corners that doesn't bode well for any of its other services.  Here, freshly squeezed was never in doubt.

-I hesitate to mention this because the last thing i want is to incentivise freeloaders to show up here, but they just keep giving you stuff - at times it feels like they don't actually want to charge you for anything.  Champagne on arrival, ice cream and dessert buffet over dinner, champagne again in the morning.  My wife and I had a few hours between checking out and our dinner reservations, they gave us a courtesy room for the day.  I had some time to kill in the afternoon and had a pot of tea in the lounge, when leaving I asked them to add it to my lunch tab - ""oh no, that's on us.""  Twenty minutes before leaving for dinner my wife decided she really needed a necklace, given our experience so far I suggested she call downstairs (the reception/concierge button is labelled ""Whatever, Whenever"") to see if they had any we could buy/if there were any extremely nearby jewellers they could recommend.  A couple of minutes later, a lady showed up at our door with a tray of necklaces for my wife to choose from, and again, the idea of charging us was almost laughed off as absurd.",5,2015,02,16
137,Five Star Gem,"A five star gem in Victoria next to Buckingham Palace We could not fault this hotel it is absolutely amazing the staff are so friendly and welcoming and you feel like your meeting close friends.

137,Perfect Boutique Hotel!,"Charming, sophisticated, cozy, unique - then add excellent service - beyond what you could even think possible - and you have 41 Hotel.  Just one floor full of rooms with a staff that is ready and willing to accommodate your every request.  They send you a pre-arrival form and I requested a birthday cake as a surprise for my husband and some roses.  I was then asked what type of cake, what did I want written on it, and when did I want it delivered - extremely detail oriented!  When we arrived from our dinner out that evening, our room was lit up with candles in each part of our room (including the bathroom) surrounded by rose petals, a delicious chocolate mousse cake (small, as requested), and beautiful turn down service.  I love that they put a hot water bottle between the sheets to warm things up on the chilly nights!  Add to that a large and lovely lounge with fabulous food and a large variety of drink offerings (including 4 different champagnes by the glass) and this place is perfect for any type of visit - business, romance, touring.  It is worth mentioning that we arrived around 9am from the airport and our room was not yet ready.  They offered us a ""courtesy room"" to put our things and sleep, which we took them up on.  We have never experienced this before and we so appreciated it!",5,2015,02,11
137,Wow!!!,"If you are wondering where to stay in London this is the place. Service, Accommodation, Clean, Very Comfortable, all top notch one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. Executive lounge suite is a real treat. Cannot wait to go back . Well done to all staff you do a fantastic job.",5,2015,02,06
137,Perfect weekend stay in London,"My wife and I went to London for a weekend to celebrate her birthday. From the first second we were greeted with an amazing personal service and complimentary champagne. In the room awaited a complimentary birthday cake and a handwritten card.
The room was delightful, with a good sized bathroom (not common in London.) The Lounge was elegant and cozy at the same time. 
The staff was very helpful and attentive. They also helped obtain musical tickets and restaurant reservations beforehand.
Plenty of small amazing details everywhere ensured a memorable stay in London. We are definitely coming back.",5,2015,02,05
137,"Delightful, best hotel ever","From the moment we arrived we felt very special, the attention to detail is second to none. I have been the hospitality sector for over thirty years, these people have had the best training and make each person feel at home.

They have the knack of just making you feel special and that they appreciate that you chose to book your stay with them.

I had a problem with my Mother that I had not realised had got worse before we arrived and they went way beyond what that should have or had to do, to ensure that our special time together was unforgettable.

It is truly a jewel in the crown and will always stay here when I visit London. 

The price may seem high but you will know that it is every penny well spent.

Thank you all again for our magical stay",5,2015,02,05
137,Shocked and more shocked,This hotel met all our needs. We stayed in the executive king suite. The bed was comfortable and soft. A little softer then I would like but I slept like a baby. Location was perfect. Close to Buckingham palace and tunnels. The staff was very educated of the history and area. The breakfast is a must! It was deligjtful . It could of been cleaner as I did come across some hair in bed and the shower. Over all it was a wonderful experience and we can't wait to return ,5,2015,02,04
137,Outstanding in every way,"What a wonderful hotel this is ! My husband and I recently spent the weekend here .
A lovely warm welcome as we entered the hotel even though we had arrived quite early , the staff were so friendly and attentive throughout our stay .
Amazing to get a choice of champagnes at check in , followed by canapés whilst our room was ready . 
The executive lounge is so relaxing and homely and was never really busy or noisy , such a difference to the many London hotels we have stayed in . 
We had booked an executive king room and found this to be a perfect size , nice big bath and separate shower , beautifully furnished and spotlessly clean .
The bed was extremely comfortable and the choice of pillows included an aromatherapy one which I highly recommend .
Breakfast in the lounge was perfect in every way , the service , menu choice and quality of food . 
I cannot praise this hotel enough , the staff are the nicest , friendliest that we have ever met and we will definitely stay here when we return to London",5,2015,02,03
137,Home away from Home- Perfection!,"From the warm, welcoming staff to the delightful ""nibbles"" always available, to the beautiful decor, this hotel felt more like a bed and breakfast. It is a short walk to Buckingham Palace and a quick jaunt to the Tube station. This wonderful hotel is absolutely delightful in every way, and we will not stay anywhere else from now on!",5,2015,02,02
137,A wonderfully relaxing time,"Possibly the best hotel stay I have ever had whether for business or pleasure.
Incredibly attentive, friendly and welcoming staff.
Super comfy bed (always important even for one night!) and nice bedroom. 
We could have whiled away the whole of Sunday reading the papers by the fire in the Executive Lounge. Will definitely be returning.",5,2015,02,02
137,Unbelievable Service. Perfect stay. Beautiful and Clean.,"I've stayed at the Intercontinental, the Sheraton Park Lane, the Cavendish St. James and a number of others. Nothing compares to the level of service you'll find at this wonderful, cozy and friendly hotel. Everything was clean and in order and the accommodations were excellent in every respect. Great location too. Thanks so much to the awesome staff. Nice job!",5,2015,02,01
137,The Best Hotel in 25 Years of Travel,"The experience of ""41"" begins with a warm welcome from the Concierge and your car whisked away for parking, The reception by the hotel staff is second to none, very attentive and exceptionally polite.
Our stay was to celebrate my partners birthday, the room was wonderful, a small piece of cake was a thoughtful gesture and the flowers ordered were of good quality. The ambience is wonderful it is like apartment living with the lounge the main gathering place.
All requested reservations had been made and nothing too much trouble. The afternoon tea was really good, a great selection of sandwiches, pastries and scones. 
Above all every staff member was so polite, addressed you by name and a great asset to this hotel. For anyone wanting the best hotel experience in London this is the one for you.",5,2015,02,01
137,Fantastic,"One of the best hotel I've nevere used. fantastic, with an excellent service and romantic room. The hotel is near to all major famous places of London. A perfect location to start to visiting and living London.",5,2015,02,01
137,"Small, Personable Stay","We stayed at Hotel 41 the week between Christmas and New Years Eve. The rooms were elegant and clean (but watch your head in the loft if you're very tall!). The staff were all exceedingly friendly and helpful, making arrangements and suggestions each night of our visit. Because it's a small hotel, you quickly feel as though the staff knows you. For example, each time we left the hotel on an outing that the staff helped arrange, someone at the door recognized us and handed us an envelop with printed walking directions and (if needed) confirmations. Very handy!

The location was also perfect. We would definitely stay at Hotel 41 again!",5,2015,01,30
137,One of the best,"I've been fortunate enough to stay in some amazing hotels around the world, but few are as personable and memorable as 41.

You'll be greeted with champagne, treated like an individual rather than a room number, and lavished with incredible luxury throughout your stay. Pricey (as expected), but worth it.",5,2015,01,28
137,Simply Stunning ....,"Wow,  just returned from two nights at 41,  it is a truly a stunning hotel.  The Staff are friendly, attentive and nothing is too much. I have been fortunate enough to stay in some great hotels but none as good as 41.  The location is great for travelling round London and despite being next to the main road it is quiet.  no road noise, no doors banging and then there is the food,  just fab with a great pantry that is worth visiting.  a lot of other hotels could do with visiting 41 and just learning what hospitality is about.  my thanks to all the staff who looked after us. Highly recommended",5,2015,01,26
137,Amazing,"I stayed here as a birthday treat for my girlfriend on 24/1/15 and could not have picked a better choice. There is not one thing about this hotel that could be improved and I will certainly be staying here again, I felt like a celebrity from start to finish! 
Highly recommend!",5,2015,01,25
137,Feels like home!,"This was our 3rd Christmas at 41 and we really didn't want to leave, so much so that we ended up extending our stay.  Special mention to Lauren, Monika and Florent for making the stay so memorable and fun, but the whole 41 team as always were fantastic.  They make you feel like returning friends rather than guests and had organised a lovely anniversary surprise for us in the room when we checked in. Consistently excellent service and the best hotel beds we've ever slept in!  41's location is great, it's just a short walk through the park to some great shopping streets and an excuse to feed the local squirrels! Can't wait for next Christmas!",5,2015,01,25
137,Wonderful Experience,"My stay at Hotel 41 was such a treat, I cannot recommend highly enough.  The care provided by the staff was absolutely top notch.  The rooms are very comfortable, well appointed and surprisingly spacious for central London.  The reception area was such a nice and comfortable amenity.  Staying here was truly a retreat from the hustle of London just outside.

The location was excellent, just a short walk to Buckingham Palace and Victoria station.  It was a great place to stay while exploring London.

For being a luxury hotel, they had a lot of items included, that seem to be how other nice hotels nickel and dime the overall experience.  Snacks, water, soft drinks...really nice touch.

London can be quite expensive, if you can get a competitive rate at Hotel 41, don't hesitate, you cannot do better.",5,2015,01,24
137,100% recommend,"Stayed one night in this hotel . The room was big and it had comfy bed . We had great and sound sleep . The staff were friendly and helpful , we would use this hotel again !! 100% recommend. Mr & Mrs Murray ",5,2015,01,24
137,Everything a luxury hotel should be.,"An amazing hotel. Anyone running a five star hotel should be a guest here to see how it should be done. The check in was painless, helped along with a glass of champagne, the bar is like a modern gentlemans club crossed with a country house library.

Superb attentive service by staff who frankly have to be chosen for their good looks,as they were all drop dead gorgeous!

The continual supply of delicious canapes helps the excellent selection of malt whisky go down.

The rooms are fantastic, modern stunning interiors with little touches that make a difference. Bose wave sound system, roaring fire, hot water bottles in the bed. I,would have been very happy to move in.

My new favourite hotel in London, I can't wait to go back.",5,2015,01,21
137,A rare gem,"Hotel 41 is small but it doesn't matter as the service is impeccable and the little touches are amazing. 
In winter there is a wonderful fireplace in the lounge.  There is a home-styled kitchen where you can help yourself to delicious treats from icecream to fruit to sweet and savoury snacks whenever you feel like it.  in the later afternoon we were treated to free champagne and snacks.  And instead of a chocolate on your pillow each night - you choose your little gift from a basket which includes some adorable items I still use.
I loved this hotel - it is central, reasonably priced and different.  I have stayed in five star London hotels that don't come close to the outstanding service here.",5,2015,01,20
137,Fantastic hotel wonderful stay,The staff could not have been  more friendly and helpful we had a wonderful time celebrating my belated birthday. I can't wait to go back and stay longer it was such an easy place to get to  aswell the restaurant recommendation that the made was also first class .afternoon tea was a delight,5,2015,01,18
137,Instantly relaxing,"I booked hotel 41 for my partners birthday and have to say we had the most relaxing, chilled out time ever in a London hotel.
We were checked in to our room in the lounge and offered a glass of champagne, and that's where we stayed for the next 3 hours!! Absolute bliss.
Everything here was perfect for us, attention to detail is unbelievable. When we walked in there was lots of sweets and goodies by the front door and I said the kids would have loved that. At check out we were presented with two bags full of sweets for our children, nice touch:))",5,2015,01,18
137,Almost fit for royalty,"What an exquisite place! I love the attention to detail in the decor, and the lovely staff that genuinely do want to go the extra mile to make your stay memorable. This is one of the rare few places where the demeanor of the staff is genuinely amicable, rather than getting the vibe of they are just being nice because they are paid to do so. I never felt the generic manufactured "" friendliness "" feeling from the staff. My only caveat with this place is that the staff although well meaning, do sometimes get a little intrusive by way of watching you at all times which is akin to a security guard watching you. This is something which is antithetical to an otherwise wonderful hotel. There is a fine line between being attentive and being intrusive. Other than this, i'm a big fan!",4,2015,01,18
137,The best Hotel in London,"We will never forget the Hotel 41!  It is the best Hotel in five stars.  All is clean, British decoration, beautiful.  All the staff is perfect, each one work perfectly and they are friendly.  The staff is like a second family.  Do not forget the Valet, perfect service.  We have a marvellous souvenir for the very warm welcome with the bottle of Champagne and the surprise, a birthday cake for Eddy !  Victoria, our cat liked very much the staff, especially the lady who came everyday to clean the room I think, Victoria did not want to leave the room the last day.  All the staff took care of her with many kindness.  We loved the dining-room, the ambiance and lovely music, the meals were delicious, we discovered a nice coconut soup, and the famous afternoon tea, It was magic.  We tasted for the first time the dessert Eton Mess, excellent !  It was a waiter who advice the dessert and we liked that he explained the history of the dessert and some informations about London.  About the Bathroom, Penhaligon was the branch of soaps and shower gel etc.  Luxury perfume.  The full english breakfast was nice and well served by a very kind waiter.  The hotel is the best for everything, and should stay the number one.  We will add that It is easy for principal access, we were very near Buckingham Palace, Westminster, St James Park, Green Park etc.  The hotel is comfortable, our room was magnificent and the bed comfortable, a private bar in the room.  Nothing miss in the Hotel.  We will come back.  We thank you very much all the staff in the Hotel for those magic and nice days that we have spent in the Hotel 41, we spent an amazing Birthday, thank you and thank you again for Victoria.",5,2015,01,15
137,"Does not live up to the reviews, nosey staff","We stayed 10 nights at this hotel based on the positive reviews we had read on trip advisor. We were very disappointed. The staff are incredibly nosey. My introverted wife felt too uncomfortable venturing into the common room for snacks on her own as she found the staff too intrusive. They always want to generate a lengthy conversation with you even though you can be visibly tired or uncomfortable. We knew they were trying to be friendly, but you really feel imposed upon every time you step into the common area. 

Also, our sleep was terrible. Initially our room (which was tiny) had such a loud compressor outside that I couldn't get to sleep. We had to ask for a room change (which they provided). This second room was much larger. However, we never got to sleep in as the staff could be heard stomping around directly above us from very early in the mornings. We could hear them constantly going up and down stairs. It was very annoying.

The shower/bath handles were also prone to repeatedly breaking and being unusable. Also, on many occasions, choices listed on the breakfast menu were just not available eg I love waffles but rarely got to have them (even though they were listed on the menu) because they were repeatedly ""out"" of waffles. 

Also, be aware of some of the rooms which are incredibly claustrophobic and tiny. Please note we stayed here in 2012 (there were no earlier choices than Feb 2014 given by trip advisor on their drop down menu). Perhaps Hotel 41 would have fixed some of these problems since then. However, I would not chance it again.",2,2015,01,15
137,Brilliant,"Me and my wife stayed here just before christmas, and can honestly says it really is amazing, from the minute you walk through the door, you feel welcome lovely check in really friendly staff, and explain everything you need to know. We had dinner the first night and the food is delicious! Real 5 star service. So all in all a lovely stay here, and will be recommending to my friends.",5,2015,01,14
137,Best service I've ever experienced,"The hotel is comfortable, well decorated and reasonably well positioned in Victoria. What sets it apart is the service. It's amazing. I travel a lot with work and have stayed in excellent hotels all over the World. This really stands out. They anticipate your needs and are generous with their champagne, snacks and excellent coffee. They are also friendly and very helpful. We had a wonderful time.",5,2015,01,13
137,Stunning luxury!!,"I first wrote a review on Hotel 41 about 4 or 5 years ago and could not stop recommending it to everyone that I knew.  We had the opportunity to return in December whilst doing some Christmas shopping in London and it is as magnificent as ever!  We stayed in a Junior Suite and I would like to share our experiences as follows:
Location:  Hotel 41 is situated in Buckingham Palace Road and is just around the corner from Buckingham Palace.  We never caught cabs anywhere as it is so easy to walk to places such as Hyde Park and Harrods.  Longer walks would include walking to Fortnum and Mason - totally lovely!
The staff:  We had not been there for two years and were so happy to see familiar faces at the reception desk.  The friendliness and the helpfulness of the staff cannot be overrated.  They are amazing - it was an easy check-in with offers of something to eat and drink and smiles all around all day, every day.
The suite:  Absolutely breathtaking.  Spacious bedroom with the most comfortable beds and pillows. An amazing sky light can be found in the bedroom and the fruit basket is replaced every day. The beautiful bathroom is filled with fluffy white towels, gorgeous toiletries, hot towel rails and a television.  We were most reluctant to leave it every day!!
The food:  One of Hotel 41's best features is the food which is available all day.  The midnight snack bar, which is the best idea ever, has saved us on many occasions during the past few years.  We would arrive back absolutely exhausted from shopping and too tired to eat out...and the midnight snack bar would fill the void abundantly.
There is also the advantage of free WIFI (I see that some hotels no longer offer this facility).
I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and cannot wait to return.
A big thank you to everyone who made our stay there so memorable.",5,2015,01,13
137,Fantastic&romantic,"Very nice little butique hotel with helpful stuff. Room was very cosy, with fireplace and comfort bed. Location was the best. It was only couple hundred metres away from Buckingham Palace and short walk away from Victoria bus station. Hop on-hop off bus station was almost in front of the hotel. Loved to spend our christmas time there, hotel lobby was also very cosy and stuff spoiled us a lot. Definately will visit again.",5,2015,01,12
137,51st Wedding Anniversary,"This has to be the best hotel in London,we were celebrating our 51st anniversary and spent one night at Hotel 41.From the moment you enter the hotel and receive the unique registration format (crudités and champagne) to the exceptional room facilities, it's the first hotel We have visited that have sanitised TV controls in sealed plastic bags.We would also congratulate the highly professional and friendly staff. Do visit Hotel 41 it's amazing!",5,2015,01,12
137,A hidden treasure,"What a find!! We stayed for two nights and we had a great time. We were met by the doorman as we pulled up. Luggage taken into the hotel and the car was whisked away. We were greeted by name by the staff who were really attentive. If you're not used to it you could feel a little overwhelmed but with only 28 rooms the staff have plenty of time to look after you. We had a glass of champagne whilst we were checking in and complimentary snacks whilst we waited for our room. The executive lounge is very tastefully laid out and never too busy so it feels like you're in an exclusive club. Be aware that although the snacks and cold drinks are free the tea and coffee that they offer certainly aren't and are added onto the bill without a word....no slip to sign so we were surprised when we checked out. We had an executive King room which was exactly as described on the website. The attention to detail was super, the bed really comfy and the bathroom well stocked with toiletries.  Warm canapés before the theatre and a generously stocked 'plunder pantry' when you fancy a late snack are such a delight. Overall probably the best hotel I've stayed in but shame about the hidden charges....",5,2015,01,11
137,Discreet and exceptional service.,"We had 2 nights here for a birthday weekend of shopping and partying. The service for us is unrivalled and we are used to being spoiled having recently stayed in the Savoy and the Sanderson. Loved the executive lounge, really can't wait to return to spend a little more time making the most of it. Thankyou to all of the staff for a wonderful stay.",5,2015,01,11
137,Ultra High Quality,"Stayed here in February 2013 in a fantastic two-floor room. Entrance through a nice seating area with a fireplace, spacious bedroom in the top floor. Nice 1920's surroundings in the lounge, breakfast is generous and the afternoon canapés is a feature rarely seen in London establishments.",5,2015,01,09
137,A JEWEL OF THE CROWN,"A JEWEL OF THE CROWN 
(IN THE MOST LITERAL SENSE OF THE EXPRESSION ! )

Following the online reservation of rooms on the website for 3 nights of the Hotel, communication with the staff prior to arrival was most informative and kind, helpful and attentive to all our requests. I had planned this journey for my partner’s birthday and I could already feel that the staff paid attention to every wish I would formulate. Moreover, they arranged for private transfer to pick us up from the airport upon arrival, as indeed I had requested. 

As soon as we arrived at the hotel, Mr Malcolm Hendry, General Manager, came outside to greet us and even kindly helped us with our luggage himself (!!). Once we got into the ground-floor hall we knew we would absolutely love the place. Mr Hendry told us not to worry about our luggage since it would be taken care of by the staff and he accompanied us to the 5th floor, where the Reception / Lounge of the “41” is located. We were offered a glass of champagne (to be chosen from among three or four different kinds), seated in comfortable old-style leather armchairs before a wooden desk. Once we checked ourselves in, they showed us around and led us to a couch near a fireplace to wait until our room would be ready (as we had arrived a bit too early). It was lunch time anyway, so this came on time, and we asked for the lunch menu. The waitress (Juliana) was very kind, smiling and obliging. Following a brief half-an-hour lunch, Magdalena from the Reception came to tell us that the room was now ready and accompanied us there. 

Wow ! This was getting even better : a really nice king-size bed, the entire decoration in the characteristic black-and-white décor of the Red Carnation hotels, British style, and with a fireplace lit ! The room was equipped with plenty of little items everywhere proving attention both to detail and to the customer’s eventual needs (e.g. stationery in the desk drawers, umbrellas in the wardrobe), as one may expect of a five-star hotel of course. Everything I had previously requested online before (a chocolate box, a bouquet of white orchids, indoor gym bike etc.) was already there, including a copy of the beautifully edited cooking book by the owner of the Red Carnation chain of resorts, which “41” too belongs to, Ms Bea Tollman ! 

The bathroom was of a normal size but excellently equipped, in marble, with both walk-in shower and a bathtub, again in the black-and-white motif prevailing. Nice satin dressing gowns, slippers etc. were of course provided as well. 

We had a “view” on the Royal Mews on the one side, as the hotel is situated just opposite Buckingham Palace, although this was partly obstructed by the colonnade of the terrace. In any case, we had plenty of light coming in and, on the other side, a view over central London and as far as Hyde Park and its fun Fair. In fact, it usually took us about twenty-five minutes on foot to get to the East End.

Every member of the staff was extremely helpful and understanding throughout our stay with them: Monika and Magdalena from Reception, Johann (Assistant F&B Manager), always ahead of our wishes. Kindness, professionalism of the highest standard, and a personalized interest in every customer constitute perhaps the secret behind the sure success of “41”.  

Breakfast was always sumptuous, a rich buffet to choose from, anything you can think of, even champagne; everyday a different choice of Danish & pastries, then one could always opt for a full English breakfast or eggs anyway one wanted them. The buffet offered even fresh red berries such as raspberries or strawberries.

Moreover, there was a “plunder-the-pantry” possibility from 8p.m. to 1a.m. with a selection from nice salads, cold cut, cheese, pastry, fruit salad and much more. During the day one could also help oneself to different snacks, sweets and chips as well as nuts or different flavours of ice-cream. This is particularly useful if one goes out to do some sight-seeing around London or when one comes back late from downtown shows. And again, the entire staff always kindly available and still smiling, even at late times. 

A telling detail: next to the Reception desk there was a stand covered with luxury soap bars (such Fragonnard) to be taken and used by customers in their rooms if they so wished.  

A highlight worth praising was the wonderful “tea ceremony” which we ordered and which included tea of your choice served with differently filled sandwiches, scones and sweets on a three-layer serving stand. An experience certainly not to be missed ! 

Our warmest thanks, in particular, to Lauren (Resident Manager), Monika, Magdalena and Johann. They were all wonderful and surely made us want to return to “41”, hopefully for a longer stay.",5,2015,01,08
137,5/5 isn't enough - 100/100,"We stayed early December 2014.
Not only would I say this is the best hotel in London, I'd say it's the best hotel I've stayed in in the UK and Europe. 
We stayed for our 10 year anniversary. We checked in and sat in the lounge while the excellent staff sorted our room. 
We was shown to the room where all our belongings was waiting, with a happy anniversary card. 
The hotel is totally stunning, and I see a lot of buildings as a surveyor.
Everything is spotless.
The food is second to none, and the restaurant next door, Bbar, - wow. 
I cannot thank all the staff enough for making our stay a totally amazing experience.  
My only regret is not being able to thank all the members of staff that we had the pleasure of meeting during our 4 day stay.
We will definitely be returning to this outstanding hotel.",5,2015,01,07
137,Nine days (and nights) in heaven,"After reading the rave reviews online, we decided to give this hotel a try.  It was even better than we had hoped for.  From the welcome with champagne to our final breakfast before our departure, we were treated like royalty.  (The hotel is literally just down the street from Buckingham Palace, and at times, we could swear that we must actually be guests of the Queen, staying within her private domain.)

The atmosphere is one similar to that of a fine gentlemen's club in the Saint James district.  The main room, called the Executive Lounge, is filled with beautiful mahogany furniture and features comfortable seating, a cozy fireplace, and a very attentive staff always available to help.  The service is outstanding but understated.  Help seems to appear magically just as it is needed.  The name of the button on the room phone to get help is called ""Whatever, whenever"" and it meant exactly thata.  

We stayed for nine nights during the Christmas season, arriving on 22 December.  Our first pleasant surprise was to be informed that we had been upgraded to a more lavish accommodation that we had originally booked.  This gave us a very large room with the opportunity to really spread our things out and feel very comfortable.  We had chosen the plan that included full English breakfast, and we dined splendidly each morning.  Breakfast was ordered and then served to us by staff.  We helped ourselves to an extensive buffet, which included cold cereals, fruits, juices, and so on.  

We also spent many evenings just relaxing in the Executive Lounge.  Usually, there were only a few other guests and we felt that we were almost alone by ourselves in this magnificent room.  At 8:30 each evening, food was put out in the buffet area, consisting of pates, cheeses, desserts, and fruit.  This made for a wonderful evening meal, which arguably could be substituted for dinner.  And all this was entirely complimentary.

We cannot wait to return!!",5,2015,01,06
137,Simply a fabulous hotel with an exceptional staff,"My wife and I along with our 2 children (in their early 20's), checked in to the Hotel 41 on New Year's Day for a 4 night stay.  Upon entering the hotel, the staff led us to the lounge where we were warmly greeted and introduced to the wonderful comforts one will find there.  A beautiful wood paneled interior, exceptionally comfortable furniture, a warm fireplace all greet the senses.  As others have alluded to, the food was excellent and was unlimited in the evening.  Our suite and room were spacious and appointed beautifully.  From the hot water pouch in the bed for warmth to the wonderful jacuzzi and spacious shower, there was little if anything that was lacking in our suite.  

As great as the location, the beautiful interiors and amenities, the staff is what really separates this hotel from others.  They had the intuitive sense of how much to be engaged as well as any that I have ever experienced.  They were very warm and friendly, as well as completely professional and proficient in their manner and tasks.  We were all so impressed with the men and women that secured difficult tickets for us, served our beverages and food, answered our questions and looked after my wife and son when they were feeling less then well one day.  Thanks to all of you.",5,2015,01,06
137,Perhaps the best hotel experience we've ever had,"We stayed for a week over New Years holidays.  Everything was absolutely superb.  Every single staff member at the hotel was extraordinary and went out of their way to make sure our needs were being met.  There is nothing we would suggest to improve the service or the quality of the experience.  I do not know if all Red Carnation hotels are of similar quality, but I can confidently assert that none are better.  Yes, it is fairly expensive, but worth every pound.  We hope to go back as soon as we can!",5,2015,01,05
137,Feeling like a King and Queen,"Despite this Hotel being located next door to Her Majesty the Queen of England, the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty by staff and management. The Hotel interior is simply amazingingly royal and British. Warm friendly atmosphere greets you n arrival and leaving is like leaving home.
We booked a delux King room of which was simply flawless. Bathroom had bath and shower separated. The shower was always hot and fast flowing. Bed was like sleeping on a cloud, with attention to detail in room facilities we haven't experienced before in London or many places. An open gas coal fire in room made it all that more cozy. 
The central lounge area served for both breakfast dining and relaxation. Its huge ornate wood fixings, carpet, mezzanine floor made the ambiance very honely and comfortable. The drinks and snacks were of a high quality and you were told to feast at your hearts content whenever the hunger strikes. The staff here served us with enthusiasm and friendliness. Location could not be better as most tourist spots are walking distance or cab away.
Hotel 41 will now be our number one stay when in London.",5,2015,01,01
137,Beautiful Place.,"Hotel 41 is a beautiful hotel in London and definitely one to stay in. Anyone who's looking to stay in London I would recommend Hotel 41. Great hotel and at a very good price. The rooms, the view, the staff, the food, the service that you get is excellent.",5,2014,12,31
137,Simply the Finest!!!,"Certainly a jewel in London's hotel crown.  Like a private club.  Buckingham is just down the street. Rooms are beautifully appointed with every convenience.  The Exec Lounge is fantastic.  But the true excellence of 41 is its staff and their superb service.  The hotel's website is quite accurate, but doesn't do the 41 experience justice.",5,2014,12,31
137,Not quite as good as our first stay,"We recently returned from our second stay at the 41 Hotel, this time for 7 nights. We enjoy the 41 for its friendly staff and wonderful amenities. The location about a 5 minute walk to both Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station is fantastic. We also like that it’s about a 20 minute walk to either Hyde Park or Westminster Abbey. This review will compare our December 2014 stay to our 2011 stay a bit.

We requested, and got, the same room that we had last time. We like the spacious room that overlooks the Royal Mews and the large bathroom with a wonderful, deep tub and a separate shower.    

Upon arrival, we were greeted by the friendly doormen from the neighboring Rubens and  escorted upstairs to the check-in desk. The champagne while checking in is nice! We enjoyed seeing the 41 beautifully decorated for Christmas. 

Our vacation was a Costco package, so our stay included daily English breakfast, a 3 course dinner, and a tea. We appreciate Costco and the 41 offering this package. 

Breakfast is served in the Executive Lounge - a room with beautiful woodwork, a skylight and fireplace. Truly an oasis in the middle of busy London. The hot breakfast includes all of the items on the continental breakfast (cereals, fruits, muffins, pastries, meats, cheeses, yogurt, salmon, toast) plus a choice of menu items such as Eggs Benedict, Eggs Royale, 3 egg omelet with choice of fillings, bacon, sausage, waffles and more. It usually took 30 – 40 minutes for our hot items to be served, so breakfast was a leisurely affair before starting a busy day.  

Bottled water (both still and sparkling) is now included. During our first stay there was a charge. Also new this time was ice cream. There is a small freezer in the Executive Lounge stocked with small tubs of ice cream. The salted caramel flavor is yummy!  

Afternoon snacks in the Executive Lounge included assorted bags of crisps, chocolates, and small packages of candies and nuts. 

One of our favorite things about the 41 is Plunder the Pantry. From 8:30 p.m. – 1:30 a.m., delicious items are set out to enjoy. The shepherd’s pie, fish pie, and spiced shrimp were fantastic. Plunder includes an assortment of smoked seafood, cheeses, meats, crisps, salad and bread. One evening there was biltong, which we enjoyed. There was also a selection of tasty desserts each evening. 

Unfortunately, we experienced issues this trip that didn’t happen during our 2011 stay: 
1. Our reservation requested two beds, but we arrived to find the bed configured into a single king. This was fixed during turndown.  
2. Prior to arrival we asked about gluten free items for my daughter and were assured there would be something available for her for snacks. The first evening they made a toasted ham sandwich for her, which she loved, but after that she fell off the radar. She was very disappointed by this.    
3. At breakfast one morning my daughter and I ordered together. My food arrived and the server said my daughter’s was being “specially prepared” and would be served in 5 minutes. Instead it arrived almost 20 minutes later. It was pretty obvious that her order had been forgotten.   
4. We had made a dinner reservation before our trip but changed it after we arrived. The person we spoke with made our new reservation but neglected to cancel the old one, as we learned when our room phone rang 30 minutes prior to our old reservation needing to discuss an issue in the kitchen that would affect our dinner. We had to explain that this reservation should have been cancelled.   
5.  On two different evenings housekeeping knocked on our door to ask if we wanted turndown service. One of the times this happened, we had just spent an hour in the Executive Lounge for tea and had no sooner returned to our room when there was the knock on the door. During our 2011 stay they seemed to know when we were out of the room and magically appeared for turndown.
6. On the last afternoon of our stay we returned to our room to find that we couldn’t get in - our key cards had been deactivated by the hotel a day too soon.  

The 41 set the bar so high during our 2011 stay that they couldn’t meet their own standard for our 2014 stay. The problems listed above are small issues, but having so many of them during this stay had us leaving the 41 feeling a little disappointed.",4,2014,12,29
137,There should be another category above EXCELLENT?,The title of my review say it all but since I need 200 characters I will also state that I would challenge anyone to find a more service oriented staff. From the moment you arrive on the 5th floor you are at HOME!,5,2014,12,28
137,Fabulous hotel,"After seeing this hotel as number 1 on tripadvisor, we booked for 3 nights and have not been disappointed. From emails to check our preferences before arrival to the wonderful staff who have looked after us during our visit, I can't recommend this hotel highly enough.
The lounge is wonderful to relax in after a hectic day out, the choices of meals are great and saves having to leave the hotel for dinner if you don't wish to.
The difference between this hotel and many other great ones we have stayed in previously, is that they have thought of everything for you and nothing is too much trouble for them- many other hotels make this claim however in hotel 41 case, it is genuine as the staff team want to do everything they can to make your stay in London amazing.
This will be our hotel of choice whenever we come to London.",5,2014,12,28
137,the secret hotel,"This was our first stay here and I chose it soley due to trip advisor high reviews .I didnt expect it to be as amazing , unique and individual as it is . It is hidden away from view and doesnt even look like a hotel . The entrance gives you a feeling of glamour whilst the lift takes you up 5 floors to the sctual hotel . On check in the staff are friendly  professional and charming , nothing is to much trouble . The rooms exudes glamour and are striking in black and white with more than enough facilities . The bathrooms are perfect for relaxing , whilst everything including the toothbrush is provided for you . The service hotel 41 provide is second to none .They have an excellent array of food and drink plus plunder the pantry is a welcome sight at the end of a long day in london .This unique hotel is set near buckingham palace fitting really as your treated like royalty but is close to tube , coach and rail links . It is close to shopping and wicked , billy elliot shows .I am planning areturn visit in feb for daughter 21st birthday as I was extremely impressed and so was my husband as it was a weekend away for us from caring for our additional needs child so was special .we returned rested and ready to face xmas !!!!",5,2014,12,27
137,A very warm 'hot chocolate' welcome!,"We booked this boutique hotel solely because of its Trip Adviser #1 ranking and were not disappointed. 
From the moment we arrived, we began to understand how this small ""top floor"" hotel close to Buckingham Palace (that even the black cab drivers haven't heard of) had earned this prestigious ranking. The staff, without exception, were super friendly and professional and we were made to feel very special. 
The hotel's heart is the 'lounge' which we loved. There are lots of complimentary candy and snacks throughout the day, which was perfect for us as we were out for much of our time, shopping and site seeing.
Having stayed in lots of top 5 star hotels - particularly in Asia (which are always world beating) we tend to stay away from such branded hotels in the west as we always end up comparing and being disappointed. Hotel 41, may be small and may not pack the 'punch' of a conventional 5 star offering (which some people may not like) but boy did it live up to its status for us. 
We will definitely be back to what could easily become our second home!
A huge thanks to the entire team. ",5,2014,12,27
137,Once again No 41 delivers,"We continue to run out of wonderful things to say about this hotel and its outstanding staff.  They have once again made my wife and i's annual London trip perfect.  From the free flowing champange when you arrive to the tea by the fireside before you leave everything was done with a friendly smile, a kind word and genuine customer care.  The attention to detail is exceptional, especially for returning guests (thank you for the strawberries) and sets the bar over and above 5* standard.  It is not a cheap option but its incredibly good value.  We'll be back.",5,2014,12,23
137,Fabulous special weekend,"This is the 3rd time we have stayed at 41 and we took some friends for a special birthday celebration. The welcome we received was lovely and we and more importantly our friends were really well looked after for the whole weekend. The rooms are beautiful, the lounge and well stocked plunder pantry are wonderful and the service brilliant! Can't wait until we can go again.",5,2014,12,23
137,Wonderful hotel,"Our 2 night stay last week was amazing and everything that has been said in previous reviews is well and truly the truth.The staff at 41 do go the extra mile for everyone and you are made to feel special.I have been raving about 41 since I returned to work.Unfortunately as it was a treat from work I don't think we would be able to afford to go again,but at least we had the chance to sample perfection.Thank you to all the staff for an incredible 2 days.",5,2014,12,21
137,"Authentic Luxury, Authentic Service","My wife and I came to experience relaxation and comfort. We found authentically attentive (at this level we all know the difference) staff, who were so very kind. They couldn't do enough for us. From the doorman to Lauren Hargrave, Resident Manager, every member of staff gave a luxurious service to go with the 5*+ hotel.  Hotel 41 really is the centre of authentic luxury in the centre of London. 

There are so many extra treats, and I'd love to share them here, but you really want to experience the surprise of it all. Trust me it's wonderful. 

Our room was fabulous and we would love to stay there every time we return, which we surely will whenever we are in London. (Move over Dorchester) Hotel 41 is our new home from home. 

Thank you all at Hotel 41. See you soon.",5,2014,12,20
137,Exceeded my expectations,"First, this hotel is not for the bargain traveler. But, it it worth every cent. Good location in central London with short walk (5min)  to Victoria Station. But equally easy to walk to all the other locations in London. Small boutique hotel with very very personalized service. The entire staff should be commended for thier attentiveness and friendliness. I would stay at Hotel 41 again and again. 
I was visitng London for business/leisure.",5,2014,12,19
137,Our new number one favourite London hotel,"Stayed one night in mid-December as part of my birthday celebrations. From the moment we arrived we were treated to a master-class in customer service. At the reception, in the Executive Lounge, we were offered a choice of complimentary (vintage and non-vintage) champagnes. Our suite, on two floors, was very special indeed. After our theatre trip, we indulged in some terrific fresh snack foods in the beautifully seasonally-decorated lounge. Once back in our room we were met with a very romantic trail of rose petals and a crackling fire.

We slept very soundly and (after the best power-shower ever) had a very tasty breakfast with porridge to die for. Even after we checked out, we were invited back after our trip for some more treats.

We'll definitely be back next time we're staying in London",5,2014,12,19
137,Exceptional service,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for our anniversary in December, from the moment that we arrived I knew that I had made the right decision in booking Hotel 41. We were greeted by the door staff who welcomed us by name, then took us through to the lounge for checking in, we were offered a glass of (good) champagne and the lovely Lauren chatted with us about our plans for the weekend, offering assistance with taxi's, directions and even offering to book a local hairdressers for me.
The rooms were beautifully appointed, gorgeous furniture and fixings and one of the best beds Ive slept in.
When we returned in the evening they had turned down our room with candles, music and rose petals, such a lovely touch.
My favourite memory of the weekend will be returning to the lounge, sitting by the fire and having the gorgeous nibbles and wine from the butler's pantry.
A true retreat in London, we can't wait to come back.",5,2014,12,18
137,Many Happy Returns,"It's a little while since we stayed.  We are pleased to see the management team remains the same, which is unusual in London hotels, and we always receive a warm welcome back.  The consistency of the product and service is always first class.  The canapes and Plunder the Pantry offerings for the winter season are impressive, and they have even increased the choice of soap gifts at Reception.  The downstairs departure offering too, is lovely, with chocolate truffles to die for, other choices of sweets and savouries, and water and/or good coffee to take away for your journey.  Other hotels simply do not give these things away within the price. The hotel looks great for Christmas and we were pampered as always.  Our thanks to all the team, and see you in 2015!  C&L",5,2014,12,17
137,By far the best hotel we have ever stayed at!,"A couple of years back while on vacation at Disneyland, my family won the grand prize giveaway  which was a night stay in Disneyland's Dream Suite(above the Pirates of the Caribbean ride and originally build as Walt Disney's private apartment)  plus VIP treatment during our stay.  It was a once in a life time experience!!  My husband and I just returned from our trip to London where we stayed at the Hotel 41 and I would describe it was the same sort of Hotel experience as Disneyland's Dream Suite.  From the moment we arrived we were pampered!  They have thought of every detail and it shows!  The location was great, walking distance to many must-see sights and right across the street from Buckingham Palace.  The breakfast was amazing, and the snack bar they set up at night was a great touch.  Sadly we had only booked our stay for three nights and for the rest of our vacation my husband joked, ""well this is no Hotel 41""",5,2014,12,16
137,Wonderful intimate atmosphere,"This hotel is a special place ,the staff are particularly attentive and personal without being intrusive highly recommended for guests who prefer the  small and intimate atmosphere which is created superbly by all the staff at the 41",5,2014,12,15
137,The best hotel at which I've had the pleasure of staying,"Having only ever heard the reviews & stories of this hotel, and fortunately being a business traveller to London's 5 star accommodations, I was prepared for this to be another lovely boutique hotel. What I was not prepared for however, was the absolute joyous and uninhibited luxury of Hotel 41.

Even before we entered the secluded & regal lobby, the feel and impression of the building is clearly indicative of the luxury within. met by the most attentive & pleasant young lady, Roberta was welcoming, personable, and interested- immediately introduced us to the hotel. From the check in- at what can only be likened to a fine private club- through to our service at the lounge, the staff at Hotel 41 are by far the most courteous individuals I have had the pleasure of being around.

As wonderful as the lounge, staff, and hospitality was, we were then escorted to our bedroom- which again, raised the standard! Absolutely no expense has been spared and everything from the incredibly opulent Penhaligon cosmetics to the Lowe television and Bose ipod dock is pristine. every little detail has already been considered and the finishing quality on each detail is outstanding. 

I like to think that there is a way in which any establishment could improve- though I think, for once, this is a venue that is already perfect- and I am already looking forward to the next time I can recline in front of that wonderful fireplace with a glass of champagne and those beautiful English biscuits! 

To each member of the team at 41- thank you, for everything, and for making me feel like I was a royal guest at your beautiful home.",5,2014,12,15
137,Outstanding," my self and my husband stayed here to celebrate my 40th birthday. From the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out we were treated like royalty .5stars all the way I'd give more if I could loved every minute of it 😍 hope we have the pleasure of staying again.",5,2014,12,14
137,"Amazing, just amazing","Myself and my husband treated ourselves to a 2 night stay for our 10th wedding anniversary, and to say it was amazing would be an understatement. From the moment we arrived, the staff did everything they could to make our weekend as special as possible. The hotel itself is incredible, pure luxury, from having your bags taken at the lobby, to champagne to sip on at check in, fabulous food, and the lounge with its ""pantry"", a never-ending supply of tasty nibbles perfect after a day around London, or indeed, a night out around London.",5,2014,12,12
137,Fantastic stay at this fabulous hotel,"My wife and I just spent three nights at 41 and can't say enough good things about the hotel and the staff.  From the moment we arrived to the when we got in the taxi to leave, every interaction with the staff was incredibly positive, helpful, and courteous.  Their genuine desire to assist their guests is apparent - from making dinner reservations, booking tours, and helping with directions they are there to help.  The hotel itself was immaculate and every detail done to great luxury.  We will absolutely go back to 41 when we return to London and can't recommend this hotel, and it's fabulous staff, highly enough. Stay there - you will not be disappointed.",5,2014,12,10
137,Absolutely Outstanding,"My partner and I had the pleasure of staying at 41 for a two-night break from 5th-7th December.  From the moment we stepped away from the madness and noise of London into the beautiful black and white foyer, we were treated like royalty.  We were welcomed by Malcolm, the manager and his team; we were relieved of our luggage and taken up in the lift to the Executive Lounge to check in.  What a check-in!  A trolley bearing a selection of bottles of champagne was presented to us by Norbert and we were invited to choose.  Having completed all the formalities, it was suggested we sit in the lounge and finish our champers before going up to our room, Norbert kindly having served us delicious canapes and nibbles to soak up the bubbles.

I had booked us the 'Night To Remember' package in a king size executive room, but Magdalena on check-in informed us that we'd been upgraded to the Balmoral Suite, which was an unexpected and delightful surprise. What a beautiful suite!  The stylish black and white theme was much in evidence and we had two bathrooms, a separate shower room, a dining area, a lounge, a walk-in wardrobe/dressing room, a work station and the most enormous, comfortable bed you could wish for.  Our hospitality table and hamper were laid out and presented to the highest standard with fresh fruit, a bespoke cake, Hotel Chocolat chocs, a half bottle of Moet, nuts, sweets, high end toiletries and massage oils.  When we got back in from our sightseeing, it was like walking into some sort of wonderland! There had been candles lit all over the suite and rose petals scattered on the bed and in the bath(s) and even a hot water bottle popped into the bed.

There's a really great thing they have at 41 called The Pantry and I believe it is complimentary to every guest, regardless of what package they happen to have bought.  This is in the Executive Lounge and is available from early evening until 1am.  You can just keep going and helping yourself to the delicious array of 'little plates', a wonderful array of breads, cheeses, olives, terrines, pates, game, miniature fish pies, salads, fruit, berries and the most gorgeous homemade tartlets and little puddings.  You can either raid the pantry and eat in the Executive Lounge, or do as we did and take your plunder back to your room to enjoy.  Nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff who will offer to serve you drinks in your room with your food should you wish it.

Breakfast, as you would expect, was superb.  There was everything anyone could wish for, from cereals and the continental option to an array of cooked choices .... full English, Eggs Benedict, Eggs Florentine, kippers, hot tea and coffee of all varieties and very decent, non-soggy toast and preserves.  My partner and I are pretty low-maintenance, but I know for a fact if one or both of us had decided to be awkward and just order something like beans on toast (which isn't on the menu), the staff wouldn't have missed a beat and we'd have had what we wanted in front of us within ten minutes or less.

To sum up, 41 is an amazing place.  I read through some of the reviews on this site and was highly amused to see people complaining about being looked after 'too well' or the superb staff caring about their welfare 'too much'!  Hilarious!  If I'm having a special weekend away, I WANT to feel looked after, I WANT to feel like the staff care about my stay!  I don't want to be greeted by some grumpy misery sitting behind a desk who can't be bothered to speak to me once they've had my money.  So thank you, the two Magdalenas, Norbert, Malcolm and Monika and all the other wonderful people at 41 who made our stay so special and memorable.  We shall return!",5,2014,12,09
137,"Special, secret place","Our second visit to 41 and just love this little gem. Really don't want to share it with anyone else however it's too good not to recommend. Our beautiful cosy room was perfect, apart from external building noise but after mentioning this to the lovely in house team we were soon moved - and what a move. They very kindly put us in the amazing Balmoral Suite which was so much more than we could have wished for. We spent our evening in the relaxing, stylish lounge having cocktails and ""plundering the pantry"".  Tasty delicacies, both savoury and sweet. Such a treat and we are already saving up for our next visit. ",5,2014,12,05
137,WOW!,"We stayed at Hotel 41 back in November for my boyfriends 21st birthday. After looking on trip advisor and noticing Hotel 41 was rated #1 and reading through the amazing reviews I thought it were only right I booked to stay there for the occasion.  Hotel 41 contacted me before our stay with a preference form to see if we had any special requirements for example what kind of pillows we liked, in house massages, if we would like a bike machine in our room etc. Hotel 41 were very happy to accept special requests, they also asked if the stay was for a special occasion. 

When I first booked the hotel I did think to myself it was a little pricey, after visiting all I can say it was worth every penny, every single penny.  I did not want to leave, even though it was only 1 nights stay it was pure luxury it felt like a dream - my partner did laugh how upset I was when we left. I've already made sure he books a few nights for our anniversary, I really can not wait to go back!

We arrived around 1pm on the day of our stay, we were met by a lovely young lady called Roxanne(going off memory). Somehow we ended up walking right past the hotel but Roxanne came out to meet us so we knew where we was going which was most appreciated as we getting a little bit flustered as to how we had been so clueless to walk right past (the hotel is very close to the station)!!

We left our bags in reception and were taken upstairs by another lovely lady unfortunately we didn't catch everybody's names but I must say every member of staff offered the most amazing 5* service. We were offered complimentary champagne when we arrived and we were offered a seat next to the fire place to relax . Shortly a complimentary tray of canapés were brought over. After travelling for a few hours you can imagine how nice it was to be sitting in a warm lounge next to a fire place with canapés and champagne (complimentary topped up a few times  whilst we were in the lounge) - all we were thinking is we could get used to this. 

When we were ready to go to our room we were again offered another glass of champagne to take to the room, we were shown to our room by a very lovely gentleman Florence who really was AMAZING throughout our visit. When we walked in the room I noticed there were stairs - but I had only booked a executive double room which is one floor we were then told we had been upgraded to a Junior suite due to it being a special occasion . Well you can imagine how delighted we were to hear that! The suite was amazing and we will definitely be booking one next time!

We did pay a little bit extra for a romantic turn down - HIGHLY recommended for couples! When we came back to the room the fire place was lit, a bath had been run, romantic music was playing, a plater of chocolate strawberries had been made, there were rose petals everywhere and there was also a little birthday cake for my boyfriend.

We did take advantage of the 'anything, any time' button I must say! Every time our call was answered within seconds and request was dealt with promptly. We did check out of the hotel around 12/1pm to go shopping but they made it clear that we were more than welcome to come back in the evening before our train home for a complimentary drink and canapés which was nice after a long afternoon on shopping.

​​
I could go on and on about how perfect our stay was but in conclusion the hotel is in a great location. 'Plunder the pantry' was a great little extra we said next time we wouldn't need to go for dinner every night as there were plenty of things to choose from - meat, cheese, crackers, fish, bread etc, chocolates, crisps, nuts, ice cream and so much more . The rooms were lovely - the beds were very comfortable it was like being on a cloud. The room service was second to none, the breakfast was tasty and a nice touch having it in your room. The lounge is beautiful very comfortable and very homely. There are so many more extras that this Hotel offer that you wouldn't find in any other other - they have truly thought of every little detail. We couldn't find fault with one thing!!!

I will say though the one thing that makes this Hotel a cut above the rest is the staff. The staff were incredible we feel very guilty for not remembering names because they all deserve a special mention (we stayed Wednesday 19th November would be great to know the names) , they made us feel very welcome so much so we felt as if it were our home. No request is too much trouble for any of the staff, they are the reason Hotel 41 is #1 in London. 

Can't wait to come back!!!!

",5,2014,12,05
137,Great stay,"We just returned from 3 night stay at 41 hotel, the other reviews really cover it well. The staff were so helpful and accommodating.  We arrived early in the morning from an overnight flight from the states, and since our room wasn't ready, they offered us a courtesy room to use until our room was ready. The snacks available throughout the day were great and the room was spacious and very comfortable. On top of all that, location is perfect, near Victoria tube station and Gatwick Express train.  41 has spoiled us, we won't be able to stay anywhere else in London. ",5,2014,12,04
137,A haven of excellency,"A haven of peace, comfort, effortless quality & chic, nothing's too little, too small to make you feel at home, from the moment you arrive till the moment you leave.  And this in the heart of London.
Could recommend the place to everybody !!!
Filip",5,2014,12,04
137,Hard to believe,"My wife stayed at 41 two years ago and came home raving about the place, so when we went back to London last week we stayed there again.  It was my first time and I must say that it was the most pleasant hotel stay that I have ever had.  The staff are unbelievably focused on making everything you might desire come to be. Polite, helpful, attentive are simple words but its all real at 41. The Executive Lounge is another delight.  I can't imagine returning to London unless we stay at Hotel 41.",5,2014,12,01
137,This is Royal Treatment,"From Check-in to Check-out, the quality of pampering here is unsurpassed, anywhere. The staff took care of every detail, right down t o remembering our first names. The rooms were decorated with the latest fashions, with heated floors and towel racks to boot! Being situated within walking distance of all the attractions, this is the place to stay. The price is of a 5 diamond hotel, but well worth the stay.
Thank you Hotel 41......",5,2014,12,01
137,Magnificent,"I want to echo previous comments. This place cannot be faulted. Treated perfectly from the moment you book. Nothing has been overlooked, they must have taken experience from many other places and just tweeked them to make them even better. A million small things that make the whole stay perfect. We will return.",5,2014,12,01
137,We just keep coming back!,"Usually I see a review like this and think, oh dear, they have too much time on their hands!! but I just wanted to do this wonderful hotel justice.

This was our 3rd year in a row at Hotel 41 and this year we were lucky enough to stay in a suite which was just beautiful. Incredibly luxurious but still very cosy and homely at the same time. 

From the moment you step through the doors at this hotel you are made to feel like royalty.  We were welcomed back to the hotel like old friends and as we sat down by the fire with a glass of champagne it felt like we had never been away.  

This time we had the afternoon tea accompanied by champagne which was lovely and when we returned to our room on the Friday night, we had the turn down service which was so romantic.  These are extras that I would highly recommend to anyone wanting to make their stay extra special.  

There is always the worry that when you return to a hotel, that it won't be as good as the previous visit, but still, we have left wanting to book again for next year already.  This hotel isn't huge and its not right in the centre of London but don't discount it for these reasons.  We always stroll through Green Park onto Oxford street for a bit of shopping and its a really lovely walk.  Similarly, you can walk in the other direction towards Knightsbridge and Chelsea which is also so nice.  Despite it being top on Trip Advisor, it still feels like a hidden gem.  It never feels busy and you always receive such a personal service.  I could go on and on! Ive not even mentioned the amazing breakfast and the room service which is just out of this world, the deep bath and heavy fluffy towels, the dressing gowns and slippers, the treats by the door as you come in, the porters and the attentive (but not intrusive) waiting staff. Its all just wow and I can't recommend it highly enough. Thank you so much Hotel 41 for making our weekend so special yet again.  See you again next year.",5,2014,11,30
137,You will not want to leave!!!,"I knew I had chosen the right hotel even before we arrived when we received a detailed sheet asking us for our preferences for the room - types and number of pillows - humidifiers - yoga mats and DVD! Romantic Turndown, Express Check-In or Out, car transfers or theatre and restaurant bookings and even in-room spa treatments.  Everything about this hotel is geared to ensure that the guest has a wonderful stay - the location is perfect for access to all parts of London yet peaceful at the same time and close to green spaces.  The accommodation is relaxing and very comfortable - bedroom windows that open to provide fresh air - solid doors that close to ensure no noise during the night - proper hair dryers in the room - with long cables so no struggling to reach a mirror - lots of wardrobe space with ample hangers - the turndown service includes a summary of the next days weather forecast and a hot-water bottle in the bed as well as a little bag of chocolates.  But the real charm and asset of this hotel is the staff - each and everyone that we met was very friendly and helpful but no element of pushiness - professional and efficient but not overbearing or intrusive in any way.  
The purpose for the trip was a special one-off event for my daughter hence the decision to really push the boat out and I am so glad we did - the hotel upgraded us on arrival and made us feel very special throughout the stay.  We now need to unsure that we can think of an annual reason to return.",5,2014,11,29
137,5 and a half star !,"Spent three nights here recently. This is a classic boutique hotel - with exceptional staff.

From the moment you walk into the tiny but lovely (Harry Potter) reception - it is as if you are not in London. The hotel is very quiet despite being in a bustling area and next to a building site.

It is old English style - maybe not to everyone's taste - but certainly to ours. The food is very good - but it is the attention to detail and the exceptional staff that makes this a wondrous place. Very close to Victoria Station - so convenient to get everywhere.

Special mention to Magdelana for historic service. 

Cannot wait to return.",5,2014,11,28
137,Absolutley superb hotel!,"This is one the best hotels I have been too!
I love the design,  the layout and everything!
Really great service and wish I could stay there longer!
I would definitely visit again if I come back again on a visit!",5,2014,11,28
137,Excellent!,"Our fifth visit this November and wonderful in every way. Location good, attention to detail eg without me asking they put a hot water bottle in bed. The staff are superb make it the best we have stayed in London, with their professional but friendly service. We're already booked for the next visit.",5,2014,11,27
137,The best so far,"Simply amazing, a real gem, from the minute you arrive you know its going to be special, we were greeted like old friends & offered a glass of champagne whilst we checked in, nothing was to much trouble, the staff were superb, really was a fantastic experience. Would we stay again? You bet.",5,2014,11,25
137,Don't stay anywhere else!,Just returned from a simply marvellous 2 night stay. The previous reviews have said it all. The team are very professional in all that they do and attention to detail is second to none. I highly recommend this hotel as a place to stay in London don't stay anywhere else. We will most definitely be returning for a longer stay next time.,5,2014,11,24
137,"Superb Hotel, highly recommend","We wanted somewhere nice to stay and this hotel fitted our expectations. It's not often I give 5 marks, but this hotel was worth it.
The service and the attention to detail set this hotel apart from others. We only stayed 1 night, but could of stayed more. The little extra details and the welcome was great.
The only slight criticism was we stayed in 4108, and the creaking footsteps was quite noisy.
But apart from that wonderfully loomed after and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.",5,2014,11,23
137,Treated like royalty,"This hotel is in a great location, 1 block from the underground, very quiet rooms. Booking the room with executive lounge access gave us a place to unwind after a busy day of sightseeing. We had no desire to leave as the staff was extremely attentive and the wine/ snacks were excellent. The food from the menu if ordering was also delicious! We have to thank all the staff for the best stay we have had in any boutique hotel that we have stayed at. The stay made our trip to London extremely enjoyable and we will definitely try and get back as soon as we are able.",5,2014,11,20
137,Amazing stay,"Fabulous hotel - nothing bad to say at all.

I only booked Hotel 41 in the first place because it was rated #1 hotel in London on Trip Advisor and it didn't disappoint in any way.

Special mention should go to Monika and Flo who welcomed us with champagne and saw us off at the end of the stay with a glass of champagne - such a lovely touch.  

All the staff went out of their way to make sure there was nothing lacking, incredibly attentive, even down to the way they bagged up a selection of sweets for us to take home to our children.

The room was beautiful and as it was our anniversary they scattered rose petals all over the floor while we were out having dinner.

We will not be staying anywhere else on future trips to London and can't wait to return asap.",5,2014,11,19
137,Perfect,"Stayed at Hotel 41 for two nights. All I can say is that I will never stay in another hotel when I am in London this is the best hotel ever. The staff,  the room,  the breakfast well everything is just perfect.",5,2014,11,17
137,Very impressed,Loved this place good quality great prices and food locket staff was so impressed will be returning soon very impressed    Good location also and the bathroom in my room was amazing loads of hot water breakfast good quality,5,2014,11,17
137,A hidden gem of a hotel!,"Thanks  to TripAdvisor for revealing this hidden gem of a hotel to us! I was looking for a great hotel in London where I could really pamper my wife on her anniversary, and as always I checked TripAdvisor. Hotel 41 was highly recommended, so I went for that. What  a choice it was! Everything was impeccable,from location to service and amenities. We got an upgrade to a Junior Suite, which was amazing! It is clearly that the owners and management has a clear idea and philosophy of design, personal service and discrete attendance!
This is the best stay we ever had in a hotel, and we would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a special treat when celebrating anniversaries or similar.
Thanks again to all of the wonderful personnel at 41!",5,2014,11,17
137,Fabulous new find! ,"We were guests at the Hotel this past weekend and truly felt like guests in someone's beautiful English manor. The staff, accommodations, lounge and food/drinks were top notch! We are seasoned luxury travelers and really enjoyed this small luxury find in London. The jr suite has plenty of space, great king size bed, nice sized bathroom. Only minor complaint was that our jr suite bathroom had a very tiny shower stall. My husband could not use the rainhead  nozzle in the ceiling as it was too close to his head and he couldn't open his arms in the stall. He resorted to using the hand held sprayer. Very tiny shower! The access to the executive lounge with unlimited snacks and some drinks was a nice touch. The morning breakfast was also nice each day.  All the staff was professional and very kind. Marius and Norbert took great  care of us in the executive lounge. There was a very professional blonde young woman working the desk in the executive lounge...I never got her name but she was very helpful in many levels. This place has had excellent customer service training! We will return! ",5,2014,11,16
137,"Welcome back, welcome home!","There are plenty of reviews here that cover the great location, the beautiful rooms, the homely but luxurious club feel to the whole place and the delicious snacks available all day. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary so this was a very special occasion.

For me, 41 excels in the hospitality offered by everyone at the hotel. You can get great service in plenty of 5 star hotels in London but at 41 you get great hospitality. 

Hospitality is not just about meeting your needs but about how everyone makes you feel. 41 makes you feel right at home. Coming back late from the theatre I removed my boots and socks and put on the slippers provided before wandering into the lounge for drinks and nibbles. Marius made the Martini while we sat and watched the American football with some of the other guests while enjoying hot and cold snacks.

Feeling at home and being spoilt rotten in understated luxury is a rare combination and 41 is the best in the country.

",5,2014,11,16
137,Fabulous boutique hotel - still great on 3rd visit,"We had the oppotunity to stay here again recently and it is still as fabulous as the prior visits.  The staff is outstanding and truly care about your needs and what would make the visit perfect.   We had room 4129 which was larger than ones from our prior visit - it was very comfortable with separate shower and tub.  It also was laid out with essentially two rooms plus bath - with plenty of space for luggage as well as relaxing on the couch.   The food (breakfast, tea, drinks) were all great.  We love the ability to grab a snack from the pantry and sit by the fireplace.  The location is easy for walking to various areas and they are always ready to assist with any other transportation.  There are a lot of great places to stay in London, but we've never seen one where EVERY member of the staff is so attentive, friendly, and goes above and beyond.  Great place!",5,2014,11,15
137,Romance at the 41,"We stayed in the 41 in November nearly 9 years after our first holiday there and so the hotel has very fond memories for us. I wanted to propose to my partner and with the help and advice from Monika it was a truly special occasion. Monika and her team arranged rose petals on our bed saying ""WILL YOU MARRY ME"", there were more petals in the bathroom, a hot bubble bath and our favourite song playing when we walked into the room after being out for the afternoon. She even stayed on after her long shift finished to ensure it all went okay.

My fiancee was surprised, delighted, emotional and thankfully said yes.

I cannot add much to the other positive reviews on how wonderfully friendly and welcoming and helpful the staff are. Very comfortable beds, great breakfasts that you linger over for a hour or more and plundering the pantry is a treat late at night. This is a hotel for staying in and enjoying, not just sleeping in and doing the tourist sights. 

It is a very special hotel and one that we will be returning to as a couple for special occasions for many years to come (without the kids!!)",5,2014,11,14
137,Very good four star hotel,"This is an old Victorian railway hotel with a modern extension at the back.
The rooms are all clean and tidy and you have a choice of modern or older rooms but even the old ones have been restored very well. Rooms at the front tend to be a little noisy but not too bad.
The food is very good and you can have bar snacks, many of which are like meals or eat more formally. The key to this hotel's success is the quality of the staff from the General Manager right the way through to trainees.
The hotel is also trendy with lots of different artefacts all over like an old phone box, giant chair and interesting paintings and sculptures etc.",4,2014,11,13
137,Wonderful Stay at Hotel 41!,"My husband and I just returned from a perfect stay at Hotel 41. Our purpose for traveling was to celebrate my husband's birthday.  Thank you Mr Hendry and your wonderful staff for making this a vacation to remember. The hotel arranged theater tickets (great seats) and a wonderful birthday dinner. The room was very nice, very well appointed. The complimentary food in the lounge (including ice cream and chocolates) was excellent, the full English breakfast was delicious and the dinner at Bbar  restaurant (affiliated with the hotel) was perfect. Without hesitation I would recommend this hotel to anyone who desires a high end hotel experience in London. Once again, I can't thank the hotel staff enough for their kindnesses during our stay. This is really a special hotel.",5,2014,11,11
137,First class treatment,"We stayed at this gem of a hotel to celebrate our 20th anniversary. and were made to feel special throughout our two night stay. Everything was perfect from the warm & friendly greeting ( with complimentary glasses of champagne) when we booked in to the care that was taken in wrapping up my anniversary bouquet of flowers at the end of our stay. We were given a free upgrade to a charming split level suite which consisted of a small lounge on the ground floor and a bathroom and bedroom on the upper floor. The bed was huge and really comfortable with the largest softest feather pillows that I have ever slept on. The staff were attentive and friendly without being intrusive, nothing was too much trouble for them. Food was wonderful, we had full English breakfast & a champagne afternoon tea both of which were delicious. Additionally, there was a complimentary snacks bar ( sweets, dried fruit, nuts, ice cream)  available during the day, good quality canapés in the evening and a cold buffet ( sliced meats & cheeses) ready for a late night snack. Overall, an incredible never to be forgotten experience. Perfect venue if you need a central London venue to celebrate a special occasion.",5,2014,11,09
137,Can I rate 6 dots?,"Stayed here five nights while attending a conference and conducting business so needed the place to be home-away-from-home and the staff to be very on top of things. In these respects as well as all the usual categories for a boutique hotel, the 41 exceeded my already high (#1 Tripadvisor London Hotel!?) expectations. It's an exclusive hotel-in-a-hotel, on the fifth floor of the Rubens, and feels like a swanky private club. The lounge is beautiful and the goodies - ""plunder the pantry"" after-hours complimentary buffet, for example - generous and thoughtful. I peeked in a couple of rooms when making plans to return in two weeks. I had a gorgeous King room but even the little double room was beautiful and fully appointed. The bathrooms are pristine and roomy. The staff is outstanding - friendly, responsible, professional. Location good for being near enough to various work or tourist sites, Victoria tube and lots of buses, and the parks. I've stayed in other similar London hotels - Egerton, Number 16, etc. - and love them, especially for Knightsbridge or S. Kensington location, but this was something special. ",5,2014,11,09
137,A Special Experience at 41,"I just read rare negative review of this hotel and felt compelled to write my first ever review of anything on line.  I am typing this as my wife and I are about to check out of our first time stay at the 41.  We were here for 3 nights.  We decided to stay here based on the #1 rating Trip Advisor reviewers have bestowed on this establishment, despite being skeptical about the relatively high price.  

Let me say this was a special place, due to the special team in contact with their guests.  We would wholeheartedly recommend 41 to anyone.  A few points we want to make.  First, is it expensive (north of $500/night), yes. But you get what you pay for and there is actually value and special touches we rarely see in hotels we have stayed at around the world.  A full breakfast was included, as is a ""pantry"" which is not an accurate reflection of what they offer throughout the day/night.  It's basically a small buffet of nice food and drink.  Nice bottled water is included until you float away.  This alone is worth $100/couple if you know these 2 items are typically the most expensive things hotels ding you for when you stay.  

Second, the room size and special touches are noteworthy.  Is the room a little small?  Yes, by American standards, but the ""W"" properties are smaller and the 41 room includes things like towel warmers, rose petals and candles on our last night.  By European standards, the 41's rooms are not small and the bed was one of the 3 most comfortable we have used all over the world.  Taste in beds are very subjective.

Third, and most importantly, is the staff at the hotel.  I hesitate to use the term ""staff"" as in 3 short days, they almost feel like friends and family.  Attention to detail is extraordinary (custom maps on how to get anywhere, recommendations and reservations, both in London and Paris, etc.)  They were 150% attentive without at all seeming like they were hovering.  More like mind reading and anticipating what we needed.  Their professionalism is in the top 3 we have experienced in the world.

If you are going to London on a tight budget, maybe 41 won't be for you, but if you understand value and want to feel very special, don't dwell on the decision of where to stay, as we did.  Just choose this hotel and treat yourself to a really special experience at a boutique (just over 20 rooms) hotel where you will feel like you are leaving family when you check out.",5,2014,11,09
137,Best hotel ever,"Stayed to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday 
Booked this hotel because of the amazing reviews on trip advisor and would wholeheartedly agree with everyone's positive comments
This is a real gem of a hotel in the heart of London. The hotel has so many little touches that makes your stay so special. The staff are wonderful, making sure that every element of your stay is perfect. The food was fantastic - enjoyed a delicious 3 course meal in the excutive lounge and one of the best English breakfasts I have ever  tasted. Thank you hotel 41 .",5,2014,11,08
137,Lovely stay at 41,"My partner and I recently stayed five nights at Hotel 41 and had a perfectly lovely stay. As travelers who love a boutique, intimate hotel experience this was a perfect choice. Situated in what we considered a good location - near Buckingham Palace and the Victoria station - this hotel, as other travelers have said, feels like an exclusive club. On arrival your bags are left to be delivered to your room while you're offered a beverage and snack prior to a quick and painless check-in.The hotel has a modest entrance, always manned by a personable staff member, with a lift that leads you through a maze of corridors to the Executive Lounge. The lounge is the hub of the hotel and a great space for a snack, evening beverage or game of cards. The evening snacks are a welcome-back treat post theater or after a long day of sightseeing.

We stayed in a split level junior suite. It's an elegant space with a super comfortable bed, lovely bathroom (great water-pressure, bathtub and products), all the amenities you would ever need and exquisite housekeeping service. At turn-down you're provided with slippers, 'sleep spray', and a weather forecast for the following day (appreciated touch). (Note to management: be aware of your clientele. My partner and I, both men, repeatedly came back in the evenings to find his and hers slippers waiting bedside - even after leaving a tip and note for housekeeping signed with our names. A nice touch, yes, but, again, know your guests).
 
Staff was consistently helpful with restaurant recommendations and reservations, theater tickets, taxis and assistance with general questions. Always professional with a big smile.

We'll be back in London soon and 41 will, for sure, be our hotel of choice. Expensive but worth the cost for the luxury and service.",5,2014,11,08
137,cramped and overrated,this hotel has tiny rooms hard beds and staff that watch you all the time. At the prices charged we expected a lot more. It was like staying in an overstuffed guest house overseen by a landlady with a beagle eye. When asked for directions staff had to look up the nearest theatre (5 mins ) walk away on the computer and then sent us to a road which has been closed for some time now with building works.,2,2014,11,08
137,Wonderfull experience,"We stayed one night for my wife's Birthday. This hotel and its staff are brilliant, I was expecting a lot having read the reviews on here but our stay surpassed my expectations. If you are comparing hotels in London in this price bucket;stop comparing and just book hotel 41.",5,2014,11,04
137,Dream like state...,"Hotel 41 greeted me with such wonderful service.  The people are very nice and friendly and the dining experience is excellent.  The hotel is very intimate, personal, and charming.  I felt like I was at home in a very exclusive hotel.  The hotel is not open to the general public, so my privacy was maintained.  For a large city, I expected to hear much noise from the road while sleeping.  However, the room I had (#4114) was very quiet.  Dickson waited on me and was very friendly and personable.  The rest of the hotel staff treated me very nicely.  I only have good things to say about this Hotel.  The location is awesome.  It is very near to Victoria Station (to your left as you walk out the hotel) as well as Buckingham Palace (to your right as you exit the hotel).  I felt like I was in a very proper English hotel and loved the ambiance.  I would definitely recommend this hotel.  This also was my very first time to London.",5,2014,11,02
137,Special weeekend,"Highly recommend.

The service is the best that I have ever had in London.

Nothing is too much trouble.

Rooms are of an exceptionally high standard.

Cannot fault it a all.

We stayed on a Friday evening and went out for the day Saturday.

The hotel looked after our bags all day and invited us back in the afternoon for a glass of champagne and some food! 

Amazing! ",5,2014,11,02
137,Pretty perfect!,"The hotel was perfect for a 3 night stay: comfortable bed, taxis out front, central location, fabulous food for meals or snacks, gorgeous sitting room. But the best part was the young, enthusiastic staff  always available to help. Can't think of anything I'd change!",5,2014,10,31
137,Speechless. Fantastic hotel. ,"Up until our stay here I often stayed at The Landmark and 51 Buckingham Gate which I would say are some of the best hotels in London. 

However having Stayed here I have changed my mind. We had an utterly perfect stay, which went above and beyond our expectations. 

The attention to detail in all aspects of the hotel are mind blowing. If your thinking of a special night away I couldn't recommend it more. 

We will without doubt be returning and it's certainly the best hotel I've ever stayed in to date.   ",5,2014,10,31
137,Perfect,"My wife and I stayed on 29th October. A great experience from start to end. The staff were brilliant, they listen and care in a way that makes you feel that they really want to look after you - not because they are told to, but because they want to. The decor is great and the rooms perfect, clean with comfortable beds and crisp fresh sheets that just make you want to stay in bed!  I have already booked for my next visit...",5,2014,10,31
137,Faultless,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 a few weeks ago and from the moment of arrival (with my favourite champagne) to departure, the accommodation, staff and level of service were faultless.  Having retired from a career in hospitality I thought I knew a thing or two about customer care and well trained staff but the team at 41 surpassed all my expectations.  

Our room was extremely comfortable and the rose petal turndown with candles and light music was an unexpected delight. Snacks were available all day with the mini shepherd's pies served during Plunder the Party time - my husband's favourite.

We stayed at the Ritz last year as this was always one of my ambitions. And, although it was very nice,  I have to say Hotel 41 has definitely come out on top!  Looking forward to showing 41 off to my daughter and granddaughter on another trip to London next month.

Lucy & Neil",5,2014,10,29
137,A magical experience,"My wife and I stayed as a surprise 50th birthday celebration at what is truly a 5-star boutique hotel. The staff was fantastic. They provided personal, friendly, exceptional service from before we arrived until after we left. That alone would have been worth the stay. Add to it 4 nights in the Conservatory Suite with its all glass ceiling and lots of extras the hotel provides, such as an excellent breakfast, ""raid the pantry"" throughout the day (and night), a room to take a nap and freshen up in while waiting for your room to be readied, and you have what is a magical experience. Hotel 41 is one of the best kept secrets in London. We look forward to our next visit.",5,2014,10,27
137,What a little gem in the big city,"We have stayed here 3 times now, twice this week and I have to say it is a little gem in all the hustle and bustle of London. The hotel, the rooms, the service and the food and also the staff are fantastic. From the moment you walk in and receive your glass of champagne to the check in process and then when you come back at the end of the evening you can chill out by the fire and have cheese and biscuits and wine. All the nibbles are included in the price too. When we got back saturday evening our room was covered in petals and everywhere was lit up with candles. Beautiful I absolutely love it. Anyone looking at this hotel will certainly not be disappointed.",5,2014,10,27
137,Excellent as always,"Our second stay at this Hotel, we were there in 2013 and it was wonderful to come “home”.
We were greeted as old friends and it was wonderful to see Lauren, Monika and Magdelena again and also to meet Malcolm the General Manager.
As always it’s a lovely way to check in with a glass of “Verve” and have a catch up on what everyone has been doing in the last year.  This time we were in Room 4119 which had a little downstairs lounge area (TV, Fire, fridge) and then you go upstairs to the bedroom and bathroom.  
Good sized bathroom with quality amenities and whilst the shower was a little small in size everything else about the property outweighs this.   Whilst the room was smaller than the ones we had stayed in in 2013 we were only here for a couple of days as part of our 30th Anniversary trip,  there was sufficient room for us and the luggage and to feel we had room to move, there was a lovely “Happy Anniversary” cake in our room and a Welcome Back card.
As per my last review of this hotel in 2013 it’s the people who make this hotel and the service and I cant recommend them  highly enough.  One night we arrived back from our Anniversary dinner to rose petals all throughout the room, stairs, bed and bathroom and a lovely red rose and candles which was a lovely touch.
Breakfast as usual was very good and again our juice and tea/coffee preferences were always remembers.  One thing that I felt was even better than last year was “The Pantry” this year there seemed to be more substantial food at night, one night we had lobster, prawns and beef wellington – amazing when you consider this is complimentary.  I believe they have a new Chef.
The hotel is centrally located with Victoria Station tube a few minutes’ walk away and then you can walk around Buckingham Palace and Green Park up to  Trafalgar Square.
I can’t rate this hotel highly enough and also they have now River Cruises through their Hotel Group which we are looking forward to doing in the next year or so.    Again a wonderful stay .",5,2014,10,26
137,Swanky excellence!,Our stay was perfect in every sense.  The staff at Hotel 41 was incredibly accommodating and fantastic to work with through the whole process from booking inquiries until after our return home.  We had a small billing inconsistency upon our return home and the staff quickly rectified the situation.  We were well tended to while there and our accommodations were perfect and comfortable.  Hotel 41 is in a fantastic location!  So glad that we chose to stay here!  Hope to return someday!  ,5,2014,10,26
137,Superb Position and Service,If you want to stay in a friendly small five star hotel this is it. Pampered from the moment you step inside the staff are there just for you. The hotel is quite small and distinguished. Don't expect flashy lobby pool and gym! Expect discerning and classic high end service. The staff will help you with everything and will all know what you are doing and be interested in you having a great holiday and experience. The rooms are classic and comfortable and have plenty of space. The bathroom was clean and big enough with a bath and separate shower. Opposite Buckingham Palace and close to the action in London. Food and snacks laid on all day and into the evening. How lovely to go out and get back yo the hotel for a coffee and light snack before bed! And you don't get hit with a bill every time you eat! Impeccable staff who really know their business. Would I stay again? Yes. ,5,2014,10,26
137,I would stay here every time if we could afford it,"My mother and I managed to meet in London for a lovely three-day girly break prior to my first wedding anniversary, and since this is very rare for us (we currently live at other ends of the earth), I insisted that we stay somewhere very special.
Like many Trip Advisor fans, I chose Hotel 41 based on others' reviews. This is the first time my expectations have been truly exceeded.
The ever-lovely assistant manager Monika is a gem! When we were in the USA, I tried unsuccessfully to book London theatre tickets on my Australian credit card and I emailed her ahead of our stay to ask her to book them for us which she did. She also easily secured a table for me and my husband for our first wedding anniversary for the following week at Belmond Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons which is normally booked out months ahead.
The staff always took the trouble to ask us specifically what we were doing for the day and to ask us afterwards how it was, which I cannot remember any other hotel ever doing. This simple gesture makes you feel so appreciated as a guest that other hotels should take note!
We stayed in a mezzanine Junior Suite which was gorgeously decorated in stylish black and white, spotless, with Nescafe coffee pods,a good-sized desk, twin beds upstairs, a gleaming white bathroom with huge bath and separate shower, and seriously more drawers and storage than I have ever seen! Had it been wintertime, we would have enjoyed lighting the fireplace and watching TV downstairs in the ""lounge"" on the sofabed. As an unexpected touch, they had a Happy First Anniversary chocolate dessert waiting for us on arrival. in our room, next to the fruit platter. 
We seemed to have trouble working out the lighting system (ie which light upstairs or downstairs controlled which lights) but this is not their fault and we really should have rung to ask someone to show us how it functioned.
For the three nights we stayed, we enjoyed relaxing with a drink, after having dinner or going to the theatre, in the stylish executive club lounge which by morning doubled as the breakfast area. If you were travelling alone, it would be a nice place to meet other guests. 
This lounge had a mezzanine area which on our last morning we had breakfast. Maybe it is too easy to overlook or forget guests when they are seated in the upper mezzanine, but when my husband asked for his barely cooked bacon to be redone crispily, nothing had arrived after 20 minutes. Unfortunately we had to check out (they had kindly let us park in the street behind the hotel until 10am) so we couldn't wait for this to be rectified.
Still, this is a very tiny issue on a wonderful stay and if we could afford it, we'd make this our London hotel always.",5,2014,10,26
137,Another Perfect Stay At London's Hidden Gem,"There is very little I can say that I haven't already said about this wonderful property. The staff perfectly exemplify never-say-no hospitality, with each and every member of staff taking the time to better know and understand their guests. The dining was excellent as always, as were the provisions on the pantry. 
Overall another lovely stay at 41 and I will no doubt return.",5,2014,10,26
137,Excellent,Stayed for our anniversary. The staff couldn't be more helpful and welcoming. Our room was small but comfortable and had everything you could possibly need. Only had breakfast but couldn't fault it. Will definitely stay again and would recommend to anyone.,5,2014,10,25
137,EXCELLENT jewel in London!,"Hotel 41 is a lovely jewel in London.  Fantastic location near Buckingham Palace!  Amazing service, food, rooms...PURE GRACIOUS HOSPITALITY!!!!  It feels like home!  From the champagne welcome throughout each day's amenities, Hotel 41 has it all.  A quiet, lovely respite in the midst of busy London!",5,2014,10,24
137,Overdue review!,"I've stayed here with my wife at least 20 times in the last few years, and will always look to 41 first when booking a place for myself or friends.  While the amazing rooms and common spaces come as standard and outshine the other top hotels in London, it is the personal service and welcoming team looking after us during our stays that always stand out.  

They remember us by name, face, and even voice on the phone after years between bookings!  They know what we like and don't like, and prepare our room accordingly in advance whenever we are staying there.  For example, at my wife's suggestion, they provide a free standing full length mirror which is already in situ when we get to our room (the ladies will appreciate this, I am led to believe).  

Simply a super hotel with all that one would expect from a top shelf hotelier in London.  By the way, it is not their fault that we always over indulge in their breakfasts, which are not to be missed!!!",5,2014,10,23
137,Posh and service-oriented hotel very close to Buckingham Palace.,"The staff are excellent at the hotel- everyone gets to know you and tries to assist you in any way they can. The rooms are comfortable and well-appointed. Soft towels and comfortable sheet/bedding.  There is a lounge area which is stocked with drinks and snacks 24 hours a day and that offers meals and cocktails as well as tea. The room we booked had air conditioning problems the first night of our stay and the staff moved us to a new room that was larger and even more beautiful. They gave us complimentary champagne and waived our first night's charge because of the AC problem. While we were at dinner, the staff lit candles and placed rose petals throughout our room . They went well above and beyond our expectations. We will definitely return!",5,2014,10,22
137,Wonderful,"I stayed at this lovely hotel last week and it was a truly superb and decadent experience.  As soon as you walk in the door you feel taken care of.  The executive lounge and the rooms themselves are luxurious and you feel totally pampered.  From check in with champagne, to the plunder the pantry, there was nothing that was missed.  The staff is wonderful and they pay close attention to detail.  My room was lovely with a view of the Royal Mews.  Located about a 5 minute walk from Victoria Station, I was able to navigate the tube to all the wonderful landmarks.  I will definitely be visiting again and I can see why they earned this rating on trip advisor.  Truly a classic elegant hotel.  Can't wait to visit again.",5,2014,10,22
137,Very very excellent.,IT ios in the prime place for a hotel and the rooms are spotless. The staff treat you well and it deserves all the acclodaes that it has received. All the services are propt and friendly. Not a big hotel but the roomsc are a fair size. Hotels in London are expensive.,5,2014,10,21
137,Fantastic Hotel!!,"Two weeks ago my husband, my son and me, we were at the Hotel 41, and everything was perfect, in the 3 days we stayed there.. The big smile in our arrival, the welcome cocktail, our amazing suite!! The cozy lobby and the great service in all our request, every one was promptly resolved and always with an incredible attention and great smile.

Usually we are going to London 3 times a year, And this was our first visit to the Hotel 41, was great we did it!..  For sure in our next visit to London,  we will back to this beautiful and charming Hotel !!

Thank you Piero, Remus, Simone, Paula, Yohann, Mitchel and Stefanie, every one of you made to us feeling like at home with all your attentions and great service!!

137,A gem in the heart of London,What a remarkable hotel.  From the minute we arrived it felt like home.  On arrival we were greeted at the door with a glass of sherry and from that moment on we were totally pampered.  I was a bit nervous about booking a hotel in that price bracket but I was not disappointed and will certainly be staying here next time I visit London.  The beautiful lounge was like being at home curled up with a magazine.  Totally worth the money.,5,2014,10,16
137,A one night stop over for a special event,"I booked 41 after googling ""best hotel in London"" as I had a special occasion in London. The booking process was excellent and the lady on the telephone was very attentive.the location is a 4 minute walk from Victoria station. On arrival the whole experience started to snowball into sensory overload. The staff are fabulous, the facilities excellent and the bedroom... Well, I booked the basic room, I dread to think what the suites will be like. Our room had a mezzanine floor and a swimming pool for a bath, with 3 TVs in the room.
The hotel is small , and if there is a con to the pros it will be the cost. However, even though it is not cheap, it is value for money, and that for a 5* is not an easy thing to address. If you can afford to stay at 41 it is a must stay hotel in London. Does 41 justify the Google tag of best hotel in London? I haven't stayed in every hotel in London so I cannot be qualified enough to say ,  but now I have found 41, I won't be looking elsewhere for a long time to come.Fully recommended.",5,2014,10,15
137,Where to begin...........,"Our experience began from the moment we entered the doors to this hidden treasure.

We were taken up to the lounge where we were checked in - with a glass or two of bubbly!

We were then taken to our room - we had been upgraded and my breath was well and truly taken away by this amazing suite.

On entering you arrive at a cosy seating area with an a open fireplace, with stairs leading up to our bedroom - and when we go up to the room - the ceiling blinds were drawn back to reveal the most amazing window - we were in the conservatory suite.  The room was spacious, well decorated and well kept - with a Jacuzzi bath tub and walk in shower.

After dinner, we returned to the hotel and had a nightcap in the lounge then on returning to our room we were met by rose petals leading from the door to the room up to our bed where there were freshly dipped chocolate strawberries, massage oil and romantic music playing and we could enjoy this with a view of the stars.

We were treated to a superb breakfast in bed... and then unfortunately we had to pack up and leave........ It was such a relaxing and wonderful little treat in London.

The staff at this hotel are just fantastic and so on the ball - from the moment you walk through the door they know you name.  You are not rushed at all and even on check out we were offered another glass of bubbly if we wanted it.

I cannot fault this hotel in way!!

Def worth a visit!!!

I would love to return !!",5,2014,10,13
137,The best,"This really is your home from home this is the second time my partner and I have stayed the experience just gets better and better from the minute you arrive at check in you are made to feel at Home immediately and greeted by a genuine friendly face . Hotel 41 has it all , frendly and helpful staff great location ,palatial rooms and the executive lounge is the best place to relax and enjoy the treats available all day from the pantry in front of the open fire . We enjoyed our visit so much we have booked again for December , looking forward to seeing the Christmas tree",5,2014,10,12
137,Fantastic ,"There is a reason this is one of the top hotels in Europe.  You'll not find better service or such a sense of exclusivity and privacy anywhere else.  The private library lounge is often a private retreat leaving you feeling as if you are living the life of a billionaire.  

Many rooms have fireplaces and are a particular treat in cold winter months.  Worth the upgrade from the Rubens when you are able.  ",5,2014,10,11
137,HOTEL 41 - EXCEPTIONAL!,"We have just returned to New Zealand from another wonderful three night stay at Hotel 41.  Hotel 41 you didn't disappoint - exceptional service, luxurious rooms and above all wonderful, friendly staff. 
Our special thanks must go to Monika whom I dealt with after staying two years ago - it was lovely to be greeted by a familiar face and we cannot thank her enough for making our stay special with our daughter Natasha. 

Hotel 41 delivers on all counts - great proximity, great staff, fabulous food and above all it is very central to all activities.  Victoria Station is close as is Buckingham Palace and the parks.  Breakfasts are wonderful and the chef is to be congratulated for delivering such good food and snacks every day.  It was always such a lovely treat coming back to Hotel 41 for afternoon tea - relax in the surroundings and soak up the ambience.  

We will be back Monika - rest assured - hopefully before another two years. Thanks for the candles and rose petals - you know I love them.  Hotel 41 is the place to stay in London if you want somewhere special, quiet and not too many people.  
Diane & Richard",5,2014,10,07
137,Even better service the second time around,"We stayed at 41 in the fall of 2013 en route to Nice France for the winter and promised ourselves that every time we pass through London we will always stay at this hotel. In our previous review we commented on the personal service which was the best we have ever experienced in a hotel. In September 2014 on a return trip from the Baltic to Canada, we once again had the pleasure of spending wonderful nights at 41. How was the service better this time? As we walked into the reception area, we met Monika, who had looked after us so well in 2013. She remembered us instantly by name. Everything else for the next three days was as great as the last time. So guess what? On our next trip to London, we will be back at 41.",5,2014,10,05
137,I can think of 41 reasons why we must return!,"This small hotel is a unique experience in a city known for superb hotels. Situated between Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station it's a haven of peace and luxury in London. There is always one person, sometimes two, sitting inside the front door who welcome you as if you were an old friend.You are escorted up a hall to a lift which takes you to the 5th floor where all the rooms are situated. You are ushered into the lounge a very bright and comforting room on two levels, more staff are waiting and after greetings ""would you like a glass of champagne""? They  explain that this is the main area, breakfast is served here, other meals too. The bar in the corner is well stocked with a buffet opposite with canapes provided from 6pm to go with the champagne. From 8pm there will be sandwiches and other snacks. Afternoon tea with home made scones, cream and jam is always available.
Our room was very comfortable with a king size bed and other attractive furniture, the bathroom has everything one could possibly want. The staff are seemingly chosen for their pleasant and attractive attitude - it really is a home from home. Our stay was memorable.",5,2014,10,05
137,Almost perfect,"Stayed the weekend to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary and had a fantastic time. Champagne on arrival, flowers and a cake in the room with tealights and rose petals; fabulous food available at all times; great breakfasts, well trained staff who know what to do and an upgrade to a junior suite.

The decoration and ambience is pure class and whilst the Executive Lounge feels a little like a gentlemans club, it isn't pompous or intimidating like some quality hotels. 

Everything about this hotel makes you feel special.

One criticism only - the bedroom ceiling height. At 6'2"" tall I was just about OK . That did make the bedroom feel just a little cramped but with a huge bed and dark mahogany furniture and a massive TV it did fit a lot in.

It's not cheap - but it's worth every penny.

Wonderful place.",5,2014,10,05
137,A Must Stay in London!,"This review is long overdue as we stayed on September 5th for my husband's birthday. I can't stop thinking about our stay and how it was absolute perfection. From being greeted with the champagne trolley to the gorgeous canapés in the evening and then of course the room! Absolutely stunning! I can't even begin to recommend this hotel enough and I've told all of my friends that if they have the opportunity, and a special occasion to celebrate, this is the place to stay if you want a real treat. The staff is superb and really make you feel special. The attention to detail in everything they do is genuine and well thought out. This hotel is faultless and I just can't wait to go back!! Hotel 41 is a real gem in London. It's a special place and will hold a special place in my heart. Thank you to the staff for making our stay so memorable. ",5,2014,10,03
137,Luxury for those bored of the large london hotels,"This hotel is very small and feels quite exclusive - its rather different from the larger london hotels

The style of the rooms make you feel a bit like you are staying in a converted part of someone's home - like a luxury bed and breakfast.  They are not the standard size and shape seen in other hotels, but have all  luxury amenities and service of a five star hotel. So this place is great if you are bored of the standard format hotels

If you want intimacy and privacy this is a good place to stay.  If you want spend time in large grand foyers and dinning rooms maybe not..... However, you are more likely to get to know your fellow guests in this sort of hotel. The reception area lounge is the only public area and is cosy. 

We stayed in an interesting room.  A small dinning area leading up stairs to a bedroom with lots of skylights.  I think this was one of the best rooms the hotel had to offer.  I thought that the quality of the soft furnishings and the quality of amenities, was very good.  There were treats on the pillows. 

The bathroom was great - the best bathroom ive been in for amenities- jacuzzi bath and a TV.   You don't get this everywhere.  A bathroom like this is important and makes the room one you want to spend  time relaxing in the hotel room.  

 The  location is good for most tourist attractions in london - especially Buckingham place and Big ben.  Its near a number of green parks

Only downside is the hotel could use a slight interior decor update - i think the black and white theme is a bit old fashion and some of the leather bound items could be updated.  There are also no views from this hotel,  but the room with large skylights is a novelty.",5,2014,10,01
137,A special place,"My husband surprised me with a stay for my birthday. This is a hotel that makes you feel special from the moment you are greeted with a glass of champagne. The staff certainly know how to look after you and nothing is too much trouble, our room was lovely and luxurious and the only problem was not being able to stay longer.",5,2014,09,30
137,perfect,"We stayed at this hotel as a treat when we came to London for the great British Pub awards.
The Staff and management were faultless as was the food. we would not hesitate to recommend
this hotel. The late night buffet is inspired and very welcome after a long night out",5,2014,09,30
137,Birthday delight,"My husband and I stayed for his birthday and it was fantastic. The staff were excellent, the rooms divine, the food at the attached restuarant was bliss, we even bought an umbrella it was that good!!! Highly recommended for a romantic get away, being in the city its the one place that is quiet in London and we loved it.",5,2014,09,29
137,Indulgence at its finest,Hotel 41 is a pricey hotel so staying here really was a treat for my boyfriend and me. Having said that it was worth EVERY penny. Talk about being pampered. My boyfriend described Hotel 41 as a hotel from a movie due to the level of customer service all staff members exhibited at all times. The all-day rotating snack bar is a nice touch and the lounge has a very comfortable atmosphere. It is true that the rooms (or at least the one I stayed in) are a little on the small side but the experience of staying here overcomes any small inconvenience this may cause. Would definitely stay here again the next time we’re in London.,5,2014,09,28
137,Number one Hotel in London on tripadvisor ?,"Normally when in London I stay at the Savoy or Claridges but I also rate highly No1.Aldwych, The Grosvenor, The Four Seasons at Canary Wharf and the May Fair.I have always been curious however as to how 41 gets to rank as the best hotel in London on tripadvisor .I therefore decided last week to stay there .I was not disappointed.The Hotel is exceptionally good, the reviews are accurate and it deserves its ranking.The staff are indeed as good as any I have come across worldwide not so much for their supreme competence but more for the relaxed way they undertake their duties in a way that leaves you with the distinct impression that enjoy what they do and take enormous pride in maximising your enjoyment.Red Carnation Group Hotels continue to impress.",5,2014,09,28
137,Superb!!!!,"Before I even try to describe how ""Superb"" the 41 is I want to say that my wife and I have never had a more enjoyable stay at a hotel than we had at Hotel 41!  That says a lot as we have traveled much over our life together.  Have you ever teared up when you had to depart from a hotel?  My wife could not hold back the tears when we said goodbye to the best hotel staff we have ever had the opportunity to be so close to.  Lauren, Marlen, Monica, Piero, Johann and all the other staff became our family away from home.  They don't allow any small detail to be missed and do it with a warm smile and a caring attitude.  Here is a great example.  We went out to the show ""Wicked"" at the Apollo Theatre close by to the hotel.  When we returned home from the show and entered our room there was a signed poster by the two leading stars of the show laying on our bed!

Two thoughts, first if you go to London this is the place for you! Second, become part of the family at Hotel 41 and enjoy the most wonderful away from home experience you will ever have in a hotel!  We will be back!!!!

Dave and Linda Hirsch",5,2014,09,28
137,One Word,"If I was allowed to write one word, it would be ""Amazing"".  From the minute that you arrive in this hotel, you will feel, completely enveloped in the quality and service.  The staff are polite without being over deferential.  Enjoy....I did!",5,2014,09,26
137,A wonderful experience.,"We chose Hotel 41 because of its Trip Advisor ranking and reviews and we were certainly not disappointed. This is the perfect hotel for those who desire perfection and warmth in service and accommodations. It's location around the corner from Victoria Station and across from Buckingham Palace is great as we we enjoyed walks through Green Park everyday there. The staff is the friendliest, most conscientious and helpful of any I have experienced sans the arrogance that is often displayed. Our two story suite a bit ""tight"", but perfectly quiet and tastefully done as is the entire hotel.  It may not be the place for the bar crowd, gym rats or those looking for the scene, but if you want comfort, impeccable service, location and quiet, this is an experience you might also find wonderful.",5,2014,09,25
137,Wow wee,"did the queen stay here once? Cause it's so fancy I loved it I suggest going here treat your self once in a life time opportunity spend the big money and Stay here's it's amazing and a tv in the bathroom wow love it, cleaners were amazing cleaned so well and dressed nicely too all the staff a big thank you for making my family feel at home",5,2014,09,25
137,Best hotel staff I've ever encountered.,"I wasn't crazy about the rooms (personal style) but the staff is absolutely outstanding and you get much more than what you pay for. They have free stuff everywhere in the room and are incredibly accommodating. Even though it's got a classic boutique hotel feel, it is incredibly modern. And best part besides the staff is the free wifi !",4,2014,09,24
137,Absolutely fantastic!,My first impression the beauty of hotel. the hotel was charming as a perfection and can be complained. staff is very excellent and attentive. Absolutely fantastic!. this was the best hotel in London in my opinion,5,2014,09,23
137,AMAZING!!,"Hotel 41 was fantastic.  The location was convenient to everything, as it is centrally located across the street from Buckingham Palace.  It is also only about 2 blocks from the Victoria tube/train station.  The hotel feels more like a special club!  Every single person that works there is professional, kind, and caring beyond belief.  They truly want you to be as comfortable as possible.  When we first checked in, they showed us to our junior suite, a split level room.  As I had just taken a bad fall, my legs were not happy with any extra stairs.  When I inquired about alternative rooms, they responded immediately by moving us to the Balmoral Suite- a huge hospitality suite- for no additional charge!!  We also appreciated the endless options for food and drink as we were always on the go during our 4 days in London.  We often came back late in the evening for dessert and a drink.  Breakfast was great too.  The concierge team was helpful with suggestions, directions, and reservations.  The room was very comfortable- great bed, amazing shower!!  We loved Hotel 41 and would definitely stay there again!!",5,2014,09,20
137,"Whatever, Whenever","Without a doubt, one of the finest hotels in the world. We have stayed in the best Mexico has to offer and all over Europe, and 41 has them all beat. From top to bottom the service was impeccable and intuitive. The property is tiny and intimate, and even though there are other guests it doesn't feel crowded; rather, it feels like home. The staff are well-educated and cheerful. Most have traveled the world and we found them to be a good resource for recommending other far-off places to stay. 

The best part: the Whatever, Whenever button on each phone. Just pick up the receiver, hit the button and speak. There is seemingly nothing the staff cannot accommodate. Whatever you want, Whenever you want it - this is the guiding principal and it's utterly impressive to see it in practice. 

A big thanks to Monika, Stefan, Flo and the many other staff members who made our first visit to London so memorable. ",5,2014,09,20
137,Greatest Hotel and Staff in London,"My 14 year old grandson and I have been traveling to London for the past 3 years and we always stay at the 41 Hotel.

137,Best boutique hotel in London,"My parents visited London recently and we all stayed here, I have to say it was one of the best hotels I've stayed in.  I'm not a jet setter, but I know quality service and performance when I see it.  Great staff, great location, wonderful food. 10 out of 10 for these guys.",5,2014,09,17
137,Impeccable Service,"The staff at this boutique hotel, just near Buckingham Palace, were among the best I have ever had serve me in any hotel, in the world. Nothing was too much trouble and their attention to detail was evident at every turn. If you want to be wowed, try this.",5,2014,09,16
137,Amazing experience,"My partner and I chose the 41 to celebrate a special anniversary and were very pleased with our selection.  The hotel and staff are fantastic. I have traveled extensively in the U.S. And internationally and the 41 is undoubtedly the best hotel I have stayed in.  The excellence of the hotel is due in large part to the staff.  I want to give special mention to the manager, Lauren, as well as Stefanie, Alina, Florent, Marius, Norbert, Paula, Marlen, Juliana, Simone, and Yohan, all of whom were extremely professional, courteous, and genuinely concerned about ensuring that the needs of all guests are met.  The hotel staff truly exemplify the motto ""no request is too large or small"".  In fact, they focus on guest comments and go above and beyond to create a memorable stay.  Not only were we provided with a wonderful celebratory pastry to commemorate our anniversary, we were also given a romantic turndown service with rose petals and candles -- fabulous!! Additionally, after I mentioned to Stefanie that I prefer a certain type of soda which is apparently not readily available in the U.K., we returned from sightseeing to find that the staff had acquired the drink and left it in the room.   Incredibly thoughtful and appreciated!!!  Bea Tollman, founder of Red Carnation hotels, you have a jewel in the 41.   

In addition to the staff, the hotel itself is lovely and well maintained.  The dining experience is also fantastic, including breakfast, afternoon snacks which are plentiful and varied, and the delightful plunder the pantry options in the evening.

Although the hotel is not inexpensive, it is actually quite reasonably priced considering the caliber of service and all of the extras included.  All future trips to London will include a stay at the 41.  Cannot say enough good things about the 41 experience.  Very well deserving of no. 1 status on Tripadvisor.",5,2014,09,14
137,Outstanding service,"We spent one week of our honeymoon with the family at hotel 41. I say family because you literally felt at home. The staff are extremely lovely, helpful and will help you with anything at any time. Such a central location and overlooking the Royal Mews which is awesome. Easy walking distance to the tube and local attractions. Good was superb and for me, the service was top notch. Thank you so very much for a brilliant and comfortable stay. ",5,2014,09,13
137,Our Crown Jewel,"Planning our first trip to London, we were given an extensive list of 5 star hotels. We chose none of them and instead decided to take a chance on TripAdvisor's #1 rated hotel. I think all who have had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 would give it 6 stars.  What a special place to spend our first time in London! From the moment we arrived and were greeted with delicious, flowing champagne, to the moment we left, when we hugged the staff goodbye - it was impeccable hospitality.  Attention to detail is amazing, ""plunder the pantry"" is exactly as it promises and more, and staff goes far beyond what could ever be imagined to make your stay special. This beautiful little gem is a magnificent jewel in the queen's crown and made our visit to London one we will never forget.",5,2014,09,11
137,It is definitely worth it's #1 ranking on Trip Advisor,"We just returned from our trip to the UK and Paris and selected Hotel41 based on the reviews on TripAdvisor.  The hotel exceeded our expectations in every way!  Hotel41 is a boutique hotel (28 rooms) and part of the Red Carnation Hotel chain (which we were not familiar with prior to our trip).  The hotel itself is adjacent (part of) Ruben's Hotel at the Palace.

A note to travelers - if you are traveling to the hotel via taxi, tell the driver to take you to Ruben's, none of the taxi drivers we used had heard of Hotel41 by name.

The service is impeccable, and you could not ask for a better location (across the street from Buckingham Palace) - close to Victoria Station for train and tube access.  

We have traveled and stayed at many 5 star hotels, Hotel41 is definitely in our top 3 hotels to stay!  We will definitely be staying here on our next visit to London.",5,2014,09,11
137,Amazing hotel,We stayed in this hotel while visiting central London. The hotel was amazing and the staff who was working at the time very friendly. Also its fair to add the rooms were very clean. Good value. Highly recommended.,5,2014,09,10
137,Amazing experience!,"Everything about this hotel is fantastic. The deserts at night are delicious the ice cream fridge is great, definitely take advantage of their pantry. The staff is fabulous!  I hope we can came back!!!",5,2014,09,10
137,"""Mike & Doree's Home away from home""","The 41,Rubens & B-Bar are a must if you're ever in London. The staff, better yet the ""family"" here are like no other's we've experienced throughout our travels both in the U.S. and Europe. We have visited London 3 times over the last 6 years and have made them ""our personal home away from home."" To say that you feel like family is an under statement, Never before have we left a property knowing the names of most of the staff as well as they knowing our's. We can not thank them enough for their genuine hospitality and friendship, anything you want or need they all are so happy to accommodate. So, to Monika, Magdalena, Lauren, Remus, Stephan, Flo, Dave & Nathan a very heartfelt thank you and we'll see you again soon.",5,2014,09,10
137,A Sanctuary,"The excellent staff make this hotel special, they seem to intuitively recognise what guests need and create a sense that each guest is being treated as an individual.
The rooms are well maintained and creatively presented. The central lounge was described as the ‘heart of the hotel’ by the staff and became a relaxing sanctuary for us between shopping and dining excursions",5,2014,09,10
137,Excellence with a personal touch,"We have visited Hotel 41 on 3 separate occasions and have already booked a fourth visit.

Immediately their attention to detail is what struck us the most:

On our first visit my fiancé waited for me in the executive lounge while I parked the car. As she sat by the fire place just by moving her hand over the fire place where there was a slight draft, a member of staff came over in moments and asked if she would like the fire out on. When I joined her for the complimentary glass of Champagne you receive on arrival, the lady serving me opened a fresh bottle to top up my glass which to my eye was pretty much full! Immediately impressed, we soon realised this would set the tone for this and future visits.

Having asked for extra pillow, larger slippers for my fiancé and the ingredients for a Bloody Mary (I bring my own Vodka and tomato juice), all of these items are in our room, on arrival, on subsequent visits without our asking. 

The staff are of the highest calibre; friendly, chatty and helpful.

There is an 'anything, anytime' button on the phone in the room and it truly does deliver. Using this facility we have requested warm snack, scones, hor d'oeuvres and even a bowl of popcorn all of which have been brought courteously to our room.

The hotel will prove a picnic basket if you wish to go to St James Park nr the palace for the afternoon and of course there are round-the-clock nibbles available thriugh their 'plunder the pantry' service. The food that is provided in the evening is of particularly good quality.

How much extra do all these services cost? Zilcho! All the above is included in the price.

Hotel 41 is not the cheapest! But if you wish to spoil yourself at a well situated, well staffed boutique hotel with quirky, stylish rooms then we would recommend 41. It is an excellent getaway, perfect for the West end theatre district and as you can see we can't speak highly enough of it ;)

Although we have found all the staff to be excellent, special note must go to Mr Tyrone Kidney and Ms Monika Skrzynska who have been great.

Notes to the visitor:

There is parking behind the hotel on Warwick Row. (If you staying over the weekend, parking here is free from 6:30 pm on Friday. We typically arrive at 4 ish on Friday and pay just £5 or £6 pounds for our weekend parking)

Don't be afraid to use the anything, anytime button. The staff are courteous and efficient and genuinely make you think that nothing is too much trouble.

You will get an email about your 'preferences' before arriving at the hotel and this is great if you have any particular needs.

Try breakfast in your room; we haven't been charged a tray charge yet and it is a nice lazy way to start your day.

Enjoy :)

137,Amazing hotel,"This was our first stay at Hotel 41 and will not be our last time. From the receptionist to the managers, everyone is very friendly and they make their best to always make you feel welcome. I hope we can came back",4,2014,09,08
137,"Like a Private Club with 1st Class, Personable Service!","This was our first trip to London so we spent hours researching hotels since we wanted to get it right.  We did! 

 First off, the location is great. So close to Buckingham Palace you could join the Queen for breakfast if so invited. She obviously was not aware I was not in town as I did not receive the much anticipated invite. Oh well, her loss. Many fine restaurants and other historical places of interest are within walking distance or a short cab ride away.

The guestrooms: All located on the fifth floor of this boutique hotel. They were quiet, well appointed and afforded a comfortable night's sleep. 

The service: This was exceptional. The staff's willingness  to take care of the guest and make them feel welcome is what sets this hotel apart from any I've visited in the past.  Upon arrival we were made to feel welcome and enjoyed a champagne breakfast after our long overnight flight from the States.

 Since our room wasn't ready yet, we were given another room in which to shower or nap in if desired. This greatly refreshed us and helped us take on our first day in town though we had little to no sleep.

 The executive lounge where you enjoy drinks, snacks and meals is comfortable yet makes you feel like you are a member of an exclusive club. 

The staff will know you by name and will gladly assist you with reservations or tips on seeing the city.  We had a great four nights here. I think that if the Queen were allowed an endorsement, she'd give Hotel 41 her royal stamp of approval!",5,2014,09,07
137,Felt like heaven!,"This was the first time we have stayed at the 41Hotel but will clearly not going to be the last one. Everything in this Hotel is just made to a maximum level of perfection. From the receptionist to the managers, everyone is very friendly and they make their best to always make you feel welcome. We have stayed at the 41Hotel for a very special occasion, and we could not have asked for me.  Not just the service is 5 starts, but also all the food served in the morning on in the evening. Just perfect! Highly recommended! A very close peek on what heaven might feel like :)",5,2014,09,07
137,A Special Hotel With Outstanding Service,"This was our first stay at Hotel 41 and will not be our last time.  Our stay was just exceptional.  The hotel is located right near Buckingham Palace and relatively closely to two different theaters and lots of other places to visit and also near many restaurants.

The hotel rooms are on one floor with an exceptional executive lounge that serves breakfast in the morning and various other snacks throughout the day and evening hours.

From the moment we entered the main entrance we were taken care of by the exceptional staff who looked after our very need.  Nothing was a problem for them and they were very charming and gracious and they truly know what personal customer service is all about.

Thank you to the entire team at Hotel 41 who took such terrific care of us during our stay.",5,2014,09,05
137,Amazing trip,The hotel was great and the hotel lactation is really fantastic and the hotel manager was friendly and any kind of information the manager he always give me  the new information and he always help me. I want to the hotel again.,5,2014,09,04
137,The Best Vacation Ever,"We can only give Hotel 41 the very highest rating of excellence. From the moment you arrive and are warmly greeted by the concierge to the gorgeous rooms, easy and friendly checkin, the unbelievable presentation of food and all the amenities, you can not find a better hotel experience. We booked our vacation through Costco Travel and
they added to the Hotel 41 experience with their excellent help and prices. Go to London and stay only at Hotel 41.",5,2014,09,04
137,insert superlative here..,"I have stayed in a lot of places and travelled all around the world but there is no doubt in my mind that this is the best hotel experience I have ever had. From the moment I walked in I felt at home, comfortable, cared about.

Hotels often give good service and staff often look like they care about the service they give but in this Hotel they dont have staff, they have hosts.

Hosts do more than staff and care more about how you feel. To be a good host is not a job it is a lifestyle and a vocation, not everyone can do it, not everyone wants to do it but here the people of Hotel 41 do and they do so exceptionally. From the moment we were greeted at the doorway to the moment we popped back in to collect our bags at the end of the visit after a hectic visit of the capital.

I single out Lauren because it was she who we said our goodbyes to but all the staff were truly delightful.

I could speak about the good quality location and the high standards of cleanliness but at this level that should rightly be taken for granted, it is the people that make this hotel the place that it is and the place is good, no great.

It made our trip to London the best trip ever.",5,2014,09,04
137,Simply the best! Thank you Hotel 41.,"What a fabulous hotel! We stayed here for two nights to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special, being a small hotel the staff know all the guests names and show a genuine interest in your daily plans. We can't single out anyone as they were all excellent!  Our room was beautifully decorated in the hotel's black and white theme, we had an accessible bathroom with bath and separate walk in shower. Lots of fluffy towels and lovely Penhaligan toiletries added to the luxury. There was a lovely cake on a table with 'Happy Anniversary' piped on the plate and the staff also sent us a card.  It's the little touches that make Hotel 41 stand out - we mentioned that we were going to see Billy Elliot and later that day found a signed programme in our room. Breakfast was delicious and plunder the pantry is an excellent idea. Loved the little bags of sweets in the afternoon!",5,2014,09,03
137,Wow!,"Having stayed here to enjoy a mutual birthday celebration, I am convinced that no other hotel could possibly compare to this amazing find. In all honesty I am very wary of my next stay that is anywhere else but here as there is little hope of this experience being surpassed ever. From the moment the little champagne trolley was wheeled out as part of the very wecloming check in to the thoughtful touches throughout the stay, the service here is truly second to none and the facilities are beyond wow! There is luxury hotels and then there is this property!",5,2014,09,03
137,Exceptional hotel and staff!,"From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave you have a wonderful,experience. Service and staff amazing. Very good location close to dining and shopping. Concierge was one of the best ever and gave great tips on what to do and see.",5,2014,09,03
137,"""Secret hotel"" that you don't want to share with anyone else","What an amazing place! We stayed here for only 3 days but will definitely return in the future. Not a typical 5 star hotel, this place is a definition of a boutique hotel with lots of character and signature English decor. Those people who are looking for a modern hotel with all of the new tech updates should probably stay elsewhere. With only 28 (?) rooms, staff knows theirs guests by name, communicating with concierge is easy and service is great. Having a 24/7 pantry room, free of charge (except for alcohol) was definitely a plus.The room did not have a nice view and typically I would complain about that, but the accommodations made me totally forget about that. The decor, our own living room and an amazing lobby/club room made up for that. 

One suggestion for the hotel is to have a private car service. At times traffic is pretty bad, hence the busy and one of the most touristy streets in London, so the the wait time to get a cab can take a while. 

Arriving early before check in time was not a problem. We were given a temporary room to relax after a long flight until our room was ready. 

You almost don't want to share this hotel information with anyone else so it's is a like your secret place to go to but the hotel deserves recognition.",5,2014,09,02
137,Yes!,"Cannot explain how luxurious my 2 night break away was. 
Fantastic hotel, worth every penny and the staff are very friendly and helpful. 
Expensive rooms but would only be a problem if the room was not worth of price. 
Will certainly return in near future! ",5,2014,08,31
137,Made very welcome,"The best hotel I have stayed in - also one of the most expensive hotels I have stayed in but worth every penny. I wanted somewhere very special for our anniversary and looking on tripadvisor this seemed to fit the bill. I was not disappointed the staff were very attentive nothing was a bother to them. Although it seemed expensive everything was included including champagne on arrival, snacks in the day and breakfast. The only problem is if I now take my wife anywhere else she will be disappointed.",5,2014,08,30
137,Very special,"This was a special 2 night break for our wedding anniversary . This is the best hotel I've stayed in .
Fab fab, nothing was any trouble, great breakfasts and service, attention to detail on everything.
From booking in with champagne to afternoon tea, I can honestly say there was nothing to fault beautiful. 
Would return at any given chance, expensive but was a wonderful treat.",5,2014,08,30
137,Superb birthday stay,"Having combed Trip Advisor for suggestions where to stay for my wife's birthday, it was soon apparent that this hotel was somewhere very special to those who stayed here.  The hotel staff made us feel so welcome it was just the spot to celebrate.  Nothing was too much trouble, always on hand to help but never over-zealous, giving time and space to enjoy the lovely atmosphere in the hotel.  The 'Plunder the Pantry' was a revelation, another very positive plus as it allowed an opportunity to sit and relax between trips out to enjoy the city. There can be no doubt that this is one of the very best places (if not the best) to stay if you are in London.",5,2014,08,29
137,"""The"" Hotel in London","This was our second stay here and this time we chose a junior suite (stayed in the magnificent conservatory suite on our honeymoon) and found it to be very spacious and very comfortable. Service was very smooth and everyone was eager to please (continually being offered tea/coffee/champagne).

We were warmly and royally welcomed back by Monica, Lauren and Juliana. Prior to checking in, we stopped in to say hi and was offered champagne and had a nice chat with Stef. 

Breakfast was excellent as was plundering the pantry every evening. The romantic rose turn down one evening with all the candles was very special and romantic.

I don't know what else to add from our previous review and what others have said, except we plan to stay here on our annual family visit to the UK. See you next May.",5,2014,08,28
137,Our 25th Wedding Anniversary,"Greeted on our arrival by friendly staff & taken to the Executive Lounge where we were served a glass of champagne.  Escorted to our room only to find out that we had been upgraded to a fabulous room.  Inside a congratulations cake & sweets.  We had canapés & plunder the pantry, then we went back to the room to find evening turn down, candles, rose petals & music.  I was very emotional.  Cannot say enough great things about Hotel 41.  Staff very attentive, relaxed atmosphere.  We fell in love with the Hotel & did not want to leave.  Made a promise to each other, that when we come back to England, we stay here again.  Treat yourself & stay here, you will fall in love as well.  Thank you to all the staff for making our special celebration even more wonderful.",5,2014,08,28
137,A 2nd visit within last 3 months,"We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in May of this year and again in August.  We love this hotel.  The service is fabulous lead by the wonderful, Lauren.  All of the staff was so friendly and helpful.  All requests were filled - they got our tickets for everything we wanted to do and made all our dinner reservations.  We booked the included breakfast and it was so very good!  Great canapés at cocktail time in the lounge.  The location of hotel is great, we walked all over the city.  Whenever we go back to London, we will definitely stay at 41.",5,2014,08,27
137,Outstanding boutique hotel,"This is a small boutique hotel with outstanding service. It's quirky and individual and will not appeal to everyone, but I really like it. The interior is all wood, brass and mirrors, and the heart is the executive lounge which functions as reception, bar. lounge and restaurant. The relatively small number of rooms allows them to offer a very individual service. The breakfast is wonderful, with a wide range of hot options to supplement the cold buffet. In the evening substantial snacks and drinks are included in the rate.
Rooms are all very individual -I have stayed in three different ones. Non has had a great outlook, and indeed you can argue that they are rather dark. This, coupled with no outdoor space tends to make me regard this as a winter hotel, rather than a summer one. But not a big issue for me as I am generally out during the day anyway
The rooms are very well equipped, as are the bathrooms, which have incredibly powerful showers. Delicious fresh fruit was provided in the room, replenished every day - not just a couple of manky apples which gradually go soft during your stay.
I think the rates are competitive when you consider the level of service, and what is included. 
It is different to many other places you will have stayed, but when you are next in London I do recommend you give it a try",5,2014,08,27
137,5 Star Service!,"We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel 41 while we were recently in London. We were thoroughly impressed with the impeccable service and location of the property. Monika and the rest of the team was absolutely wonderful and helpful in every way. They took care of many of our reservations and had insightful recommendations. 

There is some construction going on around the hotel and the location of our room was in an area that we could hear some of it. We informed the personnel and immediately they brought us a fan to block out the noise. We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and they made it a very special occasion for us as well. Again, their attention to detail is amazing!

If you prefer the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel with more people around-this would not be the place for you. This is a quiet and relaxed boutique hotel that allows you to unwind after a day in the busy city. 

We loved it! We will stay here again on our next visit to London.",5,2014,08,27
137,Wonderful oasis!!,"My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41. From the moment we checked in, they made us feel so at home. We had lost our luggage and they were incredibly gracious & kind about helping us get some supplies. The evening we stayed was my birthday & it turns out that before even checking in, the concierge and team had been helping my husband arrange a surprise for the evening at a local restaurant. They really went out of their way to make it a memorable night. The service is not only outstanding, but feels genuine & sincere. The hotel is beautiful and the personal touches -- particularly the food in the sitting room -- make this such a great oasis from the hustle and bustle of London. This is a gem & we look forward to our next visit.",5,2014,08,26
137,One of the best in London,"I am not easily impressed, however; on this occasion I was. Would like to say that it is an absolutely amazing cave to escape and relax and to enjoy pure luxury.

The best thing about this establishment is their personnel. True professionals in every sense. Fabulous!! Nothing is too much trouble and with a huge smile on their faces.

Most amazing bed in my suite. Like a huge fluffy cloud. Slept like a baby!

Attention to detail is added to absolutely everything.

Truly impressed and will be returning soon.

Great location for exploring if you are visiting London for pleasure rather than business.",5,2014,08,24
137,Fantastic service,From the moment we arrived the service was impeccably efficient and friendly too. The check in was seamless and the choice of arrival drink a lovely touch. The room was very well appointed and decorated with lots of toiletries and towels. There service was very personal and the staff all remembered our names and asked about our theatre trip on our return to the hotel. We loved the plunder the pantry in the evening with the selection of tasty treats. This was in the executive lounge which was a great place to relax any time of day. The breakfast had a great selection of quality items including excellent cooked choices. We have visited four different Red Carnation Hotels. They are all very good. This is the best. ,5,2014,08,24
137,The Perfect Proposal,"What an amazing experience! For months I have looked at different ways to propose in or around London but failed to find something special. I am glad I chose Hotel 41!

Weeks in advance I was given the opportunity to discuss every single detail with the Hotel team. It was planned so perfectly that when I checked-in I thought they had forgotten about what was supposed to happen.

A Proposal in the rooftop of the hotel with a champagne tasting experience and canapes. The actual proposal was made using telescope pointing at an adjacent building with a message: ""Will you marry me?"". Over the course of the evening we had the opportunity to then see the stars and the moon - Pretty romantic and unique! The following day we went for a picnic in St. Jame's Park, which is just a few minutes walking distance from the Hotel.

The executive lounge in the hotel is an excellent spot to relax and have casual conversation. Everyone was extremely kind, attentive and friendly, the breakfast was delicious and I will certainly return to 41 - A truly memorable experience!",5,2014,08,23
137,Lovely small boutique hotel with the perfect location.,"This 28 room hotel does feel like a private club instead of a hotel. If you like very small hotels  then this is the place for you. As you walk into the front door off the street, you are directed up to an elevator to the executive lounge which is the check out/in area/ breakfast area, etc. A beautiful room for sure. We stayed for one night only as a layover and were in the Monarch Suite, a small 2 room area, and my husband and I both had separate bathrooms and a door bt/ the bedroom and living room. It was perfect for us, I cannot image anymore than 2 people staying in any of their rooms or suites. The location is great. Overall we really liked this hotel, not loved it. My husband summed it up perfectly, and but would go back again, but it was a little claustrophobic for him.  The service and the staff were outstanding. Room tip- ask what the sq footage is in each suite and get the biggest one you can afford.",4,2014,08,21
137,One of the Best in the World,"There are only two places in the world we have stayed that came close to the service we experienced at Hotel 41. Lauren, Victoria and Steffan (amongst several others I cannot recall) were simply amazing and went WAY above and beyond what we hoped for. Their constant refreshing of snacks and food in the main area (not sure if that is what they call it) was also awesome, they took really, really good care of us and I also appreciate a place that uses brilliant branding. You will find the 41 logo on almost everything in your room which, as a marketer, I thought was cool. We highly recommend this place and it is easy walking distance to Buckingham palace.",5,2014,08,21
137,Amazing,"Everything about this hotel is fantastic. The deserts at night are delicious the ice cream fridge is great, definitely take advantage of their pantry.  The staff is so fabulous, always there but not intrusive and they don't stand around awkwardly waiting for a tip (I hate that). The bed is so soft and comfy, the shower and tubs are also fabulous, best shower head ever. Champagne on arrival with fresh berries waiting in our room and a pillow menu I case you need so something different.",5,2014,08,20
137,"Wonderful stay, lovely staff and very convenient location","We stayed at the Hotel 41 in the Balmoral suite for four nights in August 2014 with our three children and we cannot say enough kind words about the staff who were so gracious and accommodating to us - and especially to our children who are 8, 11 and 13. We travel quite a bit with our children and Hotel 41 was one of our favorites of all time. From giving us bus map apps, to helping us with tour tickets, to ""fixing"" our tv (our own tech deficiencies), to the fresh fruit in the room and delicious snacks in the Executive Suite - the staff was incredible. 

We came to the 41 after spending a week in Ireland where we had quite large separate rooms or suites, so all of us were worried that we'd be on top of each other in one suite -- but that was NOT the case at 41! We were so happy with the 2 full baths plus an extra, separate shower as well as the room that we could close off - we did not feel cramped, and we all slept well (the bedding is really comfortable).

We loved the cozy atmosphere of the hotel and the fact that there wasn't a huge, noisy restaurant or rowdy bar. 41 is perfect for families, couples who want a quiet getaway or business travelers who want a good night's sleep. Though don't get us wrong, we hung out in the lounge area on more than one night enjoying a glass of wine or two after dinner ….

The location is perfect for those who want easy access to Victoria station (which will take you virtually anywhere in the city) or those who like to ride the bus - which we do, being former NYC'ers. Taxis are readily available but we honestly did not need to take one except to the airport as we could walk everywhere we wanted to go, hop on the tube or bus and be at our destination quickly. 

We will definitely be staying at other Red Carnation properties (and we hope Hotel 41) in the future - it was the highlight of our 2 weeks abroad and we miss it already!",5,2014,08,19
137,Another world...,"I booked this hotel at the last minute as I wanted to be close to my first meeting.  After flying in on a late flight from NY I arrived around 11 pm but was greeted by a friendly staff, glass of champagne and buffet of appetizers in the lounge.  The lounge itself is very formal, old world and an experience by itself.  The room was not big but was well appointed and had everything I needed.  I liked the idea of the ""plunder the pantry"" concept but did not stay long enough to take advantage of it.  I was not crazy about the gym access at LA Fitness as the gym was not ideal but clearly better than nothing.  I also did not like all the construction going on close to the hotel but nothing they can do about this.  Overall I was impressed and will consider returning the next time I am in London.  The staff was quite solicitous and went above and beyond to be helpful but if you like to be a bit anonymous this is definitely not the place for you.",4,2014,08,19
137,Best Trip Ever,"We stayed at Hotel 41 in July 2014, after nearly 15 years from our last trip to London. It was amazing. From the effortless check-in, to having them print off my very own Washington Post, to relaxing breakfasts and pantry, our stay was perfect. Great location, top-notch and attentive staff, they made our week memorable. We will definitely stay here again!",5,2014,08,19
137,No Regrets,"My wife and I stayed here, April of 2014....from the moment you arrive, you can tell this place is different and amazing. The check in was flawless, the rooms beautifully appointed, the parlor filled with complimentary wine/cheese/water/soda/ the reading area was amazing. The staff was very attentive and  always approachable. And the location, not sure if it could be more perfectly placed......Hotel 41 has our highest recommendation. ",5,2014,08,17
137,absolutely delightful experience and service!,"absolutely delightful experience and service!
perfect location, service, and staff! I would love to come back to this small, cozy hotel!! 
The hotel was very close to buckingham palace which is perfect for sightseers and travellers!",5,2014,08,16
137,3 days in London - this is the place!,"My husband and I had the chance for a short trip to London without our kids. We had not been to London in nearly 20 years. We wanted to make the most of our three days and nights and the Hotel 41 was the perfect place to do so. The location near Buckingham palace was excellent. It was easy to walk to places such as Westminster Abbey and the London Eye from there, and there was a tube station close by. We also took a few taxis, which the hotel staff hailed for us. The Victoria Palace theater is just around the corner, where we saw the show Billy Elliott. Every morning we had a fantastic English breakfast, and we also had high tea as part of our package, which we thoroughly enjoyed. (It was a much more relaxed and gracious experience than the time we had tea at the Savoy back in college!) Each night when we got back from the theater we had an amazing ""snack"" as part of the hotel's ""raid the pantry"" service. We had everything from smoked salmon to miniature shepherd's pies to ceviche, wonderful cheeses, and sea salt caramel ice cream. I looked forward to it every night! Our room at the hotel was spacious, elegant, and very comfortable, with everything we could have needed or asked for by way of amenities. Every staff member we had interaction with was kind, professional, and helpful. I have only praise for the Hotel 41, and will happily go back if I have the chance to go to London again.",5,2014,08,12
137,Outstanding service & More...,"Well…
Whoever will read this review is lucky.
Why lucky? because after you finish, you will definitely reserve this fabulous hotel.

This Boutique hotel  is definitely the best in London.
I have stayed in more than 20 different hotels in London and can't compare hotel 41 to others.

Location:
Absolutely best possible in London. 
Quite area and yet close to most London sites. (Big Ben, London Eye, all the Parks, Piccadilly, Museum and of course Buckingham palace)

Room:
Wonderful. Well equipped, clean and shine.
The best room in London for 400-450 pounds rate.

Service:
OK… This is the best point here…
I was always dreamed to get in London Hotels the service I'm getting in Thailand.
I always thought it's impossible…
Well… I was wrong!
The service in Hotel 41 is the best in any western hotel I had (Have experience with more than 150 hotels)

I think I can summaries in one word

Outstanding 

Ori Ben Moshe",5,2014,08,12
137,Beyond the excellent,"Everything is perfect - location, service, staff, food, etc. etc.
We just spent four nights at this hotel and definitely would love to come back.

You are treated almost like a member of a royal family at this small hotel. It's very cozy, clean, comfortable and very quiet. Not crowded - just 28 rooms, or so. Short walking distance to all major attractions (not to mention the Royal Mews and Buckingham Palace literally across the street).
When I saw it, being listed as #1 at TripAdvisor, I expected it to be good, but it was really exceptional!!",5,2014,08,11
137,Boutique hotel in a great location,"I jumped a flight from Washington DC to London one evening, leaving behind my husband to tend to the teenagers and decided a two night stay prior to a stay in the English countryside with girlfriends was just what the doctor had ordered. Hotel 41 did not disappoint!  It is a small hotel, tucked away and mere steps from Buckingham Palace, The Royal Mews and Victoria Station. Customer service is paramount and the staff were very attentive to my needs, knowing that I was a female traveling alone - an English Rose escaping her American philandering husband. This is a boutique hotel with high accolades from both TripAdvisor and Conde Nast. Yes, the rooms are small, but every detail and amenity are at your fingertips. And if you are looking for peace and quiet, then the hotel will not disappoint, but a full service business style hotel with restaurants and bars it is not.",4,2014,08,08
137,Fulfilled my expectations.,"Hotel 41 has been ranked as the number 1 hotel in London on TripAdvisor for quite some time. My wife took me there for a birthday surprise on Saturday. I was fully expecting a boutique hotel and quality service, which we received.

The staff are fantastic. The hotel itself has beautiful decor. Yes, it is small, but you only need to do some cursory investigation to realize this. The rooms are quite small, but perfectly functional, the bed is very comfortable.

My criticisms are:

Firstly, and the biggest culprit of all, is the squeaky floorboards. We were in room 4108, I am admittedly a light sleeper and was awoken 3 times by people walking along the corridor, my wife slept fine, she can sleep through almost anything.

The other criticisms are trivial. Such as:

The remote control operation of the Sky doesn't work unless you point it exactly at one particular place. This is because the box is behind the TV, why not install IR extenders?

There was a slightly funky smell in the bathroom. While taking a shower the bath fills, as the drain cannot take the water away at the velocity that the shower supplies. Maybe there is a slight problem with the drain and the smell is standing water?

The toast was cold at breakfast.

On 2 occasions we asked for water with our drinks and did not receive any.

Apart from the floorboard noise, these are minor criticisms, I just wanted to make the management aware.

Overall it is a fabulous hotel. Would I go back? Absolutely, though not until they've screwed those floorboards down tighter!",4,2014,08,04
137,Gorgeous little hotel,"This was a short ""honey weekend"" that we had decided to spend in London after our marriage. As others have mentioned, the staff and service are second to none and the hotel in itself is gorgeous. Everyone was more than welcoming and kind, taking any request and delivering outstanding service. We would like to thank everyone for all their attentiveness!

Breakfast is really REALLY yummy, my favourites are definitely the eggs benedict. I would definitely recommend going for the cooked breakfast, as the options are very varied and delicious every time. 

Make sure you get to plunder the pantry one evening as there are plenty of lovely treats on offer.

The room was huge, well appointed (we're so sorry we didn't have time to have a proper bath, in the bathtub) and spotlessly clean. Turndown service every night came with lovely sweets and a suggestion for activities the next day.

All in all a wonderful experience, it did make our stay unforgettable.

What else can I say...I guess I'll see you guys again in December :)",5,2014,08,04
137,Expensive little treat,"Myself and my husband just spent the weekend. The food was 5* and we was right in the centre of all the shops and heart of London. Expensive little treat but worth it, Perfect for couples wanting the perfect get away!",5,2014,08,03
137,Perfection From Check-In to Check-Out,"Hotel 41 made our trip to London an absolutely amazing vacation.  The rooms, location, food, drink,and  quiet elegance were the best I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying.  But the best part of the trip was the staff.  Each and every one of them were top-notch in customer service.  Lauren, who helped me plan the trip from the beginning, set the tone for our expectations.  She also upgraded our room to a beautiful suite. Monika and Stefan gave us some good recommendations for restaurants and sightseeing tours. Remus, Mickesha, Siobhan, Michaela, Juiliana, Norbert, Maruis, Celestin, Florent, Peiro, Tyrone and Simone looked after our every need and want!!!  Mickesha had the kitchen specially make some chicken soup when my daughter wasn't feeling well.  Florent gave me some teas that he thought I would enjoy at home that I did not have the chance to try during our trip.  

Piero and Norbert set out special snacks during a World Cup game when the USA was playing.  A birthday cake for my daughter and other special treats were in our room when we arrived.  Everyone remembered my penchant for Diet Coke and what kind of tea we drank.  If my hands were full from shopping or just grabbing a drink, a staff member would insist on helping me carry things to my room.

You can read all about the food, tea and drink specials in other reviews but I wanted to highlight the staff.  They were the best I have ever had the pleasure of having at any hotel!!!  Thanks to all of them for making sure we had the trip of a lifetime!!  If I left anyone out please forgive me!",5,2014,08,01
137,Just gets better and better.  Wonderful.,"Hotel 41 is our little expensive treat and once again the hotel did not let us down in any way.  This hotel is quite simply the best place to stay in London if you want quality service which is subtle and unobtrusive.  The room we used this time was perfectly arranged and the little details they provide for a couple seeking a romantic getaway are a very nice touch.  They pick up on your every comment (for example I mentioned the strawberries were excellent at breakfast and what was waiting in our room when we got back that evening, a plate of delicious strawberries).  There are cheaper hotels in London but this hotel is excellent value.  All I can say to the wonderful staff at 41 is keep your standards up and see you in December!",5,2014,07,30
137,loved it ,"Awesome entertainment I thought since I'm American I would be treated differently but they treated me just the same.  I'm totally going to go to London again thanks hotel 41
 because I'm living there . 
That's my London experience 
",5,2014,07,30
137,Just Perfect,"Hotel 41 is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. The attention to detail and the helpfulness of the staff was excellent. The room was large by London standards and had everything I wanted including a yoga mat.
The food was top rate. I will never stay any place else when I am in London.",5,2014,07,30
137,World's Best Hotel Experience!!,"Other hotel operators should take note of how Red Carnation runs 41.  This 5 star hotel is very comfortable and the staff is terrific.  Rooms are nice but what makes this hotel truly special is the Pantry where guests can get self-service tea, snacks, ice cream, etc. any time of day or night.  Makes you feel like home.  At first I thought the pantry would be too expensive for other hotels to adopt, but when I stopped and thought about the actual cost of the snacks we consumed it was not that much money.  Granted to do the Pantry concept the hotel has to give up the idea of selling you a $10 candy bar from the mini-bar but the good vibes more than make up for it.  This hotel is expensive but we couldn't help but feel like we got our money's worth.",5,2014,07,28
137,Best service ever,"We stayed here as a treat as we were competing on the British 10K run, the service and attention to detail from all the team at hotel 41 was amazing, including a glass of champagne on our return from the run, much appreciated, we can't thank them enough.
We also can't wait to stay with then again soon.",5,2014,07,27
137,Can I move in......Please,"Don't change a thing, I cannot praise this hotel enough. The staff are amazing, friendly and chatty people. The customer service cannot be faulted as they will literally bend over backwards for their guests. The rooms are well furnished without being cluttered and the attention to detail is impeccable and the fact that they have grey goose vodka in the room mini bar is fantastic. You'll never go hungry with all the little complimentary snacks and ice creams aswell as the afternoon tea with sandwiches, scones and little cakes. When you arrive you will be told about the tradition of drinking a glass of champagne to which we were very pleased about. They have a very good selection of Brut, Vintage and Roses. I went with Gosset Rose which was delicious. 
I dont want to leave, myself and my husband have had a fantastic stay and we cant wait to return to Hotel 41.",5,2014,07,27
137,Hotel 41!!,"Hotel 41! What a great hotel in such a perfect location, right in the heart of the city. Its very close to all the major shopping, nightlife and attractions. Very stylish and comfortable space, surprisingly large for downtown london. Superb service and excellent environment. Highly recommended",5,2014,07,26
137,Very Very Good Service,"My husband fell in love with this hotel. The location is wonderful. The staff are amazing, they even gave me a hot water bottle in the bed to warm it up! They changed rooms to one with a fireplace! Amazing. However, the staff was so attentive, I almost felt uncomfortable.",5,2014,07,24
137,Beat in the whole wide world!!,Hands down this is my favorite hotel in the world. It was the first time I stayed there and it was the last time. The hotel itself is quirky and cool while the staff is nothing short of awesome. My daughter and I were treated like royalty. I think the employees truly enjoy working here because they are so happy and helpful- no task too big for them. It's so very close to Buckingham Palace I thought of waving to the Queen!,5,2014,07,23
137,Superb,"Our second stay at Hotel 41 and pleased to say the standards are as high as ever. The staff make this hotel what it is and their professionalism and friendliness is amazing. One of our party was in a wheelchair and he was well catered for and looked after.
Special thanks to stefan and lauren who were attentive, helpful and amusing.
Keep up the great work- can't wait to stay again",5,2014,07,22
137,Just a bowl of cherries,"Many five star hotels have sumptious surroundings, delicious food and drink and exceptional comfort,  Hotel 41 has all of these but also something else that sets it apart - absolutely amazing customer service which is friendly and professional but never snooty.  
I stayed here for three nights with my 11 year old daughter in a Junior Suite as a treat for her winning a major golf competition.  We returned to our room on the first evening to find a 'congratulations' cake waiting for her, its fair to say she was delighted at this thoughtful touch.  One afternoon we returned to the hotel and my daughter proceeded to avail herself of the cherries dotted around the complimentary fruit bowl in the street level lobby. The concierge inquired if we would be going to the executive lounge or to our room. As we sat down two minutes later  in the executive lounge an enormous bowl of delicious cherries was delivered to our table........
We mentioned to Stefan one morning that we would like afternoon tea later but we were extremely vague about the time. No matter, our table was laid and reserved for us on our return and our afternoon tea promptly served. Choice of tea, delightful little sandwiches and bridge rolls, scones with jam and cream and delicious cakes, topped off with a glass of chilled champagne as my extra little treat to myself. 
The complimentary ice cream selection was thoroughly explored by my daughter during our stay (mango crunch, very vanilla, strawberry tease, double choc and salted caramel) and I sincerely hope they have been able to restock since our departure! 
Tip - make time during your stay in London to relax and enjoy this hotel, it is a destination in itself.",5,2014,07,21
137,"Location and service: ""Brilliant""","There is really not much that I can add to the other rave reviews.  Location: unbeatable – right next to the Queen.   Staff: very professional and personable – with a special mention to Monika and Stefan, who both went the extra mile to make our stay special.   Rooms: not particularly large, but well appointed, comfortable and cozy.  Breakfast: generous – particularly enjoyed the eggs royal!   We went out each evening and sadly never managed to “raid the pantry.”  Which leads to my only quibble: the entrance is locked and left unattended at 11:00PM – perhaps a tad early (especially when the key card doesn’t work), but no big deal.  All in all, an exceptional hotel.  A bit pricey, but one gets what one pays for.  Will definitely return.",5,2014,07,21
137,Loved it!,"We celebrated my wife's birthday here - and I am so pleased with the choice.

A special hotel - boutique style. The rooms are very pleasant, not huge, but knockout when you're trying to impress the missus!

The service was attentive but not overbearing, friendly but respectful - really pleasant. Nothing was too much trouble.

The Executive lounge is done out like a gentlemen's club (well, not having been to one, how I imagine such a club to be). Snacks all day (no charges) and an honesty bar.

The welcome glass of champagne on arrival really got the day off to a super start. And, if it's a romantic weekend, the turndown service was perfect. 

During the week there are also business guests apparently, so it is not just couples.

We will be back! Loved it.",5,2014,07,21
137,WOW,I had booked the Rubens for a 50th Birthday treat for my husband. On arrival we were greeted by the duty manager who upgraded us to Hotel 41. What a fantastic surprise. When entering this hotel you are made to feel so very special. Our room was perfect and a welcome Happy Birthday cake from the hotel. We also had afternoon tea which was just perfect. This hotel certainly has the Wow factor and we can honestly say we have never experienced such a high standard of service from any other hotel where  we have stayed in. The staff deserve a massive congratulation's for there excellent customer relations skills. I only hope One day I have the pleasure of returning.,5,2014,07,21
137,Amazing Experience,"My wife and I stayed at Hotel 41 in London England last weekend and were blown away by the service provided by this boutique hotel located close to Buckingham Palace in London.The staff went above and beyond the call of duty and the accommodations were outstanding. We would recommend this gem to anyone looking for a charming getaway in the heart of London.
Steve and Ewa from Oakville, Canada",5,2014,07,21
137,Second visit even better than the first,"My first visit blew me away and this second visit in a year improved on that. The staff manage to combine super-friendliness with great professionalism and customer service. They remembered us AND our TripAdvisor review!

Any room is great and make sure you leave room in your diet for the deli counter in the evening after the theatre - it includes salmon, desserts such as profiteroles, cheeses, cold meats, a mini hot dish etc.

I will always choose this hotel from now on!",5,2014,07,20
137,Nice Hotel,"Such a nice place with nice staff too. Easy to find, great location and would recommend the hotel to anyone. The people who stayed here were friendly too which made it an overall excellent experience.",4,2014,07,18
137,Wonderful hotel,"Hotel 41 was a really amazing experience, and the staff were doing everything possible to make our stay comfortable. 
Eg. upon arrival, during check in, we were offered a glass of champagne in front of the fireplace and in the late afternoon, canapés were offered to guests sitting in the central lounge. 
The hotel is quite small and very cozy, and the lounge is very relaxing and invites you to sit and chat, read a book etc. while you can help yourself to drinks and small snacks from the bar.",5,2014,07,15
137,Without question the best!!,"I cannot state enough how good this hotel is. The decor is beautiful, the food is amazing but what makes it above any other place I've ever stayed (or probably ever will) at is the staff. They go over and beyond what is the expected level of service and make your stay so good you just don't want to leave. My wife and I spent our last night of our honeymoon here before flying out and we didn't want to venture out of the hotel. I booked the romantic package which is definitely worth it, especially for the perfect night with your partner. At many hotels there are offers of extra this or that and they are overpriced and not worth it. Not here. Virtually any extra we went for was not only fantastic but perfecto worth the money. We cannot thank all the staff enough for the most perfect finish to our honeymoon. If we decide to venture back to London for an anniversary, there will be only one place we will want to go!",5,2014,07,15
137,Simply amazing!,"We stayed here for two nights, for our wedding anniversary, and everything was absolutely perfect.  

From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty; upon our arrival we were booked into our room with a glass of champagne. The staff were brilliant. Breakfast was wonderful. After arriving back from the theatre, we were greeted with candles and rose petals scattered around our room, music playing and a bottle of champagne.

We have already recommended this hotel to friends of ours. There was nothing about our stay I would change - a truly memorable experience. 

Many thanks to all at Hotel 41",5,2014,07,11
137,By Far Best Hotel we have ever experienced,"Hotel 41 exceeded our expectations from the moment the door opened to the Lobby. They knew who we were before we introduced ourselves. We traveled with our children ages 8,12,and 16 as well as my parents aged 65. The employees went above and beyond to make sure everyones experience there was unforgetable. All the small details were attended to. Unfortunately a main water line was broken down the street while we were there causing the water to be shut down and the hotel staff provided extra bottles of water and whatever else they could to make it bearable in the meantime. And I can honestly say even with that glich (which was beyond their control) we had the most amazing time. Also the location is absolutely fabulous. Walking distance to all the main attractions one would want to see in London.",5,2014,07,10
137,"First impressions, they still work...","From the moment I was greeted at the lobby with the offer to valet park my car to the moment I departed the hotel, everything and everyone at 41 was a credit to RC Hotels. Quirky, yes, the most luxurious, possibly not, but in terms of the welcome, staffing, comfort, and being made to feel like a privileged individual and not just a number, 41 didn't miss a beat. 

Arriving at 8.30am, a complimentary breakfast and a room to change in was offered by Monika and Lauren at reception which got us off to a fabulous start. Absolutely nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff and each of them were extremely polite, very well trained, and were faultless in making our stay as comfortable as possible at all times. The rooms were very comfortable and well sized, whilst the Executive Club styled bar and dining area was well stocked with a diverse range of goodies that you were welcome to enjoy at any time of day. Located wonderfully close to Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station you could be forgiven at times for thinking you were in a country retreat as it was so quiet in the room which was located at the front of the hotel. A lovely experience, and one that everything about 41 would happily make me want to return to. A great place to stay in London for those travelling long haul.

Well done 41, especially Monika! We'll see you again.",5,2014,07,09
137,the swank without the snoot,"we are the goofy americans people talk about, and still the staff was so uniformly cheerful, polite and friendly that we felt accepted and welcomed. they were more than eager to assist even when i got food poisoning and was a mess. i dealt with probably 10 different employees, and they were all gracious. i will definitely be back :)",5,2014,07,09
137,awesome sevices,"What a great hotel in such a perfect location, in the heart of the city very close to all the major shopping, nightlife and attractions. Hotel 41 is a hotel within a hotel, its the top floor of another hotel and a very stylish and comfortable space. Surprisingly large for downtoen london and a very solid staff. Loved the hotel and the area",5,2014,07,08
137,Hotel 41 is way past fantastic!,"Hotel 41 is a super fantastic hotel with super excellent service!  And that's putting it lightly!  My husband is a die hard Ritz Carlton fan.  I was surprised when he suggested we stay at a Red Carnation Hotel, but, well, who am I to complain?  Hotel 41 exceeded our expectations and for some reason I felt privileged to stay there.  It's that good.  It's way past excellent!  

We were able to compare room decor and size with a similar room at the Grosvenor Hotel where one of our friends was staying.  Our bed was the size of his entire room, no need to discuss the differences any further.  

As for service, the attendants are way past exceptional.  For example, we traveled to London to see the Monty Python Stage Show.  Monica found all the reviews and printed them out for us as they came in.  Stefan always humored us with interesting stories about the places on our daily itinerary and the key items to look for.  Florat somehow knew the answers to his questions before he asked them.  For example, I always draw a blank before my morning coffee.  One morning I went to the Lounge to get some coffee.  Florat that he would deliver it to our room and asked me the room number.  I drew a blank.  I just couldn't remember it.  It didn't matter because Florat knew the room number anyway.  He did the same thing when I couldn't remember what my husband wanted for breakfast.  Heck, he'd probably even  remind me what I wanted for breakfast.  It is people like Monica, Stefan, and Florat that make the Hotel 41 the super special hotel it is.  

After all is said and done, the part that is nearest and dearest to my heart are the afternoon service candies.  No, not for me, although they are super delicious.  I packed a couple bags of candy in my suitcase to give to my kids when I get home.  I can easily say that my kids are regular candy connoisseurs.  They said these are the most delicious they have ever tasted anytime anywhere.  I agree with them.  ",5,2014,07,07
137,Everyone knows your name but little details need attention,"It has been a number of years since my last visit. While the lobby lounge keeps getting better there were a couple of complaints from my recent stay.

Rooms-while well appointed the bathrooms were very small and the showers especially small for a large guest. I stayed in three different rooms and found that when a separate shower area was provided the space was tiny.
The Hospitality Suite at 839 pounds was much too expensive while the other rooms at 395 were fairly priced.
On two occasions I asked about renting a local cell phone. No one gave me an answer. There is a large staff but I never figured out the distribution of responsibility.
Upon checkout they resolved  my misunderstanding about champagne in the lounge being free rather than 16 or 17 pounds per glass. They were willing to write off the charges but I said that a 50% discount would be fine.
I was never introduced to the General Manager and would have expected this to happen at such a small boutique hotel.
Overall I find the property special and well worth a visit.",5,2014,07,07
137,awesome sevices,"The staff was the best!!! They treated us like royalty. They always had smiles on their faces, always ready for recommendations for places to eat, how to get to various locations by taxi or train.We loved London and would come back again and probably stay here just for the service that the staff gives. its simply the best for the  short stay.",5,2014,07,04
137,Excellent English Style,"What a great hotel in such a perfect location, in the heart of the city very close to all the major shopping, nightlife and attractions.

137,Superb Service,"We have stayed at Hotel 41 a couple of times before and this time was for our honeymoon.
From the second you arrive your every need is catered for and you feel truly spoiled.
All the staff are polite, friendly, efficient and fantastic at making you feel special.

It's not only the general level of service but the little extra thoughtful things that make it a delight to stay here.

If you want luxury and the very best level of service I have found anywhere then this is the place for you.

Love it. Just wish I could afford to stay there more often!",5,2014,07,02
137,"""Bea"" looked after!","We spent five nights at 41 in London during Wimbledon.   We travel to London nearly every year, but this was our first stay at this hotel.   In terms of location, when you check in, you will be neighbors with the Queen as Buckingham Palace is around the corner.   As for convenience in getting to anywhere in London, you are a few steps away from Victoria Station that connects to every major line.

This hotel is much like “Platform 9 ¾” in the Harry Potter books – you need to know about it to see it!  A black and white awning branded with the number “41” hides away a small walk in lobby manned with one of the seemingly dozens of welcoming staff who tend to your every need.  During odd hours, the property is accessed with your keycard.

The heart of the hotel is the magnificent lounge that features a loft level and glass ceiling.   Cozy furniture dot the space and a “pantry” of assorted treats, snacks and drinks are beautifully displayed in plain view.  You can help yourself or one of the staff is happy to do all the work for you.   Complimentary high speed Wifi, printer and other business tools in the lounge loft meant that we could tend to work without having to visit a typical sterile business center.  Our room was very spacious and beautifully decorated.  Other important features included comfortable beds, full sized hair dryer (yes ladies – full sized and complete with a nozzle!) and large bathrooms with deep soaking tub and great water pressure.   The food was equally outstanding.

What puts this hotel over the top is the staff.  Professional, efficient and imaginative -- they go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable and to anticipate your needs thoughtfully. The guest rooms wrap around the lounge area.   This means that anything you want is literally at your fingertips.  The small number of guest rooms allows the staff to give each guest undivided attention 24/7, quite literally.  There are no lines at a front desk, no waiting time for concierge services, room service is delivered in no time at all.   The ratio of staff to guest is not the only thing that allows this property to deliver such extraordinary service.   The other factor is employing true professionals determined to deliver top-notch service with care.  This was demonstrated countless times during our stay.  

Here are a couple of examples:
We needed a flower arrangement for a dinner we were attending – as the recipient is a boating enthusiast, we requested that they include a tiny boat in the arrangement.   Not a problem!  The staff didn’t flinch!  The gorgeous arrangement, complete with little boat was wrapped and ready to go!  It was a team effort led effortlessly by Monika.

I mentioned to Stefan, that when I lived in the UK as a child I loved a particular candy.  That night, there was a bottle of champagne in our room and a tray of the candies I had mentioned casually in passing!  So special! 

Another night we came back to our room to find tens of candles lit around the room and rose petals on the bed in the shape of a heart.  No occasion, just an opportunity to delight a guest.  This type of service is nearly extinct elsewhere unless specifically requested.  

When is the last time you leave a hotel and remember the name of every staff member who made your stay special?   Here it goes:  Lauren, Monika, Remus, Stefan, Julien, Piero, Peter, David, Victoria, Tyrone, Simone, Stefanie, Flo, Michaela, Mickesha, Juiliana and Marius.  A long list of people who delivered flawless service. 

There is no doubt where we will be staying on any future trip to London.     We were curious as to whether this is a stand alone property.  It is not.  It is part of the Red Carnation group, properties dreamed up and presided over by Bea Tollman.  She should be proud of her creation – hospitality at its finest.",5,2014,07,01
137,"Comfortable, cozy and welcoming","41 Hotel is not a super high-end hotel.  It is a welcoming ,warm comfortable little hotel with a meticulous style and staff.  It has a great location just across from the Mews where the carriages for Buckingham Palace are housed, and right up the street from The Palace.  There is some serious construction nearby - the rebuilding of Victoria Station, but it didn't cause any problems for those of us staying at the hotel.  This is an unusual hotel idea - the housing of a small boutique hotel within (on one floor)  a larger hotel.  You enter off the street where there is a desk and attendant who can help with pretty much anything, and go up in the elevator to the hotel.  You are guided through several hallways  past guest rooms to the main reception room where everything happens.  There is a living room area with a tv, a breakfast area, a library area, the reception desk and many very attentive staff members to assist with everything.  You can have meals here, in your room, or next door in the larger hotel, or in the casual restaurant on the other side of the entrance. 41 Hotel is the comforting and comfortable harbor; a joy to return to after a busy day at the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Tate Museums,  Harrods  or any of the other myriad of London offerings.",5,2014,06,30
137,Perfect luxury in the heart of London,"We have stayed in London on many occasions but after a friend's recommendation we booked Hotel 41 for the last few days of a month's holiday in Europe. We were certainly not disappointed as the quiet ""club"" atmosphere, luxurious rooms and amenities were outstanding. The staff were a perfect balance of friendliness and professionalism - right from the welcome champagne to our evening departure for Heathrow. Arrangements were made on our behalf without hesitation or fuss. The availability of snacks and substantial evening food in the lounge was a bonus. Lauren and the front desk staff were wonderful and we can't wait to visit again!",5,2014,06,30
137,Conservatory Suite...Perfection!,"I must admit I had never heard of Hotel 41 when my husband told me he had chosen this hotel for our anniversary stay in London.  However I knew it would be good as he had selected it because of its superb Trip Advisor reviews. What we hadn't  anticipate was how fabulous our stay would be!!!

From the moment we arrived through the doors we experienced fantastic customer service.  We were offered champagne by the Stephan the most unique, eccentric, likeable member of the Hotel 41 team.  Such a wonderful way to welcome us.  

The decor in the Executive Lounge is sumptuous and luxurious.  The skylight ceiling allowing the afternoon sunshine to flood into the room.   We later returned to this room in the evening to relax and enjoy a complementary drink and ice cream.  

When we were shown to our room we were told that we had been upgraded to the Conservatory Suite.  We didn't appreciate at the time how lucky we were until the member of staff kindly showed us to our accommodation.  The suite consisted of a lounge area downstairs, upstairs was the bedroom, dressing room and huge bathroom.  We were absolutely amazed when a button was pressed and the white ceiling folded back to show a huge glass conservatory roof! The suite was gorgeous, black and white themed luxury.  A huge bed, a huge bath, a huge television and the stunning glass ceiling.  We slept under that stars that evening, a truly unique experience.

Breakfast lived up to expectations.  We dined in the Executive lounge which had been converted into a dining room.  My husband opted for a cooked breakfast, whilst I decided to help myself to the Breakfast buffet bar.  All top ingredients, and service second to none.  

We really can not fault this amazing hotel.  It you are fortunate enough to be able to stay here you will not be disappointed.    Thank you Hotel 41 for making our anniversary stay so memorable. We literally can not wait to come back and visit!",5,2014,06,30
137,The Finest Experience in Service and Beautiful Suites,"When visiting London Hotel 41 is a must!  Absolute perfection from the minute you enter the front door.  The entire staff was accommodating and genuinely concerned with exceeding all of our expectations.  Our dining experiences for breakfast and dinner were excellent. 

During our stay we had a family emergency back in the US and the Executive Lounge was a very comforting environment for us to spend time. The staff was attentive but not intrusive.",5,2014,06,29
137,Perfect for single traveler,"I had one night to spend by myself in London before meeting my group.  This was exactly what I wanted.  There is a pleasant lounge where you can get a simple meal in a club like atmosphere. I do not like going out to dinner alone so this was perfect. I noticed families enjoyed this feature as well.  The staff was amazing.  As soon as I checked in everyone knew my name. I  do not know how they do it. I wanted a luxury stay for the night and this definitely met the desire.  It is within walking distance of the the pageantry of Buckingham Palace, the city's beautiful parks and historic buildings.",5,2014,06,29
137,London's Top Hotel,This is truly the finest hotel in London. This is quite a statement as London has a mulltitude of excellent hotels. I have never received the level of attention  in decades of travel spanning several continents as I encountered at this hotel. The room was also truly beautiful. THis was a trip I will always cherish.,5,2014,06,27
137,JEWELBOX IN THE HEART OF THE CITY,"This was my first visit to HOTEL 41, but it will not be my last. This hotel is truly a little jewelbox in the heart of the City. With just 25 rooms, and as many staff, they offer a very high level of personal attention, and unlike some other high-end facilities, where the staff frequently seem overly-impressed with themselves, the staff at 41 seem to be interested only in giving you the very best experience possible. The room and bath were beautiful and comfortable, the food and wine was delicious (with a never-ending spread of treats in the Lounge, if you leave the facility hungry it certainly isn't their fault!), and the service, as mentioned above, was impeccable.",5,2014,06,25
137,Lived up to the hype,"We had the best family vacation possible thanks to the staff at Hotel 41.  Cannot believe that anyone would consider this less than 5*.  If you want a large reception area, workout room or spa then this is not the place for you.  If you want over the top service, great facilities and a fantastic location then this is a great choice, assuming that you are willing to pay for it (this hotel is not cheap).
Many thanks to the hotel staff!  I hope that we can return someday!",5,2014,06,23
137,Best hotel in the uk!,"Stayed at 41 for the night whilst visiting London and the theatre. The service was unobtrusive and simply amazing. Nothing was too much. Stefan particularly notable as a member of staff that makes you feel special, and at home at the same time. The extras in the lounge are second to none, and the wine cellar perfect. Our room had the comfiest bed and (seriously I'm not exaggerating) the BEST shower I've ever had! It was my birthday too and I was treated to candles, roses and chocolate dipped strawberries. If you only stay in one hotel this year-make it this one. ",5,2014,06,22
137,"Outstanding, private club feeling, just needs a garden","This is an outstanding hotel by every definition.    It's just a few blocks from the palace, but not really in the heart of where you might be going.    Tons of construction, lots of modern sort of building going on, surrounded by easily accessible parks too.   Marks and Spencer a block away for those food callings.

The conservatory suite is very nice, an entire glass roof over the bed, with push button blinds.   As in almost all London hotels, the light switches never make any sense at all.   The staff is beyond belief, instantly knowing you by name, serving you complimentary great food and snacks 24 hours a day, an honesty bar at night.   

Unfortunately, there is no ""outside,"" but they are apparently designing a rooftop bar and garden, which will make this the perfect choice for luxury travelers who appreciate old world elegance.",5,2014,06,22
137,The best hotel I have stayed in.,"I took my wife down to London for our first wedding anniversary and found this lovely boutique hotel online amongst all the others. And my goodness I am so glad I chose ""41"". As it was our first anniversary, the hotel upgraded us to the master suite - what can I say about the room, stunning!! So comfortable, and well equipped. The staff are so friendly, make you feel right at home, nothing is too much of an issue. Had champagne afternoon tea, fantastic! Breakfast, eggs benedict on the recommendation of Stefan (who i must say is a wonderful host), really delicious. I could go on and on about how fantastic this hotel is, but I would just suggest you try it yourself!! Is there anywhere else I would stay in London for my next visit - NO. Looking forward to next time...",5,2014,06,19
137,For my taste one of the best Hotels,"Hotel 41 is it - at least if you like personal treatment and british club atmosphere. The rooms are a little bit oldfashioned, however very well maintained and very quiet for a central London hotel. The Hotel is located near Victoria Sation and Buckingham Palace and is therefore an excellent starting point for business or leisure. What Hotel 41 is all about is service. From arrival through departure the extremely friendly and knowledgable staff reads your lips to make your stay a comfortable one. I can very much recommend this hotel.",5,2014,06,19
137,Excellent hotel in London!,"If you like a smaller hotel with personal service and an excellent location, this is the place!  After a long day of travel we were greeted with champagne (which we had to refuse because we were too tired!) and friendly faces.  After a review of the city map and many attractions that we might be interested in we given a tour and then shown to our room.  The rooms are small but the comfort is high!  I have to say that Remus went above and beyond to insure our stay was enjoyable!  We will be back!!",5,2014,06,18
137,One of the best boutique hotels in London,"I met an exceptionally great group of staff members working for Hotel 41. My stay at the hotel was great and the hotel exceeded all my expectations. I have been to this hotel twice and always feel like home.

The staff was very very helpful at every moment and request. I love the concept of ""Whatever Whenever"". Just having one button makes a lot more sense and makes the guests life a whole lot easier.

I plan to stay here again in future whenever I travel to London. I don't think there is one single staff member that I would like to highlight - I think all of them provided me with an exemplary service and I would like to thank and highlight all of them.

Thanks Hotel 41 for such great experience :)",5,2014,06,17
137,My favorite hotel,"We stayed at the hotel 41 three years ago and we still talk about it as our favorite hotel.  The service, the comfort, the late night snacks and honor bar, the breakfasts, it was all just perfect.  So comfortable - expensive yes, but completely unpretentious. A great family hotel.  If I find myself back in London, I wouldn't hesitate to spend some time at the 41.",5,2014,06,17
137,Special Hotel,"We picked hotel 41 because of the reviews and high scores on trip advisor, so I arrived with high expectations, but was a little wary, as we were getting married in London on the day of our stay
But from the moment we checked in, our party of 8 all had our rooms upgraded, to our departure, we were treated like kings.
The service is second to none and the hotel is luxury, My expectations were met and so much more, best hotel I have stayed in.
I hope to return for future anniversaries, well done hotel 41.",5,2014,06,16
137,Wow as Usual - A London Secret,"I stay at this hotel several times a year when I travel to London for business. The location is very central with easy to access the Underground. The secret of this hotel is the service, I have no idea what the staff to guest ratio is, but there is always someone to help you available at any time of the day. I regularly have business meetings in their boardroom, and they have assisted me getting tickets to plays and London events while I am in town with excellent attention to detail. I like to think of Hotel 41 as my home in London.",5,2014,06,13
137,A wonderful stay in a beautiful hotel,"This was the best and most relaxing stay in London we have ever had, largely due to the nature of the hotel and the staff and management who work there.  The service started before our visit with the manager asking for our personal preferences so that they could be accommodated for our arrival.

We received a complimentary room upgrade overlooking the Royal Mews, with complimentary champagne and personal message from the manager marking our special occasion.

Hotel 41 is a small but beautifully appointed hotel with top quality furnishings and room accessories. Although rooms are not huge the focus is very much on quality and service, rather than size. The theme of quality runs throughout the hotel.

The staff were exemplary and very attentive; some may have seen this as overbearing, however we didn't feel this way.  The staff were very astute in knowing which guests welcomed their interaction and those who didn't.  It was a touch of theatre in the executive lounge, if you wanted it.  It was also very pleasant to be addressed by name (although this was never too formal).

We loved it!",5,2014,06,07
137,Another excellent stay,"Stayed in this hotel with the family, and it really was an excellent stay. The location is excellent, the staff are great, and I liked the decor. They also do a lot of small things that do make you stay that little bit more special.",5,2014,06,04
137,Luxury and Attention,"I have been fortunate enough to have stayed at Hotel 41 a number of times and the service, ambiance and every bit about this Hotel stays constant.
It is superb, from the moment you arrive at the reception desk through to the very personal service received from every member of staff throughout your stay.
All the staff want you to have a great experience, you can just tell and you do.
I love to book in around lunchtime and just sit in the wonderful library surrounding until early evening, nibbling and drinking their brilliant wine, I just don't want to go anywhere, sad but true.
I cannot recommend this Hotel more highly, it is just luxury.
Additionally you are a few hundred yards walk from Buckingham Palace and the beautiful St. James Park as well as 20 minutes walk to Park Lane and West End.",5,2014,06,04
137,Never fails to be the best!,"This was our 4th time staying at 41 and at the risk of sounding like a broken record, it was excellent again! Monika and the team looked after us like old friends.  41 is relaxing, peaceful, friendly and quite simply the best place we've found to stay in London.  Hoping to be back again for Christmas!",5,2014,06,01
137,"The ""E"" in Excellent","My wife and I recently stayed in Hotel 41. The experience was overwhelming.  The staff was professional, attentive, and exacting. Most times when I mentioned an issue or desire in passing it was acted upon immediately. This is a one-of-a-kind gem of a hotel. I would have loved to stay longer, unfortunately, we had to leave. The location is perfect and obscure.  But don't worry. Most taxi drivers in London know its location. Strongly recommend you stay there, even for a short stay, and be prepared to be treated like royalty.  The stay was unforgettable and it is our location of choice on a future visit to London!",5,2014,05,30
137,Wonderful service!,"I would just like to reiterate what others have said.  I booked this hotel following all the great reviews as a 60th birthday surprise for my mum and I was not disappointed.  

After a very early morning flight, my mum and I were greeted very warmly with a glass of Champagne and were told we had been upgraded!  We sat in the Executive lounge, taking in all the beautiful surroundings whilst we waited for Eggs Benedict (which I would strongly recommend)!

You were made to feel very relaxed and encouraged to soak up the atmosphere.   There was food in abundance.  You will never go hungry and Stefan was always on had with a glass of Champagne!  

The hotel is ideally situated for Victoria station and Harrods is only a 20 minute walk away. The hotel staff are very knowledgeable, are more than happy to give you advice, directions and a map.

In a our room, there was a cake and a note saying 'Happy Birthday'.  Such a lovely touch, i thought!

I wouldn't hesitate to go back. Thank you",5,2014,05,27
137,AMAZING!!!,"On arrival to this gem of a hotel, we were upgraded to their beautiful executive suite, we were given a glass of Champagne and shown all the facilities. We were shown to our room and instantly fell in love with it. 
The staff were so helpful, they really couldn't do enough for us.
We would go back without hesitation and would recommend this wonderful hotel to anyone.",5,2014,05,26
137,A truly unique and fabulous experience! ,"I have to say that this hotel has the extras you don't usually get in a 5 star hotel. 
First the staff was almost like a very polite and hospital family,  you felt directly at home and treated us like one of their own.
Second, the service!!!! Outstanding thought to details and creating an atmosphere where you as guest could feel total relaxation. 
Third, the lounge was so delicate and superbly designed that you felt time was slowing down and a feeling of total calmness was surging thru you like a warm bries on a nice summer night.

",5,2014,05,26
137,"Lovely, luxurious boutique hotel","This hotel is small and very intimate.  The location is perfect, close to everything but quiet as well.  The service is amazing!  The lounge is a very nice feature - we went almost every night before dinner for a relaxing drink and complimentary snacks.  The rooms are a very nice size and the bathroom was lovely too.  We would absolutely return!",5,2014,05,26
137,Fantastic !,"You know you have entered a quality hotel, no sooner are you through the door and the friendly staff have taken your bags and offered you a glass of champaign or fine wine.

There is only 2 floors to this hotel the entrance and the 5th floor here all the rooms are situated and the dining room stroke bar area, they work on a honesty bar with all named drinks and if you can't find what your looking for the helpful staff will soon find it or mix it up

We only had breakfast here but that was really well made we have already said we will be staying here again in no time At all",5,2014,05,24
137,Fabulous !,"No review can adequately convey how fabulous this hotel is.  The service is the best.  They have a whatever, whenever button on phone and that sums it up.  Every request we had, they fulfilled.  They can fast track tickets for most anything.  The lounge is very nice with breakfast in a.m. Then snacks all day into evening included.  A honor bar is available ( glass of very good champagne is offered upon arrival complimentary).  We had an executive king room that was a nice size and very comfortable bed.  All of the staff are so friendly and helpful!!  Good location and great wi-fi.  We will return.",5,2014,05,23
137,"Lovely Location, Lovely Staff","The first thing you notice when you enter this cosy English hotel is the courteous and well mannered staff. Everyone laughs and smiles, and just make you happy! They ask if they can help at every point. 

Apart from the staff, the great thing about this hotel is their little knick knacks that are laid out throughout the day, to help fill in the little gaps in your stomach. I always looked forward to see what was in store after spending a good day in London.

Their rooms are quite English to begin with. Quite cosy. Their beds are like feathers. I almost always slept within minutes once I was on them. 

Overall a lovely stay!",4,2014,05,20
137,The BEST of many fabulous hotels in London!,"This is only the second time I have felt moved to write a hotel review--this place is THAT special.
I have stayed at other excellent luxury hotels in London before but decided on Hotel 41 this time and I was absolutely thrilled!  I was in town alone visiting friends for a few days and the extraordinary staff made me feel completely at home.  I really cannot say enough about them.  Every single person went out of their way to be welcoming and helpful.  I found myself catching up on work each night in the ""lobby"" which is actually more like a library or drawing room in a private home with comfortable chairs and sofas with tables set and food and drink available 'round the clock.  My room was comfortable and impeccably clean. 
I can't wait to go back and I am recommending the 41 to everyone who is headed for London town.  Fantastic.",5,2014,05,18
137,It's so nice returning to this hotel,"I would like to thank the staff at hotel 41 for making my stay such a pleasant and enjoyable one.
I was in London two years ago and visited this hotel for the first time.
The staff were so friendly and professional that I decided to return to the hotel again when I was recently in London.

The staff have lost none of their charm and dedication towards the guest.
They really are the best staff of any hotel that I have stayed at in the world (and I do not say this lightly).

I would like to thank in particular Monica, Simone, Stefan and David. Nothing is too much trouble for these people
and they made my stay another memorable one.

I will happily recommend this hotel to any one who wants not only a stay but an experience in London too.
I look forward to returning to the hotel in the future.",5,2014,05,18
137,Another Crown Jewel of London,"If you are looking for a small, luxury, boutique hotel, look no further.  While the location, rooms, amenities and food are all outstanding, it is the service that puts the hotel in a class by itself.  This is by far the best service that I ever have been accorded in any European or Asian hotel I have stayed in.  Lauren and Monika and their entire hotel staff were wonderful in assisting with theatre tickets, hard to get dinner reservations and shopping suggestions.   On this trip (April 30-May 4) I was traveling with a friend, but I can't wait to pay a return visit to the hotel with my husband!

Jacqueline P.",5,2014,05,15
137,What a gem!,"We spent 2 days at Hotel 41 after a 15 day transatlantic repositioning cruise on a small cruise ship.  We had been terribly spoiled by the service on the ship, and we were unsure of what Hotel 41 would be like.  The service in the hotel was unbelievably fabulous.  We were pampered from the moment we arrived right through our departure.  The staff was attentive, friendly and very, very professional.  Anything and everything we asked for was seen to with a smile.  The hotel's location is but a few steps from Buckingham Palace and is just a short walk to Westminster Abbey and Parliament.  Other London attractions, if not within walking distance, are easily accessed by nearby public transit.  Our very comfortable room, like the rest of the hotel, was immaculate.  Staying at Hotel 41 was like a trip to England's past.  The staff, elegantly dressed, gentlemen in tails and striped pants, were the epitome of gracious service.  Our stay was wonderful, and when we return to London, we will definitely be staying at Hotel 41 again.",5,2014,05,14
137,"Truly 5 Star, excellent service","We were warmly greeted by Victoria on our arrival. Lauren gave us the orientation ""tour"". All the rooms are on one floor, as well as the executive lounge where we were seated and offered breakfast while being checked in.  Due to our transatlantic flight we arrived very early but they still allowed us to check in and provided us with a room about 30 min later. 
The room may be on the smaller side by American standards but is adequate and well appointed. They put in those extra touches that I love like a bathroom scale! Full length mirror, dimmable lights and reading lights, Penhaligon toiletries 
The executive lounge is most likely where u will have breakfast or a late night snack and utilize the concierge to make plans for the day. The room has a great domed skylight which is great for judging the weather outside. Have a chat with Stefan for some great stories! 
The location can't be beat. It's obliquely opposite Buckingham Palace! Walking distance to st James palace , apsley house,Victoria station,Piccadilly Westminster Cathedral, Harrod's etc 
But the best part of staying here is the excellent staff!
Cons. Minor but FYI there is no view out of the window (we overlooked an office bldg) and they did put a $1300 British pound hold on the credit card on check in. ",5,2014,05,14
137,Perfect Honeymoon!,"From the moment we arrived to the moment we left everything was perfect. We were a week in London on our honeymoon and all the staff in 41 went out of their way to make it a very special occasion for us. We were treated to drinks and canapes on arrival. We had cake, fruit and water in our room. What surprised us the most though was the attention to detail. The staff noted what we wanted to do for the week and then helped us at every opportunity to make it better. 

Our room was beautiful and so comfortable. The bed in particular was so comfy. The room and bathroom were spotless. The food in the hotel was delicious. Raiding the pantry is a must! It was so useful on our return from the theater on one of the nights. The food on offer is varied and always fresh. We were spoiled for choice every day of our stay. Afternoon tea is a particularly tasty treat.        

The central location is ideal for sightseeing with the Royal Mews across the road, Buckingham Palace 5 mins walk, tour bus stop down the street, underground station and bus station 5 mins away on foot. A special thanks to the concierge who always managed to get a taxi so quickly as well! 

Thanks again to Lauren and all the staff in Hotel 41 for being so kind and making our honeymoon so special. We can't recommend this hotel enough. It is truly a hidden gem that offers peace and tranquility in the hustle and bustle of London. We can't wait to return to 41!

Kenneth & Lorraine.",5,2014,05,11
137,Great atmosphere ! Spotlessly clean Hotel!,"Amazing Staff !! the room was spotlessly clean!!! We had a wonderful stay !! 
Location was amazing  next to all the theatres and Victoria station we will be back !
Forgot to say the beds were really comfortable and the design of the rooms we liked very much",5,2014,05,11
137,Excellent hotel and wonderful staff,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 on our first visit to London to celebrate our 32nd wedding anniversary and were greeted at the reception desk with champagne!  And that was just the beginning.  We returned to our room one night to find it filled with candles and rose petals! To say that we were spoiled by the staff would be an understatement.  This is a lovely hotel, so comfy and sparkling clean complete with all the extras, including the lounge with an amazing array of complimentary snacks and drinks.  Once you walk through the door, the feel is as if you are staying at a secret club away from all noise and crowds of the city.  The staff that the hotel has assembled is one of its biggest assets, especially Monika, Lauren and Remus. I would highly recommend this hotel to all!!",5,2014,05,09
137,Fantastic stay here,"My husband and I have visited hotels all around the world, and this was by far up with the best. The standards were excellent, and the service was really very good.  So many little touches in both the rooms and the hotel.  It is not a hotel that you would stumble on, and its hidden above another hotel called Rubens, but we both like the idea that it is a hidden secret, and keeping its hidden gems away from the masses!  A very very good stay, will be booked when we return in the fall.",5,2014,05,06
137,"Very pleasant, attentive hotel","Just round the corner from Buckingham Palace, this unimaginatively named hotel is pretty plush.  The staff are very attentive; if I'm honest probably a little too much so.  We were in a bit of a rush & it took us the best part of 20 minutes to check in despite us telling them we needed to be quick.  The staff are desperately keen to help.

Room was great, with probably the most little extras I've ever seen in a hotel.  Very comfortable & clean & plenty of character, with a great public lounge which kept on serving us complimentary nibbles until we were too full for dinner.  The place is quite a maze; in terms of location, excellent for all the touristy things.

Would very much recommend, especially if you relish lots of attention from the very well trained staff.",4,2014,05,06
137,A true gem --,"Discreetly located near Parliament and Buckingham Palace, this hotel goes the extra mile in providing professional, friendly service; more than comfortable surroundings. A fully staffed, beautifully appointed lounge is a central place for guests to gather information about the city, relax at nearly any time of the day or night with libations and nibbles provided, or the option of  ordering a meal from their regular menu. I have never stayed anywhere like it in all my travels.  The staff is extraordinary and makes this what it is -- a true gem.",5,2014,05,05
137,Fantastic!,"We just had the most wonderful stay at the Hotel 41.

The service was impecable, very friendly and professional.

Everything was made to make us feel comfortable.

The room was absolutely lovely and we particularily enjoyed having a very nice afternon tea, by the fire place, in the splendid lounge of the Hotel.

Very high standard hotel. No doubt we'll go back!",5,2014,05,05
137,second time having the pleasure of a stay here,"this is the second time we have stayed at 41 and it was a great stay. the staff is very professional and they went way out of their way to make us comfortable. the ""plunder the pantry"" option is great for late night returns to the hotel- we mad a meal out of it more than once, although the restaurant served food is very good as well. the library are reception is a pleasant place to hang out and have a cocktail. bravo red carnation hotel group! all your staff is to be commended.",5,2014,05,04
137,One of my all time favourites,"Absolutely loved the executive lounge, gorgeous hotel and fantastic location. I would totally recommend it, but if you are looking for a big hotel with loads of room then this isn't for you. It's a small yet delicate hotel with buckets of character.",5,2014,04,29
137,Top marks to 41 - a real luxury home from home - just up the road from 'her majesty's place',"That this hotel is amongst the best in London comes as no surprise - I hadn't realised it's actually No.1 in TA!

First impressions - it's true that some taxi drivers are not aware of it but they all seem to know the Rubens next door so it's no problem. The front doors open directly on to B.P. Road but no worries.  As soon as your taxi arrives outside your cases are whisked away in double quick time and re-appear in your room a little later.  What immediately struck me was the wood panelling, the polished brass and the gentleman's club feel (or at least how I imagine them to be since I've never set foot in one). Service is exemplary from the word go.

Up to the fifth floor and past a multitude of black and white framed cartoons on the wall (not of the Tom and Jerry variety I hasten to add).  The wow factor definitely hits you as you enter the main dining, relaxing and reception area.  Overall feel of a library (and there are lots of books filling the bookcases which surround you with much wood paneling here too).  Glass ceiling makes the room really bright and airy. The room is opulently but quite subtly decorated.  I'm not sure if there was an aspidistra plant but, if not, it felt like there should be.  Check-in was quickly and efficiently dealt with.  A few glasses of complimentary bubbly later and we were ready to see the room though we could have soaked in the 'wow' a bit longer!

I was with my wife and two teenage children and had booked the Balmoral Suite as it had two sofa beds that I thought would suit us well.  Well, it was fine but in honesty only just.  On the last day we had the beds converted back into sofas and it was easy to see why couples would love the space.  As it was we were left squeezing past the bottom of one of them - consistently banging the TV on the wall (even sober!). The small lounge area - separated by two doors from the main room - was a little easier and had its own shower/bathroom.  The main room  was very comfortable with a number of good if inexpensive 'goodies'. The shower room was a bit tight (no room for cat-swinging) and the main bathroom a little too narrow and lacking enough space for three lots of washing things. But there were three TV's in the room (one of which at the press of a button appeared out of a cabinet at the foot of the main bed) and one (slightly over the top?) in the bathroom.  A really nice paneled walk-in closet which had lots of space.  A line of windows gave good light and a view over the Royal Mews.

Back to 'that room'.  Others have disliked its multiple uses - can't say it worried us in the slightest. There is a delightful gallery accessed via a wooden staircase where a handful of breakfast tables are set up.  Only drawback?  It's not for people 6' 6"" tall like me - very low ceiling!  But I think it contains the only table that really works for four people.  We were the only 'four' I noticed during our stay of 5 nights - so we used to split up into adults and kids for eating.

The breakfast menu was good - I love having a choice of kippers and haddock along with all the various egg options.  If I had once criticism it would be that there seemed to be a slight timing difference between the cooking of eggs, bacon, sausage and its arrival on the table - like some of it may not have been cooked immediately prior to serving but removed from a dish of pre-cooked examples?  Maybe I'm wrong but it's what it seemed like.  Cereals, fruit, meat, cheeses and pastries though were all excellent.  Also, a wide variety of teas, coffees and juices.  Service for me was, on occasion, a bit over-attentive.  Repeated ""is everything ok?"", ""can I get you anything?"" is good service but given the room is not that big I could have just called them over maybe.  On check-out I also suggested that a little more catering to diabetics (eg. cereal and jams without sugar) would be good. But I'm being a bit picky maybe and after all it was in that gorgeous room ...

Check-out was again very efficient - the above comments accepted with good grace and thanks - and a couple of items on the bill I challenged were removed in seconds.

As to price I can't really comment as I have no benchmark for boutique hotels of this kind and after it we did occupy a suite. Was it expensive - yes, I thought so but was it poor value for money?  I don't think so given the overall quality, extras and service levels.

So, now the test.  Would I go back?  Undoubtedly. Its location is great for Buckingham Palace and the Royal Mews across the road,  It's very near a stop for two of the London bus tours (if that's your thing) and five minutes walk from Victoria station (train and tube).  There is a great restaurant next door (BBar) and a few restaurants in a small shopping mall round the corner.  Also, as a tourist, there is a two-floored ""British"" store for you to fill up with all that Union Jack stuff before you return home!  Ok it's not right in the centre of things but there's nothing better (in good weather) than a walk through St. James Park (my favourite in London) to get to Big Ben, Westminster Abbey etc.

Ok - enough of this book - hope you enjoy 41 as much as we did! (Oh and thanks to all the multi-national team at 41 too!).  I must try to sample some of the other hotels in the group in the future !!",5,2014,04,28
137,The reviews are accurate,"Just got back from a four-night stay at this wonderful boutique hotel, and I have to say that all of the positive reviews are completely accurate. I was almost a bit suspicious when booking the hotel, given how overwhelmingly positive the reviews were. But this really is a wonderful little hotel, with fantastic service, an excellent location, and all sorts of little touches that make it a very unique place to stay.

I won't repeat what is in the other reviews, other than to confirm that service was fantastic throughout - very attentive, responsive, and super-friendly. Our room (an executive king) was very spacious and very tastefully decorated. Bathroom a bit small, but perfectly adequate. We got an in-facing room, which didn't have much of a view, but made up for it by being utterly quiet. And the executive lounge is a wonderful space, with food available pretty much around the clock. The snacks during the day were very tasty, and the ""plunder the pantry"" available in the evenings was a terrific way to end each day, with a huge assortment of cold cuts, salads, smoked fish, etc.

Location was also very convenient, right next to Buckingham Palace and St. James Park, 15 minute walk to Westminster Abbey and Big Ben, and a lovely 25 minute walk through the park to Trafalgar Square. Also convenient to the Victoria tube station.

The one thing I would note is that this is very much a special boutique hotel, and not a big full-service hotel. It has only 28 rooms, and a marvelous atmosphere - it felt less like a hotel and more like belonging to some kind of exclusive club. To the extent that there are any negative reviews, I think this comes from a mismatch about expectations. If you need the full array of services from a large hotel, then this may not be the right place. However, if you are looking for a wonderful boutique hotel with fantastic service, then this is a great choice.",5,2014,04,23
137,My 40th birthday at this fantastic hotel. ,"My husband booked this amazing hotel for my 40th birthday for a three night stay. All the staff at Hotel 41 made you feel, comfortable, welcome and very very valued. From the champagne on arrival to the amazing breakfast in the executive lounge, the romantic turndown after our dinner out one evening, the complementary canapés every night, the soft music playing on arrival to our suite, the beautiful cheesecake birthday cake on the table in our suite when we arrived. Everything from start to finish was faultless. The little finishing touches too, the his and hers slippers which are so comfortable as well as the gorgeous Penhaligons toiletries in the bathroom.  Not a thing is missed and I would not hesitate to book this hotel again. Just wish I could afford to take my husband back again soon, even if just for one night. It's amazing and well worth it for that little something special. You will most certainly leave wanting more. Cannot recommend Hotel 41enough. Unbeatable!!! ",5,2014,04,22

The staff are second to none making you feel like family and royalty in a very homey way. We were attending a wedding so we had plenty of dining experiences but every time we came back to our hotel they seemed to top it w something even better. From the unique tasty appetizers to the cold bar w freshly sliced Salmon, cheeses paté and much more, available till the wee hours of the am. Open bar, ice cream, champagne and goid rum which is hard to come across sometimes in Europe,  they had it all. Well done guys, David

Rooms are lovely. Beautifully decorated and have everything you need including a fireplace. Our DVD player didn't work but the staff worked non stop until it did and they could not do enough to make up for it including bringing cocktails to our room and wavering the drinks we had throughout our stay. The pantry was amazing. We didn't need to eat out. Good quality ingredients which can be said for breakfast also which was amazing. Hope to return soon. It really is a special place. Thank you!

We were upgraded to a junior suite and the room was superb and the bed massive and comfortable.  The staff were attentive and considerate at all times and made the stay perfect for us both.

137,Great hotel & great experience.,Great hotel & great experience.  I've stayed here once with the Soho was fully booked and could not have been more pleased.  The rooms each have character and the hotel staff is very accommodating.  I highly recommend this hotel.,5,2014,04,09
137,Luxury!,I had the pleasure of staying at this amazing hotel last year. what can I say but wow! Everything was perfect from our arrival to our departure! The staff are very welcoming and hard working! Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone!,5,2014,04,09
137,Amazing hotel & staff,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying here for 4 nights in February, 2014.  We splurged and booked the conservatory suite.  Everything from check-in to departure was perfect.  The room was absolutely beautiful with all the amenities you could need.  Having the extra space was very comfortable.  The staff, each and everyone, truly went above and beyond to make sure you enjoyed your stay.  The snacks and treats in the lounge were wonderful and we were able to take advantage of ""plundering the pantry"" a few times.  This was our first time to London and the location worked out perfectly for everything we wanted to do.  It seemed as though everything was within walking distance.  You really feel as though you're in your own private little part of London. 

Thank you to all the staff at Hotel 41.",5,2014,04,07
137,Its Amazing,"what an excellent experience, from arrival to departure the service is world class. The staff know who you are and are extremely welcoming and totally efficient.  champagne on arrival, clear explanation of how anything works. In the room that have thought, and do think of everything. We had his and his slipper bags as opposed to standard his and hers.  Personal notes in the room handwritten. Every T is crossed and every I is dotted.

LOVED IT",5,2014,04,07
137,Best hotel in London,"Stayed here for one night whilst we went to the theatre. I was so impressed with the staff and the little extras that this will now be our default hotel for London. The staff were far and away the most genuinely friendly and helpful staff we have experienced in the UK.

Some of the little but special touches were:
- staff remembering your itinerary so always one step ahead, including flagging a taxi down as soon as I emerged from the lift
- always offering something extra, such as an umbrella and bottle of water on the way out or professionally wrapping the flowers I had bought for my wife so I could carry them on the train
- arranging spots in the hotel for me to have business meetings and caring as much for my guests as they did for me
- the free snacks, canapés and late night deli selection were all top quality, no limp cheese or ham slices in sight. The deli included smoked salmon and potted prawns and fresh bread. The food was so nice we didn't bother to have an evening meal, having had a business lunch already, so the hotel was actually quite cost effective! Perfect for a theatre trip.

The inside rooms are quiet but of course no view. Perfectly decorated though with more TV square inches than you are likely to have at home!

This place has such a relaxed, grown up feel that it is great for adults who want to be treated like royalty. You would be a very stressed parent if you had your kids running around the place though with all the beautiful furnishings and hushed, calm atmosphere.

Whilst Hotel 41 is at the expensive end of the market, if you can afford it you won't regret it.",5,2014,04,06
137,Incredible hotel and the best hotel I have stayed at in London,"This is quite simply a totally amazing experience. The staff are superb and nothing is too much trouble. They all remember your name and are incredibly helpful. The room was beautifully decorated and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. The lounge area is beautiful and relaxing and you get given canapés and snacks with your drinks. There is an honesty bar and the ""pantry"" food is very good. I can't wait to go back again. The location is super and it is such a treat to find a hotel like this in a big city. Loved it!",5,2014,04,05
137,very good,"I was stay at Hotel 41 for 2 nights. I was really impressed with their service. My room was also very nice, clean and large. The staffs were helpful too. I really like this hotel and would like to come back here again.",5,2014,04,05
137,Wonderful,"We only stayed one night but now looking forward to a return visit. We received a warm welcome, friendly efficient service, nothing was too much trouble. Pleasant room and very comfortable bed. Loved the idea of 'raiding the pantry' post theatre. Home from home feel in the lounge. Food excellent. Good central location.",5,2014,04,04
137,Feels like you are in a movie!,"I love this hotel. Its ambiance makes you feel like you are back in Twin Peaks times...! The lift has only one floor to chose...5th floor. Would be nice to call it 4 1/2 or something. Black and white decor, very friendly people, excellent kitchen and breakfast and very good location. What else can you ask for? Only small downside is, I called a week later to inquire if they found something I lost but they never got back to me...",5,2014,04,03
137,A perfect London Hotel!,"My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41 for 9 nights while in London.  We were impressed well beyond our expectations.  The hotel was very clean and quiet and well located, very close to Victoria Station.  The staff were exceptional - always friendly and extremely professional. They even arranged for rose petals to be strewn in our room when they learned it was my birthday.  We have stayed in many hotels in North America, Europe, Hawaii and Asia and this hotel is by far the very best we have come across.  You won't regret booking here!",5,2014,04,02
137,My new favourite London Hotel,"What can I say! Just book it!!  This is one the best hotels I have ever stayed in for service. they  say nothing is too much trouble and it really is. Our arrival was delayed 24hrs by a flight issue but Hotel 41 were great and had our transfer rearranged. Lovely car waiting for us on arrival and easy check in despite is being 6.30am. They felt bad for our delay so added a complimentary breakfast to our stay. We had a lovely champagne afternoon tea, the happy hour drinks and nibbles are amazing and the plunder the pantry is incredible. The selection of drinks/nibbles always on offer is a real benefit. Our room was an executive king room and was really lovely with everything you could need at your finger tips.  Can not recommend this hotel enough. It's not cheap but with all the extras and great  location itsworth it.",5,2014,03,31
137,Fantastic,"Loved that this hotel is not boringly ""corporate"". From the friendly, helpful front desk on, it feels different and special, like a private club. Staff all very friendly and professional.  The lounge is bright, airy and comfortable.  The room was large with excellent bathroom with bath plus separate shower. Plenty of wardrobe and storage space and loved all the extra touches, especially the candles burning in the bathroom when we came back, chocs, olives etc etc.  Comfy robes (but would have liked the slippers immediately - they arrived with the ""turn down"").  Good curtains/blinds kept the light out (but I think a little maintenance is needed to the blind). Quiet.  Spotlessly clean.  Provided everything you could possibly want and more (including the essentials for a spot of work). Overall, excellent.  Would definitely stay again. Good location near Victoria station.",5,2014,03,31
137,Fantastic stay,"one of the best hotels I have stayed in the world, Service from second arriving is like you are Royalty in fact thought I had booked into Buckingham palace next door by mistake. 
Bedrooms are fresh and well appointed and the food at both locations was superb",5,2014,03,31
137,A very special place! Note the taxis tip!,"Hotel 41 is about as special as it gets. 

Firstly a tip.....most London cabbies will not have heard of it! This is not a negative, it's indicative of the exclusive nature of the place. Because of its small size and it's reputation only a lucky few get to stay there!

The Hotel Rubens is right next door and the cabbie will know that one!

Enough has been said about the quality of the place in other reviews which I fully concur with however what sets a hotel apart is the response when something goes wrong. In my case an afternoon tea where the finger sandwiches were dry. A quiet word saw the whole effort removed, an apology after 10 minutes because the manager was still not happy when she checked the replacement which was duly sent back with (I suspect blunt words to the chef to get it sorted!).

I Then got what was a magnificent cream tea and everything was perfect. When I checked out a day later, no surprise it find there was no charge for the afternoon tea.

What sets this place apart is the staff and their attention to detail. Nothing is too much trouble. The service is, quite simply, exquisite.

I'll be back!

David Talbot",5,2014,03,31
137,A perfect romantic weekend!,"I stayed at this hotel for one night with my girlfriend, in a junior suite with the romantic package. After a show and dinner we returned to find the suite covered with roses, the bath full and chocolates on the bed! It was perfect. The room was great, very clean, and the room service food was excellent. The staff were great and overall it was a fantastic experience. I recommend this hotel.",5,2014,03,30
137,London lodging at its best,"We were guests at 41 for 6 days in March and our experience was unmatched by any other hotel we've stayed at.  From the time we were greeted at the door, we felt as though the hotel was there only for us.  The attention of the staff went beyond professional.  All were friendly and accommodating in the very best tradition of 5 star hotels.  The attention of the staff -- from the general manager, Malcolm Hendry to the resident managers Lauren and Monika to the wait staff -- made us feel valued and respected on all counts.  Requests for dining suggestions, tour routes, directions to destinations, reservations and travel schedules were all answered promptly and efficiently.  If you can stay in only one place in London, ask the taxi driver to take you to 41.  He may not know where it is since it's a small hotel, so tell him it's by the Hotel Ruben.  You will not regret the decision.",5,2014,03,29
137,Extremely Disappointed,"Re: Hotel 41, 41 Buckingham Palace Road, London SW1WOPS.
My wife and I stayed in “Hotel 41” for three nights in January 2014
I purposely booked Trip Advisor’s No.1 Luxury 5 Star Hotel in London. We had previously stayed in the No. 4 rated hotel, the Corinthia, which was excellent but as this was a special occasion I thought I would go better and go to the best – how disappointing. 
In no way does this hotel live up to the standard of a 5 star hotel. My wife described it as a luxury  
B &B and we are dumbfounded as to how it achieved its rating from Trip Advisor as being the No. 1, 5 star luxury hotel in London.
Here are our comments:-
If this is the best 5 star Luxury Hotel in London it must cast a shadow on all other 5 star hotels in the city. Our experience of the 41 would lead us to question all of Trip Advisors Ratings and how they are computed. We would also question the standards necessary to obtain a 5 star hotel rating.
In our opinion this is simply not a 5 star hotel. That said we would not in any way fault the staff who were exemplary.
We also note that the Red Carnation Group has managed to obtain the 1st, 2nd and 3rd rating on Trip Advisor for luxury hotels in London. Can this be correct? Have other hotels noting to say as to how the ratings are computed.
The Hotel is actually the 5th Floor of the Rubens Hotel as we discovered by taking the wrong lift and arriving in the reception area of the Reubens. Why the owners wish the 41 to be billed as a separate hotel from the Rubens we do not understand.
Arrival & Location
We arrived at London City Airport and our taxi driver had never heard of the hotel. However when we finally located the hotel and my wife saw the unimposing entrance her heart sank – a side entrance to Rubens Hotel!
During our stay we always had to ask our Taxi driver to take us to the Rubens as they had no knowledge of Hotel 41.
The small entrance had a desk and armchair – we then had to walk a short corridor and up 4 steps to take a lift to the 5th Floor as this, as was explained to us, was the hotel. In our opinion no possibility for wheelchair access.
On the 5th Floor we exited on to a number of corridors passing 12 doors and turning 4 corridors before arriving at the Executive Lounge which was describe by the staff as “the heart of the hotel” 
This executive lounge was impressively and comfortably furnished in mahogany, heavy drapes and customised furniture with a lighting gas fire.
This lounge served so many purposes -- it was the main business area for check in, restaurant, lounge and snack room.  Unfortunately there was little privacy here when dealing with the staff, either from the point of view of seeking advice, checking-in or checking out etc.  --- the business of guests could be heard by all – “Would you like champagne, did you enjoy the show, was the Restaurant satisfactory etc.”?
It reminded my wife of our kitchen at home or maybe even a train station. Indeed the lounge also served as the main restaurant. There appeared to be no other restaurant in the “hotel” as this was where breakfast was served. 
Our room – The Executive King Room
Small, overcrowded with furniture but no wardrobe space. Even for a short stay we could barely fit our clothes in the wardrobe; it had a hanging rail a metre long. We had to squash our clothes together and we were only there for 3 nights.  The length of the hanging space was too short for my wife’s coat.
In spite of this the room contained a large desk, a central table with 4 chairs, a side table with 2 chairs, a 6ft bed with side cabinets – all of this but no adequate wardrobe space.
The Bathroom
Also on the very small scale for a 5 star hotel. It had a shower cum bath, a small hand basin and no bidet.
Both  bedroom and bathroom were laden with toiletries, sets of slippers, beautiful gowns, umbrellas, shoe shine ,fresh fruit basket,, water rose petals, candles etc.
Concierge
Because of our special occasion we asked to be recommended to a restaurant of Michelin star quality. The restaurant recommended was certainly not of that standard and disappointingly we left, luckily to be accommodated in Scotts.
Through reception we booked tickets for Billy Elliot and were surprised to learn that each £65 ticket cost a £19 booking fee. The Theatre was far from full and our row of seats was completely empty.
The Staff
We felt that the staff were so anxious to please in any way but because of the position of the Customers desk in the executive Lounge it was not comfortable to make any negative comments as they could be overhear by any other guests.
We felt truly deceived by this Hotels 5 star luxury rating and cannot understand how it was rated as the No. 1 trip advisor Luxury Hotel.

All in all, a most disappointing stay in London which up to now has always been so enjoyable.",1,2014,03,28
137,Simply the best 5 star hotel we have ever stayed at!,"Let me start by saying we normally stay in 5 star hotels. We have stayed at the Ritz, Mandarin and many other high end 5 star hotels around the world.

This was without a doubt the best.

The hotel itself only has 29 rooms/suites. There is a lovely reading room you walk into, this is the place you dine and sit while you wait for your room.

Upon checking in we where presented with four different choices of champagne. Not just the cheap stuff either. We had a choice from 4 great brands. We both opted for the Veuve clique (one of our favourites). Two large glasses of free champagne later we were lead to our room.

The room itself was lovely large, spacious. Great views.

The room itself had sky TV in, this is a first for any hotel we have stayed in.

The shower was nothing short of incredible. A great power shower.
The bed was the most comfortable and largest bed we have ever experienced. Compare this to the bed we had at the Mandarin, which was like sleeping on a hard wood floor!

The staff are some of the nicest staff we have ever experienced. They know you on a first name basis, always there having unforced natural conversations with the guests.

The breakfasts are brilliant. We were presented with a menu with over 10 major choices. The first morning I opted for the cooked breakfast, second morning the eggs benedict. Everything cooked perfectly. Pair this with the continental breakfast bar that has a wide choice of things from Yogurts, cereals, different meats (parma ham, smoked salmon etc).

They have an area in the reading room where you can help yourself to free treats throughout your stay, including sweets, ice cream and many other canapes. This is a great touch. Normally for this type of service we would have to pay a lot more to go club level.

We got a deal including two nights in an upgraded room, breakfast and a romantic turn down service (including chocolate covered strawberry, chocolates, bottle of Louis Rodera champagne) for £700. We stayed in an upgraded room at the mandarin, without breakfast and that cost us £640 for one night! so this is by far a bargain in comparison. We will never stay anywhere in London again, this place cannot be beaten in our opinion. The little touches are the things that count and really make an experience memorable.",5,2014,03,28
137,Unbelievable,"Certainly the best choice in London. Excellent location, near some of the most attractive points. The best of all is a higher level of service from the hotel management and staff. I had the great pleasure of staying at the Hotel 41 and would recommend it to anyone without reservation.",5,2014,03,27
137,Bob on.,"Perfect and very comfortable exclusive hotel.
Loads of freebies, one needn't venture out really.
Will stay longer next time.
No grumbles what so ever.
Highly recommended. 
Some rooms are better than others. 

",5,2014,03,26
137,What a great experience!,"What a top notch hotel. I am not even done with our stay and am compelled to write a review based on the level of service from the hotel management and staff. 

 When we arrived we were greeted and given champagne. After all the paperwork we were shown around the hotel and went to our room. When we arrived there were a few issues with the room (TV didn't work properly, shower handle broke, and the toilette made a lot of noise). We brought it to managements attention and they took care of it the next morning while we were out.

Once we got back everything was fixed. In addition, we were given an upgraded room with complimentary champagne. Based on our current experiences I would give six out of five stars.",5,2014,03,25
137,"Your Own Exclusive, Private Club in the Heart of London","I had the great pleasure of staying at the Hotel 41 for a short 3 day holiday with my husband to celebrate my 35th birthday.  I have stayed at some beautiful hotels around the world, including in London, but there was something special about Hotel 41.

The hotel is very small - just one floor - but it feels very exclusive and private feel.  The main lounge/library is absolutely gorgeous, and is the center of activity at the hotel -- it's where you check in, have breakfast, and can lounge around with a drink or cup of tea after a day of sightseeing.  It has a  lovely fireplace, and my only complaint about my visit was that every time I went to the lounge, the spots next to the fireplace were always taken!  It's the kind of space you don't want to leave.  

The rooms are gorgeously appointed.  Our bedroom was very quaint with a small gas fireplace, and an extremely luxurious bed.  I slept better at the Hotel 41 than I had slept in years.

What makes the hotel unique from other beautiful hotels is the level of personalized service.  By the time you leave, it feels like you are friends with every member on the staff.  The staff are always helpful and attentive, but not in a way that invades your privacy.   As some of the other reviews have noted, the phone in the room has a ""Whatever, Whenever"" button and it is truly that - no request is too large or too small.

 I give my highest praise to this hotel and would recommend it to anyone without reservation.",5,2014,03,24
137,Best Kept Secret in London,Recently spent 4 nights in London at Hotel 41.  This is the best kept secret in London.  It is a great location within walking distance of many attractions.    The service from the moment we walked in the door was nothing short of superb.  The amenities and service of a 5 star hotel with the cozy feel and intimacy of a B&B is the best way I can describe the experience.  We will definitely stay here on our next visit to London.  ,5,2014,03,23
137,Marvelous!,"One of the top notel to stay in London. Great service to help you for all problems. Rooms are large and very clean, bathrooms wonderfull. We strongly suggest if you want to have a perfect stay in London!",5,2014,03,23
137,"""Out of this World!""","Booked Hotel 41 having google searched for top hotels in London and thereafter reading the reviews on this site.  Everything sounded and looked amazing and fitted our needs so I couldn't resist and booked.
Was my 40th birthday celebration and it was magical from start to finish.  The Hotel is absolutely stunning and pristine, the staff are so polite and attentive without being pretentious.  Its all about the service at this place, they truly want you to have the best experience ever and you will not be disappointed.
We were lavished with champagne on arrival and then a complimentary bottle (and a very expensive one too!) in our room for my birthday celebrations.  Very romantic turndown at night and Happy Birthday cheesecake in room when we returned from the theatre.
We chose to eat our dinner in the Bbar Restaurant where we were again greeted with complimentary champagne as a birthday treat.  The staff were very friendly and the meal was great.
I could go on forever as our wonderful memories and talk of this ""diamond find"" will, however, I can only say ""Treat yourself, you deserve to experience this!""
We will definitely be back. Thanks so much to all staff for making this a truly wonderful birthday.",5,2014,03,22
137,Five stars are not enough!!,"Our stay at Hotel 41 was a totally unique experience.  We have stayed in good, even great, hotels before but this one is very different.  The hotel is limited by its size but this is a positive thing since the staff are able to know the guests and their preferences and able to service their needs in an exclusive, personal and yet unobtrusive way.
Nothing is too much trouble.  Consideration and sensitivity are paramount.
We mentioned that we had Grandma babysitting our three children at home - on checking out we were given a box of beautiful and assorted sweets for our children, chocolates for my mother-in law and coffee and water to-go for our journey - just one more, of the many aspects that sets the hotel apart.
Somehow the five stars seem inadequate since there is an apparent void and tangible difference between run-of-the-mill five star hotels and Hotel 41.
We were utterly impressed, would use the hotel above any other London hotel and hope to return before too long.
Simply a special place to stay!",5,2014,03,22
137,A magical stay,"We booked Hotel 41 primarily due to it's ideal location for our needs and excellent sets of reviews which gave us confidence that we would have a good stay.  I have to say that we were delighted that our experience exceeded our already high expectations.  The hotel itself is wonderfully comfortable but what really made it stand out for us was the superbly accommodating and attentive staff.  It's the small details that make the difference and at Hotel 41 no detail is overlooked.    
I cannot recommend Hotel 41 highly enough and will happily return there on my next city break in central London.  If you are looking for a treat you will do the same.",5,2014,03,18
137,Exceeded expectations,"The problem with reading so many great reviews about a place is that you set your own expectations very high indeed. I can say that having just spent Saturday night at this hotel, as part of a special big birthday surprise, the hotel, service, room and food were excellent. It is not a formal or pretentious place, just comfortable and welcoming. The staff are excellent and having only stayed in large impersonal hotels before, it was a lovely experience to be treated so well. It delivered not only everything we were expecting, but much more. Yes, it cost more than we would usually pay, but was absolutely worth the extra. We will stay here again, for sure.",5,2014,03,17
137,Looking forward to next time,"We have stayed in this hotel for the 3 rd time once again amazing service,amazing room,amazing time. We have stayed here as a couple and also as a family with our children. The staff are great with the children. Although the hotel is beautiful ,clean ,and luxury rooms. It's the staff that makes us come back. We look forward to our next stay with 41",5,2014,03,17
137,I'd move in if I could,"Like being a member of a private club. Discreet, private entrance. Always welcomed back by name. The included executive lounge is an important part of the experience. Great location, across from buckingham. ",5,2014,03,14
137,Couldn't of been better,enjoyed everyday I stayed here. everyone was super friendly and attentive. great cozy rooms. would most definitely stay here if i have the chance. really memorable stay. and the food was to die for!  highly recommend.,5,2014,03,13
137,Fifth floor haven,If you want quiet and luxuriously comfortable place to come back to after a busy day out and about in London then this is it. We stayed for two nights for our 28th wedding anniversary and it was quite simply the best service we have ever received in a hotel. The romantic turndown was simply beautiful. Breakfast was delicious and our needs were often anticipated; no request was considered trivial and there seemed to be a genuine desire on the part of all staff to help make our stay as pleasant as possible. I honestly don't know how you create that through training. We had delightful afternoon tea and later when we returned from an evening at the theatre we enjoyed the relaxed library lounge (styled like a private club) where we enjoyed a snack and drink with their 'Plunder the pantry' service in front of the fire. We look forward to returning.,5,2014,03,12
137,Pampering at its best,"Just returned from a two night stay here and will return. Felt very pampered from arrival to departure. The staff are attentive without being intrusive. Romantic turndown very special as are the little gifts each evening. The executive lounge is a haven of relaxation and very nice food, full English very good. I enjoyed discovering new things in the room and executive lounge. Amazing drench shower. Great location for transport and sights.",5,2014,03,09
137,fabulous hotel,"This small hotel is so discreet it would be easy to miss it, next to Reubens, easy walk to the palace and parks, Victoria Station and  theatre. We had a delightful 1 night stay here, just wish it had been longer.
The room was a good size comfortable  and clean, very stylish (love the black and white carpet) with big bed (thick soft mattress topper) small sofa, and everything we needed. 
Lovely touches like the glass of champagne while we checked in, fruit and chocolates on the table,  soft music playing, rose petals and candles lit around the room when we got back from our night out. The red petals  looked so pretty in the black and white room. All made our stay extra, extra special.
Plenty of lovely toiletries, gowns, towels etc. in the small bathroom.  
The lounge/reception is very interesting, with its glass roof. Complementary snacks seem to be on offer most of the time.  Enjoyed a lovely hot pasty from the complementary butlers pantry when we got back from the theatre in the evening as well as ice cream after our walks.  Breakfast was amazing, no teabags either, proper tea leaves really did taste better. (have to admit to using teabags myself).
Lots of very attentive staff, couldn't have been better, we were looked after so well! We will certainly be back as soon as we can. We have only experienced  this level of service in the far east before.
Thank you very much to everyone at 41. We really enjoyed ourselves.
The previous reviewer wasn't impressed. It is an expensive small hotel but you do get what you pay for  -  Luxury!          This isn't just an anon 5* hotel. That's why we loved it,",5,2014,03,07
137,Not really impressed,"Stayed at this hotel last November and was somewhat disappointed to be honest.I keep on reading rave reviews about this place but I've actually stayed in better B & B's around the country.
It's very expensive for what's on offer and I probably would return if the price was reduced by 50%.
There are alot of expensive gadgets in the bedroom that are probably seldom used ( e.g. TV in long narrow bathroom that is almost impossible to view - then why would you want to of course ?
Not really for me I'm afraid to say.
There are far better places to stay in London for the price ( like 5* hotels )
Apologies , but too many reasons against recommending this hotel as being one of the best in London.",3,2014,03,06
137,Fantastic romantic hotel,"Hotel 41 is a fantastic little hotel, in the heart of London.
The service is super, the rooms are nicen and the whole place is like living in an old english mansion.
We loved it and will come back some other time.",5,2014,03,05
137,Another great visit,Hotel 41 never let's me down. Staff amazing - food awesome  rooms so comfortable great bathroom -had a two story room with fireplace and sitting area. Very quiet  see you next year :) location location location,5,2014,03,04
137,Magical,"Our first time to London and so much to see and do.  An amazing city!  That said, the Hotel 41 was a big highlight of our trip and we would fly from Canada again just to spend time at this Hotel.  The management and staff are truly special in how they made us feel very comfortable and catered to our every desire making us feel like royalty.  A special thanks to Monika.  From the second you walk into this hotel it is very unique and warm feeling.  Our room was spacious, very functional, and romantic.  The beautifully designed lounge was quaint, and we always looked forward to spending time there at the end of a long day of sightseeing to relax and enjoy great food by the fireplace or in a cozy corner playing chess.  The staff really go out of their way to cater to your every need and beyond.  Like I say, the hotel in and of itself would be reason enough for a vacation to London.  Thanks to Monica and the rest of the team for making our stay so wonderful.  We will be back again someday.",5,2014,03,01
137,A wonderful place to remember!,"I booked the executive king room for my boyfriends 25th birthday and from start to finish the service and atmosphere was old school class. I couldn't fault anything about this hotel and truly feel like I have found a treasure in London. Brilliant for romance, quality time with your other half and full of pleasant surprises. Great location and scrumptious selection of food, drink and breakfast in the morning. I couldn't suggest booking Hotel 41 enough if only for one night it is really worth every penny! The staff make this hotel and it was a breath of fresh air to feel so well looked after.  ",5,2014,03,01
137,We loved the hotel and its staff.,"This hotel has excellent location. The services were very pleasant. room was very clean, nice decorated and quit too. The restaurant serve good foods, Just wonderful.For sure I would stay here. Definitely worthed for the money...",5,2014,02,23
137,Fabulous hotel,As an extra treat for my husbands birthday I booked into hotel 41 for two nights. The whole stay was wonderful primarily due to the care and attention the staff and management discreetly provide. Many a large hotel could take a leaf out of the lengths of service this little gem of a hotel provides its guests. There are an abundance of excellent little touches like raid the pantry and champagne on arrival that also add to the experience. It is also worth highlighting that if you are looking for a romantic couple of days in the capital then the hotel goes a long way to make it memorable!,5,2014,02,23
137,Amazing,"Stayed here for my 21st birthday as a surprise from my boyfriend. I've never been anywhere and been treated so nicely. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff there. I was given roses and chocolates and surprised with a 'romantic turndown' in the room which was amazing. We were given a room upgrade as it was a special occasion, and the hotel arranged our entire evening when we went to see Billy Elliot. They booked our tickets which were right at the front in the middle and got me a signed programme which they left on the dinner table which was also covered in rose petals. 
The pantry where you can eat complimentary food throughout the day is also delicious! came back after Billy Elliot and we had bread and salamis and cheeses and haagen daaz!
It was an amazing and unforgettable 2 days and would recommend this hotel to everyone.",5,2014,02,23
137,Delightful,I have stayed in a lot if hotels in my lifetime and this one definitely stands out. Genuine attention to detail with a smile  is not something that is easy to instil in the staff.. That is because they must really enjoy what they do.. And this wonderful boutique has pulled it off in virtually every category. From choice and quality of champagnes to supplying plasters (band aids). Your attention and friendliness right from the entrance to departure sets you a class above the rest.. And the Eggs Royale were definitely the best I gave tasted!  Congrats to all staff! ,5,2014,02,22
137,Fantastic,"Wow!!! What a beautiful boutique hotel this is. Fantastic staff who are never overbearing, but always on hand to help if needed. The rooms were large enough and well decorated. 
The complimentary food and nibbles means you never go hungry for long.
The location is also great for visiting Buckingham Palace which is a stones throw away. Maybe not the cheapest hotel available but you get what you pay for - first class service and any needs catered for.
Thanks again to all the staff for making this a truly memorable Valentines stay.",5,2014,02,18
137,My new favourite,"Having a very romantic boyfriend, I have been lucky enough to stay in some gorgeous hotels. He booked us in to the conservatory suite of hotel 41 for valentines. It was a gorgeous split level suite with a glass roof, open fireplace, the most comfy bed and all the mod cons you could need. The bathroom had a corner jacuzzi bath, stand up rainfall shower and a mirrored ceiling. The suit was decorated beautifully in a monochrome theme. We also had a bouquet of flowers and champagne on ice on arrival. My boyfriend had arranged this prior to arrival and you could tell great care had been taken to set this up. We went out for dinner and whilst enjoying drinks in the lounge, staff had put more champagne in the room with roses, scattered petals throughout the suite, beautifully arranged roses, strawberries and massage oils on the bed as well as pretty tea lights dotted around the suite. Again you could tell the staff had ensured this was all arranged perfectly.
From the moment you step in the hotel you are treated like royalty, amazingly friendly, attentive staff. Check in was quick and we were treated to champagne whilst being checked in and shown the executive lounge, which has an honesty bar where you can help yourself to drinks and log it in the book, or you could have one of the lovely staff serve you drinks, cocktails, wine, (etc). They also served cider which pleased my boyfriend. Nothing was too much for the staff. The hotel has plunder the pantry at night where you can relax in the executive lounge whilst helping yourself to complimentary cakes, cheeses, breads, cold cuts, crisps, desserts amongst other delicious goodies. 
Check out was swift and easy and you were offered tea, coffee or soft drinks whilst check out was completed. From start to finish it was made special, can't compliment the staff enough.
Having stayed at the savoy New Year's Eve and thinking wow, I was even further impressed with this hidden little gem of a hotel. Definitely my new favourite. My boyfriend likes to treat me to a different hotel when we stay in London and I love the fact it's a new one each time but this is one I would return to again and again.",5,2014,02,16
137,What a Gem,"Stayed for one night on business and found it via a random search on the web. I always book direct with the hotel and the booking process was easy. Upon arrival at this chique, boutique hotel I was taken to check in at the lounge and offered a glass of champagne. From then one the level of service, attention to detail was exemplary. My US colleagues stayed at the Marriott, Park Lane for  room 4 pounds cheaper, bio prizes for guessing which was the better value. Although I was unable to enjoy it for long everything, even to a take away latte when I checked out was outstanding. Turn down service included lit candles and fresh fruit waiting for me. Lounge had snacks during the afternoon and an honour bar. Great location, great staff, great hotel. We will be back. I have already recommended it to my US based colleagues.",5,2014,02,12
137,Another fantastic stay,I can't praise the service and hospitality at hotel 41 enough. We have stayed at the hotel several times both as a couple and as a family with 3 children. The staff can not do enough for you and it's the personal touches that make it such a wonderful experience.,5,2014,02,11
137,The perfect hideaway,This is a beautiful hideaway right in the centre of London.  I cannot speak too highly of this hotel.  We were celebrating a landmark birthday and the excellent staff insured that our stay was as near perfect as possible.  I would like to return - something I have not said in any of my many reviews on this site.,5,2014,02,09
137,Oasis in Victoria,"This was booked as a anniversary celebration to see what the top hotel in our home city was like. We were greeted by the concierge, who sits on his own downstairs, and then waited for a receptionist to take us (sans luggage) to the 5th floor Executive Lounge to check in. We were offered a choice of welcome Champagnes and then taken to our room, where our case was waiting (they also bought the Champagne to our room).  Excellent start!
Even better - we had been upgraded to the Balmoral suite, which was a huge room, with a separate lounge area, three bathrooms (one small, but with a big and fast-filling bath, one with just a shower), two of which had heated floors. There was a welcome ""Happy Anniversary"" cheesecake (lovely) and petit fours and bottles of water.  We also liked the blue night lights in the bathrooms, the copious fluffy towels, the powerful shower and the huge walk-in closet. There were a few niggles as well: we couldn't get the heating to work; the main TV was hung 9"" off the wall (after walking into it twice and several near misses we moved the table from the middle of the room to underneath the TV - sorted!); and there is no kettle, although there is a hot water bottle in the closet!  There is a Nespresso machine, however.
The Executive Lounge is very nice with lots of free snacks available, an honour bar and lots of comfy seating.  Service is very friendly, willing and helpful.  We ordered tea in our room twice - very quick and nicely done, but the morning tea arrived with toast but no butter or knives!
Overall, a lovely place to stay, and very welcome respite from the chaos that is Victoria at the moment.",5,2014,02,07
137,Utterly delightful hotel!,"We recently stayed at Hotel 41 and could not have enjoyed our stay more.  

The rooms are charming, and the fact that many have gas fireplaces make them unusual in London as well as a cozy place to rest after a long day.  The Lounge area with its snacks, comfy couches and old world decor only add to the feeling of homeyness.

But, as previous reviewers have mentioned, the staff is what really make this hotel perfect.  They are welcoming, quickly know your name, and greet you warmly.  Everyone on the staff strives to be helpful and will go the extra mile to make sure you have everything to make your stay as pleasant as possible.  The Concierge was quickly responsive via email.

From a business traveler perspective, the WiFi was consistent and taxis were plentiful.  The staff received a package for me and had it in my room when we arrived.  When we were stranded in London due to weather, they made sure we were accommodated for the unexpected night.

We will definitely be returning to Hotel 41 on our next trip to London.",5,2014,02,04
137,At Home in London.,"I simply can't thank Hotel 41 enough for their tremendous support, kindness & individual attention to absolutely everything. I have lost count the times we have stayed, sometimes a visit to london in unhappy circumstances, others times more positive ~ A roller coaster few months. 41 is the ultimate and most certainly the most fabulous without any doubt, regardless of your reason for staying there. Everyone genuinely cares & you will feel wonderfully special. An extra enormous thank you to Lauren, alongside Monika & Cara. You have been simply super to Andrew & I.Lxx",5,2014,02,02
137,My absolute first choice ,"Business or pleasure Hotel 41 is my new first choice in London. I have to stay away from home often and so when I do it's good to be somewhere that is inclusive and service focussed. 41 has kind and attentive staff, lovely rooms and good food if you chose to eat in. I love it here and will be making it my base when in London",5,2014,02,01
137,Absolutely perfect,"A perfect service (special thanks to Florent!), an extremely cosy lounge and comfortable room, perfect welcome and room service, great décoration and attention to clients. Just food quality could be improved...sorry we are French ;-) be sure we will come back! ",5,2014,02,01
137,Love it every time!,"We have stayed here now 3 times and every time is just as good as the first. It feels like a family inside the city. The staff is consciences, kind, respectful, and wonderful. A jewel-perfect for business, family, or romance. Can't wait for our next visit!!  It is especially cozy at Christmas time with the decorations!",5,2014,01,27
137,fantastic,"OK, we're not use to 5 stars hotels. But even though, the week-end we've spent there was just fantastic and worth every penny! I highly recommend the 41 if you're looking for something very very special.",5,2014,01,27
137,Wonderful Anniversary Weekend Stay,"Stayed on 25th Jan for a 25th Anniversary weekend. We had an amazing stay at ""41"", from the moment we arrived the staff made us feel incredibly welcome and special; from the Champagne reception to attentive staff and the little extras in the beautifully decorated rooms, it was a very pleasant surprise and 100% lived up to the reviews I had read
All in all an amazing experience, so pleased we chose this hotel for our anniversary weekend away, we will be recommending to all our friends and family who want a special stay in London",5,2014,01,27
137,outstanding!!!,we were in utter awe and amazement by everything about this place!!!!   it topped any other top hotel we've ever stayed at!!!!  what a gem:)  i think it's london's best kept secret!!  the library feel and coziness and food were all too perfect!!!!!,5,2014,01,26
137,It doesn't get better than this for sure,Lovely hotel very knowledgeable staffs abd friendly too. The view we had was fantastic.  Very close to all tourist attraction.  All in all very good. The tube station is just a minute walk from the hotel. ,5,2014,01,26
137,Wonderful find! Amazing service,We stayed on 25/01/14 for my husbands 40th birthday. From the moment we entered the hotel it was apparent that the service is second to none. Wonderful decor and the friendly attentive staff made for a truly memorable stay.,5,2014,01,26
137,London's little gem,"Arrived at the hotel door which could have doubled for that of a 'Gentleman's Club,' of course it was Hotel 41. Once through the door after being buzzed in you are  greeted by a very friendly receptionist, she makes a call to a member of staff who then comes to escort you to the 5th floor and into the Executive Lounge.  You are again greeted by more friendly staff members. The Executive lounge is the heart beat of the hotel, the staff more than make you feel welcome and at ease, their attentiveness, it's what the hotel is all about. 

The room was adequate, the king size bed an obvious bonus. The bathrooms are larger than most, the showers were a little bit of a challenge. The English Breakfast was disappointing being a vegetarian, there were no alternatives and what they charge it was a total let down; if you go for the continental breakfast you will not be disappointed.

Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2014,01,26
137,A gem of a hotel,"We stayed at Hotel 41 on 22nd January on a trip to London to see a couple of shows.  I had not previously been aware of this hotel but my wife and I were tremendously impressed with the whole experience.
The service is outstanding and the staff were unfailingly helpful with any requests, including generously allowing us to check out an hour later than normal.  This enabled us to visit The Queen's Gallery, almost opposite, the following morning without having to rush.
A glass of champagne on arrival, especially of the quality offered, cannot fail to create an instant feel-good factor and a top-up as we relaxed by the open fire showed that it was more than just a standard gesture.  The room itself was beautifully furnished with a well co-ordinated black and white scheme - in fact the only colours in evidence were the fresh berries in the fruit basket and the pale blue remote control for the second television in the bathroom.  It is not easy to shave and watch TV at the same time but nevertheless a thoughtful offering.  The bed was enormous and the pillows the softest imaginable.  The provision of an exotic range of toiletries, bedroom slippers and dressing gowns were appreciated, whether or not used.
On our return from the show we were able to enjoy some tasty snacks from the complimentary buffet and a reasonably priced bottle of wine from the honour bar to round off a thoroughly relaxing day.
A lot of thought has obviously gone into the creation of this gem of a hotel and it is clear that the owners have a flair and a passion for excellence that percolates through the whole establishment.  In our view, Hotel 41 thoroughly deserves its position as number 1 on Trip Advisor out of over 1000 London hotels, although to be fair, we have not stayed in all the others.  Hotel 41 is not cheap for the average purse, but it is good value and well worth the expense for a special occasion.    Mike Thompson   Farnham, Surrey",5,2014,01,24
137,As good as it gets,"First stay for my wife and I, last Saturday to celebrate her birthday, we try and stay at a good hotel for our birthdays every year, this is the second Red Carnation Hotel that we have stayed at. 
From the moment we stepped through the door the staff were welcoming and attentive, a choice of champagne and some savoury snacks with check-in. Our room was lovely, we had an Executive King, enormous comfortable bed, complimentary birthday cake and fruit. The room was well equipped with most things that you might need for a short stay and beautifully finished. The room had marble fireplace and a wrought iron gas fire which was more for effect than heat, but quite a nice feature..
It may not have been the biggest or best room that we have stayed in London, but where this hotel absolutely excels is the attention to detail and the personal touch that the staff deliver, nothing seemed too much trouble. When we returned to our room in the evening, collecting a couple of Haagen-dazs strawberry cheesecake ice cream pots on the way, our room had been furnished with chocolate dipped strawberries, rose petals on the bed and bath and half a dozen candles lit, definitely for the girls!
For me its easy to see why this hotel rates so highly in a very competitive market, the staff and management team are an absolute credit and demonstrate faultless hospitality.
41 will joint a fairly short list for me headed 'must return', many thanks for a great stay!",5,2014,01,20
137,Another perfect Christmas at 41!,"This is our 3rd stay at 41, our second time at Christmas and yet again it was faultless.  It really is like coming to stay with good friends as everyone makes you feel so at home. From remembering the music you like, or don't like, to the lovely surprise when we came back to our room from Christmas night drinks just a little too early!!! All the team were great as usual, but particular thanks go to Lauren, Florent and Stefan for making us feel so special.  We felt totally relaxed and pampered for the whole stay and can't wait to come back again.",5,2014,01,19
137,Absolutely marvellous hotel,"I have now stayed here twice, once on business and once with my wife as a treat for her birthday. I would now easily rate it as my favourite London hotel.

You enter on the ground floor, and are then taken up to the 5th floor, where the hotel itself is situated. You are offered a glass of champagne as you book in in a beautiful lounge, lined with old books. The rooms themselves are extremely well-appointed and comfortable, and I also specifically want to mention the staff who are a model of courtesy and helpfulness. The wireless internet is free.

We were fortunate enough to be upgraded to a junior suite for my most recent stay, and the room was stunning, with an upstairs and downstairs! 

I received an e mail before my stay, inviting me to state preferences such as foam or feather pillows etc, which were then followed perfectly.

There are some very unusual, and enjoyable touches-it has an external 'living wall',  a bar where you can serve yourself, free ice cream etc etc. 

The hotel is a short walk from Victoria Station, and very close to Buckingham Palace, and the Theatres where Wicked and Billy Elliott are currently on-no more than a 5 minute walk from either.

This is not a ""cheap"" hotel, and it is small, so you don't get a swimming pool etc, BUT it is a real treat. I don't think unique is too strong a word. It is very unlikely in my view that you would have anything other than a really enjoyable stay here.",5,2014,01,19
137,Great Stay!,"My husband and I stopped over in London for one night before boarding a cruise ship to The United States.  Hotel 41 is a great place to stay!

The hotel is quiet, quaint and the staff is there to help with anything 24/7.  From the second we walked in the door, to the moment we caught our cab to the train station, everything was perfect.

When we arrived to our room initially, they had a beautiful spread of fruit, chocolates and roses laid out for me as a gift for our wedding.  I was very impressed.  The room was a nice size, super clean.

Would definitely recommend for a boutique, personalized experience!  (Walking Distance to Buckingham Palace, too!)",5,2014,01,16
137,The Perfect Place To Stay,"My daughter and I plus 2 dogs had a 3 night break at Hotel 41. My expectations were high, from website and reputation and we certainly were not disappointed. In fact everything we experienced surpassed expectation. All the staff were attentive, polite and friendly. The bedroom was compact yet perfect, beds were wonderfully comfortable, as, I imagine the dog beds were. We loved sitting in front of the fire with friends (and dogs) in the evening. The pantry nibbles were irresistible. 
Overall it was an excellent hotel, would recommend it without hesitation and shall return as soon as I have an excuse to do so.
Thank you Hotel 41",5,2014,01,14
137,Other worldly,"My daughter and I throughly enjoyed our week at Hotel 41.  It truly felt more like a home than a hotel, location close to Victoria station was great and the staff was exceptional!  The room was lovely and spotless, the food and beverage department top notch and the executive lounge so inviting and peaceful. Thank you so much Monica for the unexpected but truly appreciated treat!  It was like a palace!  Thank you everyone for making our trip magical. Only complaint...we had to leave!",5,2014,01,14
137,Amazing team of staff,A really well located hotel. It has rather compact dimensions for those used to larger hotels. But the sheer size of the effort and care from the team was world class. We were so well taken care of we had a great New Year. A boutique cutie.,5,2014,01,12
137,Exceptional hotel,"The staff does everything right in this quaint boutique hotel near Buckingham Palace.  A great place to make your home while in London.   Fabulous.  I wouldn't stay anywhere else. 

Before arriving, they send you a request list.  The little things are what really impressed me.  A bottle of bubbly waits for you.   Breakfast was fabulous.  They have a great ""honor"" bar if you want to make yourselves a drink. The complete opposite of a big chain hotel experience.  

While it is not cheap, it represents great value.  I felt like I was staying in a nice London home.  The executive lounge is cosy and free wifi worked great.  
",5,2014,01,10
137,Great for the family!,"We loved this hotel for our two kids ages 6 and 9. They had gluten free toast in the morning in addition to their gorgeous breakfast - and their snacks late night were delicious. 
The staff was amazing with our kids and lovely without being overly on top of you (like at the Park Hyatt on Paris). It was by far the most interesting experience we have had - and have now decided to find other boutique hotels after this wonderful visit. ",5,2014,01,08
137,(Cliche Alert) A Hidden Gem!,"This was a surprise birthday trip planned by my wife in mid December. I knew we were staying in London at a hotel, but that was as much info as she was prepared to divulge. Clearly it was going to be somewhere very special.. and indeed it was! Coming off a wet and windy street through a tiny door into total opulence; and having a glass of champagne almost immediately thrust into my hand just took my breath away as I processed the surroundings. The fire! The chandeliers! The comfy chairs! The ice cream on tap! This was my kind of place and my wife clearly knew it. We were shown to the Balmoral suite which was approximating the size of our ground floor with its 4 TVs, sofas, tables, huge bed; I could go on with the superlatives but it would be overkill if I did.

Suffice to say the Hotel 41 is the BEST hotel we have ever stayed in (and we've stayed in some good places!) Fantastic room, huge bed, gorgeous black and white decor in our room, enormous breakfast and a truly amazing team: Cara, Remus et al must be without equal in the hotel industry. They were astonishingly professional, competent, friendly and helpful (we even got a glass of champagne as an apology over a minor problem with the DVD player) and showed us genuine warmth, in particular to our little 20 month old daughter who even got to keep her little bathrobe at the end of our stay. 

And I can't finish this review without mentioning the never ending amount of snacks such as scones with jam and cream, crisps, canapes, cakes and of course ice cream that were laid out at literally all hours of the day and night for us.

I'm sure it's a pricey place (I've been forbidden from looking at the prices!) but it is truly worth it to turn your special day into a truly special experience. Thank you guys again, it was a pleasure!",5,2014,01,08
137,A wonderful stay.....again!,"This was our second stay at hotel 41 and yet again we had an amazing time. We were welcomed back like old friends and made to feel very special.  We were given a different room this time and it was beautiful, we asked for a quiet room with lovely views and that's exactly what we got. Nothing is ever too much trouble for them and your every need is catered for. All of the little touches are what makes this place extra special, such as the champagne on arrival, the 'plunder the pantry', the lovely dressing gowns and the luxurious Penalagans  products....... I could go on but you really do just need to go along and experience it all for yourself, you will not be disappointed.",5,2014,01,07
137,Really the best.,"One of my favorites! Very comfortable and homey. Nice to sit in front of the fire and sip hot chocolate. Rooms are cozy, black and white prevail. Service excellent, small boutique hotel so they always remember your name and what you want before you do. Great breakfast and snacks in the clubroom. Excellent central location, not far from Piccadilly. Been there several times and will definitely be back!",5,2014,01,07
137,Amazing!!,I love this hotel. We came here for my husbands 30th birthday and everything about our stay here was perfect! The level of customer service provided by all the staff was so far above anything I have experienced at any other hotel. I can't wait for our next trip to the UK to stay at this hotel again!,5,2014,01,06
137,41 Hotel is 5*,"Fantastic stay, from the pillow menu to plunder the pantry. Stayed for a romantic weekend and therd could not have been a better place for it. All perfect. Clean, luxurious, helpful and exclusive. A truly wonderful getaway.",5,2014,01,05
137,incredible!,This hotel was hands down the best place we have ever stayed. The service was of the highest quality with no details forgotten. The small things made this place and I can only praise our stay here. We will definitely be returning! You will not be dissapointed in any sense!,5,2014,01,03
137,Justified #1; sets the standard for boutique hotel luxury,"To celebrate a special occasion, I wanted to select somewhere around Christmas time that would provide a special experience. After much researching and looking at names synonymous with London Luxury from The Ritz to Claridges etc., I settled on Hotel 41. 
The communication from the outstanding manager, Mr Hendry, was excellent from the beginning of the booking process. It set a standard and tone of service that was evident in all staff that we had the pleasure of coming in to contact with. From the warm greeting after arriving early in the morning after a long haul flight, to the attention to detail in our room, I could not fault this establishment.

The guest lounge/dining area is an exceptional room, with old world decor that has a sophisticated and contemporary interpretation. A selection of snacks are on offer for guests and it would seem that no request was ever too big for the staff. The room had a level of character and individual style that is often missed in the larger scale hotels. The bed was heavenly and the amenities in the bathroom were Penhaligons. 

It was a fantastic start to our European tour and can now vouch for why this hotel is at the top of the table for the over 1,000 other options in this incredible city. Thanks to all the team that made this stay so special.",5,2013,12,31
137,Wonderful hotel with excellent service and amazing staff,"Stayed at Hotel 21 for a family break between Christmas and New Year.  This was our first stay, but will definitely not be our last.  Cannot wait to return.  The warm and welcoming staff are incredible.  The atmosphere is calm and tranquil and envelops you as soon as you enter the wonderful lounge. The standard of service is second to none.",5,2013,12,30
137,A wonderful welcome home,"Having spent a wonderful pre Christmas 2012 at Hotel 41 we were delighted to return for the whole of Christmas 2013, enjoying a 3 night stay. And what a wonderful Welcome Home we were given. Hotel 41 is a truly magical place to stay and from beginning to end there is only perfection. We were given the same room as previously and this made us feel even more at home. There are  so many super reviews of Hotel 41 and they are all so true.  There are no superlatives that can really describe a stay at Hotel 41.  It's just something you have to experience for yourself.  And once you have?  Well then you will see just what its all about.  Its all about never wanting to stay anywhere else in London and its about the constant search for somewhere in the World that could possibly meet your expectations.  Hotel 41 spoils you. Just sit back and enjoy.",5,2013,12,30
137,Home away from home in London,Fantastic staff cosy lounge area with sideboard loaded with various snacks all day stylish room with instant hot water. Our new place to stay in london 20 min walk to theatres and Trafalgar Square Hyde park 10 min away,5,2013,12,30
137,Perfect Christmas in London,"My fiancé and I stayed at Hotel 41 over Christmas (2013) on a five day vacation to London from the States.  It was perfect.  Our enjoyment of London on our trip was due largely to the comfort and excellent service of Hotel 41.  The hotel itself looks and feels like an exclusive private club.  Like you would expect at a private club the staff is first class and is on hand 24 hours a day to help with anything you want.  The hotel, other than the ground floor entrance, is on a single floor with about 20 rooms and a large, extremely comfortable ""clubroom.""  The clubroom has both food and bar service, an inviting fireplace, walls of bookshelves, and in general feels like (and is) the place you want start and end your day. We enjoyed breakfast, pre-dinner drinks, and late night snacks here every day.  I would the rate the food and cocktails in the clubroom very high in quality (excellent gin-martinis).  Further, the clubroom was very cozy and was always full of friendly, smiling staff  immediately looking after us (they have complimentary  Hagen-Das ice-cream available there 24 hours).  Our personal room was also a delight and was both extremely comfortable and modern (great bed and bathroom.)  The hotel’s location was also excellent for us because it is located centrally and within walking distance of a lot of the sites (Buckingham Palace is across the street).  Finally, I must say that we were pleasantly surprised to find a Christmas stocking on our door on Christmas morning full of chocolates, fruit, and nuts.  Though I am 35 it was pretty awesome.  I would highly recommend this hotel for any couple visiting London and wanting a swank, romantic, top-shelf place to stay.  Thanks for the great Christmas Hotel 41 we had a blast.",5,2013,12,29
137,Best of London,"We are suprised,we see very good review on the Internet but we dont expect much.When we came into the hotel we are suprised to see old London decor in modern style.The staff is beautiful.Every moment in the hotel we fell like first class.Breakfast in the lounge was fantastic.All in all this the best hotel in London in my opinion.",5,2013,12,27
137,Great Gem In A Busy City,We decided to try a new neighborhood in London from previous visits and chose to stay at this boutique hotel.  What a treat.  We arrived tired and the staff greeted it us with such warmth and concern. We were offered a complimentary room to rest in before our room was ready.  We enjoyed a great breakfast in their warm living room with a great glass of champagne. Our room had a very comfortable bed with warm decor.  It is a very inviting little hotel and I know my sister and me would love to stay there again.,5,2013,12,24
137,Perfection once again,A pre-Xmas visit to London has become an annual pilgramage for us and No 41 is a key part of the experience.  From the first moment you step across the threshold to the moment you leave the staff treat you care and respect and look after your every need.  The welcome champagne which is free flowing coupled wth the lovely food bar is a wonderful touch.  The rooms are comfortable and perfectly maintained and very quiet (we had a great nights sleep).  What makes 41 stand out though is the extra care they take in listening to you and making sure you get what you want (for me it was a bag of Twiglets).  We love it and will always return.  Merry Xmas.,5,2013,12,21
137,Like a comfortable pair of slippers,Everything about Hotel 41 was carefully and thoughtfully planned to provide a luxury yet unobtrusive experience. From champagne at check in through to little personal touches in the room. The location of the hotel is excellent and the room was quiet ensuring a good nights sleep. The lounge served a great breakfast too! All in all a great hotel ,5,2013,12,20
137,To be taken care of is worth trying once in a while.,"41 is a small hotel. And small is beautiful a wise man said. He didn't think of 41, but who knows?
This place is more a poem, or a work of art, than a hotel. It is not a base camp, it is the peak.
You just don't want to leave the bed, the breakfast in bed, the fireplace, the mahogany shrine were afternoon tea or glowing wine is served under the glass roof. Very intimate, but not in an embarrassing manner.The staff is young and tenderly responding to all your needs without showing off. The waiters are descrete in a manner that challenges your pride. 
Tranquille, but precise and to the point. British? I think so. Even the lampets have their own rythm.
God must have smiled when he created 41 through the imagination of Bea Tollman.
When I left I knew that this hotel will be more a milestone than a memory.",5,2013,12,18
137,Great place to stay,This place is really pricey but this is where i stay if im in london for businees or pleasure. I have been to many other estabs over the years but they give you the best. If youre a regular they give extra special srvice.,4,2013,12,18
137,Perfect weekend stay,"I've stayed at Hotel 41 previously and am more than pleased to say that it just doesn't change, you get friendly, attentive service with excellent efficiency, politeness and everything to the high standard you expect, having stayed in most of the top London hotels in the past since discovering 41 I will not stay anywhere else.",5,2013,12,16
137,"Wonderful,wonderful,wonderful!!!","My lovely husband booked a surprise birthday treat for me and we combined a stay at Hotel 41 with a visit to the theatre.  From literally the moment the taxi stopped outside Hotel 41 we were met by warm, attentive staff and nothing was too much trouble. The service was the best we had received anywhere.

Our room was a much needed peaceful haven, every detail was considered.  The quality of linens, towels and fittings are exceptional.  The phone has a button ""anything,anytime"" and that really does sum up the room service.

Upon arrival you are greeted with champagne, what a treat  - very good champagne!!  The food is superb and plundering the pantry after walking back from the theatre was most welcome.  The cheeses, hams, bread and fruit were just amazing, no leftovers here all quality, beautiful food.

Thank you Hotel 41, a birthday I shall remember for a long time.",5,2013,12,15
137,Special Hotel for a Special Occasion,"Excellent service from very professional and caring members of staff in a superb well located boutique hotel with outstanding food, drink and facilities. Traveling to London to receive an award from the Queen was special enough but such an occasion was further enhanced through the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41.",5,2013,12,14

137,Family trip to London,"My wife and I had enjoyed our stay at this hidden gem in 2010, and on this trip we brought our 3 children, ages 8, 11 and 16, for a 6 day vacation, their first transatlantic journey.  The junior suites were perfectly sized, and the kids made full use of the ""pantry"" every night.  The central location was an excellent base for adventures within and without the city limits.  If we ever return to London, we will want to stay at ""41"".",5,2013,12,12
137,Excellence in every respect!,"5 star boutique hotel. Extremely friendly staff. Incredibly nice people! They seem to know your name before you introduce yourself to the concierge. Nice and comfortable rooms, cozy living room for breakfast, snacks and drinks. You feel at home.",5,2013,12,11
137,I need to come back!,"This is most definitely my favourite hotel in London. The staff could not do enough for you, the rooms were a great size and the lounge made the hotel have that special touch. 

The hotel itself is a joy to just roam around and enjoy the hotel setting, particularly a glass of champagne in front of the fire. 

The prices for the rooms seem extremely reasonable in comparison to other 5* hotels on offer in the area we have stayed at.

The only downside was our shower did leak slightly, however we did not complain as it was not that much of a concern at the time! Definitely not enough to make us have a negative thought of this exceptional hotel.

I look forward to my return.",5,2013,12,04
137,the best hotel in london,"For us was an incredible experience!! the hotel is so british and we love that!! the suite perfect to celebrate our wedding aniversary.

137,Birthday treat,"Staff are all exceptionally helpful friendly and professional in looking after their guests.
 Facilities are excellent as you would expect. 
Nice little touches - a special little birthday cake was left in room without asking or prompting,  and helped mske the day extra nice for my wife.",5,2013,12,02
137,Top notch everytime,"Had another excellent stay here this time to celebrate Mummy and Daddy's anniversary, service is nothing short of servitude (in a nice way of course). Breakfast and afternoon tea to die for. Perhaps we should move in.",5,2013,11,30
137,Royal treatment!!!,"I dont think you can stay @ a hotel any closer to the palace & get the same treatment as if you were staying AT the palace!!!! From the moment you are greeted @ the front door to leaving after your stay- its 1st class all the way. We are fortunate enough to have had this last quick stay be our 4th time to the 41 & we honestly cant think of another place in London that we would want to try out- well other than the palace- if we were invited...... The top notch, professional staff @ Hotel 41 really make the difference & genuinely go out of their way to make you feel as comfortable as royalty. This time we stayed in one of their 2 story suites & it was beautiful. The living area on the entrance level was compact but served its purpose- there was also a fireplace the living room with remote- but I couldnt figure out how to turn it on- not that we needed it on.... Seating was ample & comfortable. Up stairs was the bedroom, a work desk, great spacious bureau & the fabulous bathroom. Such a comfortable bed & luxury linens. Spacious bathroom with stand up shower as well as a separate tub, super soft towels on a heated rack as always. Full english breakfast in the lounge was fantastic as always & just being in that lounge- so much to keep your eyes busy looking @ their classy collection of coffee table books & other collectables. What more can I say about this fabulous hotel that I havent already said in my previous review. We will return, we will recommend this hotel & we will stay @ other properties they manage. Special thank you's to the staff whom we consider friends for sure.",5,2013,11,29
137,The best in London,"My favorite place to stay in London.  Worth traveling to the UK just to stay here. The afternoon teas are lovely and breakfast is great.  Very close to Victoria Station.  Great central location..................."".........",5,2013,11,27
137,Distinctly upper class,"There are so many things that make Hotel 41 special but one of them is the friendliness of the staff; they know who you are and address you by your name. All the personnel are genuinely interested in your plans and ask about how the day went when you return to the hotel later in the day. 

 When we booked in we were welcomed in the reception lounge with the customary glass of champagne – how civilised – and, being in no particular rush, finished it sitting on leather sofas by the fire where, unbidden, refills and canapés appeared. We were then escorted to our room. It was beautifully equipped and contained every extra you could possibly wish for. The toiletries are Penhaligons, the bathrobes are pure bliss (I searched online but unfortunately they are only available in USA), the complimentary bowl of fruit was overflowing and, pleasingly, was topped up daily. A very nice touch was a welcome (back) card from the manager and, to our delight, a lovely cake with the message ‘Welcome back to Hotel 41’ piped in chocolate on the plate.  It’s the small touches that can turn a good hotel into a great one.  

One indicator of a hotel’s class is the way it deals with problems. Our TV did not work so, at about 9 pm on Friday evening,  I used the ‘whatever/whenever’ button on the phone, admittedly somewhat reluctantly because I feared the problem was not with the TV but my Luddite-like incompetence with modern technology. But it was the TV because the staff could not get it to work either and immediately offered to summon a TV engineer to resolve the problem. Such urgency was not needed but by mid morning the next day the TV had been replaced and was operational. The manager was so remorseful about this very minor inconvenience and, without prompting, offered a complimentary meal in the hotel that night. This was very generous.

We shall undoubtedly return to Hotel 41, drawn back by the comfort of the mattresses and the pillows, the generous supplies of complimentar y food on which you can graze throughout the day, the aura of calm in the reception lounge, and the private club ambience of the place. Being a small hotel you are treated as an individual and made to feel special. This is an essential ingredient of a relaxing weekend break, dearly needed as my wife was recuperating from two significant brain operations in the summer. We were reluctant to leave – always a good sign – but the farewell was complicated by a computer system failure which meant our bill could not be printed. They offered to forward the bill and I could pay later but I paid it upfront based on paper records. The next day the invoice was e mailed to me and I noticed I had paid for the meal which was meant to be complimentary (the computer glitch overrode a code they had been used to mark it as free) and naturally the cost of the meal was immediately refunded when I queried it as well as all other charges for room service which had been legitimately incurred. As I say, how a hotel deals with problems is a mark of its class. Hotel 41 is distinctly upper class.",5,2013,11,27
137,The best hotel in London,"Hotel 41 is not as grand in appearance as some of the other hotels in London, however, the service is the best I have ever experienced. The executive lounge is a fantastic place to relax and the staff are excellent and can not do enough for you.",5,2013,11,27
137,Excellent,"Hotel 41 was beautiful! Me and My boyfriend went for our anniversary. The champagne reception was fantastic. The people were wonderful. I can't wait to come back! I first had the chance to enjoy it when it was aq brand new additio to London Boutique Hotels scene, some twelve years ago. Since then we had been lucky enough to return in numerous occassions, but it had been a while when we went back this week.",5,2013,11,24
137,Service - the best we've ever received,"We have stayed at wonderful hotels around the world but the service offered by the staff at 41 was  truly the best we have ever experienced anywhere. From the moment we made our online reservation until the moment we left, the staff left no stone unturned. Our check-in was enlivened by offers of ""Veuve Cliquot"" champagne (which we gladly accepted). There was always a complimentary snack, hors d'oeuvre, or a late-night treat available on the buffet table in the lounge. They arranged for excellent seats at the West End play, Wicked, followed by a ""Wicked"" turn-down service in our suite which had to be seen to be believed! The location of 41 (essentially next to the Queen's rear garden) made exploring the city very easy. We would think of staying no where else in London.",5,2013,11,22
137,Still running strong !,"I first had the chance to enjoy ""41""  when it was aq brand new additio to London Boutique Hotels scene, some 12 ( yes, 12) years ago. Since then we had been lucky enough to return in numerous occassions, but it had been a while when we went back this week. Fortunately nothing has changed the ""executive lounge"" still has no comparision within the city or beyond, the rooms ( large for London Standards) are as charming as always, and the staff ( Love the ""whenever whatever"" phone key) keeps mastering on what luxury service should be. We will back soon!",5,2013,11,20
137,AMAZING!,"Hotel 41 was beautiful! Me and My boyfriend went for his birthday. Firstly the champagne reception was fantastic. Then we got a very detailed check in. We had been downgraded but they made up for it with a free bottle of champagne and free breakfast. We then got t our room and were astonished about how beautiful it was. Everything in black and white & very cosy. The bed was extremely soft and the best bed I have ever slept in! My boyfriend helped himself to the mini bar for a fee, quite expensive but well worth it! Also he made full use of the snack bar and honesty bar, which he loved! The best part was they had free haagen daas! The products in the room were divine which I made full use of having a bit of a pamper before dinner. We went out for dinner but It was very disappointing but when we came back we let ourselves into the room noticing that someone had come in a lit candles up all around the room and put rose petals around the room and bathroom. Also on the bed there was a bag each one with him and one with her on; with slippers in. We had the best nights sleep, Then check out was at 12 which was lovely and we had a bit of a lay in then went for breakfast which was delicious we even got our tea poured for us! We were disappointed to leave and had hotel 41 blues for well over a week! We will definitely be booking to be coming back! We wont leave it too long we enjoyed living the high life! Its expensive but well worth it! Thank you so much for an amazing stay and to all of your staff for being so attentive. Hannah & Austen.",5,2013,11,17
137,Simply the best,"My fiancé and I stayed here the night we got engaged Oct13, and what can I say other than it was worth every penny. 

We were upgraded free of charge to the conservatory suite which is phenomenal, I had requested a romantic turndown which was fabulous. 

And the customer service was some of the best I've experienced in any walk of life. 

My only niggle is something that the hotel obviously cannot help and that's the ongoing construction work which begin very early and was a tad loud.

Other than that exceptional.",5,2013,11,14
137,Fantastic place!,"Hotel 41 is such a great place to stay. The always present and super friendly staff in this cozy place with its amazing interior will make you love your hotel stay in London.
Food was nice and the concept of an honesty bar adds the extra trust flavour to you feeling at home. 
On the scale, from 0-10, this was a clear 10 for me. I have already recommended Hotel 41 to many friends and colleagues.
Will be back :-)",5,2013,11,14
137,Excellent stay,"I went on a business trip to London a while back and I stayed at Hotel 41 because a friend recommended it to me, and I must say it was an excellent choice. The rooms are extremely clean, spacious and luxurious, and the bed was amazingly comfortable. The location is also great, being very near to places like Hyde Park or the Buckingham Palace, and the overall facilities here are definitely accommodating to any need you may have. I will surely stay here again the next time I`m in London, and I highly recommend it to everyone.",5,2013,11,12
137,Outstanding service,"We travelled to London as a couple in October for the celebration of a 50th birthday. Was fortunate to have 2 nights at the this hotel. Because this is a smaller boutique hotel, it allows it's staff to lavish attention on to the patrons. From the complementary champagne upon check in, to the ""Whatever/Whenever"" function on the phone (which we took advantage of),  the staff at the Hotel 41 were some of the most gracious and attentive we have experienced. The room was excellent, with beautiful decor, and little details such as the bedside ""Do Not Disturb"" switch were nice. By booking through the hotel web site, we were able to take advantage of additional perks such as Champagne in the room on our arrival. The added surprise of birthday cake was a welcome treat. We had a wonderful time, and would definitely stay there again! many thanks again.",5,2013,11,11
137,Excellent--that's all there is to say,"Well, the title says it all.  

I was in London for a work trip combined with a wedding.  I was staying at the ""luxury"" Draycott.  It was not a good experience.  So I moved to Hotel 41 and I'm glad I did.  

The staff were exceptional in their friendliness and standards.  The room was spotless and very well taken care off.",5,2013,11,09
137,If you know what you want...,"This is the perfect spot. If you want the Bellagio, with grand public spaces, huge rooms, 6 restaurants-- you'll end up being one of the 1-2 star reviews. If you want delightful service, incredibly relaxing, quiet atmosphere, great tourist location, easy breakfast and great noshing in the evening-- this is the spot. I put 4 stars here just because I can see how someone looking for a glamorous 5 star show would be disappointed. But if you're looking for small ( and it helps to be small-- beds/chairs are all compact) quiet elegance that feels like a hideaway from the real world-- this will work very nicely. Smashing!",4,2013,11,06
137,wow. amazing! its like home only better!,"this is a tucked away small (28 room) luxury hotel located near buckingham palace. for me it was convenient to anywhere.

i flew overnight to london and got to the hotel at 8 am. my room was ready! they knew my name (and i hadn't stayed there before) they brought me fresh piping hot coffee, and then took me to where i could get (free) continental breakfast!

my room was a bit small...okay for me, but for two people it probably would've been too tight. great linens, great amenities, nice tv, decent view.

the beauty of this hotel is how well one is treated. at the end of the day i went to the executive lounge, which is the heart of the hotel. they made me drinks, brought me canapé, helped me get dinner reservations, and were so friendly i felt like i knew them for a long time.

upon departure, i said goodbye top new friends.

if the reader likes big person-less, machine type hotels, this will not be your thing. for me, as a constant traveller, getting a feel of home while I'm away is a big deal.

bravo to all of the first rate employees who really went out of their way to make me feel special!",5,2013,11,06
137,Great Hotel!!!,"Great hotel, great location, great service. There is a reason they are number 3 on the list, even though they should be higher. My wife and I only stayed for 4 days, but by the end of the stay they knew us by name and how we liked our tea. We had friends staying at the Waldorf Astoria, and they wanted to change to Hotel 41.",5,2013,11,04
137,Five star luxury with a personal touch,"Hotel 41 is small hotel with only 30-some rooms and beside a board room (meeting room) and an executive lounge arrive this is all the facilities there are but they are used to the max. 
Rooms are all equipment with all that could be expected of 5 star hotel - Furniture, fabrics and toiletries are all of highest quality. The bed is good.... all is good 
What brings 41 to be one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had is the concept of the hotel and the personal attention of a very limited but always present staff 
The center and core of the concept is the fantastic lounge where you mingle with staff and the limited number for other guests - The lounge offers various treats and snacks during the day. You can make yourself a drink and you can order food etc all while your are met with very friend and competent staff that knows your name and room number and are attentive and professional 
Yes, the rooms are classically UK small and at this particular time there was some noisy construction work but it is all made up for by the concept and service of the staff 
And did I mention that it is next door neighbour to Buckingham and in walking distance of almost anything you will need in London 
Treat yourself to this experience !",5,2013,10,24
137,We loved it!,"My family recently stayed at ""41"" for several nights. It was fantastic. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. We especially enjoyed having tea in the lounge by the fire. It was a great location - close to the tube and centrally located. Beautiful furnishings and very comfortable. But it was the staff that really made our experience at 41 so great. They did a great job!",5,2013,10,24
137,What a friendly place!,"My wife and I stayed at the 41 foe 3 days in early October. Super friendly staff.  They are always there to help.  Enjoy the delicious snacks they put out throughout the day.  Great location...stones throw to Buckingham palace. Five minute walk to the tube.  
This is a great hotel which added toast fantastic stay in London.",5,2013,10,22
137,London,"Amazing luxury boutique hotel!!! The service was great and the traditional decor was so comfortable.  It felt like I was in someones traditional mansion rather than a hotel.  The consierge made all my reservations and printed maps.  The would hail my taxi and exchange my money.  Great intimate ambiance.

137,My favorite hotel in the world.,"My husband and I visited this fine hotel in spring 2011. We brought our 18 month old daughter along. My husband arranged for a car to pick us up at Heathrow and bring us to the hotel. It was a very smooth process and we felt comfortably immediately under the care of PJ. The service and staff are second to none. Everyone knew our daughters name and gave her special attention. We didn't have room to bring our stroller on an international flight, so they loaned us a pink umbrella stroller. The location is just around the corner from Buckingham Palace and within easy walking distance from the train station and the theaters. We enjoyed our stay so much. I want to go back every year.

137,"Incredible hotel, impeccable service","Just spent a week with a friend at Hotel 41.  I can't say enough about the staff.  Not only were they formally attired and well groomed, they were friendly, helpful and available for your every need. They also remembered what your plans were for the day and then followed up by asking how the show, tour, etc. was.  We were two women traveling alone and, above all, I felt safe there.  The front door of the hotel is locked and manned.  The elevator goes only up to the 5th floor where all of the rooms are located.  The hotel is spotless.  We had an executive room which was a small bedroom area and a separate sitting area.  The room contained all of the necessities one could imagine.  The bed was very comfortable and there is a pillow menu.  Our room faced inward and was extremely quiet.  The bathroom contained a shower and a bath/shower combo.  There is only one public area in the hotel, which only has 30 rooms, and that is the lounge.  The lounge is beautiful and peaceful.  Breakfast, afternoon tea and snacks are all available in the lounge.  Plunder the pantry was extremely helpful as one night I was too tired to go out for dinner and had cheeses and pate in the lounge.  Be careful as tea outside of breakfast is 5 pounds.  The BBar next door, which is part of the hotel, has fantastic South African food.  Can't say enough about the experience and I would highly recommend it.",5,2013,10,19
137,Couldn't Have Been Better,"My husband and I just spent a week at Hotel 41 after a wonderful shorter stay last Fall. We travel a great deal, including many trips to London, and this is, without question, our favorite hotel. Our room was wonderful - comfortable, spotlessly clean, and with every amenity, but the service is what sets Hotel 41 apart.  Everyone we encountered made us feel as if nothing would  be too much trouble and the entire staff was friendly without being intrusive. We unexpectedly met up with some friends from home while in London, on a stormy afternoon.  We .brought them back to Hotel 41 with us (without notice to the Hotel) so we could chat in the Executive Lounge, which is a beautiful room with a fireplace, comfortable seating areas, and  a small bar area (including complimentary ice cream) for hotel guests.  In the minute or two between walking in the door and arriving at the Lounge, a table for 4 had been set up and pots of tea arrived soon after. Thereafter, we were given some wonderful appetizers, followed by delicious sweets, without even having to request them.  I had also asked Victoria, one of the staff, if she could make us a dinner reservation for that evening.  Not only did she make the reservation, she printed out and gave me the details of the reservation, directions and a map showing how best to walk to the restaurant. By itself, not a big thing, but such small details were the rule, not the exception.  We had a fabulous breakfast every day and we ate light meals in the Lounge two evenings, also excellent.  One rainy Sunday during our stay, we spent the entire day in the hotel, other than going to lunch at The Phoenix, a terrific pub recommended by the Hotel, and it was one of the most relaxing days of our vacation.

 If you are looking for a ""corporate"" hotel, with gym, spa, etc., Hotel 41 is not for you. If you want charming but luxurious surroundings and perfect service, you won't do better than Hotel 41.",5,2013,10,17
137,Perfect Hotel,"This is a perfect small boutique hotel in the thick of things in London. From our first conversation with Shameela to when I received the microphone in the mail in the United States from Hotel 41 which I accidentally left behind, nothing was too much for the staff of this hotel to make your stay with them as pleasurable as possible. The breakfast, the cappuccinos, the snacks, simply everything, was prepared properly and was delicious. I like the fact that they would bring some olives and snacks to your room about 4 PM to assist you in making a cocktail. If you ask for something at this hotel, they will find a way to get it for you. We stayed on the consierge floor which I highly recommend. This is a hotel that will certainly impress your significant other. Sure, it costs more than the run-of-the-mill hotel but, but you get so, so much more in return. It is a short walk from this hotel to the Victoria Metro stop, and from there you can reach most any destination you may choose to visit. You can't go wrong by staying at Hotel 41.",5,2013,10,15
137,Magnificent Atmosphere & Service,"This is a small hotel that occupies the 5th floor of an older building just a block away from 
Buckingham Palace.  From the minute you check in, you realize that you are in for a superlative customer service experience. The staff - meticulously dressed in formal wear - attends to your every request.  Although the rooms have been very nicely remodeled and have terrific atmosphere, they are a bit unique and not appropriate for the traveler that wants a big cookie cutter room, but they are charming and really fun.  Ours was a suite on two floors, with a small sitting room in the ground floor with a fireplace, and a nice sized bedroom on the top floor.  The bathroom was large, complete with a tub that had it's own television.  The best part of the place is the guest lounge where they serve breakfast in the morning, and tea and cocktails the rest of the day.  It is a beautiful room with a fireplace, and big comfy chairs.  The staff was always eager to help and very professional.  The only downside....there is construction going on across the street (looks like it will be going on for months) - so there is some construction noise.  But otherwise it is a perfect little place.",5,2013,10,15
137,Week in London,"I stayed at the hotel 41 for a week and from the minute we arrived to getting in the taxi to leave we were treated impeccably the staff were fantastic the room was excellent there was nothing I could fault and would recommend the hotel to everyone, I will definatly be staying here again the next time I'm in London",5,2013,10,13
137,Nothing is too much trouble,"The service was impeccable,  the staff were delightful, the food wonderful.  I have never been to a hotel where you are actually made to feel so welcome and I've been to many many hotels around the world.

The hotel is conveniently located a block from Victoria Station and the only thing nicer than the surroundings is the staff.  We were checked in by Monika and treated like family.  She along with the rest of the staff are great representatives of the property and made us (excuse the pun) ""feel like royalty"".  I am looking forward to a return trip to London and I would not consider any other hotel.",5,2013,10,11
137,Splendid!,"After traveling & experiencing many outstanding hotels during our 15+ years of world travel we pretty much have seen it all when it comes to 5 Star service however this hotel manages to squeeze out even more in the department of personalized service.  The Concierge team has a knack of anticipating your next move and is always at your service 24/7, ready to spring into action whether it be for a restaurant reservation, Buckingham Palace Tours or general directions.  No request appears to be a challenge for this group of go-getters.  

Housekeeping gets 5 gold stars in my book.  Our room was made up each day as expected but the entire room received a thorough sprucing up each day.  These are the little things that we took notice of.  The rooms are chock full of comfy-ness.  Bottled water at each nightstand, slippers, ample bathroom toiletries which included an entire assortment of any toiletry you may have left behind along with big, fluffy hot towels & comfy robes.  Laundry/dry cleaning, shoe shining, help with packing ... the list of services offered goes on and on.  Each evening we found fresh ice and a lovely plate of olives, lime & wedges for drinks. 

The Executive Lounge is superb and a wonderful little oasis to return to after a long day of sightseeing to enjoy a cocktail and wonderful canapés.  Everyone at Hotel 41 prides themselves on providing impeccable service with a genuine attitude.

Breakfast in the Executive Lounge was a great start to a long day of walking & sightseeing.  Coffee each morning was served with style & class in lovey silver decanters.  The breakfast menu has something for everyone or one could choose from the lovely selection of bagels, pastries, croissants and cold cereals and yogurts.    

Location of Hotel 41 is a short walk to Victoria Station, which we found so convenient in that we used the Tube almost every day to get around the city.  It was also a nice walk to the river area, Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace is right around the corner.

We loved our week's stay at Hotel 41 and would not hesitate to return.

Thank you Monika for pulling out of your hat a last minute request for Buckingham Palace State Room Tour Tickets & restaurant reservations; Thank you Shameelah for arranging London Eye tickets and always asking about our day; Thank you Guy for wonderful Gin & Tonics and turning us on to Bloom Gin which I was able to find here in The States!!  Thank you David for helping me with my iPad Wi-Fi; Thank You Sarah for my morning, personally delivered Cappuccinos; Thank you Flo for making us feel like royalty at breakfast each morning; Thank you Tyrone & Piero for sending us off each day and greeting us each evening upon our return.  If I left anyone out it was only because I didn't catch all the names.  You all work so hard and your efforts are greatly appreciated.  Thank you for making our first trips to London a memorable one!",5,2013,10,11
137,Great service,"Really friendly service, comfortable room and good location.  Lots of nice little touches.  I really enjoyed the check-in in the lounge.

137,Simply superb - staff are impeccable,"Hotel 41
This truly is a special hotel in London and with a great location on Buckingham Palace Road, right opposite the entrance for the  Royal Mews – a few minutes’ walk to Victoria Station, just down the road to Buckingham Palace and about seven minutes’ walk to Green Park tube (through the park) it’s a great location for the area.  Having been to London many times and stayed in numerous hotels (The Royal Gardens at Kensington and The Sofitel in St James on 3 occasions  Hotel 41 is my new favourite.  Certainly not inexpensive (even without converting to the Australian Dollar) but where else do you get seated at check in and offered complimentary ‘Verve’Champagne and have a complimentary  open pantry 24 hours a day.  
The Executive lounge was our home away from home for our four nights and whilst were not able to be upgraded as hoped we were offered the alternative of afternoon tea which we accepted to have later in the stay.  After tearing ourselves away from a second complimentary ‘Verve’ we went up to our room, which was a nice size and with a working fireplace.  London hotel rooms are traditionally small  but this was more than adequate for us and even had room to spare with the amount of luggage we had with us.  A lovely touch was the ‘Happy Anniversary” note from Lauren with a mix of lovely little cakes.
The bathroom was of a good size and all decorated in black in white, only issue we had was  not being able turn the shower on – had to ring down for someone to come and do for us as it was stuck, also  in the bathroom there was a shower above the bath and  a separate one, however the separate shower had the showerhead  so far out into the small shower we found it difficult to  shower in it, but luckily for us we didn’t have to worry after the first night as we got our upgrade the next morning to a Suite and they also still let us have our complimentary afternoon tea (thanks Monika)
Monika and the staff moved all our luggage and clothes from the wardrobe to the new rooms and we were thrilled with the suite,  Two  doors from the hallway one for  bedroom and one for the lounge area.  His and hers bathrooms (Although the his one was tiny and not a lot of room to manoeuvre, the hers was fine,  also two  wardrobes , good  tvs in both lounge and bedroom, nespresso machine and a full set of office supplies in the desk drawer).
Loved the little night spray left on our pillow for a relaxing nights sleep – less calories than chocolates.  Full breakfast was included  in our  room rate and each morning Guy would remember how we liked our juices, coffee and tea as well as our egg choice.   Great selection of items from the buffet as well as cooked choices
Other reviewers have talked about the complimentary open pantry and we also found this a lovely added touch. From nuts and sweets, through to afternoon hot scones with jam and cream, to hot canapés served at your table from 6-8pm and then from 8pm a good assortment of cold meats and cheeses and some lovely deserts, not to mention free ice cream and water all day.  Some nights we just had drinks and the complimentary nibbles in the Executive Lounge rather than going out for a quick meal seeing as we had been on the go all day.  
The décor is very English in the Executive lounge and you feel like you are in the library of a fine private home, however the décor of the rooms is more modern and the photos on the website are a true reflection of the hotel.  

What is special about Hotel 41 (Like similar style of five star boutique hotels around the world) is the staff.  Hotel 41 has an experienced team who have been with the hotel and its sister hotel The Ruebens for some time   Every guest is greeted and constantly referred to by their name and each time you return to the hotel Executive Lounge the team are genuinely interested  in how your day went (If you are into sharing.)

Special thank you to Lauren, although we only had you for one day of our stay, but Monika, Guy, Tyrone and Magdelina  a big thank you for making our stay so wonderful and for also making our visitors feel very special also  for your concerns on how Terry was after him not being well during our stay
Monika  - you are truly exceptional at your job and I know you have a real passion for what you do and it shows, we thank you not only for making our stay so pleasurable but also for your friendship during our stay and we really hope you will come visit in Australia soon.   Magdelina  -  all the best for the birth of your little one and again thank you for everything.    Guy –  it was like having a personalised butler each time we entered the lounge,  like Monika you have a passion for what you do and it was certainly appreciated – you were the only one who  got my coffee and eggs right on my whole trip.  Tyrone  - loved your good humour and appreciated the great job you did on the front door.
This hotel is certainly not one I would recommend for families with young children (more as a consideration to  other guests) But the staff were very good in ensuring the little ones that were staying at the hotel were not an inconvenience to other guests.   	I cant speak highly enough of our time at Hotel 41  and if we are every wanting to stay in this part of London again this hotel is our first choice",5,2013,10,06
137,Home away from home in London,"First and foremost, I must commend the outstanding staff, and to call them ""staff"" almost belittles the degree to which they enhanced our stay. Everyone we encountered was friendly, competent, and eager to please. On our first full day in London, we decided to take a break from sightseeing and called the hotel to see if they could arrange an afternoon tea in the Executive Lounge. I thought this last minute request might be hard to accommodate but was greeted with ""No problem, what time would you like your tea?"".

That tea, by the way, was excellent as were all the meals we had at Hotel 41. The breakfast selection was extensive and delicious. I'd also like to note that the Hotel's Bbar restaurant (street level) was surprisingly good.

Guest rooms are nice, quiet, and well appointed, but the Executive Lounge down the hall is such a comfortable space that we spent most of our free time there, enjoying snacks, drinks and the fireplace. The combination of a comfortable guest room and beautiful Executive Lounge really created the feel of living in a townhouse. Quite a way to enjoy London and I wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else on my next trip to London.",5,2013,10,06
137,excellent,"We had a wonderful stay at the Hotel. It was on the day of my son's wedding and the hotel kindly made our rooms available early for us to change before hand. The staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly and gave us a round of applause as we left for the service. 
The rooms very beautifully appointed, spotlessly clean and the bed the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Breakfast was excellent.
On reaching home I realised that I had left the bridal bouquet in our room. We called the hotel and it was located, put in water and kept safe until we could return to collect it the following day. They even provided a suitable pottery container to carry the flowers in. 
I would strongly recommend this hotel and hope to stay there again sometime.",5,2013,10,05
137,Quaint and attentive staff.,"My husband and I are just leaving the hotel after spending 3 nights in this excellent hotel.  The staff is attentive and charming.  The hotel has a old world feel to it however all the modern comforts are present in this hotel.  The hotel encompasses the essence of London, blending the old with the new.  Excellent Location.",5,2013,10,04
137,Charming,I have shared this hotel with everyone.  It is beautiful when you walk through the doors and the staff is overwhelmingly delightful.  It is a pleasant surprise to go upstairs.  The location is also perfect.  We will be back.😀,5,2013,10,02
137,"Exquisite, Boutique, Hideaway from reality - in the perfect location!","With only having the opportunity to stay in London for a couple of days I am so glad we chose to stay here, the experience provided by the staff at Hotel 41 was one I will remember as a highlight of our month long vacation. A huge benefit of staying here is the location, we managed to see so many sights of London from the centre point 'Buckingham Palace Road' and what better way to finish off your day of sightseeing than to be relaxing in the Executice Lounge with a glass of champagne and some afternoon tea in front of the fireplace.
I would highly recommend this Hotel and I will definitely be staying here again. Well done to the staff at Hotel 41 - outstanding customer service.",5,2013,10,02
137,"Wonderful hotel, Amazing Staff","My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 for one week while on vacation in London. Hotel 41 was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in! The staff is incredibly thoughtful and whole experience from check-in to check-out was first class.

The room was much bigger than I would have ever expected. It was my first time in London, but I was expecting a NYC or Chicago sized room. Our room was very comfortable and the bathroom was huge.

We spent many hours in the lounge during our weeklong stay as we had breakfast every morning and many a London Pride in the afternoon and evening. We had never experienced a full English breakfast before and enjoyed sampling every breakfast item available on the menu, including the Kippers. The absolute best thing on the breakfast menu is the smoked haddock, washed down with a cappuccino and pain au chocolat. YUM! I’d like to start every day like that.

Guy and friends were great in the evening as well. We thoroughly enjoyed the evening canapés and the chilled glass along with our London Prides before heading out on the town. Monica always had great recommendations for restaurants for us.

One of the things that my husband was really excited about was the honesty bar, but I think he only was able to write in it one time due to the impeccable service of the 41 staff. They could tell you were heading to the beer fridge before you even knew you wanted to!",5,2013,10,02
137,Amazing stay in London,"We stayed at this hotel for our wedding in the capital.  The hotel is beautiful, the decor is very elegant throughout.  The hotel staff made it a stay to remember, it made our stay even more memorable.  Their attention to detail is fantastic.  We cant wait to stay again!",5,2013,09,30
137,Very romantic,"We stayed here on our wedding night and it was perfect. The staff were so so friendly and extremely accommodating. You're treated like royalty! It's definitely different and has it own character. Hugely unique. Lovely themed rooms, cute boutique, very contemporary. Feels like a home away from home. Its quite small and the visit was v personal. Lots of personal touches in the room too. Thank you to all the staff for an amazing visit.",5,2013,09,28
137,Excellent indeed,"Old fashioned but stylish hotel in front of Buckingham Palace. You feel like transported in the 19th Century. This is really charming, enchanting, and a change to have people taking care of you all the time.
Service is top of the line. Pricey though, but you cannot have this kind of service for peanuts, ( peanuts are free, by the way).
I would recommend it, this is really the Bristish experience. I felt like a Princess.",4,2013,09,27
137,Excellent service,"The staff is focused on making your stay as pleasant as possible. It's a great small hotel, rooms are complete but small. 20 minutes walking distance from the mayor shopping areas. There are many good restaurants on walking distance. ",5,2013,09,26
137,Best hotel in Europe,"I actually never write reviews and always look at this site for other people's recommendations!  However, I felt compelled to take the time to write about Hotel 41.  This hotel, hands down, has been the most comfortable, friendly and service orientated hotel I have stayed in Europe.  I travel quite frequently throughout Europe and through London, each time I make sure I stay here.  Monika and Lauren go out of there way to take care of me, my clients and my fiance whenever we are here.  Down to having my favorite beer chilled in the room upon arrival.  Seriously, this is the place to stay in London, once you stay here, you will never stay anywhere else in the city.",5,2013,09,24
137,"If you are in London, explore Hotel 41.  Amazingly feels humble!!","My husband and I had one post-cruise night at Hotel 41 in London, a short walking distance from the Buckingham Palace.  I am telling you their services from the housekeeping services to the general manager was at 20 out of scale 1 to 10.  We have had stayed many hotels around the world but, I mean, this hotel is the best.  Why?  It is a classy boutique style hotel and its staff made you felt like, 'you are a prince/princess' behind the Buckingham Palace building. I tell you they are not fake or business in mind.  They are so natural in pleasing their guests and we feel too humble at their services.  it was truly refreshing.......for their style of graceful services.
If you are looking for a hotel in London, you wouldn't ever be sorry for staying this Hotel 41. If we visit London from now on, Definitely the Hotel 41 is, of course, my family, relative, and friends' choice.  We don't write much about writing a review of anything before, but about this Hotel 41, we have to, for anyone who would like to find a hospitable place to stay. We just loved it!!!",5,2013,09,24
137,Best Part of Our Trip,"My mom and I recently traveled to London for the first time.  We did many of the usual sightseeing things and loved the city, but we both decided that the BEST part of our visit was this hotel. What a hidden gem just steps from Buckingham Palace.  You are treated like royalty the moment you step inside.  We expected the wonderful room but were blown away by the friendly service.  The executive lounge is the gathering location where soft music is playing, champagne is flowing,  the fireplace is alight, and cozy little tables are outfitted with linens, china, and candles.  You nestle into a variety of upholstered chairs and sofas, adjust your pillow, and the cares of your day drift away as the staff brings you hot canapes and glasses of champagne.  After spending an entire day sightseeing, my mom and  I would return to the comforts of the hotel and relax in the executive lounge.  We planned to go out to eat at the many restaurants in London but were so comfortable there that we ate most meals at the hotel.  We ventured next door to the B-Bar and even into the fine dining at the Rubens hotel next door and had wonderful meals there too.  All in all, this hotel makes it possible to do very extensive all day sightseeing because you can refresh and refuel in 5 star luxury each night.  The concierge services are outstanding.  We visited Highclere Castle (Downton Abbey fans) and the staff arranged for the necessary taxi and train information.  Navigating the underground trains, haling of taxi's, restaurant reservations...its all handled for you. Location is ideal.  We can't wait to return!",5,2013,09,23
137,Just Perfect!,"We recently had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 for my husbands 50th birthday. The customer service and attention to detail was superb. We were made to feel very special and the staff were just delightful. From the moment you walk in the staff are make you feel extremely welcome. Our stay exceeded my expectations and made my husbands birthday very special. If you want exceptional service, attention to detail and comfort this is the place to stay.",5,2013,09,22
137,"A crown jewel, next to Buckingham Place","A wonderful stay and experience at Hotel 41. It was all about superb service, attention to detail, all with exceptional amenities, in a warm, comfortable environment. As noted in other reviews, Hotel 41 is located the top floor of the Rubens Hotel, accessed by a its own entrance. It is across from Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station is one block away. 
On first arrival, you are greeted in lobby, and escorted to the Lounge on the 5th floor via private Hotel 41 elevator, where you check in while offered a glass of champagne, introduced to the hotel facilities and then escorted to your room. Our room was wonderful, with a  true king bed, dark wood furniture (desk, wardrobe, table and a couple of club chairs). Did I mention the working fireplace, with remote? The bathroom was superb, with water pressure to die for, a soaking tub and full shower.
But it is the service, and staff that really made it so special. They are juts amazing. Courteous, charming, friendly and attentive to ones needs. My partner and I always felt welcome, and could not  recommend Hotel 41 more highly, for your next London stay. It will be ours.",5,2013,09,21
137,Loved. It.,"Wow. Our stay at Hotel 41 came at the end of a trip where we had already experienced some excellent accommodations so our bar was set pretty high. Let's just say that Hotel 41 exceeded our expectations in so many ways. From the moment that we arrived we were made to feel special. Actually the great service started even before we arrived as I had been in contact with their concierge who were very helpful in making recommendations and arranging airport transport via email. 

This hotel actually occupies the top floor of the building which also holds the Rubens Hotel. It has a separate entrance that is locked and manned making it feel very exclusive.

We had a interior facing room so no view but that may have been a blessing because the streets sound as though they may be a bit noisy. If I had to find one fault, it's that the room and particularly the bathroom were on the small side by North American standards but probably average for UK. Having said that, it was decorated very tastefully and you could see the quality in everything, down to every detail. It was also laid out very nicely with every accessory and amenity you could want while travelling. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the shower head installed on the ceiling above the tub made it hard to step away from it.

In their lounge there are refreshments and snacks available all day long including an honour bar. The same lounge is used for their excellent continental breakfast buffet and afternoon tea. A hot breakfast can be ordered as well. Since the clientele is limited in this small boutique hotel, they seem to know who everyone is without having to ask you for your room#. A small detail but it made us feel very welcome and special.

Their concierge desk was fantastic for help and recommendations. The same can be said with the staff manning the entrance who are always there to provide you with an umbrella if they think you're not prepared for the weather at hand. All staff seemed to be prepared to make your experience the best one possible.

The location of the hotel is also very convenient. It's closest to the Victoria station that connects very easily to every major line. It's a stone's throw away from Buckingham Palace and some beautiful neighbourhoods that are nice for a stroll (if it's not raining). It's also within walking distance to many attractions if you don't mind 20-30min of fresh air exercise, the biggest obstacle being the rain of course.

Normally when we travel I like to try out different accommodations but I'm already thinking about coming back here the next time we're in London ...",5,2013,09,14
137,Fabulous Hotel,"On company business we stayed one night at Hotel 41.   From the moment you walk in you are looked after by amazing staff.
We were made to feel extremely welcome, had a wonderful room, the extras in the room were most appreciated, the bathroom was luxurious and the bed extremely comfortable.
Although we did not make use of the 24 hour buffet it look wonderful as did the honesty bar.
The cooked breakfast in the morning was delicious.
We left wishing we could stay longer and would have no hesitation in recommending it to friends.",5,2013,09,14
137,Exceptional Service and Attention to Detail,"Hotel 41 is actually the fifth floor of the Rubens Hotel building, accessed by a separate entrance. It is characterized by an exceptional level of service and attention to detail from the staff. My company was conducting business in London and the board room at 41 was ideal. Throughout my three days there I was treated like a special guest and in a genuinely friendly manner. My room was especially well-equipped - the bathroom was large and the king-sized bed very comfortable - and little touches like a fruit hamper were much appreciated. Everything about the place is five-star and I found no fault. As a Yorkshireman I never imagined I could consider $600 a night for a hotel to be good value, but for this quality of experience I do think so and wouldn't hesitate in recommending it.",5,2013,09,13
137,"Small, intimate and very special","We stayed at Hotel 41 last Tuesday night to be near to Victoria Station.  It literally took my breath away.  Secreted on 5th floor (formally the ballroom) of the Rubens hotel, 41 is so special and true luxury.  Yes you do pay for it, however you certainly get the service and quality you would expect - and some.  The staff are so friendly, helpful and efficient and the decor throughout is amazing.  Definitely will be saving up to go back again.  Fabulous place for couples to celebrate a special occasion.",5,2013,09,13
137,Oasis with great service,"We had the pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel for our final night in London during the Olympics.  We had rented a flat for the previous 2 weeks and treated ourselves on our last night at Hotel 41 to celebrate our anniversary.  The hotel was an oasis in a central and hectic part of London.  The room was spacious and beautiful, but what really stood out were the staff and the level of service.  They truly provided a memorable ending to a great experience in London.  Next time, we plan on staying for more than one night!",5,2013,09,12
137,Best Hotel in London,My son and I spent a lovely week at Hotel 41 in July.  We felt that Hotel 41 was our home and oasis during our visit to London.  The staff's attention to detail and to the needs of each guest are beyond excellent.  I am a seasoned traveler and can say that I have never experienced the level of personal attention and care that we received at Hotel 41.  The staff is simply the best.  The rooms are well appointed and spacious by London standards.   This hotel is truly a gem and from now on the only place I will stay in London.  I stongly recommend Hotel 41.,5,2013,09,12
137,Honeymoon night - could not have picked a better hotel!,"We LOVED Hotel 41! It's very boutique, right on Buckingham Palace Rd. It feels like there are only 5 rooms even though there are 30. The attention to detail of the staff was amazing! We had rose petals strewn on the bed and around the bath, candles lit and a fire! The gorgeous lounge with free delicious nibbles and drinks is divine.  The continental breakfast offering was beyond expectations - in fact that just sums up the whole place. Incredible. And I stay in a LOT of 5 star places.... I wish we could have stayed longer - and eaten some of the food that is written about in the lovely recipe book. Charming, completely customer focused personal care and service - nothing is too much trouble. Well worth it.

We just can't fault it and are saving to come back next time!",5,2013,09,12
137,Return trip,"I was lucky enough to return to 41 For my birthday after staying in June.
It was better then I remembered and we had a fab time. The staff are all lovely, the food is very good and although not as central as some I really like the location, there is always something going on around the palace.
I for one can't wait to go back, a lovely oasis in London! ",5,2013,09,06
137,Best hotel in London,"We booked for a 3 night ""get more from your stay package"" in July with my husband. Being in the travel industry myself this hotel offers a special experience. Not only are you offered a glass of champagne at check in, you are offered a choice of champagne . The room was spacious for London, photos do not do it justice, good quality furnishings and bedding with some special small touches which are impressive. The staff were friendly without being intrusive. Afternoon tea was excellent, I just love afternoon tea! Best steak ever in the Rubins Library restaurant. Enough said see you soon No 41",5,2013,09,05
137,A Hidden Gem,"My Friend and I stayed here for a night whilst visiting London. We both needed a treat and this Hotel hit the spot. The staff are friendly and very helpful, and the rooms are stunning with every comfort.
After returning from the theatre we made good use of the Pantry and shared cheeses and a glass of wine. The afternoon tea was as good as any I have had at the Ritz or The Savoy.
Well done to all the team, and I will take my husband next time",5,2013,09,03
137,The Hotel Staff helped to make our vacation wonderful.,"First time in London.  The staff at Hotel 41 were very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.

Had a wonderful time  The hotel was convenient to everything.

The Executive Lounge provided a perfect spot for breakfast and relaxation with a drink and snack after a day of site seeing

Overall great experience.",5,2013,09,02
137,The hotel to be in London,If you can spend some money in a extraordinary hotel be sure to book the Hotel 41. I have never seen suich efficient smooth and graceful service . We had a wonderful stay at this hotel which does not look as a hotel. Everything was just perfect.,5,2013,09,02
137,Best Boutique Hotel,"From the minute you enter the Hotel lobby until the time you checkout, you will have a wonderful experience.  The hotel is very unique, in fact it occupies the entire 5th floor of the adjacent Rubens Hotel.  It has a wonderful lounge where you can get a glass of wine, a late night snack or full service menu. The friendliness of the staff and the service they provide are unparalleled and they take care of your every request or need.  In my case they purchased for me several front of the line tickets to exhibitions in London and tickets for Billy Elliot.  I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there the next time I am in London.",5,2013,09,01
137,Another amazing stay at Hotel 41,"My husband and I first stayed here after our wedding last year, and had such a great experience that we promised we'd be back. And we've just been back...this time for my birthday.
Hotel 41 did not disappoint. From the minute we walked in the door the service was exceptional.
Room was great with lots of space and everything we needed.
My husband had booked afternoon tea as a treat and it was amazing. The cakes were all designed with a celebration theme for Prince George which was lovely. I was also treated to a very unexpected birthday cake which was delicious!
After going out for the evening we came back and ""plundered the pantry"" whilst drinking champagne in the lounge - incredibly relaxing place to spend time.
Breakfast the following morning was excellent, as it was last time we stayed.
Overall another fantastic stay - we'll be back every year at this rate!
Thank you to all the brilliant staff you have, and a special thank you to Magda who went out of her way to make our stay special - good luck with the baby Magda!",5,2013,08,30
137,Interesting property that shake all day and late into the night,"I tried to stay here in August and had to move hotels due to the construction site across the street - the bed, hotel, everything was shaking as they drilled and dug and drilled again. It is a very interesting property - quite stylish, unique layout, and wonderfully helpful staff, but I do wonder what they are thinking when they book people in. It is not as if the construction sight is new, so why don't they warn you?  It got so bad that I had to move across town to another one of their fellow accommodations which was less than convenient. All in all, I would not recommend booking here until the construction is done - it is just not relaxing.",2,2013,08,30
137,Exceptional Service - Memorable Experience,"We spent 3 memorable nights at 41 last week and can say without reservation that 41 is the finest hotel in which my wife and I have had the pleasure of staying in over 30 years of travel for business and pleasure. The service was simply outstanding and without doubt the best we have ever experienced. The attention to detail and proactive approach of the staff is second to none. The hotel consists of only 28 rooms and is very cozy and warm. The Executive Lounge, with its unique atmosphere reminiscent of a mansion library, was the ideal setting in which to start our day with a great breakfast and in which to end our day with a night cap from a terrific selection of premium single malt scotch whiskies, wines, beer and spirits.  Consumption is based on the honor system and recorded in a log book by each guest. Our room was comfortable and spacious, complete with a bath tub and 2 showers. The black and white color scheme and furnishings were traditional British decor. I can't say enough about 41 and am already looking forward to our next visit.",5,2013,08,29
137,Amazing!,"Hotel 41 is a fabulous place to stay. The atmosphere is beautiful, quiet, and lovey. It has delicious breakfast, perfect afternoon tea with champagne and a great night cap service with hors d'oeuvres and all; plus 24hr ice cream! I stayed here for three nights with my husband; we have two small children and would probably not stay here with them.  I think small children probably need a larger hotel with kid friendly activities/play center.  But if you want elegant pampered service, this is the place to stay.  They will pamper and cater to your every whim. This is a perfect London Hotel.  It sits across the street from Buckingham Palace, a short distance to pubs, shopping, and the tub and train stations.  Wonderful all around. I can’t wait to go back.",5,2013,08,27
137,An experience,"The second time that my wife and I have stayed at this hotel. Exceptional hotel, service and overall environment. Nothing is too much trouble and we will certainly stay again when we are next in London. Try the Champagne experience in the Leopards Bar - an excellent way to unwind. All of the food was cooked to a high standard and was delightful",5,2013,08,27
137,Simply Outstanding!,"Well... I don't really know where to start to be honest!

Outstanding, Exceeded guests expectations, Amazing experience, 100% Guest satisfaction are all things that come to mind when trying to sum up my stay at Hotel41 London.

I stayed here a total of 5 nights / 6 days with Family (My Mum) and right from the time I was greeted at the main door on a Saturday night at 11:15pm to the time I left the same main door it was like a home away from home. 
No matter what the query (small, large or insignificant) ALL the staff went above and beyond to help in any way they could which as a guest makes it just that much more reassuring and helps in enjoying the holiday!

In my profession customer service is absolutely crucial and Hotel41 showed exactly how it's done on all levels.
Having the entire Hotel on the One Level does make a huge difference in terms of it being very easy to get around and talk to staff for what you need.
The 'Executive Lounge' was quite something else and promotes such a good vibe to either kick-start or unwind your day. 
Breakfast had a wide selection to choose from. The Pantry was always well stocked no matter what time of the day and unlimited Häagen-Dazs ice-cream!! Winning!!

The room was incredibly generous on size, very comfortable and very well appointed. 

It must be said, a notable mention to Piero, Cara, Magda, Guy & Lauren, who all helped in making the experience for both myself and my Mum one to really remember. Having said that, the entire staff of Hotel41 also deserve a thank-you as it's evident to see this is an incredibly well run boutique hotel with staff that represent its 5-Star rating accurately. ",5,2013,08,26
137,"Like a catered, private flat","Where to start? You know how at most hotels there is usually one, maybe two people who run around and really have the ability to sort out whatever need or problem you have? Imagine a small luxury hotel with a battalion of people with that kind of star treatment attitude and authority. At the same time, the personal touch was never overbearing -- just enough to make sure we made full use of the hotel. Service is without a doubt outstanding.

The hotel itself is laid out like an eccentric rabbit warren of corridors -- you will find this either endearing or annoying. We found it endearing, and had an informal competition to see who could first find a route to the private elevator without recourse to going through the lounge. 

The lounge itself is really the only common area of this boutique hotel, so the overall effect is like having your own flat rather than being overwhelmed by a huge lobby or dining room. That said, the lounge is quite opulent and relaxing. Hotel 41 is understated, charming and discreet -- if you want that, you'll love the place. 

We were in a suite (we had to be, with a 4 year old child in tow) and while it's possible some rooms are small (we can't speak for rooms we didn't see), ours was extremely spacious by any reasonable standard -- with two bathrooms, a walk in shower and a huge walk in closet. Despite the room's facing Buckingham Palace Road (an extremely busy and noisy street) we were surprised at how quiet the room was. 

The hotel seems to be trying to marry old and new hotelling styles: the building is traditional, but then you find modern flat screen TVs as well as a stereo with docking stations for mp3 players; the bathrooms have the traditional heated towel racks (which I always approach with fear in every London hotel) but then a very modern walk in shower. Somehow it all seems to come together in a distinctive, maybe unique style.

We're marking value at 5/5 because we took advantage of a 3 for 2 night deal -- at that price our accommodation was exceptional value for money even with the boat pushed out a bit. The only reason we'd mark location at only a 4/5 is the proximity to the Palace, which means in the summer you are wallowing through the hoards of people inexplicably and morbidly fascinated by the Royals. Also, the nearest Tube station is Victoria Station, my least loved tube stop in London (try to buy a ticket there and you'll know why). Go to St James's Park instead -- the extra 5 minutes walk is so worth it. If you're taking a taxi everywhere, you won't care.

We found the food at Hotel 41 consistently exceeded our expectations, breakfast as well as a light dinner we took one night. Now that the quiet charm of the American Bar at the Connaught has been destroyed in the remuddling, the lounge at Hotel 41 would be my go-to place for calm, quiet, pre-dinner drinks. After a full day of London noise and crowds, the lounge is just .... ""ahhhhh...."" 

Overall we loved Hotel 41. If you want grand common areas or a ton of in-house facilities, I'd go to Claridge's or a flagship Park Lane hotel. If you want a quiet, particular place with a limitless ability to provide service, you'll like the hotel as much as we did.)",5,2013,08,26
137,Perfect start to our marriage!,"My husband and I stayed here on our wedding night and the following night, before flying off on the rest of our honeymoon and even for a fussy bride this hotel excelled expectations! We opted for the romantic turn down and couldn't believe how nice the room was! 

Staff - All staff went out of their way to provide a friendly and unobtrusive service, providing champagne on arrival and quickly showing us to our room. In addition to the usual service, one person went out of her way to find me a dress bag for my wedding dress and they also held onto some of our luggage for several weeks, which we decided not to take on honeymoon (all for no extra charge).  

Food - The plunder the pantry option was fantastic, with plenty of choice. All food was of an excellent quality and the romantic turn down also included lots of sweets and chocolates. The breakfast was a wonderful experience, and sitting in the old fashioned dining area eating a luxurious breakfast and chatting to the staff made us feel like old fashioned explorers off on an adventure!

Things to do - While the location is fantastic for tourists looking to explore London, we chose this hotel also for its luxury and easy access to Victoria station. Hotel 41 shares the amenities of The Reubens, so the champagne bar and afternoon tea is available to you next door. Your can enter 41 through an unmarked door in The Reubens, making you feel like some sort of secret high profile guest! 

Room - Every furnishing in the room was of the utmost luxury with Penthaligons toiletries and all the little extras you would expect (including real fireplace with roaring fire if you wish!). Do note that the hotel is small and boutique in nature, therefore the rooms are probably a bit smaller than you may expect for the price. The bed was super comfy and the bathroom was all marble and mirrors. 

Overall we could not recommend this hotel enough, both for the excellent and friendly service and the overall luxurious feel.",5,2013,08,26
137,A wonderful boutique hotel,"I'm a Londoner who now lives in Los Angeles. I've travelled all over the US and Europe but go back to London every year. This is now my absolute first choice to stay because of the most amazing staff. I've read some of the negative reports - these people would obviously be much happier on Park Lane with the accompanying ostentation or perhaps they should simply stay at home. But if you want to feel that you are in London and you want a great location with the best service imaginable, you should stay here. The rooms are small by Park Lane standards but really comfortable and breakfast is a social event. We will be back!!",5,2013,08,20
137,A wonderful hidden gem!!,Took my wife to London for a surprise weekend. Hotel was fabulous!! Its location near to Buckingham Palace was excellent and only a short walk to Victoria Tube Station providing easy access to London's attractions. Hotel interior was refine and in keeping with the portrayed image. We have stayed in many 5* Hotels but at Hotel 41 the staff were amazing and went that extra mile. I think this is because the hotel feels like the executive apartments of the Rubens Hotel and therefore has a smaller number of rooms which enables the management and staff to provide a wonderful customer experience. Thank you to all the staff who made our stay very special and we look forward to returning.,5,2013,08,20
137,The best service anywhere.,"Just returned from our 2nd trip in recent months to 41, and already can't wait to go back!
If attentive service and being made to feel special every minute of your stay is what you are looking for then this is the place to stay.
We have stayed at many good hotels with good service but the staff here are on the next level. The staff are genuine, caring, helpful and interested in making your stay the best it can be. Thank you all at Hotel 41!",5,2013,08,19
137,ABSOLUTELY THE BEST CUSTOMER APPRECIATION!,My 14 year old granddaughter Elana and I recently returned from our trip of a lifetime to London and Paris. I choose Hotel 41 because I wanted to give her a special and unique experience and it was worth every single penny! She will remember the staff of Hotel 41 for the rest of her life....so wonderfully gifted in making you feel like you're the only ones staying there! We stayed for 5 nights and wished we could have stayed longer. The room was luxurious and delightful - every day they brought fresh fruit to the room. I can't say enough about the little amenities that the staff provided. Breakfast buffet was perfect (of course our waiter Stefan certainly had a part in making it that way with his delightful stories).  High tea was marvelous! Perfect location! Perfect hotel! I have highly recommended Hotel 41 to my traveling friends!,5,2013,08,14
137,Amazing Hotel!,"Without a doubt, this is one of the finest hotels in London.  My wife and I enjoyed our stay here immensely!  It is conveniently located within 5 minutes walking of Victoria station and Buckingham Palace.  The hotel facilities are superb and our bed was really comfortable.  Choices of nuts, fruit, and ice cream were complimentary and available all day.  Breakfast was great also.  The hotel staff were the ones that really make this hotel superb.  From check-in to check-out every hotel staff member treated us kindly and asked if they could be of assistance.  We will definitely return to Hotel 41 on our London trips.",5,2013,08,12
137,Best hotel experience of my life!,"My husband and I travelled to London as part of an extended European vacation for our honeymoon.  Without a doubt, our stay in Hotel 41 was the best of our trip and the best hotel we have ever stayed in.  Service is absolutely exceptional (they kept iced glasses and iced vodka for my late night martini, printed directions with a map for a cabbie to take us out to dinner, set up rose petals and candles in a heart shape in our room, arranged airport travel back to Heathrow with a driver, and I could go on and on here...).  I think I hugged our concierge, Monika, the day we departed because I was going to miss her! Stefan offered great travel advice every day and made us laugh every morning! The room itself was exceptional also.  We had a conservatory suite with a retractable roof that opened to view the stars at night and rose us with the sun in the morning; it was very romantic! It was beautifully appointed with plenty of seating and relaxing space. The hotel is located nearest to Buckingham palace, which made all our touring easy. There is literally nothing that I could complain about or change with this hotel stay.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone who ever visits London!",5,2013,08,11
137,Simply Amazing,"My wife and I visited together and both agreed that this is truly a lovely hotel with wonderful staff. Our entire experience greatly exceeded our expectations.

Our delightful driver Colin took us on a little mini-tour before dropping us at the hotel, helping us to get our bearings. our lovely upgraded room was ready for us upon arrival.

The entire Milestone staff was first-rate: Our room was always beautifully clean, we were greeted by name by the reception staff and doormen, all doing their best to make our stay a memorable one.Staff were very knowledgeable, helping us immensely with theatre tickets, dinner reservations, private tours, directions and advice on how to use the tube. No request was too great for them.

I am busy thinking up excuses to make another trip to London. Another stay at Hotel 41 is definitely in our future.",5,2013,08,07
137,Wow - what a hotel! Definitely going back....,"I chose this hotel based on the reviews on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed!

On arrival we were offered a glass of champagne....but not any champagne, you get a choice of 4-5 different champagnes! A great start to our wedding anniversary.

The staff are so friendly and welcoming, nothing is too much trouble. The room was lovely and we had been left a small chocolate cake with happy anniversary on it - a small but well noted touch.

Throughout our stay it was evident that they know you by name, no signing after having drinks or anything like that, the staff no exactly who you are without having to ask - finally a hotel where you are a person not a room number!

We had the romantic turndown service and it was amazing, candles, rose petals and champagne - a great end to a fantastic weekend.

Highly recommended and we will definitely be back!",5,2013,08,04
137,Exceeded our already high expections!,"We visited the hotel for our wedding anniversary and were blown away by every aspect of the stay. Every member of staff knows your name and makes you feel special. We arrived home from the theatre to find our room filled with candles, rose petals and chocolate cake. At breakfast we were given a teddy bear to take home to our 2 year old son, we must have mentioned him once in passing and they remembered about him and gave us a little gift for him. That sums the place up, it's got everything you'd expect from 5 star but all the little things they do is what makes it special. We will be back! ",5,2013,07,31
137,Amazing,"Ill start by stating we are very fussy travelers and this hotel exceeded our expectations. We found 41 on tripadvisor and was also recommended by a friend. We stayed at 41 for 3 nights from the 15 July and it was not enough. This boutique hotel had every detail covered. The staff were fantastic and made us feel so welcome. The rooms were very nice, clean and every little detail had been thought of. We traveled with our 2 children and the hotel and staff catered for all of there needs, from slippers, miniature dressing gowns and most important ice cream on tap! The food was divine. 
The staff offered amazing recommendations for food, places of interest and shopping. My family and I look forward to returning again in the near future. Hotel 41 thanks again!!!!",5,2013,07,31
137,Great service and private club ambiance,"I stayed several times at ""41"" and I like the fact that is almost a little ""secret"". Situated on a high floor in the same building of the Rubens Hotel t5he ""41"" has the feeling of a private club. The concierge service is one of the best I have experienced in London, the staff is really helpful and knowledgeable. The breakfast and tea services are terrific and I love the idea of the pantry in the library always ready for a drink or a snack even in the middle of the night.
The rooms are pretty if a bit small and the location is great for sightseeing,k a little less for shopping however the Victoria tube is very close and so is the station with the train that comes in right from Gatwick airport.",4,2013,07,31
137,41: the best,I have been many times in the 41 - and there is a reason for this: the 41 provides that kind of service that is only achieved by professionals who are competent and love their job. Service is impeccable and allow me to relax after a hard day's work with sometimes 8 - 10 meetings with various business partners. The staff's attention to detail always surprises me - and I am a hard taskmaster - almost never giving a perfect score - but the 41 comes as close as I can think of: 9.99 out of 10   :-),5,2013,07,31
137,One of the best hotels in which I have stayed!!,"I have done extensive business and personal travel internationally, and have a high standard as I was - for a while - a senior executive in the hospitality industry.  So, when I indicate Hotel 41 is one of the best, it is against a very high standard.

My wife and I were in London for a wedding, and chose Hotel 41 based on the many positive reviews.  I have also stayed, on a previous trip, at Milestone - and in the case of both properties have been impressed by Red Carnation Hotels.  The things I liked were numerous, but heavily focused on the impressive team assembled at Hotel 41.  Stay learned our names and our likes/dislikes quickly, and were responsive to our wishes almost as if they read minds.  The service was better than any Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton in which I have stayed!  Food was very good (though as they share a kitchen, was not necessarily memorable) but the service made each occasion in the ""executive lounge"" memorable.  The hotel was spotlessly clean, and our room (we had a suite) was a bit quirky in design (as it's an older building) but very well maintained and comfortable.  The bed was great.  Showers had lots of pressure, AC worked wonderfully well (important as it was hot that week in London!) and housekeeping was responsive.  

I would recommend this hotel without reservation - and though both properties are great think it is a notch above the Milestone.",5,2013,07,30
137,Wonderful hotel with wonderful ambiance,"Lovely weekend stay , check in experience was exceptional (especially if you like Champagne).
Service and atmosphere outstanding though room (junior suite) bit cramped .  Also excellent central location.",4,2013,07,30
137,Feels like a private club,"I traveling frequently to London on business and have stayed at many hotels, but I always go back to the 41 for several reasons. Small, luxurious, private hotel which feels like a private club. Responsive staff who go the extra mile to know you and your needs. Comfortable, well appointed rooms with in-room computer system. No need to bring your laptop. I can check my e-mail, surf the internet, work on documents, print or fax them--all from my bed. THe lounge is inviting and well stocked with drinks, snacks, sandwiches, fruits etc. Before going to my room at the end of the day, I always stop in the lounge for a drink. The one minor drawback is the 41 is not conducive for meetings. They do have a state-of-the-art meeting room for guests to use, but there really isn't come meet me at my hotel kind of place. 
Access to fitness club is right around corner and complimentary. I know this hotel well and think about staying at other hotels for variety, but why when the staff knows me and I always have an excellent stay.",5,2013,07,30
137,Kim and Paul at 41,We chose this hotel as it had a very good rating with Trip Advisor and were not disappointed.  The hotel is located in a very good area for getting around central London and the service the staff provided was second to none.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone and we will definitely be staying there on our return trips to London.,5,2013,07,29
137,Excellent Experience at Hotel 41 in London,"My husband and I wanted to make sure that this hotel was recognized for its outstanding service and accommodations. There was literally nothing they would not try to do for us. We especially like the button on the phone that said 'anything, anytime' and that is exactly what they meant!  Would recommend this hotel to anyone, anytime !",5,2013,07,25
137,"Staff are 1st class - real gems - and beds, what more can you say...","Stayed here over the weekend as part of our visit for the London 2012 Anniversary race at the Olympic Stadium. The hotel is situated a very short walk from Victoria tube station and right across the road from the Mews at Buckingham Palace. As we entered my daughter said it’s a bit like Alice in Wonderland inside, it is truly magical.

As you can see from my profile we stay in hotels across the world, and I have been fortunate to stay in some great places, but this one from a staff perspective is the best, really interested in you, very well trained, ready smile, helpful, endearing, you could go on. Well done everyone from the cleaning staff upwards.

Upon arrival you are offered a complimentary glass of chilled champagne, and it is chilled, whilst you check in, and there are quality snacks always available on the house. As regards rooms, my wife wanted to take the bed home with her, real, real high end stuff. As regards the shower, which is my area of interest, the best, most powerful one I have ever experienced, just wow.

Location is great, we don’t mind walking, as a regular visitor to London, turn right out of the hotel and you can walk to Horse Guards Parade, Downing Street, etc in around 15 mins. On the Saturday night, we walked to Covent Garden in 30 mins. 

All in all, great place, fab staff, cannot praise it highly enough.",5,2013,07,25
137,Do not regret not staying here !!,"Wow wow wow !!
Got told about this hotel and it was even better in person , all the previous reviews I had read are absolutely spot on , all staff are exceptionally sincere , professional and take pride in their workplace. Comfortable , clean and yet again a perfect central location - only wish I had stayed here my whole trip !!
Will be back for sure and can't recommend highly enough
",5,2013,07,23
137,Great boutique hotel with fabulous service,"Believe the other reviews, on TA, the hotel is ideally situated right across from the Royal Mews and easy access to all of London.  But what really makes it great is the incredible staff and the service they provide.  Lauren and the rest of the staff are true gems, engaging in genuine conversation with the guests in the luxurious common room  and going out of their way to make our stay memorable.  I've been to London a few times but  this was the best ever thanks to the staff at Hotel 41.  Hats off to all of you.",5,2013,07,22
137,An Exquisite Charm,"We only stayed in London two nights, once on our travels to Paris and once on the way back home - had I known how lovely our stay would be at Hotel 41 I would have made arrangements to stay longer! The service was impeccable, the lodging and appointments uniquely British and extremely 5 star quality.  Malcolm arranged every detail of our stay, Stefan and the front desk staff welcomed us with champagne and Monica followed up to confirm that every aspect was perfect. I would thoroughly recommend this little charm to anyone visiting London for a first time or for the seasoned traveler looking for a lovely British property!",5,2013,07,22
137,Exceptional service to make you feel at home,"You feel welcome from the moment you walk through the door. As a business traveller, lots of little things help ease work stress.  These include the lounge which has complimentary, excellent quality food always available, canapes daily from 18.00  and a community fridge with bottles of water you are welcome to take on your way out. The tables in the lounge are spaced so you have privacy, where you can work somewhere other than your room.  I was there until 1am a couple of nights and someone periodically offered a hot drink.  All the staff based in the  lounge were thoughtful and offered exceptional service. Our room had a good sized desk and a stationary draw with items such as scissors, sticky tape, paper clips - handy.  And free WiFi throughout - a condition of any hotel I book.  We'll be back.",5,2013,07,19
137,outstanding,"This is opulent old school style, great room and facilities excellent service so many complimentary items like ice cream in hot weather not cheap but great value. This would be a very difficult place to fault beautiful setting just wonderful.",5,2013,07,19
137,Just about perfect... and there ain't no such thing as perfect!,"A combination of business and pleasure brought my party to London. I booked two rooms. From check-in to check-out the staff was, indeed, perfect. Invariably, on a seven-day stay, situation, requests, issues come up. The staff dealt with every one, solved every problems, secured every dinner reservation, arranged every transport, fulfilled every request with aplomb and courtesy and sincere ""at-your-service"" attitude. Stefan Otto and ALL of the floor staff, from reception to servers to doormen to maids... just unfailing service with a charming smile.  The facility is charming, polished and spotlessly clean... maybe the coolest boutique hotel setting in the West (Upper House in Hong Kong still gets best-boutique-hotel-in-the-world in my book). I loved the small size and warren of intimate  hallways. The reception area, not so much a lobby than a living room, is comfortable in the extreme. Tea, drinks, champagne, snacks, always available all the time.  Weary travelers after a long day? Come back, set down, have a Pimm's cocktail and the staff will lay before you a sublime array of finger foods, sweet or savory. Rooms are smallish but fully and wonderfully appointed and offered some surprises... such as... we're all familiar with towel warmers in bathrooms... how about the entire floor is heated... no cold marble on your feet. The location is excellent... just a block and a half from Victoria Station from which you can get anywhere. It is situated across the street from Buckingham Palace. Cleverly, the 41 is attached to its big sister (brother?) Rubens Hotel and relies effectively on them for certain services a smaller hotel would not typically offer. A pert-near-perfect place and wonderfully-enjoyable stay.",5,2013,07,18
137,"Treated like royalty, wonderful service, cool a/c","We stayed three nights at Hotel 41. Upon arrival we were greeted with two glasses of Champagne. We were actually given our choice of preferred Champagne. Service and checkin were flawless. It is hard to describe the ambiance at 41. We enjoyed the executive lounge with snacks, fresh bread, drinks available at all times. The hallways and rooms are very European with low ceilings, many mirrors, wood, nicely decorated. Very quaint. We enjoyed our conversations with Stefan Otto and our bellman Brogdan was very attentive and helpful. All the staff was wonderful. The only flaw of our stay was some problems with the main elevator. Normally this would have been a major issue, but the attentiveness of the staff and the accommodations made up for this big time. It is very easy to miss Hotel 41, many cab drivers do not know about it. We usually just told them Hotel Rubens, which is right next door on floors 1-4, the top floor of the building is Hotel 41. I would rate hotel 41 as excellent. We have stayed at four other hotels in London. This one stays out way on top of the list, nothing else came close. ",5,2013,07,17
137,We were made to feel like we were Royalty!,"If you aren’t careful, you may just miss this sweet little Gem of a Boutique Hotel, placed in a superb location ~ right across the street from the Queen’s ‘Mews’ (where Queen Lizzie stores her Royal Coaches, Bentleys, Rolls, and such.) When you drive up to 41 Buckingham Palace Rd, the more prominent façade of the sister ‘Red Carnation’ Hotel, ‘The Rubens’, sits immediately next door to the entrance of ‘Hotel 41’. Hotel 41 actually occupies the 5th floor of what used to be the Rubens Hotel Ball Room, but now holds 30 beautifully appointed rooms of this very special and classically British residence.

When my wife and I arrived at the 41, we were escorted to a stylish elevator lift, which took us to the reception desk located in the Executive Lounge on the 5th floor. We were greeted warmly by three tuxedoed staff who enthusiastically welcomed us, and immediately requested that we join them atop the roof of the hotel. We had our bags put in our room, and were then taken to several narrow flights that lead to a small door exiting to the roof of the ‘41’. We were then guided to a wrought iron ladder where we climbed up further to an upper level of the roof. There we found several ‘41’ staff, again in ‘Tails’, handing out Veuve Clicquot Champagne and excitedly sharing with us that we were about to see a once-a -year spectacle… the annual celebration of the Queen’s birthday ~ The Trooping The Colour. In just a few moments we were treated to the exhibition of the final ‘Fly-over’ of the Royal Air Force, including one Chinook and two Puma helicopters, three RAF Jets, an AWAC, an escorted C130, an escorted WWII Bomber, and a final set of nine RAFAT Hawk Jets spewing colorful Red White and Blue trails. What a way to start our visit to London!!

After making our way back to the Executive Lounge, we were again poured a second glass of Champagne, and asked if we had any special requests during our visit. I can sincerely say that we have rarely been so totally indulged by Hotel staff, each one so eager to assist and make sure that guests are comfortable and happy. I was especially appreciative of the young Hotel Manager, Lauren Hargrave, who clearly understands the art of Guest Relations. That said, her entire staff emulates her warmth and determined goal of client satisfaction.
I will note that the room we stayed in, located closest to the Executive Lounge, was shared with us to be the smallest room at the Hotel. (You may note that every room number starts with ‘41’.) However, while our room was on the ‘small’ side, it was nonetheless extremely comfortable, luxuriously appointed, and certainly not a ‘negative’ in our overall experience. As my wife will be coming back to London with our Daughter-in-Law in November, we were shown other rooms in the Hotel by Miss Hargrave for consideration of her return visit. In review, I would suggest that ‘Hotel 41’ is probably not suited for the traveler who demands grand and spacious rooms with expansive open space. But if one wishes a classic, luxurious, quaint, warm, and artistically appointed abode to reclaim that sense of being spoiled and indulged, then the ‘41’ is the perfect place to hang your hat! 

One final note… we found that while the ‘41’ is very close to the front gates of Buckingham Palace – and great for watching the ‘Changing of the Guard’ – it is a bit of a walk to other noted London sites. That would however be the case for wherever one would stay in London.  We enjoyed walking to most touristy areas, but the use of either the classic London Taxi’s or the London Buses is also easy and immediate to the Hotel. 

Hotel 41 is in my estimation, the one and only place we’ll ever stay while visiting the Queen! It was Grand indeed!",5,2013,07,16
137,Wonderful stay -- helpful staff,"We are already planning our next stay at Hotel 41.  From the moment we arrived after our overnight flight from the US, the staff was perfect.  From arranging for us to have a ""temporary"" room until our room was cleaned to offering us breakfast (we slept through the United Airline breakfast) -- our first day in London started much better than anticipated.  

The team was always willing to make restaurant suggestions (which were great) and helpful hints on things to see.  Our favorite part of the day was heading back ""home"" for tea and biscuits.  

We reserved an Executive King, which was bigger than we had expected.  Next time, we plan to upgrade to the suite.  After our stay, Hotel 41 is now in my wife's top 3 hotels in the world.",5,2013,07,16
137,One of the best places to stay!,I've been lucky to stay at Hotel 41 several times and every time has been wonderful. The hotel staff are incredibly service oriented and no ask is too small. The rooms are beautifully decorated. Location is great. Cannot say enough good things about this hotel!,5,2013,07,13
137,Perfectly Classic British,"Unfortunately we were only able to stay at this hotel one night and my husband and I both wished we were able to stay longer.  I really love small personal boutique hotels and 41 is just that - personal in every way.  First the hotel is in a great location - directly across the street from Buckingham Palace.  Upon arrival we were greeted with a lovely glass of champagne - what's better than that!!!  Our room was perfect - black and white decor with British prints on the wall, comfortable king size bed with soft linen, well appointed bathroom, plenty of storage space if you like to unpack - even with drawers in the bathroom, sofa and chair in the room, and the best - a fireplace!!!!  Our room was down the hall from the lounge - decorated like a beautiful sitting room.  Breakfast was served in the lounge with a wonderful buffet and the option for hot items.  The buffet included bread items, yogurt, fruit, cereals, cold fish, meat and cheese.  As if all this was not enough, the hotel lounge offers all day snacks and cold waters at no cost.  If you stay at 41 don't miss the chocolates in the green wrapper - delicious.  I can't wait to return to 41!!",5,2013,07,11
137,Amazing Ambiance and Service,"We spent three nights at Hotel 41 starting off the European portion of our honeymoon. Upon check-in, we decided to upgrade from an executive suite to their Conservatory suite, to get the maximum 41 experience. Although very pricy, the suite was amazing. We had a stay-three-pay-two package that offered a full English breakfast with all the trimmings.

Service at 41 was second to none! Lauren and her staff did, as other reviewers have stated, ""treated us like royalty"". 

We tried the optional Leopard bar champagne experience that was an amazing mix of food and champagne in a very romantic atmosphere with highly personalized service. Highly recommended!

One night after dinner, returning to our  room with ""relies"", we saw that we were ""romantically rosed"". WOW! We returned to find candles and roses throughout the two floor suite. Moving upstairs, we saw more candles, roses all over the bed, a bottle of chilled Laurent-Perrier champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. Even more surprises awaited in the bathroom, a hot bubble bath prepared, candles and roses everywhere. We couldn't wait for our ""relies"" to leave so we could enjoy the experience (if you know what I mean).

As the hotel does not have a fitness centre, we were welcomed at LA fitness, a short walk from the hotel.

After leaving 41, we spent three nights at the Dorchester, although historical, could not compare with Hotel 41.

Overall, a wonderful London experience! Want to return on an anniversary when we visit Britain again and want to stay in city centre London.",5,2013,07,11
137,Meets Expectations And More,"My wife and I recently spent five nights at Hotel 41 as part of an anniversary celebration.  We were excited to go because of the excellent reviews we read on TA.  I have to say this hotel provided an experience beyond what we could have conjured.

What makes this hotel distinct is the level of service provided to  the guests.  I cannot imagine you will experience anything better.  From check-in, with a glass of champagne of your choice, to check-out we were treated in royal fashion. Any problem or request was undertaken in a flash, often by more than one of the mangers.  Service in the Lounge was exemplary.  Let me give special thanks to managers Stefan and Monika for making our stay special.

We stayed in an Executive King room.  Although it was not large there were many appointments and conveniences. The room was very quiet even though the Victoria Station construction is underway just across the street. 

Any accolades for the hotel and its staff are well earned.  We will return on our next trip to London.  In fact, it may be worth a trip just to stay here again!",5,2013,07,10
137,Still an excellent hotel,Staff is working 24/7 to make your stay as pleasant as possible. 2 Nights in this hotel makes you want to come back for more. The staff thinks in solutions not in unanswered questions. As I said before this is a gem in London. We will be back.,5,2013,07,09
137,Can't wait to return!,"Lovely experience from beginning to end.  My daughter and I stayed at Hotel 41 only one night, sadly, but it was an exquisite end to two weeks in England and France.  I absolutely cannot wait to bring my husband back to this divine hotel.  Elegant, comfortable, well-appointed boutique hotel, and the staff could not be any more attentive and accomodating.  I have stayed in $10K per night rooms in Las Vegas hotels, and I have never experienced service and quality equal to Hotel 41.  This hotel makes the horrible 10 hour flight from the USA (even with rude flight attendants) worthwhile.  I'm plotting to get back to London at Christmas now.",5,2013,07,07
137,Congratulations on Hotel of the Year Award!,"Congratulations, Team 41 on your well-deserved Catey Award for Hotel of the Year. I read in the news that "" The Cateys"" are the hotel industry's version of The Oscars, so this is confirmation of your position at the very pinnacle of the business.  As regular monthly guests we always look forward to our visits and in a fortnight (our next one) we will be looking out for the Catey statue itself which we hope is on display in the Executive Lounge.  But most of all, we will look forward to congratulating the team in person.  Very well done, all of you.  See you  soon.  Celia",5,2013,07,07
137,We're coming back!,"My husband & I are eagerly awaiting our fourth stay at 41. We adore this elegant, comfortable & welcoming hotel. Each time we arrive back after an outing it feels as if we've arrived home.  All the staff are very attentive & showed great concern when my husband was unwell. They even welcomed visits & breakfasts dates with our London daughter. No better place to stay.",5,2013,07,03
137,Amazing hotel in London,"We just returned from our trip to London and had to share our amazing experience. From the time we checked in until check out, we were treated to the most wonderful service, professional and helpful staff,  and a luxurious, comfortable room at this hotel. The staff, who know you by name, are available at all times to help with reservations, recommendations, maps, tickets or whatever you could possibly need while in London. They went above and beyond to be helpful but never intrusive. We felt so at home while there. The location is ideal for walking everywhere as it is centrally located to all of London's main attractions and shopping.  Also walking distance to the tube. The little touches of his/her slippers, the candle lit in the bathroom at night, the warmed towels and the incredible breakfast and teas were such a delight!",5,2013,07,01
137,Like staying with family,"Beginning with the hallway-reception leading only to one lift, the well-appointed yet traditionally styled bedrooms, beautiful but small bathrooms, quirky location on the top floor of the Ruben and sound-padded yet creaky hallways, this hotel definitely does not fit into the usual 5-star experience offered by other chains.

I realised the issues for other reviewers when they complained about odd-shaped rooms, lack of view, small ground floor foyer, no pool or staff that were almost intrusive. I would say that Hotel 41 does not endeavour to be a high-rise luxury modern facility so commonly available.

Instead, their forte is in their staff and service. Champagne at check-in. Reception staff were guaranteed to be smiling and eager to offer recommendations for restaurants, shows or even shopping ideas; they made staff interactions a pleasure. The executive lounge staff appeared to be well aware of all their guests and would regularly engage us in conversation upon entry to the club-like space, yet left us to quietly enjoy a well-presented breakfast, cup of tea or glass of wine. The buffet was constantly stocked with complimentary snacks, sweets or canapes. They even have an ""honour"" bar facility.

Housekeeping were thorough and visited at least twice a day; they were extremely thoughtful with their in-room touches, which was appreciated. I used the commercial gym around the corner, compliments of the hotel. The hotel provided me towels, fruit and bottled water. Management bent backwards to make us comfortable during our visit.

They treat you like family. I enjoyed this stay a lot.",5,2013,06,30
137,Charming small hotel with great location,"My wife and I were on our 30th anniversary vacation. I found this hotel online and it had wonderful reviews. They were well deserved. The staff is attentive and professional. The central lobby/restaurant/lounge is staffed 24/7. There are very nice complimentary foods and beverages available all the time. At 2 am, the staff was able to solve a power adapter problem easily. They also pay attention to detail. We came into our very nice room one night to find candles and rose petals - so nice for a romantic honeymoon trip. They even had an anniversary cake and candle for us in the room one night. All in all a wonderfully attentive and romantic hotel. Even the location across from Buckingham palace was great. The great topper was the price of the hotel was lower than any of its similar level competitors.",5,2013,06,29
137,What a hotel - breathtaking!,"We stayed for a Christmas break - the third time we'd been to this hotel. It is a luxurious and indulgent experience from beginning to end. Spacious and stylish rooms, comfortable beds, large baths, fluffy towels and gowns, great food - what's not to like??

The staff are always on hand if needed and unfailingly helpful - nothing is too much trouble. Location is decent - fairly central and a short stroll from Victoria Station and the parks.

We'd asked for something 'Christmassy' when booking at were delighted to find mini mince pies, christmas chocs and crackers in our room. Little details and the personal touch make such a difference. They keep your preferences on file so you'll find your favourite drinks waiting for you on arrival.",5,2013,06,27
137,"Wonderful, exceptional hotel","We stayed here for our honeymoon and had an absolutely fantastic time. We were greeted with a lovely room decorated with roses and some petit fours, which was very much appreciated. The room itself was very cute, though I must admit it was a bit cramped for the price. The hotel itself is lovely, occupying a single floor atop another, slightly lesser quality sister hotel. Hotel 41 also has a very nice library where you take tea as well as delicious food and snacks. 

One thing that really struck us was how friendly the staff at 41 was. Every single staff member learned our names within the first day and many of them had long conversations with us during tea and such. It was an absolute pleasure and really gave the hotel a very warm feeling. It was absolutely perfect for a honeymoon. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2013,06,26
137,Simply the Best,"I stayed at the hotel for one night on 16/06/13 as a ""treat"" for my partners birthday. I chose it for the simple fact it was (at the time) rated No.1 on Tripadvisor. 

It is, without doubt, the BEST hotel I have ever stayed at. The place oozes quality the minute you walk through the door. The staff are just the best - on arrival our bags were taken to the room - and we were offered (and gratefully accepted) not one, but two glasses of champagne during check in. This included a brief talk advising us of the amenities in the Executive Lounge (the main reception and dining room) which included free snacks and soft drinks (the ""snacks"" included smoked salmon, an array of superb cheeses, fruit etc). There was even a freezer full of Hagen-Daz ice-cream.

The room was, like everything else in the hotel sheer class. Immaculate furnishings, huge comfortable bed and TWO showers in the en-suite.

We spent a late evening in the lounge having a drink and spoke with Lauren, the manageress and Jian - who was seconded to the hotel during his hotel management course. Both spent considerable time chatting and were the most friendly and interesting company. No hint whatsoever that this was ""part of the job"" but instead you were made to feel they were genuinely interested in what you had to say. An absolute joy and poles apart from the ""small talk"" most hotel employees offer (if indeed they converse at all)

We had breakfast in the morning in the lounge which was served on beautiful crockery and a teapot which included, rather quaintly, a tea strainer! Long time since I've had tea that didn't come in a teabag!

The breakfast was cooked to order and was first class. No luke warm buffet fayre here.

Perhaps the best indication I can give of the quality of this hotel is to say that I casually mentioned to the porter who carried our bags to the reception that when asked the purpose of our stay I mentioned it was my partners birthday. When offering us our second glass of champagne we were given numerous apologies that our room would be a few minutes in being ready (and I thought we were way too early to check in and would happily have left our cases and returned later)

When we opened the door to our room we were faced with a massive bouquet of roses with a ""happy birthday"" note from the staff - and a selection of gorgeous chocolates!!

What can you say.?

If this is now only no.3 on Tripadvisor - I couldn't begin to imagine what could be better.",5,2013,06,24
137,London visit,"This is and outstanding Hotel and terrific staff went out of their way to take care of my wife and I great location very nice rooms the library was great place to hang out and had access to a  computer would highly recommended to everyone Phil g Indianapolis, Indiana",5,2013,06,24
137,Lovely hotel; lovely service,"I just completed a week's stay at the hotel.  I chose it based on TripAdvisor reviews and its proximity to Victoria Station for access to the train to Glyndebourne.  I could not have picked a better choice.  Having read about the construction noise, I asked for a quiet room, which the staff provided.  From the interior, I heard nothing and slept well in the comfortable room.  All amenities were fine and on a par with excellent big city hotels.  But most importantly, the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful, which makes 41 rather unusual for a big city hotel.  I highly recommend it.",5,2013,06,24
137,Lovely small hotel,"I chose this hotel because of the reviews on trip advisor and I'm glad I did. The location was good being two minutes walk from Victoria, the staff were very attentive and the room was very cosy. We had breakfast and dinner at the hotel and both very good, my boyfriend was adamant that the eggs benedict were the best he had ever had. In the evening they have ""raid the larder"" where you can get loads of different nibbles to have with your per dinner drinks free of charge, everything from crisps and nuts to mini cottage pies and ice cream.
The staff allowed us to open a bottle of our own wine to have with our fabulous afternoon tea as we had recently returned from Italy and bought a couple of bottles back with us which we thought was very good. We also had a lovely full body massage in our room.
The little things like providing umbrellas and bottled water in the reception area were also nice touches.",5,2013,06,23
137,Attentive Service,"What I Liked Most 
Attentive service, the extra touches

What I Liked Least
The corridors are a maze and poorly signposted, power cuts

Stayed here for 3 bitterly cold February days.  After navigating 5 flights of stairs because of the power cuts (there was construction outside), we were welcomed in the library with a drink of our choice (not the usual take-it-or-leave-it fruit punch). Of course we could not go to our room because there was no power.  At least there were candles in the library.  The library is tastefully African-themed, where you get (excellent) breakfast, and where we also enjoyed afternoon tea (included).  The staff are friendly and welcoming without being intrusive.  Point to note though: the desk is by the door and when you walk in, there are frequently a number of staff and it feels like you're running the gauntlet when you walk in.  There should be a better place to put it.  We were a bit taken aback by being told we could have got a cheaper rate by phoning the hotel rather than booking via the website.

The rooms are also nicely decorated and ours at least, was a decent size with a Nespresso machine.  We came home the first night to find a bottle of champagne on ice for our wedding anniversary.

The corridors are rather difficult to navigate and the signage is hopeless.  In a similar vein, not even the London cabbie is familiar with Hotel 41 so ask for Reuben's Hotel, to which it is annexed.  These are minor quibbles, and it seems fair to assume the power cuts are rare.  We chose the place because of its then number one position in TripAdvisor, and we were not disappointed.",5,2013,06,21
137,Shhhhhhhhhhhh.,"Shhhhhhh, don't tell anyone: All the reviews are true. This is a truly fabulous hotel, the most attentive staff, delightful rooms and the most comfortable beds and all within meters of Buckingham Palace, but lets keep it secret ?",5,2013,06,20
137,Simply the best I've ever experienced.,"Unfortunately I only stayed here one night and how disappointed I was!! I wish I could have stayed a week at least! 

I arrived at Victoria station and was unsure which way to go so I rang the hotel for advice. They told me to wait where I was and promptly collected me! How fantastic! 

I immediately felt comfortable and welcome in the hotel, the check in was seamless, efficient and very warm. And the glass of champagne on arrival was most appreciated too! 

The rooms are beautiful, luxurious in every sense of the word and extremely comfortable. 

Now what makes this hotel stand out is the staff. They are exceptional and SO professional. You cannot possibly fault any of them! It is simply the best service I've ever encountered. 

The icing on the cake - I rang the hotel two days after my departure to ask if they could help me sort out some arrangements for my family (who are not even staying at the hotel) and they were only too happy to help!! 

An exquisite boutique hotel and I cannot wait to return!",5,2013,06,20
137,"Hidden jewel with exceptional service, the 5 star Hotel 41 exceeded our expectations.","We just returned from a week stay in London with our family.  We traveled with our two boys ages 17 and 13, my wife's parents and my mother.  We had 4 rooms for the family for the week.  The rooms were all very comfortable and charming, and the Executive Lounge was a great place to meet.  The service was extraordinary and the staff made everyone feel at home.  The resident manager Lauren was exceptional, and we felt like Remis, Stafan, and Monika were part of our family.

We enjoyed the breakfast every morning, and it was great coming back for tea and cocktails later each day.  The food service was outstanding and the restaurant at the adjoining hotel (the Bbar) was fabulous.

Although the hotel does not have a fitness center, they have full health club privileges at the LA Fitness just around the corner, which we used regularly. 

We were celebrating birthdays, our anniversary, and our son's graduation, and we couldn't have picked a better hotel for the experience.  Every small detail was attended to, and they even surprised us with a cake and flowers one night in our room.

We all agreed that this was one of the best run hotels that we have ever stayed at, and the owners and operators (the Tollman Family) should be very proud of this property and its staff.

We will definitely make a return trip to see our friends at Hotel 41 soon!",5,2013,06,16
137,Outstanding as always,"We have just spent our second wedding anniversary in a row at the 41. From the moment we were immediatly recognised and spoilt. This place is about personal service and personal touches. Complimentary fine champage whilst you check in sitting down in a comfortable fat leather chair.

We asked for the same executive room as last year which was done with no hassle at all and after enjoying an afternoon and early evening in London we returned to the executive lounge to enjoy wonderful complementry canapes and snacks finsihed of with hagan das icecream!

The Hotel team had arranged a suprise beautiful turn down service in the bedroom with rose petals on the bed and through out the room, candles and romantic music (michael Buble)  - just wonderful.

The late breakfast the next day was truly amazing, I thoroughly reccomend the Eggs Royal, superb. It was the trooping of the colour the weekend and the icing on the cake was when Monica (the assistant manager) arranged for the guests to watch the fly over of RAF jets over Buckingham Palace from the 41 roof top - what a view, the Red Arrows, Lancaster bomber, it was incredible. All viewed again with a complimentary glass of champage.

The team here are amazing, and Im sorry I cant remember everyones names, but look at for Stefan on arrival  - top fellow, Monica the assistant Manager also a true star.

This place is about personal touches and the 41 team certanly deliver on this. It was raining as we checked out - we were handed a top 41 brolley and we explained we were checking out and wouldnt be back to return the brolley to be advised dont worry about - keep the brolley (only for my wife to then accidently leave it on the train - she was gutted!). Granted its not cheap but well worth saving up for a special occasion.",5,2013,06,15
137,Wow! We can't wait to go back!,"The best hotel experience ever! Prior expensive London stays elsewhere have been hit and miss. 41 was worth every penny! Brilliantly clean, delightfully comfortable, decadently luxurious! Amazingly, the staff were ALL helpful and friendly. They made it their business to anticipate our needs and then some! They booked tickets to WICKED for us and before we even went to the theatre, there was an autographed poster from the show on our bed! When we got back from the show, there were candles and rosepetals arranged all over the room! The guest lounge has a superb honour bar, delicious nibblies. These people put the boutique in boutique hotel!! If you want to spoil yourself for a night or a week in London, this is the place to do it!",5,2013,06,09
137,Incomparable service,"We have stayed at several 5 stars however, ""41"" was unique in a couple of respects.  First and foremost, the staff. The entire staff was supremely attentive.  How they all seemed to know our names from day one is a mystery.   They made us feel very special and volunteered to attend to details so that we could just enjoy the vacation. Like having your own personal staff.  Second, the ""boutique"" facility.  Loved it. Comfortable and classy with special touches like heated towel rods.  And everything that we wanted was right there just a few steps away.  Definitely like the small, boutique setup.  We will be back!!!",5,2013,06,08
137,Exceptional stay for our anniversary,"This was one of the best if not the best hotel we have ever stayed at. The staff, room, service, amenities were amazing. The staff was exceptionally attentive, helpful, and engaging. Very luxurious rooms and clean bathrooms, great location. The executive lounge well stocked with foods throughout the day and night and very pleasant to relax in. We were on a three week trip through Europe for our 30th anniversary, the staff made our first night special with extra attention, our stay at Hotel 41 was by far our best hotel experience in Europe.",5,2013,06,07
137,Excellent Venue & Staff,"Most enjoyable trip. This hotel is a hidden Gem! Staff was beyond excellent, rooms were excellent. Lounge was convenient and cozy. Again the staff went above and beyond to make you feel welcomed, and important.",5,2013,06,07
137,Unforgettable weekend,"I am lucky to have just spent the weekend at this fantastic hotel. From the moment we walked in to a champagne meet & greet, the whole experience was completely customer focused. 
The staff cannot do enough for you, the surroundings are stylish, and you do not feel anonymous at all. I could go on and on but suffice to say we will be back, especially as the other half proposed to me with lots of secret help from the staff! Thank you Hotel 41! ",5,2013,06,06
137,Have they paid for the No 1 spot???,"This hotel basically consists of the top floor of the Ruben´s hotel, located right next door. They have tried to create a clubby atmosphere by setting up an executive lounge that is the center of the ""hotel"", where you eat and drink 24 hrs. This is quite cozy. The rooms are well-designed and the bathrooms are ok, if  somewhat aged. The TV, hidden away in a cabinet is too small to view, and looks like it was acquired in the end of the nineties. Further on the downside, there is no gym, spa or pool. Now, considering those downsides and the price of 410 pounds per night that I paid you would expect excellent service. I did not get that. The room I got faced a construction site (they have demolished the next block and are rebuilding it) where they were drilling at one o´clock in the morning. I asked for advice of a restaurant in a specific area of town and the only restaurant that the person I spoke to could think about was a Godforsaken Italian called Petrocchi, with pink interior, bad food and no other guests. On the day that I was supposed to check out I called ahead 2 hours and ask that they bring down my bags and check me out so that I could make a touch-and-go exit. Upon arriving (in a rush to the airport) the bags were still in my room and no check out made. This was somewhat inconvenient since it is forbidden to stop with a car outside the hotel... 24 hours later I still had not got the promised email with the final bill. This hotel is so-so, and I cannot for my life understand how they managed to get the number one spot. Have they managed to attract only first-time travelers or have they written the reviews themselves?",3,2013,06,06
137,Best kept secret in London!,"First-class hotel - second to none!  From arrival to departure, I cannot find any criticism with Hotel 41 whatsoever.  The staff were extremely attentive, polite and engaging.  Hotel 41 is immaculately clean and very pleasing to the eye.  Superb location too.  Well done hotel 41!",5,2013,06,06
137,all we hoped,"The service from the very start was excellent.I emailed the hotel before arrival to say our flight arrived at 6.30am and we would like to store our bags and if possible have assess to a shower.We arrived to have a room available and a cup of tea served in this room.We were also informed we could use the room for as long as we liked and later our bags would be moved to another room,which was a free upgrade,WOW ! The upgraded room was larger,had a seperate shower and bath ,and a study area.It was lovely.Thoughout our stay wr would come back to our room to find olives,chocolates,and one evening slices of cake with happy anniversary written on the plate.
The location of this hotel is wonderful.Short walk to Victoria Station and all the major sights walking distance.There are plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby.We made use of the lounge area one afternoon for drinks and were served free canapes as well.
If I am to look for anything negative,hard to do ,there is some noise in the room such as people moving around but it is not a big issue.
The execellent service continued with staff making bookings for us and providing information for us on our future travels.
Love this place.It was everything we hoped",5,2013,06,05
137,Hotel 41 Staff is Extraordinary!,"Great location, lovely boutique, great location and the real guest winner is an extraordinary staff who makes each guest feel like they are at home with a full and happy service staff.  Impressive crew. Congratulations Hotel 41 staff!",5,2013,06,03
137,Service service service,"Spent our last two nights here before flying home to Australia, and wow what an experience, we felt like royalty. We arrived to be greeted by the doormen who arranged to park the car. We were then taken upstairs to the check in lounge, wow, choice of 4 kinds of champagne's while we checked in. Then we were shown to our rooms first being our other travel companions, their room was huge with fireplace, huge bed, huge bath, separate shower. Then we were shown to our room, well it was tiny, had to shimmy round the bed, it felt quite claustrophobic in comparison. We complained to staff as we'd paid the same price we'd expected the same as theirs. They said they'd see what they could do, we went for a walk out and on arriving back was given a new room, wow that was much better. The staff really make the place, we were going out for the evening and hubby's shoe lace snapped, I rang through to Remus asking where I could get some laces, within minutes he was at our room and took the shoes and got them re laced and polished. The drinks and  canopes in the evening have a huge variety. On returning to the room that evening we had candles in room and bathroom, rose petals every where and a long stem rose on the bed with soft music playing, very nice touch. We had breakfast on both mornings and for the price I'd say it was more than adequate and very tasty and hot. Yes the hotel is in the higher price range but in comparison to others of similar price, I don't think you'd get that personal touch anywhere else. On check out they arranged for our extra cases to be bought from the car to our room and arranged a car to take us to the airport. Thank you all especially Remus for your wonderful welcome. You will definitely be our first choice should we visit London again.",4,2013,06,03
137,Best hotel experience ever,"If it was possible to give a 10 star rating, I would.  I first heard of this hotel on Trip Advisor and decided to give it a try, and am very glad I did.  From the moment we arrived, the staff went out of their way to make us feel at home, and for 8 days, when going back to the hotel, we did refer to it as ""going home.""  As mentioned in other reviews, the rooms are nice and very comfortable.  The turn down service, with the rose petals and lit candles, was unlike any we've ever seen. The Executive Lounge, which is really the only public space in the hotel, served as the reception area, dining area, bar, and general gathering spot.  The staff quickly got to know our likes, dislikes, and my many quirks. Speaking of the staff, they are what make this place stand out among other fine hotels.  Stef was a fun guy to talk to and Remus provided us with some good suggestions for dinner. Lauren, Nicole, Magda, and Monica were very helpful in taking care of anything we needed.  And, I have to make special mention of Alexandra and Sarah, whose tolerance of my sense of humor went above and beyond the call of duty.  I can highly recommend Hotel 41 as ""the place"" to stay in London.   Rick",5,2013,05,31
137,Splendid!,"I have opportunity to stay at many top chain hotels for business trips, the Ritz Carlton, Shangri-la,  Splendid etc., but for vacation, I always prefer a boutique hotel.   Hotel 41 in London is a perfect match for what I want in a large cosmo city.  Close, walking distance to all major attractions, including museums, the Buckingham Palace, Victoria train station and of course, no vacation is complete without a good session of retail therapy.  Harrod's is only 15-20 minutes walk from the hotel (or 6-7 pounds by taxi).

Our flight arrived early in the morning.  We waited about an hour while the room being prepared and the hotel staff checked us in early, before noon.  No problem.  

Breakfasts are superb!  Begium waffles are a MUST have.  Eggs Royal are stacked up high with smoked salmon and poached egg will keep you full all day.  Excellent fresh fruit selection too.  
Forget about lunch, you won't need one after a hearty breakfast at Hotel 41!   Then comes Happy Hour with complimentary snacks in late afternoon.  Then...late evening, 8:30pm to about midnight, ""plunder the pantry"", is another round of complimentary snacks and hors d'oeuvres.   Water bottles and fresh apples in the hotel lobby, are a nice touch.   By the way, drinks at Hotel 41 are not cheap but rather on par with its hotel peers.    

Hotel 41 room is relatively small compared to the chain hotels, Ritz, Hyatt, Sofitel, etc. but is well compensated by it's good amenities and VERY good shower stall with strong water pressure and clean, white, plush towels! 

Most memorable moment at Hotel 41:  a beautiful surprise -  a bottle of Sancerre, ice-chilled awaited us in our room (post shopping).  Thanks Remus, for making our mother-daughter trip in London most wonderful!  Gestures as professional as yours certainly make a good travel story and gives us bragging rights of having stayed in a nice place like Hotel 41 and meeting nice people too. 

We also appreciate the warm welcome by all other staff at the hotel. You pampered us well!",5,2013,05,30
137,"Relaxed, luxurious stay","My wife and I just spent 9 days at 41 on an extended pleasure trip to London. Room was great-quiet (upholstered walls in hall keep noise to a minimum); lovely linens,room was large and  immaculately cleaned and refreshed twice a day. Every detail addressed right down to heated floor in bath.

But what puts 41 over the top is uniformly cheerful, friendly staff. Knew us by name in 2 hours, new our preferences for food, drink and activities by Day 2.  More like staying at a small, private club than a hotel. Definitely a personal twist on the 5 star experience.",5,2013,05,30
137,WoW what a hotel,"My girlfriend took me here in December for a birthday treat what an experience it was as soon as we pulled up we had our car door opened shown in with our bags taken from us then led to the lobby were we was offered different types of champagne. We was shown around the lobby were you can help yourself to the Hagen Daz ice cream, spirits, and different food or you can just chill out by the fire when we went to our room which was upgraded to a split level room I had a nice birthday card waiting for me with some little chocolate treats from the staff which was lovely. The room was so nice and spotless you even had a pillow menu with over ten different pillow types to help you sleep I thought was a nice touch. The beds are a good size with quality clean bedding and pillows real luxury, anything you want for room service was no problem at all we went out for dinner in the petrus which was equally as good and when we come back the room was dimmed with romantic music playing with real rosé petals all over the room leading up the stairs with chocolate covered strawberries on a plate a big rosé and candles in the bathroom such a nice touch from the staff we didn't even ask for it they was so friendly. We had breakfast the next morning I had eggs benedict and my partner had a full English both was spot on really nice food and waiters I really couldn't fault the place it's the best hotel I've ever been too I felt like a king well done.",5,2013,05,28
137,Overpriced and noisy,"I stayed at the 41 recently after seeing some good reviews here. I don't know what these people are thinking. The room was tiny. There is no lobby, you use a key card or someone has to buzz you in then you take the elevator to the 5th floor which is where everything is. Rooms, front desk, restaurant, etc. People hover all over you. I had a bowl of cereal for breakfast and the charge was £20. I was woken up at least 5 times each night as you can hear literally every noise and person walking by in the hallway. I thought I was getting a luxury hotel and instead got an overpriced crappy room with generally nice people who hover over you constantly eliminating all privacy.",1,2013,05,28
137,Fantastic Relaxing Break - Great Service,"This is the second time I have stayed at Hotel 41 in the last year and having enjoyed both visits immensely I am compelled to write a review.  The staff were extremely welcoming and upon checking in we were treated to some champagne and spent a good few hours relaxing in the executive lounge. The set up in the lounge is great with a large supply of complimentary snacks as well an extremely well stocked bar. The service was excellent and my wife and I were particularly well entertained by a charming South African gentleman who had the perfect balance of good service and amusing banter. The other staff were also excellent, in particular the Resident Manager who looked after us very well. If good service is your thing then Hotel 41 is the place to go....and I have not even got onto the room or the food yet! The room was a very large double room with a huge comfy bed and a very large bathroom. Because the lounge was so good we did not spent that much time in room though. The food was excellent, we had afternoon tea, and later some hot snacks - all of which were perfectly cooked and well presented.",5,2013,05,28
137,Outstanding service,Hotel 41 may have the best service that I have encountered at any hotel. Certainly the best outside of the Far East. As well it combines great service with an atmosphere that is not stuffy or formal. The rooms are not grand but certainly adequate.,5,2013,05,27
137,"""Disgraceful!""","Now I have grabbed your attention, the title of my review refers to all hotels I have stayed at previousley (excluding all red carnation group hotels, lily beach Maldives and sensortori Tenerife) as they really need to spend some time in this hotels company, to see how its really done! Like others have said before me regarding this hotel, there really is not much i can add to tell people how exceptionally good this hotel is. From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel so welcome, and nothing was a problem. We absolutley loved the whatever, whenever button on the phone, but this was truly the tip of the ice berg in terms of what this amazing hotel offers its guests. Special thanks go to Remus for his help with an issue at helen darozze (Remus: we have been offered a VIP lunch, so will be booking with you again soon) and Steph, with his historic anicdotes!.... he will know what i mean, but this is not to say that all the staff we had the pleasure to deal were so incredibly helpful and knowledgable, so apologies to those whose names i cannot remember. Please please please read this review, and book, as you will enjoy great rooms, great service, and a hotel that will leave you feeling (like us) that you just dont want to leave! It really is no coincidence that this place is the number 1 hotel in London. No question.... we will be back.",5,2013,05,27
137,Wow,Excellent hotel in all areas and highly recommend staying here. The rooms where excellent and the beds very comfortable. The location is perfect and ideal for all the major attraction in London and staff are brilliant and always there to help you in anyway.,5,2013,05,27
137,Attentive Service,"We came here having researched hotels close to Buckingham Palace where we were lucky to have been invited to the royal garden party. The hotel is very close to the Palace indeed. Just a few minutes walk and we were there. It has the atmosphere of a private gentleman's club but in a very good way. The hotel occupies just one floor. Our room, an executive king room, was not the hugest that we have stayed in but it was very comfortable and had all necessary amenities. The best things about the hotel are the executive lounge where drinks, snacks and breakfast are served and the staff themselves. The staff are very attentive and make the effort to address you by name. Nothing was too much trouble. We would definitely return.",5,2013,05,24
137,Excellent well recommended fellow reviewers,We stayed at the 41 last night and were not let down by fellow trip advisor reviewers.  It truly is an excellent hotel with friendly staff and flawless service amongst the best we have found anywhere.  From the warm welcome and refreshing champagne to the professional check out we were very impressed.  A slight glitch caused by a fellow guest which was outside the control of the hotel was handeled swifty and the resolution was by far in excess of expectations. Although we were not actually in Buckingham Palace we felt as though we were treated like royalty. We will not be strangers hotel 41 see you soon.,5,2013,05,22
137,A brightly sparkling jewel.,"Hotel 41 will always be our hotel whenever we visit London.The rooms are large & beautifully appointed  ~ just 2 blocks from Victoria Station tube. I am hard pressed to think of any hotel with as over- the -top phenomenal service as this jewel. The staff was amazingly welcoming, helpful, & charming...allowing us to feel at home each & every day by remembering our names, inquiring about our day, asking about our needs, providing wonderful complimentary snacks every afternoon & evening. The staff just couldn't do enough for you...they truly had your interest at heart. The breakfast was great and the setting of the lovely lounge where it was served made you want to stay all day. We would refer to returning to 41 at the end of a busy day as ""going home"".",5,2013,05,22
137,"Everything you could ask for for a ""reasonable"" price","The 41 is a top notch hotel.  I've been fortunate to stay in some wonderful hotels including several Ritz-Carltons, the Ritz Paris and a Sangri-La.  This hotel does not dissapoint in any way.  And, though not cheap, was less expensive than the competition.  

The room was large for London and beautifully decorated.  The staff was overwhelmingly helpful, courteous and friendly.  They made us feel important and appreciated.  

The breakfast was great.  I didn't have any of the complimentary food in the evening, but my wife did and enjoyed it.  Complimentary bottled water day or night was nice, too.

The location is great. (How could it not be across the street from Buckingham Palace)  It was less than a 5 minute walk to trains or underground at Victoria Station.

I would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,05,20
137,Wonderful Find!,"The 41 far surpasses any expectations I had for a stay in London. Based on the reviews, I expected to have a great stay, but it was still better than I could have imagined. the staff was so very accommodating, they offered us complimentary beverages upon arrival at the front desk, then another offer of complimentary Champaign upon check in. After they personally escorted us to our room, we walked in to find a personal greeting card and handmade candies on the table inside the room. Also on the table was a beautiful white orchid plant (what a nice touch!) The room had a fire place as well, and when we called the front desk to have it turned on the staff was to our room and had it turned on within five minutes of calling. The 'Executive Lounge' is quite nice as well. Complete with a mini bar and snack bar offering neatly wrapped goodies and even Hagen Daaz ice cream cups, lovely! The entire place is also very well decorated, it had a dark woods, black/white theme which is very elegant while also being warm and comfortable. Overall a wonderful experience! Will be staying here again!",5,2013,05,18
137,Fantastic Stay!,"My mother and I stayed at the Hotel 41 on our recent trip to London.  The hotel was beautiful, had a fantastic location near Buckingham Palace, and the room was unbelievable.  Having never been to London before, the staff graciously directed us to amazing attractions and restaurants.  The staff and service they provided definitely made our trip, they were the best ever!",5,2013,05,16
137,Rare find,"This is an extraordinary property and well executed in all aspects, but by far the chief appeal is the tremendous staff associated with the hotel.  Without exception, this special oasis is populated with A+ team members clearly handpicked with an eye for authentic personal passion for the hospitality trade.",5,2013,05,13
137,Hotel41...where!,"Stayed for a night with my wife as it was near the show we were going to. Taxi driver had no idea where it was which is part of the dark mystery of the hotel according to the concierge. It's stuck between Reuben's 43 and a bar. Entered the building and spent 10 mins waiting with an overly enthusiastic welcome committee, the hotel only has 28 rooms all on the 5th floor, we were escorted to floor 5 with staff falling over themselves to greet us.

Don't get me wrong, the decor is good and if small is what you like then this is the place for you, as there are only 28 rooms, you seem to always have way too many staff asking if all is well and bothering you, on more than one occasion I was in deep conversation with my wife when a body or two just appeared next to us! Standing there awaiting an invite to join a conversation which they weren't included in. Really really really annoying, time after time. 

Ordered a club sandwich on return from theatre and on reviewing the bill on check out discovered it was £32, for a damn sandwich with chicken, bacon, loads of lettuce and a bit of tomato.

They advise the free things (Haagen Dazs) and you'd think that tea and coffee would be part of this, you'd be wrong, there are a few things included in the price but the things you normally would have cost an arm and a leg, £13 for a tea and coffee, you don't realise that until checkout as the first one is on the house!!!

Sheet under the duvet and the duvet cover itself have been left in starch since the Crimean war, the tv failed to work properly and the shower is designed for hobbits.

I was lying on the bed with my wife chatting when the door opened and the head of housekeeping just came into the room, couldn't believe what I was seeing, rather than just leaving with the humblest of apologies he thought it prudent to introduce himself and repeat over and over again why he was there, he almost left through the window.

Would we return..NO!",3,2013,05,10
137,Service with style,"My Husband & I stayed here for one night whilst in London. Our room was lovely, well equipped, clean and quietly located. Wonderful service experienced during our stay.. Complimentary chocolates and champagne as it was our anniversary as well as going the extra mile with restaurant bookings and just a special kind of service which ft natural not forced as in other establishments. Location fantastic, breakfast divine... All in all wonderful!",5,2013,05,09
137,impeccable service,"In the shadows of Buckingham Palace, Hotel 41 is a little oasis of charm with outstanding service from the excellent staff. Although a small hotel, the welcome and attention to detail was simply first class. Our family room was well appointed and had many little luxuries, like free bottles of still and sparkling water, chocolates and toffees, and even free tubs of ice cream for the children, which was a massive hit with them! Only yards from both victoria station, the big bus site seeing tour and buckingham palace, it is a fantastic venue to explore central london. We strolled up the Mall to Trafalgar Square, and enjoyed some walks through St James Park and Green Park, which are both minutes from the hotel. The executive lounge was lavishly appointed and the breakfast's were comprehensive. All of the staff were so helpful, even remembering our children's names when we returned from a day out! This hotel was a massive hit for us. However, it you want a gym/pool or car parking, I would advise you to stay elsewhere. We shall return!",5,2013,05,07
137,Best of the Best!  We Miss Hotel 41!,"There are not enough words to describe how wonderful Hotel 41 is.  We stayed for 7 nights, and would have loved to stay more!  The staff are amazing!  Everyone is extremely friendly, and they are very eager to help make your stay comfortable and memorable.  I really cannot say enough about the friendliness of the staff.  They were always asking where we were going for the day and if there was anything we needed for our day out (there is bottled water, coffee, treats, and umbrellas at the front door of the hotel).  When we returned, they asked all about our day.  We were always greeted with a smile and kind words.  This is truly a genuinely great group of people!
     The location is fantastic.  We were able to walk anywhere we wanted to go.  All of the major sights of London are within walking distance.  It is also just a short walk (maybe 3 or 4 minutes) to Victoria station if you want to take the tube.  There are great restaurants and pubs right in the area as well.
     The rooms are beautiful.  They are definitely not your typical European rooms.  We had a king room with a fireplace.  The room was spacious, clean, and comfortable.  We felt at home from the moment we arrived.  The bathroom was large with a shower and a separate bathtub with a shower.  It was spotless!  There was fresh fruit and olives placed in the room everyday along with bottled water.  When we got to our room the first night, there was a plate of cheesecake and fruit that said ""Happy Anniversary"" on it.  What a thoughtful, nice touch.  The hotel has really thought of everything to help make your stay wonderful.  There is nightly turndown service complete with a weather forecast for the following day and a special treat.  There are so many nice surprises every time you come into the room.    
     The Executive Lounge is a great place to wind down after a busy day.  It is beautifully decorated and so serene.  The pantry is such a great treat!  It is fully stocked with meats, cheeses, fruit, desserts, and ice cream.  It is also a great place to talk to the staff and get ideas of things to do and see.  They can also give you tips on shows to see and places to eat / drink.  We really enjoyed spending time in the Executive Lounge.   
     If you are looking for a safe, comfortable, truly incredible experience while staying in London, you have got to stay at Hotel 41.  We will be recommending this hotel to friends and family!",5,2013,05,06
137,Royal treatment next door to Buckingham Palace,"The charm of this 29 room hotel is set from the moment the door is opened and you are escorted to the check-in/reception on the 5th floor.  The staff is attentive, respectful and available to assist, as needed.  The room was bright, well appointed and housekeeping as attentive with impeccably cleaned rooms and they also employ ""green initiatives"" in reference to linen changes.  It has a great location with easy access to all we needed in London and we will return again and again.  Their food and beverage service is well planned and executed and will tailor to your needs.  If you travel to London, do not overlook this gem.  You will be happy you didn't!",5,2013,04,30
137,A Secret Gem - Hotel 41,Old World Charm complimented by courteous service makes Hotel 41 one of the best hotels I've visited. Every staff member is helpful and whatever you need they will fulfill that comfort. Amenities are 5-star.,5,2013,04,29
137,Fabulous.,"We were in London for the Marathon and Hotel 41 made our stay unforgettable. They were very attentive in all aspects. The staff signed a card to cheer my husband on before the event. After they had a bouquet of roses in our room. They all took an interest in how he had done. The service was really the best we've had at a hotel. The rooms were well appointed, the bathroom had a separate shower & bathtub wt shower. Good water pressure! Turndown service too. The lounge was beautiful and they provided many complimentary snacks all day, scones, in he evening the pantry was stocked wt cheeses, breads, meats, ice cream and desserts. It was very appreciated and great quality. What we had off the menu was very good too. Location was very handy with the tube just a 2 minute walk away and would get you anywhere. Don't hesitate you will enjoy your stay. Thanks for everything Hotel 41! ",5,2013,04,29
137,A Thing of Beauty...,"Hotel 41 can best be described as the secret, luxury, top floor of the Reuben’s Hotel - the lift only goes from ground to fifth floor. We chose it for its proximity to the London Marathon finish and, boy, are we glad we did.
Service is 5 star in that lovely 'you don’t know they are there' way; demeanour is chatty, almost gossipy, again in a good way. When they found out my girlfriend was running the marathon, a good luck card appeared signed by all the girls (I never saw any male staff during our 4 day stay). On finishing the race she found a 'congratulations' cake in the room and when we returned to it late that night rose petals and candles were everywhere. Unexpected, lovely, little flourishes cooked up, I have no doubt, by the girls themselves.
This is the most romantic hotel I've stayed in apart from the Pestana Palace in Lisbon, and that is a Portuguese national monument. Well, you know what, Hotel 41 is a national monument too, albeit English, and it's charming, wonderfully thoughtful staff are national treasures...",5,2013,04,26
137,I won't stay anywhere else!,"My BFF and I stayed here for her birthday.  Thank you to Lauren, Laura and especially Remus!  The service was exceptional!  We loved the ability to plunder the pantry and sharing our adventure with the staff.  Overall everyone was helpful, charming and catered to all our needs.",5,2013,04,25
137,"A Perfect P,ace To Stay","My husband and and I just spent a few days in London and we were very impressed by not only the amazing location of Hotel 41, but also with the comfort of the bed, the amenities offered and the most courteous and helpful staff you can imagine.  There was not one thing that we asked for that we did not receive immediately and with a smile on their faces.  The rooms are not huge, but that was not something either of us felt bothered us, we would recommend Hotel 41 to anyone who would like to go to London...it was great!",5,2013,04,23
137,Excellent Stay,We had an excellent stay at the Hotel 41. We were there the previous year and loved the hotel so much we came back. This time was perfect too. Monica made our stay perfect both times from start to finish. I had requested dinner reservations prior to our stay and she took care of everything.,5,2013,04,22
137,Romance all the way,"My partner and I spent two night last week end at 41 and I booked the romantic package. It was amazing all the way. We had a duplex suite where each can have some privacy. I recommend this choice since the regular rooms are a bit small and sitting in front of the fireplace, drinking a glass of Champagne was part of the pleasure.   The staff did not spare any efforts to make us feel home and all was done in a very professional and attentive way. Their advice for restaurants at night was very much what we were looking for.  In summary, a very memorable stay and we will definitively be back",5,2013,04,22
137,What more could you want?,"There is a reason that this hotel is ranked so highly on these review websites. I will keep this one short. I have stayed in some incredible hotels, but nothing quite like hotel 41. While the staff, rooms, services, location etc are all beyond what anyone could expect, it is the atmosphere that really did it for me. The two nights that my partner and I stayed there seem like a dream. Sooo so good. I will be back!!",5,2013,04,21
137,"No request too large, no detail too small","This must be the philosophie of the Hotel, this becomes evident during your stay. What a warm welcome by the charming hosts at the welcome desk, which is located in the cozy library/lounge. You feel like entering in some ones private home, which obviously is decorated in an exclusive style. The staterooms are in black and white, which gives it a contemporary touch. I enjoyed having a bathtub as well as a seperate rainfall shower, what a treat. The fluffy towels and the 100ml Penhaligon's bath and shower amenities add to the luxury. One does want to spend the full day in bed, made by Savoir and dressed with finest crisp linnen, what a feeling. I enjoyed sitting in the library close the fireplace having a drink and a barsnack, which is available around the clock. Breakfast ist partly served from a nice buffet, all warm dishes individually prepared at the guests order. The best of all are the staff. Well trained with outstanding manners, anticipating your needs. I had forgotten my hairbrush and was in London for an important meeting. I called the ""what ever, when ever"" button on the phone and explained my situation. 15 minutes later, i had a round hairbrush in my room, they specially went out to buy one for me and guess what, it was a complimentary service from the house. If you look for personalized services in a luxurious Environment, the 41 is the right place.",5,2013,04,21
137,If you want to be treated like royalty stay at 41 hotel.,41 hotel was the most amazing experience I have ever encountered on vacation.  The service was superb and the staff were attentive to your needs.  This is the only hotel that I want to stay in.  My friends and I were treated as royalty from the time we stepped foot out of our taxi.  Thanks to all the wonderful staff at 41 hotel.,5,2013,04,20
137,"The quality of service, attention to detail and luxury that EVERY hotel should aspire to!","I won't repeat the well deserved superlatives that Hotel 41 warrants, but our return visit proved that our findings on our first stay were far from a fluke! The staff are just as attentive, charming, genuinely friendly and live to ensure that you enjoy your stay. It's not difficult to revel in the luxuriance of this top quality hotel and nothing is too much trouble for every member of the young and professional staff headed by Lauren. The hotel is ideally situated. We found a lovely gem of a find around the corner from Hotel 41, The Westminster Cathedral, which, apart from being an impressively ornate Victorian Catholic cathedral, has a tower with awesome views across the London skyline in all directions. Save yourself £24 (I understand its £29 at The Shard)  and spend £5 for an elevator ride to the top of the tower. (It is not, however suitable for those with mobility problems) I understand too that some overseas guests have problems with Taxi drivers finding this exclusive hotel, just say ""Hotel 41, Buckingham Palace Road, opposite The Royal Mews, to the right of The Rubens Hotel"" and you shouldn't have a problem! 

The hotel team try extremely hard to make you feel special and to anticipate your every desire. Remus, one of the assistant manager's, remembers what your breakfast preferences are and is obviously headed for greater things in the hotel industry. He was a charming, immaculate young chap and carried himself with a bearing and assurance which belied his youth. Gian too spoiled my wife with extra sweets from ""the pantry"" and even delivered them to our room, which was the style of kindness that we had come to expect. Our all-time favourite though remains the delightfully elegant Monika, whose eyes are continually scanning for ways to put the ""Red Carnation"" concept of how to go that extra-mile-to-please-the-guest, into action. We have never met a more charming, self effacing member of any hotel staff and she is a marvellous asset to the hotel, and she, quite rightly, shows great enthusiasm for the organisation for which she works. It's worth mentioning that other sister hotels within the same chain also feature very highly on TA so obviously Malcolm Hendry and his diligent staff have to maintain their impeccable standards to remain on top of the pile. Our only hope is that 41 doesn't become so popular that we won't be able to book in the future! Book early, book now and treat yourself, you deserve to enjoy Hotel 41!

137,"Comfort, service and treat at hotel 41","As already described by others, the service in this botique hotel is pleasent and personalized. I noticed a few business people using the facilities as their living room, which of course is nice if the travel iteniary is intensive and you want to get away from the international branded hotels. My wife loved the hotel and room decoration. 
After a busy day we were going out for dinner, and decided to have a drink in the library/bar/lounge and ended up staying there in front of the fireplace. We were kindly offered some nice appetizers and this took us further to the free buffet of a high standard. This is a nice treat.
It seems to be a mixed clientele, business people, get-away holidayas and turists.
The hotel situated next to buckingham palace invites to spend some time in the area walking around and enjoying the atmosphere.
We loved our stay. It would of course be nice with a balcony and a bit larger rooms (there is a quite large bath room and sitting area in the room) but this is London of course.
Would I stay there again? definately for small get-aways or business trips.",4,2013,04,14
137,Hotel 41 - why I may never stay anywhere else in London again.,"We stay in London fairly frequently, and usually with children. This was our 48 hour ""escape break"" without children and Hotel 41 ticked all the boxes. For so many reasons it is rated number 1 in London and the rating is 100% accurate.

The welcome at the front desk was very friendly, and you felt expected. Cara was the lovely lady who came to greet us and accompany us upstairs. Check-in was accompanied by a glass of champagne and then we had a seat by the fire before being shown our room. Stylish, large for London, a wonderfully comfortable bed, pillow menu etc...all the small things that make you feel special.
As this was a trip to celebrate our wedding anniversary, there were many special gifts from the hotel...a romantic turndown where the room was prepared for our return from dinner. Rose petals, classical music playing, champagne, chocolate dipped strawberries, white chocolate cake....the list is endless. I loved the touch of hot water bottles in our bed each night to take off any chill!
Plundering the Pantry is a joy. What a treat to be able to have a selection of such wonderful complimentary foods available all evening. The creme brulees were epic - and I shouldn't even mention the Haagen Dazs fridge!
Yes, it's more expensive then the hotels we normally stay at, but we got a great deal and the service makes up it. In addition to Cara, Louise was delightful and had a very friendly but professional manner. To be fair, all staff were brilliant - it almost seems unfair to pick any out but Cara and Louise got it just right for us.
Number 1 all day long..... exceptional service without being cloying. Wonderful food, Knowledgeable staff. Exactly how a hotel should be run. We shall be back!",5,2013,04,12
137,The Absolute 5 Star Hotel *****,"I currently live in Barnard Castle, and had a long trip journey to London and had just a bit of trouble finding the right Five Star Hotel. I found this place and currently inside the Hotel while writing this review.

The hotel experience by the server's are really briliiant and fabulous as they're speedness is skilled and extremely friendly. The sleep qualitiness is brilliant and everything else here is absolutely amazing.

There are no complaints in regards of this Hotel Experience with my family and friends. I don't hesitate to highly recommend this hotel for everyone who are going in a journey to London, this is the right place to stay for the trip.

The hotel is absolutely large and huge (at the same time), enough rooms for everyone. The rooms are very clean, good value for money, the location maybe a bit of hard to find but it's now once you know it for the first time, service is excellent, restaurant is amazing and good foods, swimming pool is very wonderful and beautiful & anything else (overall) = 100% blessed.

Visited & Currently Experiencing in April 2013",5,2013,04,11
137,Great team,"a great combination of city and boutique hotel. the stuff is amazing and service oriented. rooms are big and comfortable. all the small bits and pieces are high quality and well needed. braekfast is great, room service is very good. location is tourististic oriented, not comfortable for shopping or city meetings, good for West End seekers. TV is small but u have one in the bathroom. 
they have a special call button - ANYTHING, ANYTIME",4,2013,04,10
137,Amazing hotel,"Small rooms, as you'd expect from an London hotel, but this is an amazing hotel none the less. The lounge is very comfortable, the staff are very attentive. I would recommend it but it is expensive. I would stay again",5,2013,04,10
137,Amazingly Relaxed and Comfortable,"Stayed just before Xmas (sorry bit late catching up), for a pre-xmas break. Breakfast - best in London? Probably. Bed comfortable (stayed in junior suite). They think of everything here that makes you feel the most important person there. 
The staff cannot do more for you, they are there just when you need them. 
We enjoyed it so much we went back again in March and stayed in the same room.
Also the Library Restaurant in the sister hotel next door is superb.",5,2013,04,08
137,Great place to stay,"We spent 3 nights at Hotel 41 (room 4106) and loved it.  We booked the English cooked breakfast option, but could also raid the continental breakfast bar while we waited for our food.  We utilised the ""Raid the Pantry"" service after 8:30pm when we returned from the Lion King show one night, and an evening tour of the Buckingham Palace State Rooms on another.  The location is great and we had an easy, leisurely walk with coffee stops and lunch on our first day passing or visiting the following sights - Royal Mews, Queen's Gallery, Admiralty Arch, Horse Guards Parade, Big Ben, London Eye, Palace of Westminster, 10 Downing Street, Trafalgar Square, Nelson's Column, Admiralty Arch, St James's Park.  A convenience store, restaurants and shops are behind the hotel and major stores are a short distance away.  Staff were kind and caring and even when you didn't ask for something special, the turn down service always brought lovely surprises.
The only strange thing was finding a socket to plug the charger, kettle and hair dryer in.  They were all on the floor under the table.",5,2013,04,07
137,"Actually, it is the #1 hotel in London","My husband and I stayed there a year ago and, after reading the last reviewer, I felt the need to post. First of all, I have stayed at many 5 star hotels, all over the world, and Hotel 41 is one of the best. The location is unbelievable..it is right across the street from Buckinham Palace. So, it is not right in front of the ""gates,"" where no hotels are anyway, but, from our room, we could see inside the Palace walls. I remember watching guests arrive for the Queen's Julibee and this all happened right outside our hotel window. Secondly, the staff could not have been more welcoming, professional or knowledgable. Not only did they greet us with a glass of wine (pressed shirts and all), but they helped us out with dinner reservations & show tickets. The hotel is very exclusive, private and also a little expensive, but it truly does stand out as one of the best in my mind. If you're looking for a restaurant, there's one right outside the door...oh ya and a great pub right across the street. The location of the Hotel 41 could not be more perfect. It is walking distance to pretty much anything. The staff was actually very helpful in recommending some top restaurants and getting us some last minute reservations. If you can afford it, then this is the place.",5,2013,04,07
137,Not the Number 1 Hotel in London,"I want to start off by saying Hotel 41 is nice, but it is not the number 1 hotel in London. It doesn't have the beauty or service to be number 1.
My wife and I were invited to the UK to attend the big Rugby International between Wales and England.  We decided to go a day early and spend a night in London.  Although we have been very satisfied with some top hotels on Park Lane in Hyde Park, we decided to take a look at other top properties in London to experience other fine hotels.  A friend recommended I pick the number 1 hotel on Trip Advisor.  Hotel 41 is listed as the top hotel in London so we booked it expecting the best.  When we arrived in London, the hotel transfer went smoothly from the airport.  The hotel is located on Buckingham Palace Lane which I thought would afford a nice view of the Palace, but we didn’t even pass the front when arriving.  The hotel is located towards the back of the Palace by the Mews.   It has a fairly nondescript entrance with the Concierge desk at the front door.  We arrived at 11 am and knew it was unlikely the room would be ready so early so we decided to ask the concierge about the surrounding area and where to eat lunch.  She was very nice but not overly knowledgeable about the area.  She quickly turned to the Internet for answers. I asked about transport to Cardiff for the match and she again turned to the Internet.  Fortunately we only had to wait 30 minutes for our room to be ready. We sat in the lounge and had a nice cup of tea while we waited.  The hotel is small with only 22 rooms and adjoins one of their other properties.  We then went upstairs to check in and the first thing I noticed was that the staffs uniforms were all rumpled and dirty.  The staff was very professional and polite.  We decided to inquire more about the local restaurants with the receptionists, but again they were not overly knowledgeable about London and turned to their iPads for answers.  We then went to the room (an Executive King) and I was shocked at how small it was.  The king bed left only a foot of room to the wall.  I had to turn sideways to get past the fireplace mantle to the desk and I am not a big guy.  Our suitcases didn't both fit lying flat on the floor.  The bathroom was nice but the bathtub/shower didn't drain well so the water pooled up to my ankles during a shower.  None of my issues are fatal flaws and the hotel was nice, but I had to debunk the Number 1 hotel rating on Trip Advisor.  The hotel is quaint, pretty and nice, but doesn't compare at all to the beautiful, luxurious service oriented hotels on Park Lane.",4,2013,04,05
137,Really Super,"My sister and her husband often stay here and pursuaded us to book for our joint birthday and anniversary celebration. We were looked after like family and not that over the top, too smiley sort of service but genuinely gracious, competent service.  The sort of service which only comes from properly training and supporting your staff and understanding how to provide real luxury with ease.  The staff all knew each other and clearly wanted to be there and make sure you had a lovely time. The room was turned down beautifully and when it came to check-out, when I enquired what time it was, it was so refreshing to be told to ""take your time"", ""no rush - enjoy your Sunday morning"".  Having worked in the industry for a short time myself, I know this causes problems with Housekeeping but they knew this was a special trip for us and made everything very comfortable and easy.  Thank you to all the staff - I would return and recommend without hesitation.  Truely fabulous experience.",5,2013,04,03
137,Like Royalty,"We recently spent the week in London and enjoyed the magnificent 41 Hotel.  We did not know which hotel to select for our trip so we simply went to tripadvisor and chose the hotel with the #1 rating.  Turns out it was 41 Hotel and we were not at all disappointed!  After spending a week in our 'home away from home' we feel we must join the ranks of those who sing their praise.

My husband and I selected a suite as we were traveling with our 18 year old son.  The room was so comfortable and tastefully furnished.  It's not often the hotel rooms look like their pictures but in this case, the hotel really is as beautiful as we see online.  Monika, the assistant manager, went out of her way to make sure that not only were my husband and I comfortable but to make certain our son felt included.  The staff was very attentive and met every request with a smile and 'can-do' attitude.  We made several last minute tour arrangements and no one so much as paused when we asked for assistance.  All the tours and drivers booked through the staff were truly our favorites.

It is quite fitting that the hotel address is Buckingham Palace Road.  We were truly made to feel as if we were an extension of the Royal Family.  Our family includes the hotel as one of our happy memories from our London trip as opposed to just the place we stayed at night.  I will always stay at the 41 Hotel whenever I find myself in London.",5,2013,04,01
137,a week of royal indulgence,"I wanted to stay somewhere close to Buckingham Palace where I would be attending a ceremony to receive my CBE. This hotel could not be closer, opposite the Royal Mews and only a few minutes walk to the Palace gates. I booked 3 nights in a Junior Suite taking advantage of the 3 nights for 2 suite offer. My Aunt came down from Scotland for the event and we arrived on the Monday afternoon to a warm welcome and a glass of champagne. Contrary to a recent review we found the staff to be very genuine, friendly and eager to make our stay the very best that it could be. The suite was great and being split level, felt like a little flat. We arrived to tropical fruit and bottle of champagne on ice. We felt immediately relaxed and enjoyed our beauty sleep in preparation of the big day. After the investiture we all enjoyed a few bottles of champagne in front of the open fire in the executive lounge which was perfect. As well as attending a number of shows we made sure that we had a few nights in so that we could really enjoy the Hotel 41 experience which included watching a film in the jacuzzi bath (not together!) and the 'plunder the pantry' (together!) which is the complimentary goodies served from 8.30pm - 1.am; smoked salmon, pate, individual shepherds pie's, bread, cheese etc and the honesty bar. On our last night we chatted until 1am in front of the fire before our last sleep in the mammoth uber king size bed. We were enjoying it so much that we stayed on for an extra night. Of course now it is hard to imagine staying anywhere else and i would rather go here once every 2 years than have 4 stays elsewhere in the same time period. The standards of service are extremely high and all the breakfasts and other meals we had in our rooms were delicious. We enjoyed meeting a number of the staff and learning about their backgrounds and how they had come to Hotel 41 and found them all friendly, sincere and conscientious, a credit to the team. The housekeeping staff were also lovely and the turndown service meant coming home to a lit fire, soft music, candles and little treats. They really did make it the trip of a lifetime for us. I might start saving now for my 50th! Hotel 41 was the best choice. I visited the Royals and then got treated like one!",5,2013,03,27
137,Our London home,"Returning to our regular hotel - well, more of a return to our friends and the 41 family.  We stay here about once a month on business in the city and occasionally include leisure. On this occasion, it was a sudden need to be in Town for an extra fitting for a mother-of-the-bride outfit.  As always, the staff were welcoming, friendly and professional.  Our visit happened to coincide with my birthday week, which we celebrated with dinner at a favourite restaurant.  On our return, in addition to the card, there was a beautiful celebration turn down in our room, sincere felicitations from all the staff, including the housekeeper this morning.  As usual, our every need was catered for and often anticipated.  The raid the larder facility provided a late night cheese and port on the settee by the fireside.  On a bitterly cold night, the warmth and care was hugely appreciated.  Breakfast was excellent, and included a special tea which Lauren had sourced for us from a discussion during a previous visit.  The lovely cold buffet was followed by omelette and crisp bacon, superb and rounded off a wonderful stay.  Bless you, 41, you keep me sane.",5,2013,03,27
137,Disappointing!,"My fiancée and I were excited to stay here after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor but unfortunately the hotel did not live up to its reputation. The room was cramped and overfurnished with ageing furniture. We were woken at 5am every morning by staff walking in the corridor beside our room. The breakfast was mediocre and on occasions cold, as it was brought up from the kitchen at the hotel next door. The service was variable. The manager was delightful and helpful but some if her staff felt the need to patronise us and lacked authenticity. I think this hotel is trying to capture a private club environment but it just doesn't work. I have stayedvat private London clubs in the past and this felt like a Disney version. Would not stay again!",3,2013,03,24
137,Probably the Best Hotel Experience Ever!,"This place is simply amazing!
The entrance is tucked away beside the Ruben's hotel and is essentially one of the floors of this establishment run separately.
The room we stayed in was the opulent Master Conservatory Suite which extends over two levels and boasts a massive skylight in the upstairs bedroom. A little noisy at night, but I suspect most places in central London are...

What sets this place apart though, are the people.
There is a lounge room constantly staffed by the most knowledgeable, helpful and friendly people of any place we've stayed.Bar none. Period.
They just welcomed us in, and made us feel at home right from the very start. Unobtrusive, but always immediately available.
The lounge and all of its amenities felt like a spacious extension of our room, and the staff made us feel just like we were staying with (ridiculously wealthy) dear friends.
Most certainly the best place to stay in London.",5,2013,03,20
137,A great hotel in a great location in London.,"A return visitor to Hotel 41. I think what makes this hotel stand out from the crowd is the focus on a high quality service. Of course the prime location is also a key factor. If your looking for cheap - go somewhere else. But if your looking for a world class hotel with high guest service levels this hotel will not disappoint. Treat yourself. 

Congrats to management and staff. Keep it up.",4,2013,03,19
137,"If I could rate it six, I would!","You will struggle to find better service and attention to detail than at Hotel. 

I'm not going to spoilt it for you by telling you all the lovely things they do to delight you but you will not be dissapointed. Really personal memorable touches that we have not experienced anywhere.  Are well travelled, always 5 star hotels - few can compare.

There the many nice things Lauren and the team did to make our anniversary special but the 2 stand out items were....
1. The special turndown, soooo romantic. I'm not saying anything as the surprise was everything.
2. Lauren knew that we had left our son at home for our special night.  When we checked out, she gave us a beautiful bag of sweeties and chocolates all tied with red ribbons. 

Thank you Hotel 41, we hope to see you again soon",5,2013,03,19
137,Service above and beyond,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Hotel 41.  The service was exceptional, and the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome.  Nicole in particular was very helpful with recommendations and advise, and was even able to locate tickets to a sold out show.  I will recommend this hotel to all of my family and friends.",5,2013,03,15
137,First Class all the way!,"I chose this hotel after reading many reviews on TripAdvisor and they were spot on!  We stayed 2 nights here after a cruise before flying home and it was the perfect choice.  Right at check in we were greeted and treated to a beverage of our choice and seated at the desk to receive our room.  When we asked about a restaurant within walking distance they pointed us to the one right next door and the Hotel Manager even called ahead to treat us to a glass of champagne before dinner!  

Location was ideal for us, it's directly across the street and one block down to the entrance of Buckingham Palace which we were able to tour due to the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.  

Our room was beautiful, we couldn't have been more pleased. We will definitely return!",5,2013,03,14
137,Hotel 41,"My family (husband and three children) stayed in one of the suites in eary February. The staff were wonderful, very attentive  - couldn't do enough for us . The suite was a bit cramped with the five of us but still fabulous, with a huge, extremely comfy, king size bed and 2 sofa beds which weren't so comfortable.The location was perfect, food was fabulous and the kids enjoyed 'raiding the pantry' most nights. A big thank you to Lauren and her team who made our London experience extremely enjoyable.",5,2013,03,14
137,"Privacy, comfort and style","COnveniently located close to Victoria Station, perfect if you flew in at Gatewick and if you enjoy some early morning jogging around St.James and Buckingham Palace. Beautiful rooms and delicious breakfast in a stilish environment. Excellent staff. Quality has its price, but it is good value for your money.",5,2013,03,12
137,too popular. for good reason!,"my husband and i stayed here almost 2 years ago. we get regular red carnation e mail and thought let's stay again this weekend.  (we are from los angeles, live in paris and travel to england several times a year for various events). this time, we will be attending a concert at the royal opera house and this hotel is close enough, but far enough from the craziness of covent garden to be convenient. but now that the 41 is ranked 1 on trip advisor, it is way too popular for us to book/afford!  (we will let you know where we end up staying  this weekend....  i'm certain it will end up at the top of the list, again...)  the 41 reputation is well deserved.  we have stayed at many 5 star hotels in london but we really liked this exceptional small hotel and wanted to return...",5,2013,03,11
137,spent last 4 nights of our honeymoon at 41...treated like the royal family!,"Had stayed at Rubens at the Palace many years ago but wanted something a little more special for the last 4 days of our honeymoon on our way back to the States from Africa. We were tired from travel and arrived late in the evening. We had to wait a bit in the downstairs lobby but finally made it upstairs to the Executive Lounge where we were warmly welcomed and treated to champagne as we checked in. We were given a full tour of our room which ended up being quite small and had some plumbing issues. They didn't have any other large-size rooms to move us to that evening so allowed us access to a nearby small room for use of the bathroom and then officially switched us to a larger junior-suite type room the following day for the remainder of our stay. They handed the entire move while we were out sight-seeing and everything was seamless. The rooms were clean and although the bathrooms were slightly on the small side, they were just fine for European standards.

The Executive Lounge was fantastic for breakfast, both for food and service. The servers are delightful and remember what you like from one day to the next. The on-your-honor pantry at night was a nice touch....being able to come in late for a cocktail and simply jotting down in the log what you had so they can charge you upon check-out. Very old-fashioned way of doing things and made you feel at home. My husband particularly enjoyed the small freezer which held mini-size Hagaan Daaz ice creams to enjoy any time of day.

Lauren, the manager on duty, was professional, cheerful and always willing to go above and beyond to make sure your stay wasn't just ""good"" but memorable and extremely special. Because they knew it was our honeymoon, they left special gifts in the room for us each night...full fruit basket, expensive chocolates, champagne, floral arrangements, etc. Lauren and her staff were great at assisting with travel arrangements, loaning us their travel books and maps and booking theater tickets with ease. Turndown service always left our room neat and tidy with replenished towels and toiletries and even had music softly playing when we returned to our room at the end of the day. There always seemed to be plenty of staff on-duty at any given time so someone was always around to anticipate your needs and then deliver.

The location, right near Buckingham Palace, was centrally located to most all of the sites we wanted to see. You also had full use of the Rubens restaurant downstairs which was convenient for a late-night bar setting if you didn't want to venture far from the hotel. 

The price is high but well worth it. The accommodations were great but the staff is top-notch and made the experience all that it was!!!! They treat you like family...but more like the royal family. It's a stay you won't forget and will defintely want to do again if you can. Could not have been more pleased with our choice for the last four days of our honeymoon. Thank you Hotel 41!! Maybe you'll see us back for an anniversary one of these days...",5,2013,03,11
137,Best Hotel in London,My new favorite Hotel in London. We used to stay at Claridge's but thought would try something different. We are so pleased that we did. Lauren was amazing and really made us feel very welcome. My only complaint would be that the room was a little on the small side. The Executive Lounge is amazing as was the breakfast. Definitely deserves its number 1 status.,5,2013,03,10
137,A great experience,"We loved it here. The service can be a bit overpowering - staff seem to outnumber guests. The executive lounge is a home from home, and we used it rather than the somewhat pokey room. Good location near Buckingham Palace, and good use of the Rubens Hotel facilities. Definitely
recommended, one of the best hotels in London.",5,2013,03,08
137,Outstanding experience!,"Just returned from my stay at Hotel 41, and am wishing I'd stayed longer! I found Hotel 41 on here by accident whilst browsing for a hotel on Park lane, I saw the reviews and couldn't quite believe how highly it was recommended, and at a price similar, if not cheaper than other hotels in the area. 

As soon as I arrived I was taken aback by the service, I've never known anything like it! From checking in to showing me to my room the attention to detail was amazing. I had to dash out early on to go to an event at park lane, but when I arrived back I was pleasantly surprised to find a hot water bottle warming my bed accompanied by music and refreshments! The room was of course amazing, I was in a king size suite I believe, and it was immaculate with a huge comfy bed and awesome shower, aircon, and well... just everything!

I will definitely return here again if I can! Definitely my best hotel experience to date!",5,2013,03,06
137,Hotel 41-Fantastic Stay!,"My wife have stayed at 41 before and thouroughly enjoyed it. We stayed on March 2nd 2013 for her 41st birthday( worked well with the Hotel name!)

We have stayed in many many nice 'top end hotels'-Dorchester, 4 seasons etc etc, but Hotel 41 for the experince and service levels is the best we have stayed in.

I cannot speak too highly of Lauren and the entire team who make it their absolute mission to make your stay perfect.

 A small and intimate hotel.",5,2013,03,04
137,41 is INCREDIBLE,"Hospitality workers should be required to stay at this gracious hotel before working elsewhere. 41 is 41 Buckingham Palace Road. Yes, THAT Buckingham Palace Road - across the road from the Queen's house. Our room overlooked the Queen's backyard. The service it TOP NOTCH. Wonderful fireplaces. Excellently decorated rooms. If possible, spend a few nights in the Conservatory Master Suite. You will know it is worth every penny when you lie on the bed, hot the remote and the ceiling opens There is nowhere else in London quite like our Conservatory Master Suite. Where else could you sleep in such opulent luxury beneath the twinkling city stars? If you tire of the view, electric blinds turn your split-level suite into a private paradise complete with a HUGE, immaculate marbled bathroom and whirlpool bath - with THE BEST toiletries. A combination of stunning views and penthouse seclusion make this an unforgettable romantic getaway. Double Jacuzzi bath. Pop-up tv (but who is watching TV while in London?). Overlooks the Royal Mews. Separate dining area. Second bath. Espresso machine. Breakfast in the library. Attentive and caring staff.  The black and what decor is wonderful. Umbrellas on rainy days. And so much more awaits you at 41.",5,2013,02,27
137,Central London Cocoon.,"My husband and I booked into a junior suite in Hotel 41 on the 3 nights for 2 deal, to celebrate our anniversary. Our first impressions were of a discreet and beautifully outfitted hotel. The welcome was personal and friendly, and we could immediately tell that if we had needed any help organising things to do, then Monika and team would have been more than happy to assist. The team's attention to detail was visible in many small areas, but especially so in the little romantic surprise they arranged for us on our arrival.

Our suite was split over two levels, with a cosy lounge area downstairs, and desk, bed and bathroom upstairs. The bed was very comfortable, with a thoughtful hot water bottle provided as part of the turn-down on the chillier nights. The bathroom had a lovely high powered shower and a bath. The Penhaligon's toiletries are a nice ""London"" touch. 

We didn't make breakfast at any point during our stay, mostly because we were dashing out, so the in-room espresso machine was certainly appreciated. The executive lounge was a lovely space to relax in, and we enjoyed leafing through the coffee table books whilst we ""raided the pantry"" on our final night. 

The location of the hotel was ideal for our stay - as it is so close to Victoria train station, and we were arriving and departing via Gatwick Airport. It was also perfect for our activities in and around London.  We have no hesitation in recommending this hotel as an excellent, and luxurious, place to stay whilst visiting London.  We also recommend the St. James Theatre next door...and the Phoenix Pub just beyond the theatre!",5,2013,02,27
137,"Their motto is ""Your Home Away From Home"" is so true!","We arrived on Valentine's Day for our final three night stay in England.  We could not have picked a better place to stay.  From the first email contact, assisting us with Valentine's dinner reservations, to a follow up email when we returned home, the service was spectacular. The pre-ordered pillow selection was awesome (as were the pillows).  The champagne arrival greeting tradition (Veuve Clicquot no less!) is something I want to continue at home!  Time was taken to explain the breakfast and the late night pantry raid and honor bar, as well as all the features in our room.  The room was large and comfortable.  Our room #4111 had a choice of two showers.  A small upright and a tub shower.  We used both and found the rain type shower head to be incredible.  The wonderful smelling toiletries and the towel warming rack were just added special touches. The location was so convenient.  We were within a one mile walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, The Eye, Westminster Abbey, Churchill's War Museum, 10 Downing Street and Parliament.  The large subway/train station at Victoria was a short walk away and perfect for getting around.  We found purchasing train tickets and tube tickets from the kind attendant's to be an added bonus!  Our only small complaint was the cost of morning breakfast.  At £25 per person, we did not feel our small breakfast appetites justified the cost.  No problem though.  Just a short walk down the street was a small cafe at Pronto a Mangia that had large portions of scrambled eggs (with or without salmon) and toast for £7.  Avoid bbar next door.  The service was extremely slow even with only two couples in there for breakfast.  It is still less than the hotel but with so much to see and do, it's hard to take so long for breakfast.",5,2013,02,25
137,Great,I spend 3 nights in this hotel on a business trip. Rooms are well appointed and have all you need for your stay. The staff is great and always happy to assists and offer their service without having to ask. The only downside is that a gym or sauna is missing.,5,2013,02,25
137,"Beautiful hotel, great service","My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night using the Valentines package. Brilliant value for money and we were made to feel extremely special. Good quality champagne on arrival (not fizzy wine) and a pantry of goodies to raid in the wee hours. The staff were very friendly and welcoming, asking about our day and what plans we had during our stay with genuine interest.
The decor is lovely, the hotel is quite small but the space has been used brilliantly. It was great spending a cold sunday morning by the log fire in the lounge having breakfast and reading the papers while a blue sky beamed through the conservatory-like ceiling
The pricing may seem a bit steep at first but for the location and quality it's cheap-as-chips!
No request was too much trouble and we'll defintely be returning on a regular basis!",5,2013,02,25
137,unique,"we spent a fantastic weekend in London and had a unique experience at 41. The hospitality, quality and attention of the staff are just exceptional. It is very different from most 5 stars hotels we have stayed in. BR Switzerland.",5,2013,02,24
137,What a place,I had a 4 day business trip in London and my company arranged a stay in Hotel 41. I cannot thank them enough for having me into this wonderful place. The room is classy and luxury. You cannot ask for something to be changed for better. The staff is maybe the most helpful i have ever seen with always a big smile on their faces. I will definitely come back here again but next time will be for vacation with my family.,5,2013,02,19
137,"As previously stated:  If you don't like this place, stay home","Every whim is tended to.  Rooms are wonderfully appointed, we had a fireplace that was just hearth warming.  Meticulous attention to detail is the standard here.  Twenty four hour food and drink service, either at the spacious and private dining area or delivered immediately to your room.  Whatever you need, it will be done.  Really not that expensive considering the superior quality you receive, we have paid much more for much less.  Location is paramount to almost every event you wish to see in London.  (when Victoria station is completed, this will even be more accessible).  Quiet rooms, plush beds, steaming hot water, crisp sheets, I could go on and on.  This is rated number one for a reason, don't question, just book.",5,2013,02,18
137,"Great Service, small rooms.","Couldn't fault the service - they really did a great job of looking after us.  The exec lounge where you check in has a nice feel and is intimate and cosy.  Nice little spread of food there day and night so you can graze anytime you like.  Only criticism is the size of the rooms (specifically in relation to the price)  We paid about £440 for an exec room which was as small a room as I've ever stayed in, and smaller than other rooms I've paid £400+ for.  The bath was tiny - strictly 1 person at a time, and a small person at that.  Anyone over 6'4"" wouldn't even be able to stand up straight in the shower, so low is the ceiling.  Overall it was a good experience, but if you suffer from claustrophobia or like a bit of space, the rooms might not be for you.",4,2013,02,18
137,It really does live up to the hype!,"Having read all these gushingly enthusiastic reviews, I couldn't help worrying that it might not be possible for our our Valentine's night away to live up to expectations. How wrong can you be?! That a hotel can generate such high expectations and still surpass them says it all! I won't repeat what everyone else has said except to say that the genuine, personal concern of the staff for each and every guest is what makes this such an enjoyable experience. Well done, and roll on the next excuse to stay at Hotel 41!",5,2013,02,15
137,The best little secret,I booked this hotel myself for Xmas week and was so overwhelmed by the staff and everything surrounding us....our suite..the lounge..I can't think of anything that was missed. It as such a joy. Like a home away from home.  The staff was superb and they made us feel so special that we'd never stay anywhere else.,5,2013,02,14
137,Excellent experience!,"My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 in January of 2013.  As it was our first visit to London, we could not have chosen a better place to stay.  We arrived early from our flight from the U.S. and they met us so graciously and immediately put us in a temporary room until our room was ready (less than one hour).

The Staff from the receptionist to the concierge, the waiters and waitresses could not have been more friendly and helpful.

Our stay at Hotel 41 was so great! We would highly recommend this Hotel.

137,every service detail spot on- BUT needs an interior designer,"management has this team so focused on customer satisfaction its quite something to witness.  you'll read many reviews that expound on it.  however, overall interior design is amateurish, reminiscent of a mid-priced Victorian hotel from 20 years ago.  frumpy printed carpet in the lobby, heavy Victorian furnishings, and although there are windows you'll never be drawn to look out of them they're buried somewhere under all those window coverings and behind over-sized furniture.  flat screen tvs in an armoire ? what year is this?  too much furniture in general in the rooms and so many directories you can't work at the desk.  i never did see what was outside my small window, it was covered with a sheer-yes i said sheer-, a very heavy Roman shade, AND curtains.  i knew there were issues when i stepped in the lower reception lobby and the small desk had cords draped from all ends and the glass shelves behind it had trinket gold jewelry for sale - ish.  this isn't 5 star level design or furnishing, in order to merit this ranking they need a pro to bring the 41 up to other London boutiques (see my other review)",4,2013,02,09
137,Best Hotel in London !!,"I have been fortunate enough to stay in some of the best hotels in London but Hotel 41 is in a class of its own. A wonderful hotel, with delightful staff and many individual touches that really set itself apart from others in the 5 star category. I felt totally relaxed and enjoyed every moment of my stay. There were so many little details that made it so special,  the complimentary glass of champagne at check in, the hot water bottle in bed, free icecream and bottles of water and plunder the pantry (a lovely array of snacks available in the lounge all day long)
The lounge is the real hub of the hotel, a beautiful room where you breakfast, have afternoon tea, enjoy evening cocktails and canapes. My husband and I sat by the fire one evening after dinner with a glass of baileys - lovely.
If you are looking for a hotel where you get treated like royalty but where the atmosphere is calm, relaxed and not in the least bit stuffy then 41 is for you.
I am now dropping hints to my husband so that we can return again - very soon !!",5,2013,02,04
137,No way!,So...if this hotel does not meet your expectations...you need to stay home! Every detail is looked after and more. I think the rest of the reviews say it all. Best of the best :-) and make sure to let them do turndown service. Lots of nice surprises there. ,5,2013,02,04
137,Lauren's the best. But so are all the other staff.,"What to say? The best hotel in London and possibly the world. Boutique-heaven and lovely, charming staff. Can't wait to get back to this little gem. Note that they do seem to have one room with a slightly lower-than-expected ceiling. If you get that particular room, ask for a different one.",5,2013,02,03
137,Beyond Expectations,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 in December of 2012.  From the moment we walked in the door, we received the best service.  The staff is small, but after a few days you feel like they're family.  I knew all of their names by the time we left, and they always knew my name.  I looked forward to unwinding in the beautiful Executive Lounge after long days of sightseeing.  Anything we asked of them was delivered.  My flat iron bit the dust in Paris, and I happened to mention it to them.  They actually had one in the hotel I was able to use.  The turn down service with rose petals and candles all over the room was such a treat to come home to on our first night.  I cannot compliment the staff, service or hotel enough.  I will say for those of you who have to run each day like my husband Hotel 41 does not have a gym on the property.  However, they have an agreement with one just around the corner and it was very nice.  My husband even took a run around St. James Park, and he said he wished he would have done that everyday.  The hotel is also very close to the tube if you plan to use that mode of transportation.  I can say we booked our hotels in Paris and London following the advice of Trip Advisor.  This one is ranked number one for a reason!  We can't wait to go back!",5,2013,01,30
137,Amazing hidden gem,"We were met with a warm welcome at hotel 41, 2 glasses of champagne and nibbles whilst waiting for our room. We were upgraded to a king size room which was lovely with fire and fireplace, fully stocked mini bar, tv and tea and coffee making facilities. Bathroom had many little extras, large bath with overhead shower and separate shower aswell. Loved the complimentary choccies too! We'd definitely stay again we were made to feel so welcome and special!",5,2013,01,30
137,Once again our expectations are met,"Hotel 41 once again delivered ourstanding service, superb accommodation  and excellent food in the Executive Lounge for breakfast and for dinner in The Library of their sister hotel next door. Bedrooms and bathrooms are of a high quality and all staff most attentive and helpful. Look forward to our next visit.",5,2013,01,29
137,excellent hotel,"We fully enjoyed the ""English club"" aspect;service is excellent.The room was very well equipped,though a little small for the cost.
The shower door did not close properly and the shower system(with enormous water pressure) would certainly require being changed.
So excellent,but not perfect....",5,2013,01,29
137,As good as the last time,I agree with a previous reviewer - rarely is something/somewhere as good as the first experience (a one night stay for my birthday) but Hotel 41 did not disappoint. My husband and I had originally booked a two night stay for his birthday but unfortunately had to cancel the first night due to the weather conditions. However we made it for the second night and like other returning guests were greeted like old friends by the staff. Somehow they manage to make you feel special without it feeling creepy. Everyone seems to be smiling at Hotel 41 from the staff to the other guests. It may not be the most luxurious hotel in London (and I have no personal frame of reference) but maybe that is part of its charm. It is luxurious enough but without making you feel out of your depth and uncomfortable in case you do or say the wrong thing. My husband is very hot on customer service and he can't fault the staff. Wonderful - we will be back hopefully in better weather and for longer next time.,5,2013,01,26
137,Something a little extra special...,"This was a little bit of time away from the life of being mummy and daddy. A midweek overnight stay in London to see Mathew Bourne's Sleeping Beauty, as a Christmas treat for my wife.
Hotel 41 has a great location (opposite the Royal Mews) and is only a few minutes stroll from Victoria. The hotel is right next door to The Rubens, its sister hotel (it's actually the 5th floor of The Rubens that has been made up into a small boutique, exec club-style hotel) and you're greeted by a concierge in the small discreet downstairs lobby.
I arrived before my wife, as she works in central London, and tried to check in. As my wife had made the arrangements I had little or no details with me. Unfortunately there was no record of our booking (unkown as to where the blame lies) however the reception staff did a fine job of finding us a comfortable king sized room.
The room was well laid out, black and white furnishings, more contemporary classic in style, with some nice little touches; hot water bottle, t.v in bathroom, ceiling drench shower, well stocked mini bar - complete with barrocca for any over indulgences! I liked the His and Hers slippers.
The staff were attentive but not overbearing. There's a well stocked honesty bar in the lounge area and selction of free nibbles available all through the day. (Its nice being treated like an adult for a change).
We booked an early table next door at BBar (through the concierge - just dial the button marked 'whatever, whenever'). The style is British with an Afican twist. Great burgers, steaks etc. I chose a venison burger which was totally delicious, and received a complimentary glass of champagne too! I only wish we had more time to have taken advantage of the wine list.
After the ballet our evening was rounded off and with a nightcap, before a great nights sleep.
Breakfast with all the trimmings followed and a complimentary takeway cup of Starbucks coffee from the concierge on the way out capped our stay.
The effort from the staff and the attention to detail paid to the overall guest experience makes this a hotel well worth the little extra and well worth a return visit.",5,2013,01,24
137,Just... AMAZING!!,Maybe the best hotel i ever been!!!! I traveled here in the start of January for business with my company and i really loved this place!! Its a bit expensive for me but who cares... my company paid and i am glad i experienced the beauty and comfort of this hotel!! The rooms and the service are beyond any expectation!! Totally recommended to all!!!,5,2013,01,23
137,Service ...exceptional,I had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41.  The staff could be the best trained in terms of customer service I've seen in a long time.  They secured all my site seeing visits with detailed printouts as well as handling all the phone calls and set up all my reservations.  Never once did anyone appear impatient ... first class and above and beyond.  Superb.,5,2013,01,23
137,This is how to do special!,"Whether its because of the personal attention of the staff, the very highest quality of furnishings, food and drink this truly is a wonderful hotel experience. Nothing is to much trouble for this top team and I would like to thank each and every one of them for making my wife's 50th birthday treat this weekend so memorable. ",5,2013,01,22
137,Amongst the best hotels in the world,"We have just returned from another visit to Hotel 41. Often whenever you have a good expierience initially and you go back somewhere you have very special memories of, you can feel its not quite as good as you remember. We certainly did not have that feeling going back to Hotel 41. If anything our expectations were surpassed which was extremely difficult considering how good it was the first time. Many of your reviewers comment of the luxury and the attention to detail and 41 has all of those things but staying gives you so much more. We feel we are welcomed back as friends and not in an over the top way but in a genuine, we really care you have come back, way. Our words cannot do this hotel justice, absolutely first class in every way.",5,2013,01,21
137,THE QUINTESSENTIAL HOME FROM HOME,"If you are looking for an intimate home from home experience this hotel is at the top of my list.  My wife and I both spent 3nights at this superb establishment within a week of each other this January and were unanimous in our delight.
Quite simply this small delightful 5 star residence sets out to provide a luxurious, and intimate environment and succeeds admirably having paid attention to every little detail. Wonderful liveried staff provided exacting service by anticipating my needs and rendering help in a thoughtful and totally unpretentious way. Welcomed on an a freezing January day with a glass of good French champagne in front of a fire in a comfortable finely appointed reception and lounge area, I was escorted to my room to be carefully given the details of the extensive electronic conveniences(which normally test my lack of tech savvy) from the automatic fireplace, the music, TV, DVD and aircon. Thoughtful little extras included a hot water bottle in the bed at turndown, perfumed lit candles in the bathroom to Huggie Bear on the bed to elicit the ""ahhs"" from the ladies. All staff addressed me by name and I felt a genuine concern for my comfort and not the oh so often experienced superficial pretence, to say the right thing.
There are many things I can say to praise the ability of this boutique hotel to get it right. They succeed brilliantly on every level. Looking forward to my return. Alexander Gilbert Cape Town South Africa",5,2013,01,20
137,Attention to Detail and service - second to none!,A gorgeous little gem of a hotel - Service was absolutely impeccable and such a refreshing change for London. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. My husband and I were made to feel like royalty rather than paying guests. I won't go into detail about all the thoughtful little touches in the bedroom or plunder the pantry etc. as it has all been said before on trip advisor. It is however all completely true and the many 5 star reviews thoroughly deserved. If you are thinking of booking this hotel don't think about it just do it - you will not be left disappointed.,5,2013,01,18
137,star manager and customer service team,"There are not enough stars in the Tripadvisor rating system to express the excellent customer service that I received at this hotel during a recent stay.  I’ve stayed at many great hotels all over the world (Shangri-La, Raffles, The Four Seasons, Monasterio, etc.) but have never, ever experienced this level of care and customer service excellence.
Right after you book, the hotel sends you a questionnaire, in which you can request a special pillow from a very extensive menu (e.g., foam/feather, aromatherapy, triangular?, many others), book spa treatments, make restaurant reservations, and make other requests (e.g., a free yoga mat and DVD, an exercise bike brought to your room!).  I asked for the yoga mat and DVD and for the bike, and both were waiting for me when I arrived.  There was also a personal note from the manager and a platter of mini desserts, as well as olives/lemon/lime and ice.  (The hotel apparently offers guests complimentary champagne on arrival, but I don’t drink, so I got tea and water.)  The room itself, while not large, was very comfortable and the bathroom had all the amenities.
The turndown service included a hot water bottle placed in the bed!!! I’ve never had that done and I found it totally delightful.  Somehow, it stayed warm through the night.  I am always cold so this was such a great touch!  The bed, the pillows, the linens, and the bathrobe (absorbent terry on the inside, smooth velour-type fabric on the outside) were of high quality.  I planned to buy some linens for my house, but time got away from me and I had to catch a train.  Next time!
The hotel itself is really cool.  It’s a small boutique hotel in a great location (right next to the Buckingham Palace).  I loved the décor and the bowls of red delicious apples everywhere (several hotels do that and I think it’s great – everyone loves fruit!).  The executive lounge with the library and the fireplace is gorgeous.  I spent one evening there sitting by the fireplace, with relaxing music playing in the background.  They have this ‘plunder the pantry’ thing where from 8:30 pm to 1 am guests can help themselves to cold cuts, water, ice cream, and a variety of other foods.  Other types of foods are available in the executive lounge before 8:30.  Breakfast is also served in the executive lounge.  There is an extensive selection of continental offerings (several varieties of fruit, granola, yogurt, breads, muesli pots, smoked fish and cheeses, etc.)  I opted for a hot breakfast and had smoked haddock (or maybe halibut?) and soft boiled eggs.  The eggs were cooked perfectly and were of excellent quality (the yolks were deep yellow!) and the fish was hot smoked (and served hot), a generous portion, and very tasty.
The most important distinguishing feature of this hotel, however, is the unbelievable team that runs it.  Lauren, the resident manager, went above and beyond to make sure I had everything I needed.  The team even cheerfully (and at no charge) delivered something for me to a colleague’s office nearby on short notice.  They really made my stay and I am planning to return at the end of February for a week-end stay.  This hotel absolutely deserves its high rankings.  All hotels should aspire to this level of customer service.  Thanks again to the team (Lauren, Remus, and others) for a great stay!",5,2013,01,17
137,Tailor made 30th birthday treat - brilliant,"I wanted to organise a treat for my boyfriends 30th in January and started planning in November. Hotel 41 were brilliant, especially Monika who helped me decide on what treats I wanted in the room especially the more demanding ones such as 'please find me a room with a TV near the bed' and 'i want these dvd's in the room, can you find them?'. Completely accommodating with no fuss. Offered lovely romantic treats that was still within my budget.

Dinner was excellent and we ate in the lounge -  a lovely cosy lounge, wall to ceiling with books, dark wood and a fireplace. Honesty bar, complimentary sweets and ice cream...

GOrgeous cosy rooms, remote controlled fireplaces and excellent staff. Can't fault it at all.

If you're looing for opulence and grandeur, ornate decor and fancy pants stuff. This isnt for you. Its personal, cosy, quiet. Like your own personalised hotel.",5,2013,01,17
137,Blissful as always,"I've stayed here before and it's a delightful oasis of calm in a busy noisy city. 
I continue to be impressed by the little touches - such as coming in to have a lovely warm lit fire on a freezing cold night and hot water bottles in the beds! I was staying with my mum and she was over the moon about that, plus the fact the slippers were in His & Hers bags, but because they knew it was myself and my mum they put in two Hers instead - it's just so thoughtful.

The staff as always are super-attentive and really pleasant, genuinely nice people and lovely to chat to.  Lauren the Resident Manager had a lovely natter to us over breakfast and made sure we had absolutely everything we needed - we couldn't think of anything to make it a better stay.
Thanks to Lauren and everyone working there.",5,2013,01,14
137,Fantastic service and location,"Staying at the 41 Hotel is an amazing experience. From the moment the door was opened for we have been pampered in a trully fantastic way. The location, rooms and facilities are outstanding. If you ever want to experience what true hospitality is al about you should come over to the lovely hidden gem opposite Buckingham Palace",5,2013,01,13
137,Best Hotel I have ever stayed in London,"The words, professional come to mind as do comfortable, exclusive, well thought out, excellent breakfast, comfortable rooms that are well stocked of all those little things that make a trip just a little more special. Service was excellent with lots of people to customer ratio. I had breakfast there twice and some snacks both excellent quality with high service levels. The free ice cream was a nice touch even though it was cold outside we could not resist. We asked for Transport from airports as I was also on business and this was handled professionally as well. A great hotel to stay in London for business or pleasure. I have paid a lot more in other places and got much much less. 

What did they get wrong, only one thing, after Check out I got charged for food that we could not have consumed. This was handled with speed even though it was year end and the amount was returned to my account within a day or two of me raising the issue. The same can't be said for other hotels who charge you after check out for things you did pay for or never used and then you spend months after them for a refund.

Overall a excellent hotel in London well recommended and I will definitely stay there again!",5,2013,01,12
137,An unforgettable stay,"Myself and my husband stayed at Hotel 41 over the festive period. I would just like to say...this hotel is wonderful. The attention to detail is unbelievable. Before I had even finished my last sip of champagne, a fresh ice cold glass had been offered to me. I never had to lift a finger, anything you could possibly want was already there before you had even thought of it. I particularly liked the 'whatever whenever' button on the telephone which was an excellent touch. 
The staff were fantastic and really took the time to get to know you. The girls in the lobby were extremely helpful. Amanda arranged our whole evening for us and booked us a table at Santinis which was delicious (would also recommend). The whole style of service and decor of the hotel was exactly what we were looking for and the staff made our weekend away unforgettable. I would definitely recommend this hotel and we will certainly stay here again on our next visit to London.",5,2013,01,11
137,Perhaps i read too much on trip advisor!,"Overall a pleasant 2 night stay but perhaps reading so many glowing reports left me a little disappointed. 
No birthday cake for my husband as like so many other reviewers. No romantic turndown as stated on my third party reservation form.
The staff are a credit to the hotel. The setting perfect to explore central London but in this case trip advisor may have been their downfall. ",4,2013,01,11
137,Lost for words,"I booked this hotel for one night for my partners 24th birthday.

words can not describe how much the staff do for you here, they made my partners birthday the best! 

we was upgraded to a split level suite! lost for words! the room was lovely! after we arrived back from dinner we entered our room to find the lights dimmed with music playing rose petals up the stairs and a plate filled with chocolate covered strawberries with happy birthday written on it.

In this hotel nothing is a problem the staff will do anything to make your stay as comfortable as possible, you feel so at home here!

the plunder the pantry is a lovely idea your free to get yourself a late snack or pot of ice cream, another example of how at home they make you feel here!

will definitely be back for future birthdays or anniversaries! absolutely amazing!",5,2013,01,10
137,Truly a 5 star boutique hotel in London!,"We stayed at Hotel 41 over the New years Eve Holiday (12/29-1/2/2013) and from the our first step into the hotel until we left everything was superb and service was impeccable! Although you enter on the street level the hotel is really all on the 5th floor. We were instantly greeted by staff and then the assisatnt manager came down to greet us and take us up to the 5th floor where the executive lounge and the hotel rooms are all located. We arrived at 11:30AM on saturday morning (overnight trip from USA). Our room was not ready as we expected since it was only 11:30AM. However Monica , the assistant manager, offered us a ""temporary"" room where we could shower and relax until our junior suite was ready. This was completely unepxected but we gladly accepted the offer. They did not bother us until we woke up around 4PM and we then moved to our junior suite. Our junior suite is on two levels and I would definitely recommend staying in one of the junior suites for they are very spacious (by London room standards).  The down stairs room is a small cozy room with a table, gas fireplace, TV and sitting area. The upstairs is much large with a king size bed and large bathroom with both a walk in shower and bathtub(with shower).  This allowed both of us to shower at the same time.  Ammenities in the bathroom included not only the usual bath and lotion but also a toothbrush, toothpaste and a razor and shaving cream. Bottled water was also included at no cost which was a great benefit.  The rooms are very modern and the upstairs room has a skylight in it. I could go on about the room and the hotel but what really made the hotel a 5 star was the impeccable and friendly service by everyone who worked there.  They really seem to care about you and what to make sure your stay was as comfortable as it could be. I felt the staff to be extremely professional but very friendly and welcoming. Remus, one of the assistant managers who worked the afternoon and evening shift was the personification of this impeccable friendly service!  He took the time to meet and greet each guest and to make sure they were enjoying their experience and stay at the hotel.

The hotel is actually right next to the Reuben hotel which is nice because we had a wonderful dinner in the Library restaraunt at the Reuben Hotel.  The two hotels are actually part of the same group of hotels so our meals in either hotel or drinks in either lounger were charged to our room account.

The hotel is located about 5 minutes from the Victoria underground station which we used extensively to move about London. 

London is an expensive city and Hotel 41 is an expensive hotel. In my opinion however it is well worth it and we had our best experience in London thanks to the staff of the hotel. It was a great start to the New Year and our thanks to everyone at the hotel!  It is truly a 5 star hotel!",5,2013,01,10
137,I AM STARTING TO LIKE LONDON,"I usually do not like London but when I stayed at the Hotel 41 the first time my perspective changed. I love the traditional English hospitality combined with the top notch service. Hotel 41 makes you feel you are at a country club with fabulous staff. The location is also very convenient - right next to Hyde Park, you can get around easily. I have been back to London a few times and made sure to come back to Hotel 41.",5,2013,01,08
137,Excellent,"Spent two nights here and found it to be a wonderful place to stay. The staff are exceptionally helpful and friendly, as well as being very proud of where they work which indeed they should be. Well worth making Hotel 41 a place to visit for that special weekend.",5,2013,01,08
137,A Christmas treat!,"This was our second time at 41 and it was every bit as good as the first.  We stayed for 4 nights over Christmas as a treat for our wedding anniversary.  On arrival we were sad to hear that Frederic had left,  but Monika, Lauren and the rest of the team made us feel at home immediately. It's a special place to stay, everyone is so friendly and the location is great to explore London.  Anything you need is catered for, even down to the choice of music in the lounge when we'd had a bit too much Michael Buble!!  We had a wonderful, relaxing Christmas and will definitely be back again!",5,2013,01,06
137,What a treat,"Stayed at 41 between Christmas and New Year's Day.  The hotel was wonderful!  The location perfect.  The staff could not have made our stay any less stressful, and planned every outing
with care.  On New Year's Eve we saw Mama Mia, and Lauren suggested that they arrange transportation via private car back to the hotel.  We thought that might be unnecessary.  How hard could it be?  Turns out it was very necessary, as central London was CLOSED, and the car and driver made getting through what was essentially a blocked off area a piece of cake.  Nice work.

A small gem of a retreat in a very large city proved to be our hideaway.  We'd go back in a second.",5,2013,01,04
137,A superb hotel and wonderful staff,"So many good things to say about the staff and this hotel. We found the rooms to be well appointed, clean and very nicely finished. The staff made us very welcome and the little extras made our short stay very enjoyable. The hotel had a classy feel with a relaxed atmosphere and I would recommend this hotel to anyone. It's not cheap but worth every penny ",5,2013,01,02
137,BEST HONEYMOON (and hotel) EVER!!!,"Upon arrival at Hotel 41 we were greeted warmly in the lobby with Champagne followed by a greeting by the concierge who escorted us to the exec. lounge to check in. The concierge reviewed a preferences form that was emailed to us 2-3 days prior and which was used to book restaurant reservations and book tickets for a show.  We then were escorted to our rooms for a tour, which to our surprise was upgraded as a compliment because we were on our honeymoon.
 
 In our room were beverages of our liking taken again from the preferences form.  The rooms were very elegant but not overdone and there were small, thoughtful extras for added convenience such as:  a fully stocked desk, dental kits, heated towel racks, and the famous “Whatever Whenever” button.  When we thought our initial impressions could not have been more positive we get a phone call from the executive lounge.  The call was to inform us that some unexpected roadwork was to be taking place on the street that our window faced and they were concerned that we wouldn’t sleep well. We were given the opportunity to change rooms to make our stay more enjoyable. The room we were given was another upgrade to a junior suite, which was amazing! Every time we left the hotel the ladies working the lobby were ready to offer umbrellas, directions, taxicabs, and even bottled water.  Upon arrival our first night was a tray with a large slice of chocolate cake that said,  “Congratulations!” on the icing along with a letter from management expressing concern that the work outsides and the impact that it may have on our stay.  Each night, we looked forward to the “Plunder in the Pantry”.

41 is a paradigm of customer service!!To be honest a five star scale isn’t appropriate because it would not be sufficient to delineate it from other nice hotels that I have enjoyed.  41 provides a very welcoming experience unlike any other that we've encountered so far in our travels. The staff members are  of exceptional from top to bottom. They really have made hotel service an art form that would difficult to surpass or even mimic. If there were anything negative about our stay it was so overshadowed by the positive aspects that we have no recollection of it.  My husband and loved our experience at Hotel 41 and intend to return in the future.",5,2013,01,02
137,The Best Hotel In London,"This hotel is probably the best hotel I have stayed in. Everything is perfect! From the personable service where nothing is too much, to the outstanding decor there is not one thing I would change. What it lacks in facilities (gym, pool, spa) it makes up for in feeling like you are part of an elite members club.  The resident manager Lauren was delightful. Thoroughly recommended. ",5,2013,01,02
137,The best hotel I have ever stayed in,"Warm and friendly staff, excellent service, and personal attention were all combined to make this a really memorable and special stay. I could not recommend this hotel more highly. The staff were willing to help with anything. We stayed in the conservatory suite...a bit pricey, but really really nice, and definitely worth a visit if you are in London for a special occasion.",5,2012,12,31
137,One of the finest hotels I have ever visited,"I want to begin by saying that I own a hotel in Florida. I wish that my establishment could boast of the same exceptionally trained staff as the 41! What absolute pleasure from the moment we arrived. The staff is so remarkably pleasant and helpful. The facility, although lacking in amenities like spas and gyms, is brilliantly appointed. The rooms were clean, spotless, and tastefully decorated. Little things like champaign and turndown service allow this property to be every bit as classy and elegant as a Four Seasons type hotel.  If I were a nicer boss, I would send my staff to the 41 to learn how it feels to be treated like royalty. I will stay at the 41 each time I visit London.",5,2012,12,31
137,Simply wonderful and the best service I've encountered,"I have been instructed by my wife not to put a review on for this hotel as it may restrict our ability to book again next year!  This is a perfect hotel for a short stay in London.  The quality and attentiveness of the staff is exemplary from that first glass of champagne in the library on arrival to a farewell drink even after you've checked out.  The rooms are cosy and well furnished to a very high level.  It is also in a great location, a 5 minute walk from Victoria station and a 15 minute walk from Harrods.  We will definitely try to have our pre-Xmas stay in London here in 2013.  Cost wise it's expensive but not excessively for London and it's still good value.",5,2012,12,31
137,Lovely! I would recommend this hotel to anyone.,"While not the most opulent hotel ever, hotel 41 is one of my favorite hotels in the entire world. It is tiny- but that translates into personalized and attentive service. I truly felt as if the staff was there to assist me with my Every need. For example, when I arrived, I was freaking out because I had just discovered hat my laptop did not have a cd rom drive. Within 5 minutes of checking in, they brought a brand new, loaner laptop to my room (with the requires cd rom). 

The rooms were also super cute- each is a compact suite with a fireplace. The bathrooms are also fantastic- I can't remember a hotel with a stronger and hotter shower. 

Needless to say, I will definitely return ",5,2012,12,30
137,Excellent!,"We stayed during December for two nights. Great hotel, great stuff, great attention to details!                                                                    
Location is ok, not great...but it is what it is. Love the design, the ambiance, the service. Will definitely stay again.",5,2012,12,30
137,Heavenly!,"My partner and I stayed at the glorious Hotel 41 for 3 nights in December and I can't even begin to say how truly wonderful it was.  On arrival the complimentary glass of champagne was very well received. Our room was perfect in every way and the attention to detail is amazing.One of the tests of a good hotel is the ability for me to be able to put on my make up with a decent light,something that is sadly lacking in most hotels but Hotel 41 came up trumps yet again with the perfect mirror and light. Everything, but everything has been thought of with the tiniest detail catered for. On my partner's birthday there was a delicious birthday cake and bottle of champagne awaiting us and the Romantic turn down was just right. We have stayed in hotels all over the world and this is the best by far. The service is exceptional and attentive but not invasive.All the staff were friendly,helpful and genuine and not the cloned service with insincere attention that one gets in other hotels.  Raid the pantry was superb and breakfast was just so yummy we didn't need anything else for the rest of the day until dinner. We had an Executive King room with fireplace which was lovely to come back to after a rainy day.  Thank you everyone at 41 we will be back soon that's for sure.",5,2012,12,29
137,"41, a perfect stay","This has to be my favourite hotel of all time. Fantastic service, beautiful rooms and it feels like home from home.

The staff are just so friendly and helpful with nothing to much trouble. 

Owned by the Red Carnation group this hotel is just across the road from Buckingham Palace. If you come to Guernsey try the OGH hotel which they also own and is now the Islands only 5 star accommodation . 

Thanks for a lovely stay Vikki and I will be back soon :)",5,2012,12,28
137,"Lovely hotel, excellent location","My husband, daughter and myself stayed at Hotel 41 on Christmas Day. We had a wonderful stay, our king room was spacious and very homely. There was a bath and separate shower cubicle, the water pressure was really good with the deep bath filling in no time at all and the shower extremely powerful. The bathrobe was the most comfortable I have ever worn.  The bed was very comfortable and the round the clock snacks were very welcome :)  The only thing that could be improved upon is the TV, is seems very old and had lines across the screen, it didn't bother us too much though.  The room service menu is extensive, we tried the gnocchi and the chips which were both very good.  As it was our wedding anniversary we received a beautiful cake which was very tasty :) I would highly recommend this hotel and would love to visit again soon, the service was exceptional.",5,2012,12,27
137,"Wonderful hotel - warm, thoughtful and professional staff","From the moment we arrived the staff looked after us and everything we needed. They remembered what we were doing and even went to great lengths to provide the little finishing touches to ensure our experience was just that much better. They were ready to book tours, get tickets for shows, offer advice for ""how to get to..."" and anything else we needed. Rooms were well appointed and quiet. Location was fantastic. And I have never had better service than at Hotel 41 (and I have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world); and the afternoon tea is worth having (make sure you're hungry). I would have stayed longer if I could 

This will definitely be my hotel of choice for all my future visits to London.",5,2012,12,23
137,What an amazing hotel,"My wife and I stayed for two nights for our 10 wedding anniversary and from the moment we walked through the doors the amazing customer service began. We were a little early so while we checked in and waited for our room to prepared we were offered a complementary glass on champagne and nibbles.
The room was immaculately clean and big enough for the two of us.
 We had breakfast both morning and I'd highly recommend the full English. 
Overall the hotel and staff were so amazing and really helped make our weekend unforgettable and well deserve they're number 1 status on here!
See you next year!!",5,2012,12,22
137,Wonderful service--they really care about their customers,"Outstanding reception, crisp attention to detail, comfortable beds/rooms, and useful sightseeing tips!  My family visited London for the first time and we were so pleased with the hotel location and superb staff.  The Hotel 41 added so much to our overall ""tourist""  experience!  The staff arranged for us to see The Lion King at the Lyceum--excellent balcony seats with a clear view.  All meals we ate at the hotel were served hot and we thought they were delicious.  We were so comfortable that it was hard to leave.  What a restful, warm, and much needed break!",5,2012,12,19
137,Best service anywhere,"The decor is a little bit like staying in a Winston Churchill museum which is a taste thing, but I'll tell you this - you won't find more attentive, personal service anywhere.  I actually got homesick after leaving this hotel!  It starts with Breakfast in a lovely library-like setting.  This is where it all centers.  The concierge is in the Library.  There are always something interesting to nibble on in the presentation display.  Small refrigerators hold a collection of soft drinks and waters.  Meals are also served there, and I had an awesome steak right next to the fireplace.  This is not an expansive property, there are not a lot of rooms (which is great!) so it is very homey.  They take care of everything.",5,2012,12,18
137,Magical Place,"What an amazing hotel. It is beautifully run and nothing is ever too much for the more than able hotel staff. This is our second visit to this hotel and we will most certainly be back again soon. Where else can you say you were greeted in London with a smile and beautiful glass of champagne on arrival. The rooms although a little on the small side are perfectly situated and you hear nothing from the other rooms at all, which is unusual with most new hotels these days. Bravo to all the staff for another superb stay.... We will be back.",5,2012,12,15
137,Lovely Day in Chelsea,"I had a long overnight layover flying through Heathrow so I decided to get a room and picked Hotel 41 based off the reviews. 

This is a very quaint property just a block from Victoria Station. I wish I had more time to explore as I hadn't been in London in 25 years. I was able to go out the next day before my flight and walk through Chelsea and the Sloane Square area on a nice but damp fall day. 

The hotel staff were very courteous and helpful  and the room was spacious but they did upgrade me to a suite. The suite did seem to have one too many (3) bathrooms for its size but the rooms weren't big enough for anything else. The hallways are narrow and the hotel is a bit of a maze but that adds to the charm for me. It is across the street from the Royal Horse Guards barracks so I awoke to the sound of horses clomping down the street. Not loud or annoying and again it just adds to the charm. 

The main room has 24/7 light snacks and drinks. The only meal I had was breakfast but it was excellent. 

I will stay here again if my travels take me back through London. Hopefully, I'll have more time to explore and enjoy the surroundings and I'll bring someone along to explore with.",5,2012,12,13
137,Pure joy,"Stayed at this fantastic property 2 weeks ago, when shopping in London. From the moment you enter a small lobby to check in with a glass of champagne upstairs - they make you feel like you are back home. Black and white theme - very nice. Room was rather small but I was away most of the day. Bed - so comfortable I had problems getting up! Room - spotless. Amenities - delightful. Food - delicious. Service - exceptional. A few names to mention. Monica - very attentive and confident young lady was fun to chat with. Magda - her smile made me feel most welcome everytime I was around. Victoria - very polite and professional. She remembered my favourite way of drinking tea and I was quite impressed! As I could see the hotel was very busy she made me feel like I was the most important guest in the restaurant (or lobby). Sebastien - very polite fine gentleman who not only had enough patience to explain to me twice how to operate air con panel but also checked with me later that day if I felt comfortable enough in my room. Everybody around was very busy but I felt like at home. Will defenitely stay again next year.",5,2012,12,12
137,Paradise in the heart of London,"Simply the best hotel experience of a lifetime of travel. The concept of service, support and loft living works well to make the experience hassle free. Raid the pantry after a long day in London was an anticipated event. The staff was there to make your stay effortless. It cannot be improved on.",5,2012,12,11
137,Best Hotel Experience Ever!,"My wife and I stayed at Hotel 41 in late September 2012.  We traveled from LA to London to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary and booked three nights.  The class of service is unlike any other experience I've ever had at a hotel.  There are only a few dozen rooms in the hotel, which allows the front desk staff to treat each guest as if they were the only guest there.  The staff were friendly, helpful, and would work extremely hard to satisfy whatever need or request my wife and I might have.  We felt like we were leaving friends we had spent time vacationing with when it was time to check out.  It's located in central London, adjacent to the grounds of Buckingham Palace, a short walk to the Victoria tube station, and walking distance to Parliament, Big Ben, and Westminster Abbey.  This is the best keep secret in London, but probably not for long.",5,2012,12,10
137,A most excellent stay,"My husband and I stay here in late October and early November for a week on the recommendation of our trusted travel agent. We loved the hotel.  The location was very convenient yet out of much of the London hub bub.  It is very small with all the rooms located on the 5th floor. A very attentive staff always tried to go the extra mile for any requests and always remembered our names and asked after our day. Our package included breakfast in the comfy library/reception area.  It was always delicious.  Food was available in a small area off to the side most times of the day and night as well as a well stocked honor bar. Our room  was extremely well laid out and comfortable, but had no view at all. The bathroom was long and thin with an excellent soaking tub and a stall shower that must have been an architects nightmare to design as it was VERY small, though still quite serviceable. Movies are available from their well stocked video/DVD library though our TV was not compatible with the in room DVD player.  A wonderful experience.",5,2012,12,10
137,The Unknown Secret in London,"I have been staying at 41 for a number of years on business and vacation. I have found the location excellent with easy access to London being right across from Buckingham Palace and just around the corner to Paddington station. The staff here is excellent and always available to assist with resturant recommendations, reservations and I have found that in between meetings I can work in the 41 lounge, they always remember my name even when it is a few months between my visits. If you are looking for a unique 5 star experience with excellent service in a great location Hotel 41 is an excellent choice. You will not be dissapointed.",5,2012,12,10
137,"Fantastic, friendly intimate","What else can I say, I have never stayed in such a top class hotel that had such a comfortable atmosphere. The staff are the best staff I have ever had the good fortune to meet, they always remembered our names and were truly interested in what we had been doing on our days out and about. We stayed in The Monarch suite and it was nice that it had a seperate living room so I could get up early watch tv and make a cup of tea without disturbing my husband. There is no resturant but they do have a plunder the pantry were they provide snacks ect that are complimentary. I think they change the food 3 times a day, so it was nice to come in from a shopping trip and have scones with jam and cream. There was always what I would consider a good selection, crisps, cold meats fresh fruit, ice cream and more.I could go on forever it was great",5,2012,12,09
137,great small hotel,"Spent 7 nights here in October '12--small hotel several blocks from Buckingham Palace.  All rooms on the 5th floor--no voew but nice rooms.  The best thing is the staff-absolutely fantastic.  They have large ""lounge"" tha is decorated like a British men's club--breakfast is served there daily with superb service and cooked to order eggs ets.  In the evening (after 8:30) they put out a large buffet of ""snacks""--much food.  There is a person on duty in the lounge 24/7 for making reservations, answering questions etc. Will stay again should we decide to go bak to London.",5,2012,12,09
137,Like no other!,"I have never been one to stay in small, intimate hotels nor relatively obscure branded properties. But, I learned how wrong  and misguided I've been during a most special trip to London.

This I the best place, with the most amazing staff, I have ever stayed. There is no close second.

To have a large, modern equipped room in a small, intimate hotel in London is quite atypical.  To discover such space accompanied by impeccable service from extraordinarily talented, accommodating and beautiful staff, however, makes it even more special and unique.  Hotel 41, with service, quality and comfortable accommodations that surpass expectations, has been so much more than expected that I felt I had to write about it.

Need theater tickets? They'll print them. Need ""tube"" directions? Expect a map as you leave the front door, without asking. Need to confirm a dining reservation at a local establishment? Merely mention the restaurant's name. Afternoon tea? As beautiful and intimate an affair in a spectacular and private setting as any at the larger hotels. Breakfast? You'll leave full and content. 

If you want grand luxury in a casual setting where everyone smiles, keeps matters private and discreet and knows your name, Hotel 41's the place. Part of a small, privately-owned chain I had previously never heard of - Red Carnations Hotel - I may never ever stay anywhere else. This particular hotel is the hotel of the future today.",5,2012,12,08
137,Wow!,"I am currently lying on my bed in my room here in Hotel 41 and had to write a review.   This place is fabulous.  Arriving yesterday after a very long week of traveling throughout Europe, I was greeted by a smile and a glass of champagne, then shown to my room which is sizable by European standards and immaculately furnished.  The service here could not be any better.  Everyone is so nice, whether it be for breakfast, lunch, room service, helping me mail something to relatives elsewhere in England, or providing assistance with a business meeting.  This is a very small hotel with only 20 rooms, I believe, so all the staff seem to know me by name even though i haven't seen or talked to all of them previously.  The hotel is ideally located, and has a very discrete entrance.  After being greeted at the door, one takes the elevator to the 5th floor where the rooms are located, along with the executive lounge where all meals are available, as well as champagne and snacks throughout the day.  The honesty bar is a nice touch too - a full bar where up you help yourself and then just jut down your room number and what you took.  I will definitely look to come here again.  Wonderful experience.",5,2012,12,06
137,xmas break with the children,"My  children Eleanor (9) , Charlie (5) and myself arrived late on Saturday evening having travelled down from Lincolnshire.  

As indicated in other reviews the greeting was excellent and the immediate interraction with the children was fantastic. This interraction lasted throughout  the stay with every member of staff making them feel special

The room was laid out as requested and they had a couple of gifts for the children in the room 
which was a very nice touch.  Also during our stay the a christmas fairy visited again leaving something for the children

The staff are truely brilliant and nothing is too much trouble.  

For my family and myself the experience of 41 deservers the Excellent rating across the board.

We will hopefully be returning next year during the school holidays.

Thank you to all at 41",5,2012,12,04
137,Unique hotel,"A unique hotel with few peers. The Hotel 41 is a well-kept hotel and elegant.
The rooms are spacious and tastefully furnished. the common areas are very nice, with a style that combines tradition and modernity. Also good breakfast.
Good location.",5,2012,12,03
137,Wow. What a great place to stay,"A glass of Laurent Perrier at check in was the start of a wonderful stay. There is not a single thing I could criticise about the hotel. Beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean, comfortable bedding and very tasty breakfast. But the best bit of the whole place is the wonderful staff. Everyone we met at the hotel made us feel like royalty. Treat yourself...... Stay at 41",5,2012,12,01
137,Excellent Stay,"Was in London on an overnight for business- Everything from the service, the room and the location was superb. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is traveling in London and wants the taste of pure luxury. I will stay here again if I am in town for buisness again- thank you to the hotel 41 staff for being such splendid hosts!",5,2012,11,29
137,Best Hotel in London...........,"I arrived late on a Saturday afternoon. The hotel is situated in a discrete location & I liked that immediately. In the reception room I was greeted by a very attentive staff member tendering to all my needs. I was lead up to the Executive Lounge  for checking in & the customary glass of champagne - perfect start to the evening - 

The Executive King Room is clean, spacious & bathroom. What I especially liked was the little touches of when I entered the room, there was a greetings card & chocolates their to greet me.

I was more than happy with the professional staff as they made my experience of Hotel 41, a time to remember.

I look forward to my return to your hotel in 2013",5,2012,11,26
137,4 Days at the 41 in London,"Hotel 41 is a a quaint hotel with impeccable service and attention to detail. The staff are incredibly friendly, helpful, and professional. Turn down service included chocolates, classical music, and the fireplace on. My only issue was the lack of space in the sleeping area. We were in a junior suite on 2 floors and the desk was right beside the bed. Not only did this make the bedroom area difficult to walk around in, but trying to work while my wife was sleeping was not possible. Certainly not a complaint-but my suggestion would be to move the desk downstairs to the sitting area which would provide more room in the bedroom and would also allow guests to  utilize the downstairs sitting room more. Overall though we were thrilled with our time at the 41 and would highly recommend it to any of our friends and family.",5,2012,11,26
137,Hidden luxury,"A discrete entrance near Buckingham Palace Road and Victoria St. welcomes you to an exquisite boutique hotel that without a doubt it will be my #1 place of choice from here on out. The room was well designed, the bed was uber comfortable, the room amenities were top-notch and the location convenient to business areas and tourist sites. The availability of complimentary breakfast and snacks in the executive lounge was a welcomed convenience to a weary traveler with days full of business meetings, and the quality of the food was superb. The hotel was quiet, warm, beautiful and welcoming.  Beyond all that, however, the single best part about this lovely hotel was the staff.  Without exception, each was incredibly kind and completely focused on customer satisfaction. You could tell that each took great pride in his/her work, and cared deeply about the quality delivered. They were pro-active and took a real interest in my needs, following up to ensure satisfaction.  My compliments to the manager.  I travel frequently, and this is the first time I've been willing to attach my name to a hotel recommendation.  With pleasure, Charlene Lake, Dallas, TX",5,2012,11,25
137,Relaxing weekend in fabulous surroundings,"A wonderful stay in this luxurious hotel where nothing is too much trouble. It is well placed being near Buckingham Palace and in easy reach of other interesting places to visit. The resident manager Lauran Hargrave and her team gave us a friendly welcome on arriving in the executive lounge.  Every detail was thought of during our stay, the staff are knowledgeable and showed interest in our activities while in London. The chocolate cake to celebrate my birthday was a very much appreciated example of the effort made to provide a happy weekend for us.
The weekend was topped off with a wonderful Champagne tea in the lounge, the pastry chef excelled as usual. Really enjoyable relaxing weekend, a great experience once again and looking forward to returning.",5,2012,11,22
137,Fabulous weekend break..special Birthday,"Myself and my wife have just spent a long weekend at this excellent hotel. The location, decor, comfort and A1 service is by far the best we have received in a long time, in this beautiful city.
The staff could not do enough for us. From the minute we arrived we were look after in an Excellent, friendly, and caring way. Top team service from all team members.
Thanks for such a great experience and looking forward to visiting again in the new year.

Jeff and Tracy",5,2012,11,20
137,Possibly the best hotel in England...,"My wonderful new wife and I stayed at Hotel 41 very recently to have a celebratory weekend in London. Having stayed at 41 a number of times previously, the bench had been set in terms of standards/service etc. and it's the true mark of a great hotel that can consistently deliver on this:
Hotel 41 does this, without exception. 
The staff were exceptional (for example, my wife was unfortunately ill on the Friday night, meaning we had to cancel our dinner reservations at a 'quite hard to book' restaurant. We ended up staying another night at 41 as it really is that good, and the wonderful resident manager Lauren managed to get us a reservation at the same restaurant for Saturday night....no mean feat by any stretch!)
There's an unwritten motto at 41 which is unfortunately becoming all too rare in the increasing homogenised luxury hotel market (although it is actually summed up perfectly on the room telephones: 'whatever, whenever'). The lost art of friendliness, personal service and willing to go way above and beyond to ensure your stay there is one of the best hotel experiences you've ever had is thankfully alive and kicking at Hotel 41 - Lauren and Remus demonstrating this perfectly.
A perfect location, beautifully appointed rooms and the best hotel service i've experienced in the UK keeps Hotel 41 at the top of the TripAdvisor pile and it's clear that you don't get there without good reason!
Complimentary champagne, wonderful canapes, a lovely selection of food in the complimentary pantry...you've probably read all about these in previous reviews so I won't go on (they're all true by the way).
Thank you to the staff who made our stay so wonderful and for those of you who are 'umming and aahhing' over whether to stay here or not....DO IT. You will not be disappointed. The only danger is you'll want to come back here sooner than you can.

Hotel 41...we salute you.",5,2012,11,19
137,For the Royal Treatment in London stay at Hotel 41!,"We just spent a week in London, staying at the Hotel 41.  From the first contact at arrival to the amenities in our suite and executive lounge, everything was top notch.  The very personal service from all of the staff made us feel truly welcome.  We were always greeted by our name.  We loved relaxing in the executive lounge with our cappuccinos in the morning and pink champagne in the evening.The location enabled us to walk to many attractions and restaurants, which were well recommended by the staff.  It was always nice to come back to our room after dinner to find our bed turned down, the fireplace lit, the sterio quietly playing classical music, candles lit in the bathroom  ... it was all of the little touches that made our experience so great!  We look forward to going back!",5,2012,11,18
137,Amazing hotel in the heart of London!,"What an amazing hotel. As the other reviews state, the service is unbeatable.  My husband and I stayed here for three nights and weren't ready to leave when we did.

Check In - Complimentary champagne with arrival along with a great overview of the hotel and amenities.  The staff also checks in to see if they can help with any travel planning while you are there. My husband plans everything so we didn't need much help but they helped with transportation and gave a thumbs up to his choices.

Room - We stayed in a junior suite that comprised of two levels.  The lower level was small but comfortable and had a lovely fireplace.  The upstairs had a desk, closet, bedroom and bath.  It wasn't large but was very comfortable.  Attention to detail has been paid to the rooms.  Anything you may need is already there.  The black and white theme is modern yet still warm.  The bathroom was large and modern.  

Service/Food - The breakfast at the hotel is quite nice.  Each evening we had drinks in the lounge and enjoyed both the service and the complimentary snacks.  What really makes this hotel stand out is the service. The entire team is focused on ensuring you are enjoying your stay. They know your name, check in with you and always have a smile on their face.  We were there on my birthday and the staff decorated the room with rose petals and left a cake as well.

I can't wait to go back!",5,2012,11,17
137,An Hotel yes! But with all the comforts of an English Country Home,"From first contact, through booking, to arrival, attention to detail was exceptional, even to describing where to pull up the car, ""we'll unload sir and park the car for you, congestion charge paid sir?"" (I had done something!). Arrived slightly early, ""please take a seat sir, madam - champagne?"" Very pleasant!

We were courteously shown to our room, the door opened, my wife immediately burst into tears for I had requested the ""Romantically"" package, (see it to believe it.)

A quick change prior to the concierge booked car arriving exact to time, concert and return to a beautifully appointed Lounge offering complimentary self service buffet with a ""honesty tab"" for drinks plus staff on hand offering assistance.

We've all stayed in Hotels where the room phone has 101 extension numbers and you eventually find reception or room service, well at 41 next to one button it reads ""whatever whenever"" how easy is that.

Well off for breakfast, what shall I have today?

Finally a big thank you to all the excellent friendly and polite staff, No! Staff is not the right word - Hotel Team, yes a big thank you to all the Hotel Team - excellent.",5,2012,11,15
137,Unsurpassed excellence,"Wow, what a wonderful hotel. Great location, fabulous design and flawless execution. 

Location - turn right out of the front door and you are at the gates of Buckingham Palace within 3 minutes. Turn left, across 2 blocks into Victoria St and you have an 8 minute walk to Westminster. 

Design - enter the narrow foyer, head for the lift and ascend to Level 5. The hotel takes up the entire top floor with the suites centred around the wonderfully warm and welcoming guest lounge. The top floor location allows for natural light to make its way into the lounge and guest suites via skylights. The black and white decor, against a backdrop of rich, red timbers and antique furnishings, works wonderfully - classy without being over the top. 

Execution - 41's stated philosophy is ""no request too big, no detail to small"" and this mindset permeated our every experience. The service if attentive, timely and flawless without being intrusive. Every day sees another surprise and delight - a birthday celebration sees our suite littered with rose petals, the next night a bottle of sleep fragrance is on the bed. The beds are huge, supremely comfortable and the very long list of pillow options on the ""menu"" makes it impossible not to find your own definition of comfort. 

We will be back!",5,2012,11,14
137,The best City Hotel,This without a doubt is the best City Hotel Ive ever stayed in.  It was just perfect nothing was too much trouble.    The lounge / bar area is just like being at home just help yourself too food and a drink in the evening and just relax. And to top it all the location is perfect.,5,2012,11,13
137,Amazing Hotel Keeps Getting Better,"Since my first review of the 41 in July 2010, I've had the pleasure of staying at the 41 two more times. I didn't think it was possible to improve on such a great hotel, but I found this stay to be even better than the last two. 

The staff were, as always, quite attentive and delivered the highest quality service. What changed this time was the fare in the ""pantry""; it was more much more varied. There was a wider selection of cheeses, meats, breads, fruit, ice cream, and other interesting nibbles—all as part of the 41's ""plunder the pantry"" feature where guests can help themselves to a hearty snack each evening at no additional charge. 

For additional details, see my review from July, 2010.",5,2012,11,12
137,A lifetime memory,"Booking a hotel is not always just a simple booking. This particular booking was to be the highlight of a surprise birthday celebration for my special person <3

The best way I can think of conveying our experience at Hotel 41 is to draw a parallel to Alice in wonderland. At Hotel 41, a mere 2 minute walk from Victoria station and not to mention Buckingham Palace, you are transported away from the busy streets of London into your very own Wonderland.

We had an early flight to London and as we arrived at the hotel at around 10:00, we simply planned to check-in, leave our luggage and relax in the lounge before heading out to lunch. We were not expecting the complimentary champagne, not to mention the fact that they were able to have our room ready as we took our last sip (Checking was at 14:00!). The room was beautifully decorated, a perfect backdrop to the surprise birthday present, which had been delivered to the hotel days before our stay.

Other highlights:
Relaxing in the lounge.
Enjoying delicious breakfast; we had the eggs benedict and omelet.
Romantic turndown <3
The friendly and accommodating staff.

I had great expectations when booking our stay at Hotel 41, and they delivered a lifetime memory that we both will cherish. 

We will for sure return to our London Wonderland, Hotel 41, on a future special occasion. 
Can't wait!",5,2012,11,09
137,Service was over the top incredible!!,"Recently stayed for 4 nights at the Hotel 41 and was provided with not 5 star but 6+ star service. Having stayed at Four Seasons and Ritz Carltons I will say the service here is 2nd to none! The lounge air with butler service/quick drinks, professional conierge were outstanding. Only reason why I did not rate as 5 stars are the rooms are rather small and lack a view (at this price level a view should be part of package/realize the hotel is limited to location so just my 2 cents on subject). This hotel actually occupies the top floor of the Rubens next door (check prices there as well as it was beautiful hotel with afternoon tea) and has a seperate entrance. Taxi driver was confused, if coming in from airport the Rubens is actually a well known landmark and you should direct the driver there.",4,2012,11,09
137,"definitely worth the accolades, best value in London","I'm reluctant to add to the accolades offered to this hotel as it means it will probably be booked out next time I go to London.  However, the hard working and accommodating staff deserve recognition.
I travelled with my teenage daughter who has experienced many 5 star hotels (Sofitels, Hyatts, Orient express group and Hiltons) on family holidays but after our champagne check in and exceptional service right from the front door, on entering the room she looked at me wide eyed and said ""can we afford this?"". I have to admit I was wondering the same, thinking that perhaps I had mistaken the rate! I quickly got onto the free wi fi to check.  This has to be the best value hotel in London. (On our previous trip together I had paid the same rate at The Russell only to experience appalling service and dirty rooms.)
Our room was a very good size especially by London standards.  When we arrived we had a King bed, we asked if it would be possible to split the beds to twins when the room was made up the next day. Within 2 minutes someone from housekeeping arrived to alter them.
Finally there was a mix up with the booking which was my error but was fixed very satisfactorily by the manager with no fuss at all.
Perhaps this hotel steals staff from Buckingham palace which is just across the road they certainly treated us like royalty!",5,2012,11,08
137,Weekend Experience,"This is a lovely and exclusive hotel easy to walk by without seeing and nicely tucked away.  The service there is always excellent and the staff are well informed about your arrival and pay attention to small details.  The room was nice and clean but the furniture too large for the room and it could be better designed.  But everything is spotlessly clean and well equipped.  We also enjoyed a fabulous champagne tea and the lounge in 41 is uniquely interesting and comfortable.  The pastries were superb.  The service five star.
This hotel is very well placed being adjacent to Buckingham Palace and the staff extremely willing to help you find interesting things to do in the vicinity.  If they can make your stay more agreeable they look for ways to do so.  For example we had thewhole day in London and they allowed us a late checkout.  Highly recommended.",5,2012,11,07
137,The best service.,The small hotel located within another hotel had the most attentive staff and an excellent selection of well prepared food available at all times in the executive lounge. The room was well decorated but a bit crowded  with furniture but as I understand their intention is to renovate this room and combine it with the next room enlarging it. It is located a 3 min. walk to Buckingham Palace.,5,2012,11,05
137,Great hotel,"We stayed at Hotel 41 in October for a special birthday. The staff made us feel welcome from the moment we got there and throughout our stay. The glass of champagne was welcome after the journey to London.

The room was very clean and the pillow menu was interesting. 

The afternoon tea was very nice as was the breakfast.  

The staff had our theatre tickets ready and waiting and also booked our restaurant for us on the Saturday night. 

The location was good for sightseeing, Buckingham Palace was just across the road, London Eye and Westminster were 10 minute walk away. 

We had a fun few days and will return.

Great service, great staff and a great hotel.",5,2012,11,05
137,Hats off to Hotel 41,"Wonderful boutique hotel, fantastic staff headed by resident manager, Lauren Hargrave, personal email before trip from Janine Malia, Hotel 41 customer service manager asking if she could be of service prior to our visit.  The hotel and staff were one of the high points of our trip.  They were knowledgeable, helpful, welcoming, and made one feel like a VIP to be pleased.  What a find and I guess we are not the only ones who love this place.  Soon, it will be difficult to book a room.  We are happy to have spent 6 days with these gracious hosts.",5,2012,11,05
137,best hotel experience ever,"We spent a night in London at the end of our honeymoon.  When we entered from the main door we were greeted by our name even before introducing ourselves.  Check-in and welcome was as smooth as ever.  Room was very luxurious and very nicely decorated, also with a working fireplace.  Service and staff attitude was beyond excellent.

Location is very very close to Victoria station and Buckingham palace.  I am not an expert of London but I believe this is a very central and convenient location.

I highly suggest for honeymooners.  When we came back at night, the fireplace was on, rose petals and candles eveywhere, a very delicious congratulations case etc. etc.",5,2012,11,05
137,What an unexpected surprise,to find such a place in London. Hotel 41 offers everything and more from the super friendly staff upto the amazing service everything is done better then what you expect. For example our little log fire and the splendid breakfast. Next time London I know what to book.,5,2012,11,05
137,Birthday trip,"I stayed here for two nights in 2011. Staying here as a great experience. I remembered that I got a DVD from the lobby one night and a friendly staff brought popcorn to my room later. Great location, elegant decoration, stunning room and friendly staff.",5,2012,11,04
137,Best part of our trip,"After a 5-week trip around Europe, my wife and I decided to change our existing reservation in Notting Hill and go a little luxe for our stay in London. We found 41 absolutely amazing from the staff, the decor, the food and the service - everything was exemplary. 

While we had booked most of our tickets and dinner reservations the staff were always more than helpful - even when we extended our stay to 6 nights from the original 3 nights.

Unfortunately we won't be back there anytime soon (we live in Australia) but would recommend it to anyone.",5,2012,11,04
137,"At Your Service,","My husband and I decided to book Hotel 41 after it being suggested from a frequent traveller not realizing this was #1 on TA.  It was our 25th anniversary and so I tried not let the price interfere with making special arrangements.  Prior to our arrival Hotel 41 emailed us to have us fill out a personal preference form...some were no fee and some of the services were at a cost.  The form was not easy to use on the computer and it took a couple of tries to submit it, when I told them about this they had apologized and compensated us with a bottle of champagne on arrival.  We also had rose petals and a chocolate cake in our room. We were spoiled here with the attention...the staff was so friendly and accommodating.  We miss our late nights with Peter!  We missed the executive study at Hotel 41 and the wonderful snacks provided throughout the day.",5,2012,11,02
137,Personal and enjoyable. Well done!,"The 41 Hotel is a great experience. From the reservation process to the check-out procedure we felt very taken care of at all times. I traveled with my two children (7, 10) and my girlfriend.

Check-in which is usually something to forget about was nothing but a pleasure. Hot chocolate was produced in minutes as a welcome drink for the girls. The lobby/lounge is tasteful and very relaxing. A bonus was to be able to spend an hour or two in front of the fireplace in the lounge which that has the resemblance of an old “library”.  
My children loved that they could “plunder” the pantry and get  ice cream and fruits and dad loved that it is all complimentary. In the evening there is a selection of cold cuts and cheeses to choose from.  

The staff´s just great. Friendly but professional, relaxed and efficient at the same time. They saw to any need of ours.

The only downside for me is that the 41 is an expensive hotel. I cannot stay here every time I travel to London as I would like to. Still – it was true value for us. This is a great property and I´ll place it very high high upon my list.

Best of all – the 41 is small and personal. Not like many of the more established hotels in London.",5,2012,11,01
137,Lovely staff,"This hotel is well located and the staff are very friendly and helpful although sometimes verging on too attentive! The rooms are lovely and comfortable and the first night we returned to find candles in the room and Rose petals on the floor, very romantic.  The rooms are small though. The breakfast was very good, eggs Benedict excellent, although service a little slow the second day.",4,2012,10,31
137,james scurrah reviews Hotel 41,"This hotel offers good value for money, nice old world charm that has been kept up to date the rooms are  great very clean and the staff are super friendly, i would recommend this Hotel to anyone visiting London I hope they maintain standard, they even booked our theater tickets",5,2012,10,30
137,Excellent!,"A superb hotel with great location. The service is super good, the staff is excellent and it feels very ""friendly"". The staff fixed everything for us, like reservations at restaurans were it's extremly hard to get reservations etc..

I can really recommend this hotel!",5,2012,10,29
137,Perfection!,"Me and my wife stayed at Hotel 41 for one night on October 27th for our anniversary. Upon arrival we were greeted by very friendly staff and given a glass of Champagne each while we checked in. The Hotel and rooms are amazing. The flowers i had ordered before arriving were in the room along with the note i had asked for. The whole room is of a very high standard and attention has been paid to all the small details. With things like toothbrushes, sewing kits, shoe polish etc. For the evening i had requested a romantic turndown for when we returned from our night out and again it exceeded expectations. We arrived in the room to rose petals scattered throughout the room and in a heart shape on the bed, with Stawberrys covered in chocolate, romantic music playing, Candles, a single red rose and to top it off a cake with the word congratulations on it. It is ore than you would ever expect. There is no doubt where we will be staying when we next go to London. Perfection!",5,2012,10,29
137,A world class hotel.,"Having stayed in countless hotels across Europe and US, this hotel stands out from the usual. The customer service was excellent and combination of location, room, cleanliness and food standard was exceptional. This hotel had figured out a business model that works and as long as they can maintain the standards they can expect repeat business. I'll certainly be back. Congratulations to management and staff on a world class hotel experience.",5,2012,10,28
137,The finest hotel I have ever stayed in,"I suppose some people are used to living in such style but not me and this phenomenal hotel completely bowled me over. We arrived on a damp, drizzly October afternoon but Chris, the doorman/receptionist, gave us the warmest of welcomes as he ushered us into the hotel and pleasantly chatted about our journey. Then we were taken up to the executive lounge where we given a glass of very classy champagne and engaged in some banter with the French and Italian staff on duty. The deputy manager who signed us in was particularly welcoming, showing us the club lounge and then to our room by which time the bags had been put inside. What a room! A bed with the most comfortable mattress and pillows you'll ever encounter, a seating area with a large sofa and a writing desk with swivel chair, and a luxurious bathroom with both a bath and a walk in shower. The extras are phenomenal: bottled water, Penhaligons toiletries, complimentary slippers, 4 bathrobes, 3 flat screen TVs including one in the bathroom, air conditioning, bathroom scales, a mini bar (obviously) but this one had an ice bucket, sliced lemons and limes and a bowl of olives. There were tea making facilities, a large in-room safe, a full set of clothes hangers, a shoe horn, a clothes brush,  a hot water bottle  ... on and on the list continues. The desk drawer even had rubber bands, a highlighter, a stapler, a hole punch etc. There was a range of magazines and such is their commitment to customer service I am sure that if your preferred magazine was not there a phone call on the 'whatever, whenever' line would see it provided in a moment. I was sorely tempted to ask if they could get me that spurious publication Bill Bryson once mentioned ' Obese Brides and Gun Collectors monthly'!

And if all this wasn't enough, they also provided a complimentary bottle of champagne on ice, a lovely bowl of fruit and a gorgeous cake because my wife was celebrating her 60th birthday. There was also a hand written card of welcome from the manager.

What a treat the executive lounge is. It has the atmosphere of what I imagine a gentleman's club is like with lots of leather sofas, deep armchairs and some wonderfully esoteric library books. I could lose myself in there for a week not least because of the splendid snacks available from 8.30 pm onwards plus an honesty bar. The food ranges from quality quiches and cakes to fresh prawns and salad stuff to crisps and twiglets. What a bonus this bar is.

It is in this club room that breakfast is served: cosy tables very well spaced around the room and the full range of continental breakfast foods - a wide choice of breads, croissants, pastries, cheese, meats etc. It is a really civilised way to start the day. We only stayed one night but in this short time felt that we had made a genuine connection with some of the staff. ""Nothing is too much trouble"" is the mantra of the hotel and with such impeccable attention to customers' needs I am sure they will get lots of repeat custom, ours included. Unquestionably this is one of the finest hotels, probably THE finest, we have ever stayed in.",5,2012,10,25
137,Deserves to be Number 1# in London,"Best hotel we have stayed in on our 3 day biannual visits to London. From the moment you arrive you are treated with exemplary service by all the staff you meet.  We were taken up to the executive lounge for check in and offered a choice of 4 different champagnes as we relaxed in comfy chairs whilst the paperwork was done. When we were ready we were shown to our room where our cases had been taken for us and were given a tour and explanation of or split level suite. The bedroom had a very comfy 6ft double bed with a long list of pillow types to choose from. The bathroom was spacious with a shower wet room and separate large bath with a TV. Towels were plentiful and of good quality as were the toiletries. Downstairs we had a lounge with a desk, two comfy chairs, an open fire, dining table and TV cabinet housing a mini bar. There was a remote control for the window blinds and roof blinds in the bedroom and bathroom. Everything that we needed to make our stay enjoyable and comfortable was in our suite including fresh fruit and a very nice bottle of wine. When we made the booking I had mentioned that we had booked 3 musicals to see that week. In the room when we arrived was a programme for our first nights musical signed by the cast which was a really nice surprise and very thoughtful of the hotel. Breakfast was excellent with a good choice and cooked perfectly.  From 8.30 in the evening you are invited to raid the pantry in the executive lounge which is a great idea if like us we got in from a musical around 11.00pm and fancied a snack and a drink to round the evening off. When arriving back in our rooms in the evening turndown included lit candles in the bedroom and bathroom, rose petals on the bedside cabinets and around the bath, also an ice bucket with fresh slices of lime and lemon and some olives. Members of staff are very attentive and pleasant and go the extra mile which made our stay so enjoyable. We can’t wait for our next musical theatre / shopping trip and our stay in Hotel 41.The location is great- opposite the Royal Mews of Buckingham palace and only 5 mins walk from Victoria underground.  Book next time you are in London you will love it!",5,2012,10,24
137,The epitome of British style & luxury,"We are fortunate in this life to have spent another fabulous few days at Hotel 41 in London. One of our most favorite cities on this planet & certainly one of our TOP 5 hotels we have ever stayed at- ANYWHERE!!!! Checking in is like being welcomed into someones living room ""Take a seat, can I get you some champagne""  why yes- please & a lovely flute of Veuve Clicquot was in front of me while waiting in front of their cozy fireplace. We arrived @ noon so we were a bit early to check in- wanted to get as much time in there as possible :) Alas- our room wasnt ready & were were told they would need time to bring it up to standard. The rooms are ANYTHING BUT standard here- all the ones we have stayed in were fabulous- we have stayed in a room, & Jr Suite & this time the Monarch Suite- by far the largest we have been in. Consisted of a sitting room/living room & a separate bedroom. 2 FULL bathrooms- although the one off the living room was on the small side- but it served its purpose. Great stand up shower, towel warmer for their thick luxury towels. Although the toilet was a bit on the cramped side if you had to do a ""sit down""- but just learned to use the other for that :) Living area had a nice Kid mohair sofa that was quite comfy, (could double as a small child'd bed if need be)HDTV wall mounted TV, a medium dining table with 4 chairs & a dresser with great deep drawers & a closet with more than enough hangers. Windows looked out onto the Royal Mews (Palace stables & carriage house) that is right across the street. Windows opened if you wanted fresh air but there is a busy intersection out there so it was pretty loud. With the windows closed you would never know you were in the heart of this huge city- never were we woken up by outside noise or heard it by that matter. Great black out blinds & curtains- no complaints. The bedroom was so well equipped- the desk had anything you needed if you needed to work a bit- in the drawers there were paperclips, tape, scissors, pens & pencils- they thought of everything. A new addition from our last visit was the great Nespresso coffee machine & the Bose wave CD player with Ipod hook up. Mini bar fridge had everything you could want & another cabinet under the desk had the tea tray with tea pot, cups, assortment of teas etc. No fresh milk in the room but were advised it would appear upon request if needed Great sized closet as well with even more hangers :). Bed- OH so comfortable & such fantastic high thread count linens, firm down pillows (which I generally dont like- but these were perfect- not super mushy & too soft) Ample lighting & switches next to each side of the bed with nice wall sconces flanking the bed. Turn down service was in & to our surprise we got ""his & his"" slippers layed out on each side of the bed each night (a great personal touch & someone was paying attention when 2 men checked in & had only one bed in the room) They pulled the shades, turned on a great CD, lit a candle in the bathroom & dimmed the lights & a bottle of water on each side of the bed- a nice way to come back to the room from exploring all day. The bath off the bedroom was much larger & had a great tub with beautiful stainless faucets & shower head. Water pressure was FANTASTIC & temp was set to a perfect temp. You could make it hotter or cooler if you wanted but we were fine with the setting. Plenty of counter space & shelf space for all our toiletries. Also an in bathroom TV which was a nice touch. A blue night light glowed in each bathroom to find your way in the middle of the night that was very helpful. Now to one of my favorites of the Hotel 41- the in room toiletries- Pehnaligons......... The most fabulous stuff out there- they have the full range of the Blenheim Bouquet products- soap, shampoo, bath gel, conditioner, body wash & bar soap. We fell in love with these products out time around before & ended up ordering some of the cologne as its such a fantastic scent. Happy to see they still stock them in the rooms- some of them made their way into our bags as well....... :) I couldnt just leave them there to go to waste!!!! Also went to the Penhaligons store in Covent Garden & stocked up on some colognes as well :) Back to the Hotel 41. We ate breakfast in the library our 1st day- food was very good- took a little longer than we would have liked & something was pretty filled with sodium as we both swelled up & needed constant hydration throughout the day- not a biggie- probably just not used to good sausages & they are really good & the eggs- perfect. Didnt get a chance to ""plunder the bar"" on this trip- but its still avail. & still a VERY well stocked bar you use on the honor system (you write down what you have in the book & they bill it to your room) later in the evening. We did have drinks in the lounge one night by the fire- the most attentive waiter- I think his name was Mickel??? Very good service from him. Other times we ended up going to the M&S around the corner & having wine in our room before dinner. Had to swing through the bar to get some wine glasses though. Staff is extremely helpful & courteous & will bend over backwards for you. Sometimes you stay @ 5* hotels & it seems fake or forced- the staff @ 41 were professional & it in no way felt forced or fake- a great group for sure. We checked out & said see you again as we will certainly be back.",5,2012,10,24
137,A little piece of heaven in London,"spent three days here, half business half pleasure.  Being a single female traveler, I felt relax and well looked after there.  i Know it is expensive, but compare to Ritz, Savoy, goring for the same price, this is far more personal, relax and better service for sure.  Small things like asking if you need a spare umbrella by the reception is a nice touch. I also like the fact it is a small hotel, occupied the entire 5th floor with the executive lounge on the same floor.  once you checked in , you just don't wanna check out! Breakfast was great, but the pancakes need improving! i only use the free evening buffet once, but very impressed by the quality of the food provided.  I'm a tea total, but there is free champagne too!  so, for £300 a night, it is kind of good value for money.",5,2012,10,23
137,What a honeymoon!,"We had the pleasure of staying at Hotel 41 for our honeymoon. All we can say is WOW!!! While the location, rooms and food were all fantastic, what truly impressed us with this hotel was the FANTASTIC service we got! All our requests were granted and then some! The staff are young, dynamic and unbelievably helpful! We will definitely be staying here again and highly recommend it to anyone visiting London!",5,2012,10,22
137,The perfect place to start our marriage,"We were married in London over the weekend and wanted to pamper ourselves with a top class hotel for our wedding weekend. We looked at the Savoy, the Ritz, the Landmark, etc, but the reviews on TripAdvisor swayed us to try Hotel 41 instead - and we couldn't have been happier with the choice! 

I stayed the night before the wedding with my maid of honour and the wedding night with the groom, and the staff were so helpful in assisting with all of the wedding morning preparation. We were upgraded to a suite, and the split level layout was perfect as my room filled with the photographer, makeup artist and attendants. The hotel is beautiful and classically decorated and provides remarkable privacy in a central location just by Victoria station (but so quiet!). The bath was incredibly relaxing, the bed so comfortable, the staff were perfect and so friendly, and the groom in particular loved the delicious breakfast and foods available in the lounge. 

Our wedding was sublime, and staying at Hotel 41 was the capstone to a weekend of perfection. Should we win the lottery, we might just move in!",5,2012,10,22
137,Great hotel,"My husband and I just returned from 6 nights at Hotel 41.  We have stayed at many fine hotels and this experience was one of our most memorable. It  was  not just the painstaking attention to detail in every aspect of the physical property, but more importantly the welcoming and helpful  attitude of the staff.  We were made to feel more like old friends than just hotel guests.",5,2012,10,22
137,Excellent service ...,"I stayed at Hotel 41 for 2 nights during my visit to London in September. It was my first stay and reason was its location. I was very pleased with the service, all personnel was very helpful and always with smiling face ...",5,2012,10,22
137,Wonderful hotel!,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 for 6 nights in October to celebrate our 40th anniversary. We were extremely pleased with every aspect of our stay. The hotel is in a great location- near the subway, across the street from The Mews and down the street from Buckingham Palace and St James Park.  Our room and the hotel's dining/ sitting room in  The Library was most pleasant. It was the extraordinary  service, however, that sets this small  hotel apart. The staff is extremely  attentive, helpful, eager to help with suggestions for things to do,  dinner and theater reservations, and available 24/7. We would return in a heartbeat and recommend Hotel 41 without reservation.",5,2012,10,21
137,Excellent service but building works nearby,"The service at this hotel is excllent along with the location, food quality, cleanliness etc.  Unfortunately there is a building site just behind the property and work is approved until 11.30 pm at night and starts at 5.30 am. This is out of the control of the hotel and the staff were very apologetic however I would have preferred to be prewarned or given a room at the front of the hotel. I desperately needed sleep on my first evening so the jackhammer noise made it a nightmare. Check also that you get the room you ordered, I was expecting a room with a fireplace which didn't materialise.

The staff are wonderful and I recieved an email from the manager apologising for the noise.",3,2012,10,21
137,Amazing Quality & Service,"I booked this hotel based on the reviews here, and as a surprise for my wife for our 20th wedding anniversary. What can I say other than the hotel and every member of staff were fantastic. Having stayed at many other five star hotels, this was a real eye opener as to what quality and service is all about. The hotel provided a complimentary bottle of Champagne on arrival, and also a romantic turn-down service (Rose petals, candles and a congratulations cake with another bottle of Champagne) when we returned from our meal in London. I booked the hotel only four days before arrival and was lucky to get a room considering it was a Saturday night, I also wanted to get tickets for a West End show, being a typical man and leaving this right til the last minute all tickets were sold out everywhere on the internet and at the box office. As a last resort I called the hotel and amazingly they called the next day and said they had reserved us two tickets for the show I wanted. All of this I kept from my wife and I informed the hotel of this, they kept everything secret and we had an absolutely brilliant time.The honesty bar and tit bits that are on offer also add to the cozy and homely feel to the place. 
So what makes this small hotel so good and better (in my opinion) than many other famously named hotels, which we have been lucky enough to stay at over the years? I think it is down to two things:- Attention to detail and the people. The Red Carnation Group have clearly got their staff training and selection down to a tee, and understand what a truly quality hotel experience should be. We will definitely be staying again the next time we are in London. The only disappointing thing is that we didn't discover this hotel group before now. Thank you Hotel 41 for a fantastic service.",5,2012,10,21
137,Magnificent Hotel 41 - a real gem in London!,"We have just had three nights at Hotel 41 in an Executive King Room, to celebrate my 60th and our 35th Wedding Anniversary and to see our daughter who lives in London. From the moment we walked into the hotel we knew our stay was going to be special. We loved the black and white decor and the ambience in the Executive Lounge - very calming.  Our daughter was meeting us at 41 after we arrived from Paris - Monika made her feel welcome to await our arrival.  What a wonderful way to celebrate - champagne on arrival and such a warm and inviting atmosphere.  The staff allowed us to catch up with our daughter whilst enjoying the champagne and just sit and enjoy the lounge area - fire going - wonderful!

Special thanks to all the staff at 41 - everyone is so attentive and friendly and this is what makes Hotel 41 a wonderful place to stay.  We would like to give special mention to Monika - she arranged rose petals and candles in the room - very romantic and for the flowers, as well Charlotte and Magdalena - thanks for all your help and kindness to us. Also, thanks to Alessia who assisted us on check in and check out and Frederic, The Resident Manager. 

The attention to detail in the rooms is amazing.  We loved the black and white decor and the wonderfully comfortable bed and pillows - you just sink into them and you just seem to drift off to sleep so easily. Also, all the toiletries are top quality and really appreciated. The hotel lived up to all the reviews and expectations I had - it was a surprise to my husband and he fell in love with your hotel.  

The breakfasts were amazing as well as all the other food that is available at 41 - from snacks in the afternoon to Plunder the Pantry in the evening.  After 4 busy days in London it was always so special to come back to our haven, have a cup of tea and relax in the lounge.  

The hotel booked our dinner at the Library Restaurant at the Reubens hotel next door - wonderful meal and attention to making you feel at home in their Restaurant.  They even had a cheesecake at the end of the meal for my husband and myself to celebrate the occasion. 

If you want somewhere special to stay - stay at Hotel 41 - you will never forget the experience and you will want to return in the future, as we will.  Hotel 41 is close to Victoria Station, to The Apollo Theatre where Wicked is playing and of course to Buckingham Palace.  

Thankyou to everyone at Hotel 41 for making my 60th and our wedding anniversary so special - we will never forget our time with you.",5,2012,10,21
137,a truly individual 5* hotel - highly recommend,"I booked a basic room for one night during London Design Week for my daughter and myself. If this was basic goodness knows what the superior rooms were like. From the minute we made the reservation to the time that we left the staff could not do enough to make our stay comfortable and memorable. Our room was on 2 levels with a couch, flat screen tv, small table with 2 chairs, and a living flame gas fire downstairs; upstairs was a superking bed, another flat screen tv, ipod dock, bathroom. All the window blinds were electronically controlled. I believe that there are just under 40 bedrooms in the hotel and it is situated on the top floor of its sister hotel, The Ruebens, in what used to be the ballroom. The reception area is like a country house library, with reading nooks, a fire, and a free buffet area - sweets during the day and ""raid the larder in the evening"" - which is cheeses, quiches, meats, breads, pastries, ice cream, etc. There is an honor bar where you can pour your own wine, beer, or liquor. We didn't find the service overbearing but just  right. We loved it and will stay there again. You really felt you were somewhere special and different - and you were treated that way as well.",5,2012,10,20
137,I wish I was still there...,"My husband and I stayed at 41 during our first trip to London. We booked the hotel, based on the reviews read on this website, so I thought it was only fair that I was just as helpful to any other potential guests. 

We are the parents of 3 children, and we decided to take a “second honeymoon”.  We booked a basic room with breakfast included...but we got SO much more!! Our flight got into London at 7am and we arrived at the hotel around 8 am, only expecting to be able to store our bags..but the saints that they are, had our room ready for us. We were able to freshen up, and they were even able to get us last minute tickets to the Tower of London. The people working there gave us excellent recommendations on how to spend our day. We entered our room, and a bottle of champagne on ice greeted us. Every evening was more of the same...little surprises greeted us in our room after a long day of sightseeing and touring. It felt wonderful to be so pampered. Although, the type of vacation we were taking was not relaxing (like sitting on a beach somewhere) it was full of excitement. We got our relaxation when we walked into the doors of 41. The food they served there is excellent. Every staff member was amazing. They knew exactly who we were with only one introduction. They truly accomodated us with anything and everything we needed. Our last night there took our breath away. We went out for a casual dinner and arrived in our room to rose petals everywhere, and long stem roses on the bed, candles lit, classical music playing. We loved our trip, and this hotel was a huge part of it. We plan on coming back to London, and we will stay here again. I will also look at other Red Carnation hotels first next time we travel. Thank you 41 for making our trip beautiful and memorable!! 

Ps..the Location was great!! We were able to walk to so many major London attractions, and the underground was about a block away. The neighborhood was lovely.",5,2012,10,19
137,Pampered excellence,"Treated like royals (unlike the taxi driver who suggested we wouldn't be staying there as it was too expensive for us). Extremely helpful staff, fantastic room, really flexible with check in /out and luggage storage, all the nice little touches, great lounge area for true relaxation. The full package!! Definitely stay again.",5,2012,10,19
137,unbelievable,"This hotel is just perfect. I can't believe all the attention I have received during this stay. My business tripwas more a leisure treat at the end. Car transfer organised last minutes, fax and e-mail dealt by the team, last minute meeting in their boardroom for free. My colleagues all enjoyed the lounge and the boardroom for lunch. It has been such a great experience. I'm looking forward to return. 
The icing on the cake was the young manager in charge of this hotel (Frederic, don't be shy to call him Freddie). He was second to none and I watched him going from one table to an other, chatting with guests, paying a lot of attention to them that I couldbn't believe where he could take his energy from. 

I stayed 5 days and I have seen him everyday. Morning, Afternoon, dinner and even late night, he was waiting for me to pass on some very important document to me by hands as he wanted to make sure this was dealt perfectly well. It was 2:15 in the morning. Unbelievable. Well done to all and to the owner who have found such a great manager to run the show.",5,2012,10,17
137,I recommend this hotel to everyone,"I have stayed at 41 only twice and each time the service, friendliness and the atmosphere were terrific.  I particularly liked after flying in from the States, they allowed me into my room so early in the day.  You will enjoy your stay here even though the taxi driver may quiz you a bit more as to where you're going.  ",5,2012,10,16
137,Best B&B in London,"From the moment we arrived at the airport, the limousine picked us up and dropped us at the door steps of the hotel.  You almost could miss the door, if not paying attention.  The doorman let us in and we were greeted with a glass of champagne.  The room, with a bathtub, shower and fireplace was plush and the king-size bed and bedding was perfectly comfortable.  The concierge helped us book reservations at great restaurants and shows.  We met some wonderful people - other guests.  The meals were delicious and the wine superb.  We will not go anywhere else in London and will definitely go back.",5,2012,10,16
137,if the neighborhood is good enough for the Queen...,"Fantastic location, just a couple of blocks from Victoria station and a couple of blocks from Buckingham Palace.  The service was exceptional- possibly the best service we have ever encountered. Our room was very small,  but it was well appointed.  Trip Advisor did us well.  We will return.",4,2012,10,16
137,Won't stay at another London Hotel,"We've stayed at several other high end hotels including the Ritz and Connaught and for us, 41 outranks them all.  Quiet, warm, and a wonderful friendly staff.  They go out of their way to give the best service possible and they quickly learn and use your name.  I'm a fairly picky person regarding hotel cleanliness and this is the only hotel I've stayed at that sanitizes their tv and radio remote controls.",5,2012,10,14
137,"A Good Stay, Not a Perfect One.","We recently stayed 2 nights at 41.  It is located on the 5th floor of the Rubens at the Palace hotel.  We had stayed in the Rubens several times during trips to London and decided to give 41 a go this trip.  We were greeted by the friendly staff on arrival and eventhough we arrived early in the morning we were able to get into our room after just a short wait.  While waiting we were offered a drink of our choice which was a nice touch.  The room was nice and roomy by London standards.  The overall decor is black and white, we had a small window that looked out on an office building and the construction below.
We did recieve yummy treats in our room after turndown service but the pillow menu eluded us, which is not that big of a deal.  There were some concerns overall with the visit and while the staff did their best, if you are thinking of staying at 41 you should be aware of issues that might come up:
1.  Construction in the area which takes place after 10pm at night.  Both nights we were kept up past 1am due to the jackhammering outside, it felt like the construction was taking place in the room.  I did call the desk around midnight to ask if they knew about it and was told they had called about the noise and it would be ending shortly, (which meant another hour).  No matter what I'm paying for a room I do expect a restful nights' sleep.  The good news is that the construction won't last forever.
2.  The fire alarm that went off in the middle of the night and multiple times the next morning.  Apparently, it was malfunctioning and they do test the alarms once a week.
3.  The room locks....we went through 4 sets of keys during our 2 day stay because the door lock was ""old.""  It was so bad that staff took to escorting us back to our room to ensure that we could get in.
The staff at 41 are wonderful and the rooms are clean and spacious.   This is a good 4 star hotel but you could stay on the lower floors (the Rubens) and have nearly the same experience for half the price.",4,2012,10,14
137,Wonderful honeymoon stay!,"What a wonderful boutique hotel.  Staff was amazing.  Very knowledgeable and eager to please their quests.  No request was too small or too large for them to handle. 
Rooms are a bit small but very comfortable and clean.  The lounge is lovely to just sit by the fire and have a drink or read a book.
Look forward to staying here again.",5,2012,10,14
137,Another Wonderful Stay,"This was our second stay at the 41 (the first was in December 2011).  The 41 is a wonderful, comfortable, cozy place to stay.  The rooms have an air of understated elegance, with every amenity that  you would need for your stay, including umbrellas, business supplies, a pillow menu (!), access to exercise equipment, and a tasty treat in your room upon arrival.  

We were welcomed with a glass of champagne by Freddie, the Resident Manager of the hotel.  He is a genuinely caring person, who remembers past guests and makes sure that every guest feels at home...he and Monika ( the assistant manager, and equally kind) make you feel that you are part of the family, as does the rest of the staff of the hotel.

We recognized many employees from our last trip and they remembered us, also.  They were all extremely friendly and accommodating.  Claire, Vivien, Iris and Prince were a great help in giving me suggestions and directions for sightseeing and were even able to find a shop that sold an obscure tartan tie that my son requested (his college ""colors""), which was not an easy feat.  I really appreciated their willingness and eagerness to help me out.  

The servers, Victoria, Jeanne, Michael, Remus and Romain were equally professional and personable.  The service was amazing, yet understated.  Having breakfast in the executive lounge felt like being in a nice, cozy living room (although much more ""casually elegant"" than I'm used to...I could definitely get used to it :-) ).

The afternoon snacks in the executive lounge during ""plunder the pantry"" were a welcome (and very tasty) sight after a long day of sightseeing.  The executive lounge was a great place to relax and enjoy conversations with other guests and members of the international staff.  We all exchanged dining and excursion tips, which was very helpful.

On our last day at the hotel, I was on my own.  Iris was wonderful to print out a walking/underground map, complete with directions, to enable me to navigate the city with ease.  Freddie recommended a great out-of-the-way pub, where I had the best fish & chips and a pint of refreshing cider to end the whirlwind trip to London.

I'm certainly looking forward to my next trip to the 41.  I could not think of a more perfect place to stay in London (or anywhere else, for that matter).",5,2012,10,13
137,Fabulous Hotel and Staff,"We thoroughly enjoyed our beautiful, artistic room and the delicious breakfasts and late evening snacks in the lounge.  The hotel staff felt like a cross between family and personal attendants, and we can't say enough about the conviviality and professionalism of the staff. The location was convenient for us, but we would go out of our way to return to this marvelous hotel.  It was perfect in every way.",5,2012,10,12
137,Love this hotel,Staying at 41 always makes me think that this is what it must be like living in that big house just around the corner.  Service is amazing - friendly without being creepy - and you always meet the most interesting people in the executive lounge.  I've stayed there 3 times in the past year and can't wait until I can stay there again.,5,2012,10,10
137,"Lovely central hotel, amazing service","We just stayed 4 nights in the executive king room....which was lovely. I would not get a smaller room .... this was good for the 4 nights we had. The hotel is charming, but made even more so by the staff.  I would describe this as a boutique hotel with personalised service. Staff know your name, and are only very happy to assist.
Breakfast both cooked and continental is amazing, best I have ever had....a perfect way to start the day.  The continental offered great options and excellent muesli...which may not seem exciting but it is often hard to find....strawberries, blueberries, all fresh. 
There is the executive lounge which is an added bonus...you can call by for cheese or sweets, there is also a full bar, which operates by honesty box. There is a fireplace to sit next to to finish the evening with a drink from the bar.  This is a truelly lovely hotel, but made so, so special because of the staff and their genuine caring service.
Having not been to London before it was central to Apollo theatre (5 min walk) and Victoria station.
The fire alarm beeped 3 times on our last morning about 7am and the staff offered an unsolicited apology,,,,although not ideal, it was only a small blip to an otherwise perfect stay (hence I've put 4 as the sleep quality, not 5)...I would definitely stay here again, the service and breakfast was fantastic.",5,2012,10,09
137,Superb all the way,"Me and my better half stayed at the Hotel 41 for 3nights. And it was superb from beginning till the end. The staff was fantastic from the day we booked the hotel and they contacted us in the days before arrival to be sure that everything was in order. They had superb controll of everything. The transfer from and to Heathrow was as we asked for, we could ask for whatever we wanted and they could fix it ( and they was very quick to fix it), the rooms was exellent and had everything, and the area the hotel are placed is very good with only a short nice walk away from Buckingham and the shopping areas. All in all we have found the hotel we will stay in every time we are visiting London.",5,2012,10,09
137,This place is amazing!!!!!!!!,"As an avid international traveler amongst the Sofitel's, Ritz Carlton's and Four Season's this experience was exceptional.  The service was spot-on and the staff was tremendous.  I would be heartbroken to stay at any other property in London.
The staff was gracious and proactive--nigh telepathic--in anticipating our needs: from laundry (pricey; you should know that up front. But crucial, given our situation) to fresh towels, to extraordinary flexibility regarding maid service (I was sleeping in at ridiculous, unpredictable hours!) to cough drops and tea and extra blankets and a thousand other small but much-appreciated kindnesses.

This place is amazing!!!!!!!! had an amazing time there, highly recommend.",5,2012,10,08
137,Exceeded high expectations!,"My wife and I recently took our first trip to London. We were thoroughly impressed with our Hotel 41 experience. The great location was within walking distance of so many must-see sights. The spotless room was by far the most stylish we'd ever seen, and it was loaded with innumerable amenities (e.g., fireplace, heated towel rack, office supplies, etc). Perhaps the most notable feature was the unparalleled level of service. From the charming personnel in the lobby to the attentive servers in the Executive Lounge to the accommodating assistant manager (Monika), all went far above and beyond. There is no question in our minds that when we eventually return for our second visit to London that we will be well-cared for in the tucked-away secret at 41 Buckingham Palace Road! Highly recommended!",5,2012,10,07
137,A Special Place,"We are Londoners and wanted a special night away together - and 41 delivered all we could have hoped for.  Lovely people, special ambiance, and a sense of being made special - all the time.  We have no hesitation in recommending 41 - we enjoyed our stay there more than perhaps any other hotel.",5,2012,10,07
137,Pampered like The Queen,"We recently visited London, 2 days on the beginning of our trip going to Croatia and Italy. We stayed at the next door Hotel Rubens, which was quite lovely comfortable and very well located.  Because we loved Rubens, while there we tried to rebook for our return trip, they were totally booked; however a lovely lady there suggested their ""sister hotel, 41,"" which has a separate entrance and elevator to ""the fifth floor"" and a very different world. Welcomed with sparkling wine, invited for snakes which were a meal, treated to a lovely lite breakfast and night caps.  Beds turned down, heated towel racks, bottled water to your hearts desire and much more.  The staff was the most ""can do people"" ever!  They can get you tickets to anything and are so wonderful at making you feel welcome all with a smile. We loved this place!",5,2012,10,05
137,PERFECTION!,"Not a fault. Worth every penny and more. Perfect for sight seeing without travelling far. Sooooo luxurious, rooms are beautiful and staff are very helpful. Will visit again with family or with friends.",5,2012,10,05
137,Location Location Location - plus great service,"If you are visiting London for romance, pleasure and site seeing, you can't go past Hotel 41. Situated right where all the action is, near Victoria Station and Buckingham Palace, I was transported to a wonder world - this was my first visit to London. My wife and I were looked after with great care. Highly recommended, the hotel won't dissappoint.",5,2012,10,04
137,Charming and lovely hotel,We spent only 2 days in this charming hotel as we were passing through London.  The facilities are cozy and well thought out with a lovely dining/social area.  The hotel has only 20 or so rooms.  Our room was somewhat small but the standard of the facilities and the in-room chimney made up for it!  Location is outstanding being rot next to Buckingham Palace and walking distance from Hyde Park and Oxford Street.  Highly recommend this hotel!,5,2012,09,24
137,expensive but very good,this place is located in very attreactive place with all amenities nearby especially near the tube station. its expensive but you pay for what you get. great staffs. rooms are clean and tidy. would come again on our next anniversary.,5,2012,09,21
137,"Love, love, LOVE the Hotel 41","My experience at the Hotel 41 is unsurpassed by any property I’ve visited before (and I get to travel a lot!).  Particularly, Monika was an absolute jewel and a new friend.  I was celebrating my birthday while in London and Monika arranged for all of my dinners based on her exquisite taste.  I travel alone, but on this trip I was never alone…thanks to Monika, Magda, William, the two lovely ladies who greeted me every time I returned to the hotel and the wait staff in the Executive Lounge.  I appreciated all of the little touches:  little birthday cake, the birthday rose, the turndown service with the “Sleep” spray, the canapés, the olives, the slippers, the bottled water that was handed to me as I left the hotel.  All of it made this birthday the best one in recent memory.  I simply cannot say enough about this hotel--the best!",5,2012,09,19
137,Good Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for one night. Whilst the the quality of the service is excellent, I found it extremely odd that this hotel did not have a designated check-in/check-out area which was done at the time in the executive lounge. 

We stayed at other Red Carnations Hotels, and I don't think that Hotel 41 is in any way better than the Chesterfield Hotel or the Montague on the Gardens. 

A lot has been said in the reviews of Hotel 41 about the quality of the service and the excellent staff. I agree that the service is excellent and the staff helpful, however, I found the whole experience a little bit overbearing. It seemed that the staff wanted to have a long conversation every time they poured a new glass of wine. I, for one, prefer that wonderful British formality where the staff do everything to please, but quietly. Other Red Carnation Hotels that we stayed in achieve this balance much better.

The room we stayed in was great! Clean, quite spacious, so no complaints there.

Overall, this is a very good hotel, so maybe my expectations were too high because of its ranking.",4,2012,09,19
137,"Loved, Loved,Loved it!!!","Stayed at the beautiful Hotel 41 for two nights. Arrived from Boston into Heathrow at about 6:30 AM. Decided to run over to the hotel to drop our bags, never expecting a room to be ready at that time. They not only had our room ready for a 7:30 AM check in but everyone was so nice, friendly and helpful and the room was quiet and lovely. The location of the hotel is within walking distance to many tourist attractions and very close to two tube stations.

I can not wait to get back to beautiful London and Hotel 41!",5,2012,09,17
137,Amazing!,"Oh my God, this place is the best hotel I've ever stayed at! The rooms are spacious, spotless and nicely decorated! All the staff was just amazing, everyone was friendly and helpful. I will definitely stay there again, thank you 41!",5,2012,09,16
137,"Great hotel, excellent staff","Staying there now as I write this review from the Executive Lounge - relaxing and having a drink. This hotel is excellent - surpassed only by the staff who are personable, friendly, and very helpful (what more can you ask...).  Hands-down, my favorite hotel in London. ",5,2012,09,15
137,"Yes, this hotel deserves its #1 spot on best hotels in London","It exceeded my expectations, and that is after having read the glowing reviews on Tripadvisor.  Truly wonderful service and you feel pampered. We stayed for 3 nights in September and did the Best of British package. the tea master class was such a fun experience.  They just have all the right touches to make you feel pampered. Worth the price. Central location was great - we walked to most of the sights and places we visited. I could go on and on but I don't want to be redundant from past reviews. You won't be disappointed.",5,2012,09,14
137,FANTASTIC!!!   Nicest Hotel we've ever stayed in!,"It was our first trip to London and I used Tripadvisor for the planning.  Hotel 41 is everything everyone said and MORE!  From the minute we arrived to the minute we left they made us feel special.  We were directly across from the Royal Mews and they made us feel like royalty!  Our room was gorgeous and spotless!  The bed was incredibly comfortable and the pillow menu was so impressive!  Our bathroom was fantastic - 2 Showers!!  We were greeted with a large bowl of strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and raspberries shortly after arrival!  I mentioned that I was gluten free and they actually made 2 separate trays for our tea!  They provided gluten free toast at breakfast - we had egg white omelets every morning which were delicious!  They had a well stocked fridge with water and other drinks and pantry full of goodies all day long.  The staff was so friendly and helpful.  WE LOVED IT!!  We were so sorry to leave!",5,2012,09,14
137,Unadulterated luxury and the best staff in the world,I could go on all day and night but this is quite simply one of the best hotels you will ever visit in your life. World class service and the most charming staff I have ever met. An amazing experience.,5,2012,09,13
137,excellent staff let down by a very average hotel!!,"This hotel is so over-rated!!

My lady friend and I stayed here for two nights in when we went to go see Madonna at Hyde Park in July of this year.

Briefly, because I do not really like to write bad reviews, I will list the faults of the hotel: breakfast is minimal (a member of staff tried to make me pay extra for porridge!!); you cannot watch the television in your bedroom from your bed; the toilet flushing system in our room broke; the sink plug did not work; the ipod docking station was not user-friendly; the bedroom was barely 4* standard.

This hotel relies heavily on the excellent service provided by the dedicated executive lounge team!!

I repeat, the quality of service is absolutely first class; whereas the hotel itself is 4* at best!!",3,2012,09,12
137,Beyond Expectations,"LOVE Hotel 41!!

My husband and I cannot say enough positive things about this hotel. We stayed there for 5 nights at the end of August and were so impressed with the amazing service, executive lounge, and great location.

For the price, the inclusion of the executive lounge is a huge bonus; they always have a little something to snack on, complimentary water, and a self-serve, honor system bar.

Just steps from Buckingham Palace and a couple miles from Victoria Station, you can cut through the park and walk over to the shops at Bond Street and other sites of interest.

The staff were amazing! So friendly, always there to help with directions, recommendations, and any little need you may have. For example, I needed a quick manicure before my dinner and I told them I wanted to walk vs. take a taxi (being in a slightly remote area in-between The Palace and Victoria Station - I thought this might be a challenge). However, the door man told me of a place in a commercial building and he personally walked me there (about 5 minutes) as he knew it would be challenging to find for a first-timer. I was so impressed! Such service you rarely see these days. 

This hotel is a must if you plan to stay in London - not in the heart of everything - but we prefer a little peace and quiet with the ability to easily access the action.",4,2012,09,11
137,Fantastic hotel,"We stayed just one night at 41 for a wedding anniversary and are now saving for a return visit. We could not fault the hotel, we shared afternoon tea with our daughter and son in law and whilst we were enjoying the tea, easily comparable to The Ritz, the staff were busy turning our already luxurious room into a romantic haven! Our daughter requested the package on the day and at no notice at all the staff added rose petals, flowers, candles, champagne etc, including a personally decorated chocolate confection! It looked magical on our return but the nicest thing was that all the staff knew of our surprise and shared in our enjoyment.Customer service and attention to detail was the best we have ever encountered and because the hotel is small it had such a lovely homely feel. Thanks to other travellers for their reviews which alerted me to this wonderful place!",5,2012,09,10
137,Still the best hotel in London,"This hotel simply is our dream hotel in London, we only stay in Boutique hotels and this is arguably one of the best in the world. The rooms are stunning the service impecable. I cant wait to stay again which will be by the end of the year.

We had a problem with our restaurant booking at the Ivy and the hotel arranged a table in the Library restaurant next door, which was lovely everything I could ask for.",5,2012,09,10
137,Like being at home...,"We stayed for three delightful nights and am already looking forward to going back. The ambiance, the staff, the rooms - all superb/top of class. We were originally planning on staying in the Corinthia (which is also a delightful hotel in a great location), but I'm really glad we stayed at the 41. Due to its offering (particularly the size and ""homely"" feel) it is a really unique proposition in London. I really haven't come across anything similar before and will now not be looking to stay anywhere else when in town.",5,2012,09,09
137,"London ""Royal"" Hotel","WOW!!  I truly feel - we know how ""royalty"" is treated in London....for from the minute we walked into this lovely hotel- we all were treated as if we were the only people in the hotel.  The hotel is just beautiful, the rooms and suites are very well done and extremely comfortable - but it is the thoughtful, creative and personable things they do for each guest that makes it such an AMAZING hotel.  It is defintely a hidden gem - and selfishly I hope it will always be that way!!
We defintely are planning a return trip to Hotel 41 - soon!!  Enjoy!!!",5,2012,09,09
137,A Truly Extraordinary Experience,"It is so difficult to express how extraordinary our experience was with Hotel 41 without it sounding hyperbolic, but it is, quite simply, the most incredible hotel at which we have ever had the pleasure to stay.  It is not just a coincidence that the hotel is located just down the street from Buckingham Palace, as you are truly treated as royalty when you are there.

The room  was beyond beautiful, ultra plush and comfortable, pristinely clean and roomy.  The food and drink in the Executive Lounge were five star, but it is the service that makes this property 'sui generis', truly in a category by itself.  

Frederic, the manager, has a 'team' working for him that could not have been more attentive, friendly or efficient. Our every single need and desire was met by the staff, especially Romain, Iris, Lindsey and Kamal; each of whom we felt had become a dear friend by the time we left.  The only down side to the experience is knowing that we are forever spoiled by the kind of exquisite treatment we were afforded at this truly extraordinary Hotel.  We cannot imagine staying anywhere else.  

This was our first trip to London, we have fallen in love with this beautiful city, and will certainly be back.  When we do, we will absolutely be staying at 41.  The #1 ranking it enjoys on Trip Advisor is absolutely earned.  You owe it to yourself to experience the 'State of the Art' of accommodations.   Thank you to Frederic and everyone at 41 for the most sublimely perfect vacation we could have ever hoped for.",5,2012,09,09
137,"I want it to remain our secret, but it's just too good to keep quiet!","Based on the Trip Advisor scores, which made it the favourite London hotel of reviewers, we recently spent two wonderful nights in this oasis of calm and sophistication ideally positioned at the rear of Buckingham Palace. I don't want to spoil it for future clients by disclosing some of the thoughtful and unique touches that ""41"" do for their guests, but suffice to say, you will love them all. 41 is a relatively small and intimate hotel, and you are ""buzzed in"" as you would be when seeking to enter a high end jewellers and you are met everytime, by a genuinely friendly member of the reception staff who often knows you by name, and enquires how your day has been. The actual reception and check in desk , and all of the rooms are located on the top floor of the building which is shared by The Rubens Hotel, which is in the same hotel group, but in fairness not in the same class by any stretch of the imagination. (The two hotels are completely separate and despite occupying the same building, never the twaiin shall meet.) The check-in desk is located in the Executive lounge which is reminiscent of a country house library, and where guests chill in a very calm and relaxing environment on plush upholstered furniture surrounded by rich dark wood, mirrors and ambient lighting, beneath an illuminated deep skylight and opulent candelabras. What needs to be said is that Hotel 41 is not stuffy, not pretentious and a complete home from home, and you will soon feel like a valued customer and a close family friend. Special thank yous have to be given to Monika (you know who you are x) who resolved a small problem for us, in a way that we have never experienced in any hotel  before, and her kindness and thoughtfulness was genuine and above and beyond the call of duty. Michael and Romain also treated us, and everyone else within the hotel, like royalty, their attention to detail surpassed any service we have ever experienced, and for the first time in our lives, despite using alleged 5 star accommodation in the past, we truly realised what five star service is, and what we have been missing all these years. Every member of staff, from the housekeeping staff, to the manager, takes the time to exchange pleasantries and to ask if they can do anything for you. Frederick, the resident manager, has obviously engendered an ethos of total customer satisfaction into his young members of staff, and whatever he is doing, he is doing it well and has the recipe for success. On the subject of recipes, we experienced a delicious unique canape that delighted us both and my wife asked Michael if the chef would be good enough to let us have the recipe. Michael took the pains to ensure that the recipe was with us before we left, astonishing service! I refuse to apologise for being so effusive in our praise for 41 but I haven't even touched on the rooms yet. They were divine, clean beyond anything I have ever seen before in a hotel, and the beds were incredibly comfortable, the showers were an absolute deluge and the decor, styling and finishing touches were just wonderful. A minor criticism was that the television and media system could learn a thing or two from the Apple systems employed by other hotel chains, and the charge for a film was pretty extortionate, but a minor matter. The ""Whatever, whenever"" button on the phone pretty much tells you everything you need to know about this amazing hotel.  Our fear is that we wont be able to get into it in the future as the world will have learned of this secret, but the rest of the world deserves to experience this level of care and attention. 41 is not cheap but some sage once said, ""Quality is remembered long after the price is forgotten"". It was worth every penny. Even if we have to sleep in a broom cupboard, we will be back!",5,2012,09,08
137,Wonderful!,My husband and I stayed for one night to celebrate my birthday. Simply the best hotel we have stayed in managing to combine thoughtful luxury and cosiness. Wish we could have stayed longer and hope to return at some stage. Would thoroughly recommend for a special treat as not cheap.,5,2012,09,06
137,I want to live here!!!!,"I don't think I could ever do 41 justice in words.  From the moment we walked thru the door, we felt that we were the only ones that mattered in the hotel.  The staff  was incredible.  The rooms decorated beautifully.  The special touches that the hotel provided were a welcome surprise.  My husband and I have traveled a great deal, all over the world, and I still can say that 41 is my   favorite hotel.  We will be planning our next vacation in an area where we are able to stay at a Red Carnation hotel.    I wish our stay in London was at the end of our trip.  The experience spoiled us for the est of our trip.",5,2012,09,05
137,Bed and breakfast like charm,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 for our anniversary. It was such a wonderful experience with the most personal service. The staff was so personable and friendly. Our room was near the Executive Lounge which gave us the feeling of a bed and breakfast.  

Each night we went into the lounge and grabbed some complementary treats for a midnight snack.  Every evening the hotel stocks free ice cream, chips, chocolates, meats and cheeses for their guests. We were always welcomed with friendly faces and personal greetings, and the staff was more than happy to accomodate every request.

We have stayed at many fine hotels but we feel this was our favorite one because it was not only beautiful but catered exceptionally to any and all of our needs.",5,2012,09,04
137,5 Star Quality with a personnel touch,Quality hotel for a special occasion or simply to treat your self while on business. The experience starts with a glass of champagne on arrival in the executive lounge. Staff are very attentive and friendly. Surroundings and atmosphere are stylish. Breakfast in the executive lounge is not to be missed. Rooms are styled on a black and white theme and are very well appointed. Would recommend for the discerning traveller. ,5,2012,09,01
137,Best Anniversary Experience!,"My husband and I stayed for two nights in March 2012. Best choice ever to celebrate our 25th anniversary! Only wished we could have stayed longer. Awesome from the moment you step in, you know you have walked into a magical place. Impecabble on every aspect. Complimentary champagne on arrival and the rest does not disappoint. The staff is what really makes this place special, they all deserve a pay raise!  Location is excellent, breakfast is delicious. You almost hate to leave in the morning, you feel so comfortable in your hotel. Do not miss the tea service under any circumstance! We are still talking about it months later!  Five stars all the way!!!  Thank you Hotel 41!",5,2012,09,01
137,First Class,"We recently had the pleasure of a 3 night stay at Hotel 41 to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary and it was just perfect.  From the minute we arrived until we sadly departed we were made to feel special and nothing was too much trouble.  All of the staff we encountered were cheerful, friendly, and attentive, without being over bearing.  

On the night of our anniversary we returned to a rosepetal covered room complete with candles and bubbles, a really lovely touch and very much appreciated!  We had also received a lovely little anniversary cake with our breakfast that morning which sadly I never got around to eating as was so full from the amazing cooked breakfast!!

If you want to stay in a big busy hotel in London there are probably thousands to choose from, if you want 5 star treatment, peace and quiet and pure relaxation then Hotel 41 is a must.  

We look forward to returning sooner rather than later!!",5,2012,08,29
137,What an amazing hotel,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 for 3 nights in late June/early July this year.  We loved everything about it - our room, the hotel location, and most of all the wonderful staff.  We travel quite a bit, for both business and personal trips, and this was one of our top hotel experiences ever.  From the time we checked in through the time we had to leave to go home, all of the staff was so friendly, helpful and professional.  They always went above and beyond. We will definitely go back.",5,2012,08,28
137,Simply amazing!,"Great service, great location, great staff! Champagne on arrival and a complimentary buffet in the welcoming lounge. All the Staff are helpful, polite and friendly. The atmosphere is relaxed yet luxurious and the breakfasts are to die for. Cannot recommend highly enough. ",5,2012,08,28
137,"Quirky Rooms, Awesome Service","My husband and I spent Christmas in London, and given the number of places closed during that week (the wisdom of our trip timing was debatable), we spent a lot of time at the Hotel 41. The staff could not have been kinder or more accommodating. We loved our Deco-inspired room, and its small size didn't bother us because we had access to the cozy common area with all of its lovely teas, cocktails and snacks. One caveat -- we would not recommend the adjacent restaurant (within a sister property next door to the 41), where we had Christmas Eve and Christmas meals. To be fair ... perhaps the food is fine at other times (non-holidays).",5,2012,08,26
137,Our wonderful stay at Hotel 41,"From the moment we arrived at Hotel 41, we were treated like Royalty. From the friendly professional staff to the elegant but comfortable surroundings - nothing was too much trouble. Hotel 41 made our London break an unforgettable experience and we can't wait to return.",5,2012,08,17
137,A Gem In The City of London Not to be Missed,"We had the privilege to stay at Hotel 41 during the Olympic Games.  This is a very unusual time for a property and often hard to meet normal standards as delivery, traffic patterns and security often add challenges.  This was our 11th Olympics and the Hotel, and Staff far exceeded our expectations.  Last Games we were at The Four Seasons and these guys far exceeded that experience.  We will absolutely be back and hope to do business at the hotel too!  Service by Frederic and his team was Gold Medal all the way.",5,2012,08,15
137,Good and cozy hotel,"I stood for one night in Hotel 41. The overall expression - 41 is great and luxury hotel. Perfect service. But two things was not so perfect - the room was not ready and I waited for about an hour (to be honest, it was very comfortable waiting); the temperature knob in the shower was broken and I spend about 10 funny minutes trying to get comfortable water temperature.
And the usual thing in almost all hotels - the bed was short for me (I'm 194cm tall).",4,2012,08,13
137,My Second Splendid Visit In As Many Months,"After having stayed here two months previous, in April, '41' had left a fantastic impression on me, so when I had to come back to London, choosing a hotel was a no brainer. You see, 41 did not only  provide the sheer luxury one would expect from a property of this stature, but moreover, the service provided at this boutique hotel was truly second to none. Indeed, in all their proprieties, it seems that Red Carnation has signaled the one most important factor in creating the finest hotels in the world, and it is the people who work there, for you can have grand lobbies and fabulously appointed rooms, but without spectacular, personal, and even somewhat intimate service, everything amounts to nothing. Yes, 41 is wonderfully appointed. The Executive Lounge is just the right size, and overall, a pleasant place to be. The rooms are some of the very best I have experienced in London, but more than anything, it is the people, like Remus, Magda, Monica and Freddie that make 41 surly, one of the best hotels in the world. I've stayed in hotels the world over, and yet, I don't recall the name of one staff member from these properties, not one- with 41, the names come back like a cast list from a film, as the staff provide such personalised service... here are but a few of the examples enjoyed during my stay: at one point, my friend expressed his wish to go to Madame Tussauds, it was quite late and at about 1 in the morning I spoke to the reception in regards to how a ticket would work, etc, and promised to come back in the morning, when the museum would actually be open for more information. Come morning, and an envelope beneath the door, discreetly marked with my name had two all-day tickets for Madame Tassauds in them... splendid. 
     That, however, doesn't come close to the wonderful service I experienced when I hurt my knee. Having headed out to the Prince of Wales theatre to watch ''Mamma Mia'', I had unwittingly locked my knee and fallen a flight of stairs. The next day, my knee still ached, and Remus, the Guest Experience Manager at the hotel, not only contacted NHS and got them to get a doctor to call me in order to save time, but once I needed a knee brace, sent out the bottom receptionist, a fine Indian fellow by the name of Thomas, out to personally scout every pharmacy in the area. Once they got it, there was no delivery charge- that my friends, is truly service. 
    I have indeed focused on the service here, but the food too was sublime- everything about 41 is top notch, everything is great, and indeed I did return two weeks after that stay... and shall return again soon enough. Why anyone would not enjoy this hotel is beyond me.",5,2012,08,10
137,Rivals the Ritz and Four Seasons here in the states...,"The attention to detail by the staff is second to none.  Frederic, the hotel manager is unbelievable he is there to deliver at your every request.  The hotel only has 28-30rooms and this is great b/c it allows the staff to cater to your every need.  
The cleanliness of the hotel is amazing!  Slippers, robes, flowers, classical music, your beverage of choice bedside every evening for you.
The executive lounge is a great place to relax, eat great food or enjoy the nightly snacks beverages all included in your stay.
Location was great right across street from buckingham palace and the tube station just around the corner 2min walk tops.",5,2012,08,10
137,London for the Olympics and a stay at the Hotel 41,"In July of 2012 we made our reservations for the 2012 Olympic tickets that included a stay in a hotel unknown to us – Hotel 41. Looking at the website and especially the Youtube video on their landing page told us we were in for a treat, but nothing we read or saw could prepare us for the wonderful stay we enjoyed. The hotel is located in the shadow of Buckingham Palace, just across the street from the Royal Stables. Hyde Park is a few minutes away on foot as is Green Park and St. jame’s Park, and of course the changing of the guard at the Palace is even closer. 
The hotel is tucked in between the Rubens Hotel and a great little bar – the Bbar. All three are part of the Ruebens family and charges can be made at all three and posted to you 41 account.
The arrival lobby is small and always locked for safety, but also staffed. From there the main executive lobby is on the 5th floor and serves as the concieriege, front desk, breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack area – all very cozy and friendly.
Each room is decorated in black and white and each has a unique 41 twist to make them slightly different.
Our stay was longer than most and after a few nights the wonder Monika who is the assistant manager, showed us her favorite room – number 4101 with a view of Buckingham Palace Road and the Palace Mews. She was so excited when we readily agreed to a quick move to this more open a spacious room on the same floor. In fact all the rooms are on the 5th floor, so negotiating from room to the lounge bar is a snap.
All the staff were as gracious and charming as they could be during our stay, but Monika became our favorite immediately. As we returned from our Olympic venues we would share our photos with whoever was on duty at the time as we had a bit of  refreshment. The bar is on an honor system, but we rarely found a time when the staff weren't there to help us out. Michael was our number one barman and quickly learned our standard drinks.
Breakfast was the only meal we consistently ate in the lounge as we were out and about in the city and at the Olympic venues. Service was as perfect as the poached eggs!
One consideration for guests is that one never sees a check to sign as you are quickly recognized and the charges are discreetly posted to your room. As I approached checkout I made three envelopes for housekeeping, front desk and service.  Each was filed with varying amounts, with the least for housekeeping and the most for front desk. Service was just slightly behind front desk. Your mileage may vary.
On our last day we had a special treat to tour the honeymoon suite with a fully shaded glass skylight operated by remote control. It would a special place for a special occasion.
After dozens of trips to London, staying at some of the biggest names, we will be hooked forever on the charm of this lovely boutique gem in the West End of London.

137,STAY AWAY...because I want to make sure I can always stay here,"I've stayed at Hotel 41 several times over the years and never left without feeling relaxed and with a smile. It is pricey but well worth it in my mind. The staff and the ""quaint"" feeling of the hotel make it perfect for travel. Not for the wallet conscious, but ideal for those special times.",5,2012,08,08
137,Royal Treatment,"The staff at 41 is the best. They cater to you in the impressive ""executive lounge"" as though you are a VIP. It is a guilty pleasure that spoils you forever. The attentiveness makes The Ritz look like Motel 6. The location across from the Royal Mews of Buckingham Palace places you within a few minute walk from the Underground at Victoria Station as well as Hyde Park. The room had an understated elegance and I loved how quiet it was. This is the only hotel that I have felt compelled to review... it's that good.",5,2012,08,07
137,Fantastic,"Not much to say, this hotel was the very best and we loved every minute of our stay! The service, the room, the staff were all amazing, we will be back and we would highly recommend it to anyone else! Please message me if you have any questions.",5,2012,08,06
137,Birthday celebration 2012,"Fantastic services at this hotel, if you want five stars stay here as it’s the best.  We celebrated a 40th Birthday and were treated so well.  Our daughter was made to feel like a princess throughout our stay.
Our room service evening meal was amazing.  The staff went to great efforts with candelabra on the table and red rose petals all over, really lovely touch.  We also had a lovely birthday cake and even a gift, very thoughtful. 
This hotel is a great location with impeccable service.  We will stay again as often as we can. 
Thank you to all.",5,2012,08,06
137,"Well done, 41!","My partner and I enjoy staying in luxury hotels when we travel. To us, the hotel is half the fun of our vacation. So I did A LOT of research before our trip to London. As usual, I looked at all of the large luxury hotels in the area like the Dorchester, the Four Seasons and Claridge’s which were all enticing but then I started reading all of the reviews on Trip Advisor, raving about the 41. I was skeptical about it living up to all the hype but boy did it! 

We stayed five nights at the 41 hotel in May, 2012. We loved every minute of it from the time we checked in to the time we checked out and here’s why… Everyone at the 41 seems to truly enjoy their jobs and I mean everyone! The moment we walked into the small lobby we were greeted happily by the receptionist and led upstairs to the “executive lounge” where we were seated and asked if we would like a glass of champagne while they checked us in. I was ready to decline thinking that a free glass of champagne was most likely going to be awful but my partner said, “Yes!” Two rather large glasses were brought out, another sign that it must be so awful they’re trying to get rid of it, I thought. But it was delicious! Then we were asked if we’d like to sit and enjoy the glass in the lounge or take it to our room. We wanted to see the room and off we went. I booked a junior suite because I liked the idea of a sitting area in addition to the bedroom. On their website, this sitting area appears much larger than the room we got, showing a couch, table and two chairs. Ours was much smaller with only two chairs and a table between them. There was no room for a couch. We probably got this room because I booked it online and it is the room set aside for the internet rate. I don’t really know. I didn’t even notice this until we got home. But the room was so cute and the staff was so wonderful that it really wasn’t an issue in the end. If having a couch matters to you, make sure to ask before you book.

We don’t like to get ready before we have breakfast, so we had room service every morning of our stay. The food was not only delicious but it arrived in about 20 minutes and everything was hot! I have NEVER stayed in any hotel were the food was delivered that fast, hot and without any mistakes!

Every day after enjoying the sights of London, we would return to the 41 and head up to the lounge for snacks and champagne. Our favorite champagne is Veuve Clicquot and they made sure to have two of those large glasses waiting for us! Of course, we had to pay for them but usually when you order a glass of Veuve in other luxury hotels, they give you the tiniest of glasses! Not at the 41! Needless to say, this made me very happy!

The staff always addressed us by name, knew what we liked and made a real effort to make our stay as wonderful as possible. I really can’t say enough about this hotel. Oh, and I forgot to mention that it’s centrally located to everything.  We walked to just about every sight.

As I said at the beginning, we usually seek out the larger luxury hotels when we travel but I’m so glad that we decided to try this small luxury boutique hotel this time. What a welcome change! 

We’ve traveled all over Europe and have stayed at some of the very best hotels throughout.  The 41 Hotel is absolutely one of them. Though we love trying new hotels and will continue to do so in other countries, the only one we will stay in, in London, is The 41. Well done, 41!",5,2012,08,03
137,Well good!,"My wife and I returned here and this time we stayed in a Junior Suite which was wonderful.
Frederique the Manager and Monika the Assistant Manager made our return stay very very comfortable indeed and we loved every minute.
This hotel offers such a wonderful experience so different to any other offer available in London and is a really great  place to stay.
We had afternoon tea there this time which was very nice indeed and enjoyed the canapes in the early evening, as did our son's who joined us early evening.
Location is wonderful and the service offered by all the staff is really first class.
Hope to return again for another special occasion.",5,2012,07,31
137,Excellence Personified...with one exception.,"Monica, Remus and Stephan a huge hug and thank-you for the excellent experience!

As an avid international traveler amongst the Sofitel's, Ritz Carlton's and Four Season's this experience was exceptional.  The service was spot-on and the staff was tremendous.  I would be heartbroken to stay at any other property in London.

As every room is different Monica ensured that ""pickier"" tastes were satisfied and proceeded to show me three different rooms that varied in size and views of the city.  We found the perfect room and appreciated the soap menu and pillow menus' which were promptly delivered after ordering.

Although expensive, breakfast was phenomenal.  No comparison and almost worth the 25 pound admission.

Although the bar is well stocked I have a serious problem with Hotel 41's prices and think it is disingenuous to offer beverages at stratospheric rate.  I saw comments on tripadvisor from prior guests that thought it was cheap for Hotel 41 to charge but I was aloof to just how egregious the pricing was; e.g. four glasses of champagne averaged 30 pound per glass!  I am encouraging Hotel 41 to re-think their approach as it impacts the near perfection that the staff strives toward with every guest.

My wife and I appreciated the charm and thoughtful experience from the lovely staff at Hotel 41 and we felt honored to have met them.  We will be back for Wimbledon 2013.",5,2012,07,29
137,Great hotel,"Stayed here few nights with some of my friends and had lovely experience. Very good hotel, clean and tidy cosy rooms,spacious bathrooms, excellent service and helpful staff. The rooms are of a decent size and very well cleaned, sheets were cleaned and towels were changed daily. Highly recommended!",5,2012,07,28
137,One word...Fabulous!,"By far, Hotel 41 is our favorite hotel EVER! The service is impeccable and the property (location, amenities and rooms) is amazing. We were treated like royalty. The staff could not do enough for us and treated us like we were the only guests in the hotel. Penhaligon's toiletries (my personal favorite) were a nice touch. This hotel is simply top notch luxury!!! We will most definitely be bck soon!",5,2012,07,28
137,Incredible service,"Can't recommend it highly enough. Nothing is too much trouble, the staff to guest ratio is very high, the Executive Room is a beautiful, lounge, particularly in the winter, with the log fire going, The pantry bar is great, scones and clotted cream all afternoon, penhaligons toiletries and bottles and bottles of it. We stayed in a split level junior suite - great feeling of space, but a bit inconvenient to have to keep walking up and down the stairs to fetch water etc. Probably would not pay the extra next time for the suite, but would stay in  standard double instead. It was very very noisy from the traffic outside, central London location notwitstanding. The bathroom was beautifully finished and the quality of the bed linen superbe. Glass of champagne of arrival, never a feeling of being hurried or bothered by anyone. Boutique feel, absolutely lovely, within walking distance of Victoria train station. Personally, I would prefer that the room service breakfast was a little less breezy, sprightly and cheerful, but that's because I'm not when I have just woken up .Loved it.",5,2012,07,27
137,Amazing service,"The rooms are nice but the best part of this hotel is the service! Every time you go into the executive lounge they are extremely helpful and willing to help in any way they can. We had planned our restaurants beforehand, but if you are not a pre-planner they will be very helpful. The food and drinks in the lounge are also great, an amazing breakfast as well!",5,2012,07,25
137,A really wonderful experience,"We loved our stay at Hotel 41. Although we were exhausted after our long flight from Australia, we could not resist when they said that it was their tradition to serve Champagne on arrival in their lounge. Even my husband who stays regularly at beautiful hotels loved the intimacy and club-like feel. Breakfast was lovely with a la carte hot food rather than hours old buffet. We loved the plunder the pantry idea, but unfortunately were too busy in London to sit around relaxing in the serene lounge fully enjoying it. The staff were young and fantastic and it was an excellent location.",4,2012,07,25
137,"Excellent service, charming room, great food.","Can't wait to visit here again.. this is my new favorite hotel in London.
It's definitely boutique so if you are looking for a big hotel this isn't the place.... but the service is perfect and I love raiding the pantry... the bread basket, cheeses, meats, ice cream...you don't need to go out to dinner!  Location can't be beat either, especially for walking through the parks, Sloane Square, Belgravia and West End.",5,2012,07,25
137,"high expectations, effortlessly surpassed","My wife and I kicked off our honeymoon at Hotel 41 in May this year, and we were looking for something a little bit special given the circumstances.  Having looked at the website, my expectations were set pretty high, and from the second we entered Hotel 41 they were surpassed, and by some way too.  
I stay in hotels regularly on business, and have enjoyed some of the UK's well-renowned hotels, but Hotel 41 is in an entirely different league.
From the exquisite attention to detail, to the unrivalled levels of personal service, to the quiet, cocooned atmosphere the whole place exudes, this is by far the best hotel I've ever experienced and we will definitely be back.
The staff, from the manager, to the chef, to the front of house team could not do enough to make us feel like we were their only guests.  An amazing amount of effort was put in to make us feel special which was a truly perfect way to start our honeymoon.  Two more extremely satisfied customers.",5,2012,07,24
137,The difference in the details,"We just stayed two nights with 41. Wonderful experience. We stayed in an executive hospitality suite which had a bed set up for my son in a small room with dining table and a separate bath.  Our room was long and had a dining table, sitting area, two televisions and a nice bathroom.  The staff was phenomenal and called us by name. (thanks Monika and Stefan!). The ""executive lounge"" is a lovely place for breakfast, tea or cocktails.  Location was great- across from Buckingham Palace and lots to eat and drink in the area.  Highly recommend!",5,2012,07,20
137,Very Cozy,I have visited this hotel many times over the past 11 years. I do not the fact the hotel only has a small amount of guest rooms and the ambiance of the library/lounge. The service is good and local knowledge in this property is okay.Guest rooms are a little small. The overall package however is one that is very good you will feel more like a house guest than a hotel guest. Privacy is quite good as it is tucked away from all the noisy  tourists. I would definitely suggest this property for those going to London on business or pleasure.,4,2012,07,19
137,THE BEST - MUST GO,I had a wonderful trip to London - I am a bit of a Hotel snob as I travel for buisness and what I liked most was i didnt feel as if I were in a Hotel - Very warm and cozy feeling.  Service was excellent.  The plunder the pantry was a bit fancy for my taste - Some American Junk food would be nice - for those of us that do not have such a gourmet palate.  They arranged for a car to pick us up and that was nice - and saved time.  Loved the bed (I have a bad back).  Zillions of amenities in the room.  It was fun just searching the room and finding little things everywhere. I kept the hotel room key - and have a laugh and smile everytime I see it in my wallet - I think I will keep it forever as a reminder of an excellent trip....be prepared to spend some $$$$ but worth it,5,2012,07,18
137,wow wow wow,"What a wonderful place this is. My partner and I attended the Madonna concert and as a surprise I booked this amazing hotel for the night...and wish it was for the week. From the moment we arrived we were attended to with a wonderful, warm and friendly greeting. All the staff are so professional yet approachable and kind. A special mention to Fredrique..a man who clearly knows how to make you feel at ease and special. Thank you Fredrique.
The Hotel..Stunning..wonderful decor, attention to detail (as were the staff)
The room..the phone has a 'whenever, whatever' button with those exact words on it..I kid you not..and they mean exactly that.  The bed was so comfortable..the bathroom was gorgeous with a great selection of creams and potions. 5 mins into our stay we had a knock on the door to be greeted by two members of staff with a large tray of soaps to choose from..;.yes, you heard me...total luxury at its very best..the towels and bath robes are of high quality, as were the materials throughout the room
The food..Fresh, hot, high quality, and nothing is too much if you wish to divert from the menu..they really will bend over backwards for you
We could go on and on about this place...you have to stay there to believe it, an absolute must....no, its not cheap, but if you want an amazing experience with wonderful surroundings, a warm personal touch, and luxury at its best, save up, it is worth every single penny",5,2012,07,18
137,Best Hotel in the UK,"This is the first time I've written a review on tripadvisor but wanted to share our experience because we were so impressed. Me and my boyfriend have just come back from a short trip to London where we stopped at Hotel 41 and have never been so sad to leave a hotel. From the moment we arrived we were treat like royalty. The staff go above and beyond to make your stay exceptional and the hotel itself is amazing. Stay here, you will not be disappointed!!!",5,2012,07,17
137,Truly a special place!,"Every business is about people and the staff at the Hotel 41 is simply amazing.  I cannot remember staying at a hotel anywhere in the world where every single member of the staff from top to bottom was as kind, helpful, polite, and accommodating as the Hotel 41. We came as travelers and we left as friends. The physical property itself is quite comfortable with a common 2 floor room used for meals, relaxing, tea, etc.  Our room was well appointed and updated and the linens were pleasant and comfortable. There is a breakfast buffet out every morning that is quite nice as well as snacks, afternoon tea, and late night food just for the taking. the location worked well for us as we were vacationing and wanted to see the typical tourist destinations. Buckingham Palace is across the street and we enjoyed some fine restaurants that were a short walk away. The Victoria Station (Tube) is a short walk from the hotel as is the Green Park station - both of which can take you almost anywhere in London. This is not a hotel that is complacent - resting on its laurels. They take the posture of rolling up their sleeves and earning their 5 Star rating each and every day.  I highly recommend this hotel and I look forward to staying here again.",5,2012,07,17
137,An Undiscovered Jewel!,"I usually stay at Lanesborough or Dorchester....but because it was SUmmer and close to the Olympics, they were sold out.......I was directed to 41 Hotel as a 5 Star replacement, and I was NOT DISAPPOINTED !!!  This is a sister property to the more well known Reubens Hotel, anmd they share a Bar and Restaurant.....what you get at 41 HOTEL IS ACCESS TO A PRIVATE MANSION, WITH YOUR OWN PRIVATE SUITE !!!  the Executive Lounge is your own private hideaway in London, akin to having your own private apartment.....but without the necessary formality of the other 5 Stars.......if you want to be treated like you are at home in your private Mansion in London, this is for you!!!!! Why buy when you can stay at 41 for a week or two and be pampered like you are the Lord Of The Manor.............",5,2012,07,15
137,Exceptional stay at Hotel 41,"As a frequent traveller on business, I do not dedicate much time to writing hotel reviews. Hotel 41; however, is much more than a hotel. It was an experience. The attention to detail and exceptional staff made me feel more welcome than any other european hotel ever has. This willingness to go the extra mile is what motivated my desire to thank the owners for truly being attentive to their guests and encourage those who haven't yet been guests to visit this rare pearl. I believe that one can understand how wonderful a hotel is when instead of looking forward to returning home, it pinches one's heart to leave.",5,2012,07,13
137,Fantastic,This is someplace i tell you. I felt like a king when i stayed here its amazing. The rooms and the hotel is finished to a very high standard.  This is a dream hotel a little exspensive but well worth it for a treat. I will be returning at somepoint.,5,2012,07,13
137,Royal treatment,If you want to be pampered like royalty search no longer... This is the perfect dream hotel. Everything you can imagine and much more. The best service we`ve already experienced in our lifetime.,5,2012,07,11
137,"Fantastic hotel, the best service!","This hotel is a great find - the staff are so incredibly helpful, very attentive, polite and go the extra mile to make your stay extremely memorable. Normally we would stay at other 5 star hotels in London and would receive great service, but this is just on a different level. Very quiet, savoir beds with mattress toppers, superfine cotton bedlinen, unbelievable 
breakfast (with pink champagne if required - which is also provided on arrival) and lovely executive lounge with honesty bar for late night drinks - but hotel very quiet and peaceful. Will return for sure - now my hotel of choice in London for business or pleasure.",5,2012,07,09
137,41 Gets it Right,"My wife and I stayed at 41 for our honeymoon, and loved everything about our stay.  The service is exceptional.  All the little touches are done well.  

Without being obtrusive, the staff is vigilant and gets all the details right.  Every time we left the room it was straightened before our return.  Water at night, fruit left in your room as a snack, it is like the staff knows what you want before you want it.

The rooms are great, although we had to examine a few before settling on one with one that had high enough ceilings to accommodate my height.

The concierge was amazing and got us fantastic tickets (second row, center) to a sold out performance of Wicked on little notice.

If you have the means and will be in London, then stay at 41.  My wife and I look forward to staying there for our second Honeymoon.",5,2012,07,09
137,"The real jewel in the crown in London is ""41""","For the third year in a row, my husband and I stayed at 41, aptly named for its location at 41 Buckingham Palace Road. Yes, it is right across the street from the Queen's residence and a short walk to The Green Park, St. James Park, all the sights, and great restaurants. You can walk anywhere from 41!  41 is part of the fabulous Red Carnation hotels, and 41 lives up to its 5 star rating. The staff know your name the moment you arrive (and from year to year), the accomodations are spectacular, the attention to detail is beyond any we've experienced anywhere in the world. You make friends with the staff, and no request is too big or too small. I can't imagine staying anywhere else in London. The combination of location, staff, and accommodations can't be beat. I am only worried in writing this review that 41 will be discovered and we'll have trouble booking a room the next time we go to London.",5,2012,07,09
137,Wonderful,"I had planned a special weekend for my best friends 50th birthday. Staying at hotel 41 was part of this and it was wonderful. Pink champagne on arrival and such a lovely reception from the staff. They were engaging and interested. The room was small but quality and we loved the 'whatever whenever' button on the phone. On returning to our room we found a birthday cake and two red roses on our beds boy did we feel special.
What made us feel like princesses was the way we were treated with such interest and care. We adored the executive lounge with service on tap and the pantry to raid at will. Nothing was too much trouble and having requested a taxi for a certain time the receptionist even ran around the corner and up the road to find one and bring it back to the hotel for us. Great location, fabulous service and luxury. Not cheap but very worth it!",5,2012,07,08
137,Great location with amazing staff and elegance.,This is a great high end boutique hotel. The staff is awesome and make you feel welcome and important. Upon arrival we had a glass of champaign waiting and snacks to refresh us.  The room was huge (by london standards) and had air conditioning which was a bonus. The location was very convenient to just about everything. We were definitely pleased we picked this hotel over a chain or others. ,5,2012,07,08
137,Everything is 5 star,"We stayed a single night inour return to Australia after spending 6 weeks travelling Europe.
We had decided to splurge for our last night are we were not disappointed.
Everything from the greeting at reception, the complimentary champagne, the comfortable bedand room, the lounge where we were able to relax after a days shopping and enjoy complimentary cheese, nibbles and ice creams.
All excellent.
Great people and a great location!",5,2012,07,08
137,Buckingham Palace Garden Party,"What a wonderful location for the palace!  After being invited along to one of this year's garden parties and after having this hotel recommended to us by friends who had stayed here previously, we booked a double room.  On arrival we checked in with a complimentary G & T and were told that our room was not available for us to change before rushing out to the palace, so we were upgraded to the Monarch suite! Our room was absolutely wonderful, clean crisp sheets, a wonderful night's sleep in a very comfy bed.  The following morning the breakfast was perfect, lots of choices. The staff were very helpful, friendly and very professional. We would definitely recommend this hotel to all!",5,2012,07,08
137,Outstanding!,"We spent six days at 41 during our recent trip to London and quite simply it was a trip highlight. The rooms are not huge but they are incredibly well furnished with all the amenities. Its very luxurious. But the real treat is the staff. They are all wonderful. With all 28 rooms on one floor and with an Executive Lounge on the same floor, you have a perfect place to relax whenever there is a respite in your day and, of course, while doing so you interact with the staff. We were traveling with our two college age kids and all four of us loved the staff interaction and enjoyed the superb, but not pretentious service. There is always something to eat of drink there as well and the breakfast is fabulous. We have traveled extensively and its as good a hotel experience as we have ever had. Finally, if your seeing the sights in London, there is simply not a better location. Highly recommended!",5,2012,07,07
137,"Very nice, but 'the best'???","Rented 2 rooms for 3-4 days.  The rooms are excellent, and immaculately appointed.  The personal service provided is excellent.  The food in the restaurant is superb...all at an impressive price.  Breakfast for 2 for ~$100?   Seems pretty steep.  Several 'hiccups' during our stay.  I requested flowers and chocolates in our daughters room (to celebrate their 2nd anniversary), and they were in our room.  My daughter asked about a visit to Buckingham Palace, and she was told that it was closed on the day she requested.  (6/30).  However, when walking past the Palace, we stopped by the office, and made her and her husband reservations for the visit, which went great (thanks to her perseverance, and not listening to our concierge).  Power from the floor plugs were 'off'' for several hours, but not a true 'inconvenience' that we couldn't deal with.  Overall, this was a very nice hotel, very well appointed, with nice amenities and great service.  BUt....far from 'perfect'...",4,2012,07,07
137,Live like the Royals!,"Choose this hotel immediately - it's the best hotel I've ever been to. Stayed with my mom for 5 nights to explore London for the first time (I'm 22). To be honest, this hotel was my favorite part of my visit!! First of all, the service is way beyond first class! Needed a new room change, printing items, searching for restaurants, recommendations on the city...and much more. I think all of our questions and need for assistance was perhaps a little too much, but the staff was always able to provide the best information with a smile. To add to my travel experience, I ended up losing my passport! The hotel staff asked for all possible places I may have lost it and called/searched for us 24/7. Every time I saw them, they were calling again and again. They told me, ""Enjoy your trip in London. We'll call for you."" I wouldn't have seen the city if it weren't for them! Ended up needing an emergency passport and they helped me from start to finish in getting prepared for the U.S. Embassy visit. Three names in particular came out on top for myself: Monika, Remus, and Frederic - they are kind, hard-working, hospitable, polite, and EVERYTHING else. Not only are they hotel staff, but they are concierges, tour guides, and have now become great friends of mine. My stories revolve around this hotel. Period. If you want to know what it feels like to live like a royal, come here!
Next, the decor is elegant, and classy. Tthe food was delicious. Service was impeccable. Location was near everything. They have snacks available for free during the day and evening. Morning paper delivered - your choice. They can customize breakfast for you. We came in late on our first night and were starved..again, the hotel staff was there to save us. I could go on and on, because it truly made my entire trip memorable. The passport incident really surprised me in how much they did. I will never forget this group, the hotel, and will be running back to this hotel for another London trip next year. Wouldn't stay anywhere else. I wish all hotels and other hotel staff learned from Hotel 41. Thank you, Hotel 41!!",5,2012,07,07
137,Nice Hotel,"I stayed in Hotel 41 for 5 days during my business trip to London. 

Some taxis have difficulty in identifying the hotel since its part of the Rubens hotel (a kind of). But I must say Hotel 41 got a very friendly and professional team which makes a big difference compared to other hotels I stayed. Also the lounge is beautiful though small and a connected restaurant with a library. Also the rooms have a very good ambiance with a nice black & white theme. Breakfast was nice but be prepared to wait for 15 minutes at least if you order some cooked food.",5,2012,07,07
137,An Experience,"We wanted to have a couple of days in London as a first leg of our honeymoon before we flew out to Mexico. We booked hotel 41 purely based on the amazing reviews on trip adviser. We recieved the form to fill in prior to arrival with our drink preferences etc. We had also requested a bottle of champagne to be in our room on ice on our arrival.

We booked a king room for 2 nights. The hotel is quite difficult to find, particurlarly if you are not used to driving in central london, because I had read so many reviews in advance I was aware of what to look out for wich helped. We used the vallet service which worked well and the cost of parking was simply added to our bill.

On arival we were greeted with a complimentary glass of champagne and checked in. Staff were friendly and check in was quick. The lounge was beautifullly decorated in an olde worlde style. We were brought nibbles to enjoy with our drinks before we went to our room.

When we were ready we were accompanied to our room and shown all of the devices which helped us to settle in more quickly, only a small point but I was quite dissapointed that we had to ask for our champagne - I felt that this should have been in our room when we arrived as we had requested, maybe I'm being picky? The room was lovely, huge comfy bed, soft linens, thick fluffy towels,  and well stocked ( but very expensive) mini bar. The room was compact and also did not have much of a view but im guessing this is probably the norm for central london hotels and this is a small price to pay for the fabulous location of the hotel. 

Included in our room package was a 3 course meal in the library restaurant in the Rubens part of the hotel. The ambiance, meal and service were top noch and on arival the staff member made a bit of a fuss of us as we were on honeymoon and brought over a glass of complimentary champagne each, a lovely touch I thought. 

On return to our room we were suprised by a romantic turn down; lots of candles, rose petals on the bed, massage oils and chocolates, this was lovely and very unexpected

Breakfast was lovely but was served with a little bit too much pomp for my liking, but again this added to the olde worlde feel of the whole hotel. We spent the whole day out and about, the hotel is in a great position for sight seeing and the london eye is aprox 15 mins away by foot passing by all the famous landmarks on the way. 

We were late back to our room and therefore late out to dinner on our 2nd night, again I may be being picky but because we were late out of our room we did not recieve any kind of turn down on our 2nd night - in my opinion this should have happened regardless of how late we were out of our room for the money we were paying in a 5 star hotel. 

Overall we had a fabulous stay with only a couple of points made for improvement. I was however a little supprised to revieve 2 e-mails from the hotel management after our stay asking for us to put reviews of our stay onto trip adviser. I have never had this from any hotel, again it may be my opinion but I found this to be a little bad taste! This would not stop me staying in this hotel in the future for special occasions though.",4,2012,07,04
137,traditional,"Great place to stay, very traditional and more than close to the queen!! a lovely place to stay and a brilliant set of staff to go with it, great stay",5,2012,07,03
137,Great Hotel,"Staff is amazing and love the free ice cream in the pantry. Stayed five nights on vacation and had a wonderful time. They let us sneak up on the roof to watch the fly over portion of the Trouping the Colour and took the time to bring up champagne and snacks for everyone on the roof, a nice little extra to our visit. I would recommend Hotel 41 to anyone spending time in London.",5,2012,07,02
137,Great Service,"We spent a couple days here before our anniversary in London. It was a great stay, and the service was incredible. We highly reccommend this hotel for it's charm and service. The location was also great, and allowed us to walk to any location in London.",5,2012,06,29
137,Best hotel ever!,"Our three day stay at Hotel 41 was by far the most special experience we have ever encountered in our many years of travel.  The unique boutique hotel atmosphere was enhanced by the superb staff of professionals.  It is hard to express how special we were made to feel and we were actually sad when we had to leave our new friends when we moved on to the next stage of our travels.  

When I arrived for my business trip, upon checking in they learned that my wife would be joining me the next day - I was immediately upgraded to a larger room.  While I was at my meeting, the Hotel 41 team made every effort to greet my wife and ensure that she was comfortable after her long, transcontinental flight.  Throughout our stay, they would effortlessly and unobtrusively engage us in conversation, recommend wonderful wines and food choices, and recommend things to do at our next destination.

Everyone from the doorman and front entrance greeter to the staff of professionals taking care of our every need, was like nothing we had ever experienced.  The intimacy of the main gathering area with its ornate decor, large fireplaces, and cozy furnishings was enjoyable for dining, relaxing, or enjoying an evening cocktail.  

One evening, we were pleasantly surprised when we returned to our room to find the soft glow of candles and rose pedals sprinkled throughout the room!

Since our return home we have raved about Hotel 41 to our family and friends and can't wait to return to London so we can stay at Hotel 41!",5,2012,06,28
137,Loved this hotel!,"We stayed here on the first night of our honeymoon before catching a flight. We read the reviews but were completely knocked off our feet when we actually got here. The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful and couldnt do enough for us. When we arrived we were greeted with welcome drinks and in our room were little cakes/biscuits. They also delivered ice, lemon and olives to our room in the evening. They also hold canapes in the Executive lounge of an evening and have a selection of food available for you to help yourself to. The room itself was extrememly clean with a huge bed, 2 showers and free internet access via the TV. We could not recommend this hotel enough, our only regret is that we could only stay the 1 night! If you are considering booking this hotel - do it, you will not regret it!",5,2012,06,28
137,Surprising,"I've stayed in Five Star hotels from Honolulu to Helsinki and beyond - NEVER have I been  treated as well as I was at the 41 last week.  I've book conferences at hotels with more than 100 people and never been treated this well by the staff.

The 41 team is simply the best I have encountered in 30 plus years of travel.

I do not typically write reviews, but  Fred, Stefan, Monica, Viktoria and all of the 41 team were so efficient and genuinely engaging I wanted to share our experience.

We called from the airport saying we were in the arrival lounge and wanted to know when we could access our rooms.  The plan was to drop our bags and tour London a bit.  The instant reply was come right away, we will accommodate you.  Good sign.

We stepped out of the cab to be greeted by name...""are you Mr...""  We were a party of five and easy to spot, but still another positive sign, but nothing exceptional yet.

It started with look of the front door.  The entry way is a single door on Buckingham Palace Road - our cabbie told us he thought it was a private club - and that is the feeling you get when you enter and throughout the hotel.  There is an attendant at the door - who also knew our name, and offered to help with bags immediately. Down a short corridor we took the express lift to the 5th floor.

Once upstairs, things were taken to a higher level of service.  The lobby (library) area is similar to a private club.  This the London you see in the movies.  Dark paneling, a fireplace, plush curtains, a bust of Napoleon here, one of Shakespeare there, but skylights that make it bright and airy.

In a corner sits a desk, where you check in and someone from the staff is on call 24 hours a day.  Whether you are just passing through or stopping to have drink, someone always greets you by name, asks about your day and offers to help with reservations, transportation, etc.

I have never been a fan of European breakfast rooms, but the way the 41 does it in the library makes it very special. The breakfast, all day snack buffet and evening cocktails and hot hors d'oeuvres in the library were excellent. The food was always fresh, varied and with a lot of options. You can order hot items off the menu too. 

At breakfast, Stefan roams from table to table engaging guests on what they plan to do today, offering advice and some very funny stories.  He was outstanding with our children, they really liked him, he gave them as much attention as he did the adults.

By the third day, the wait staff knew what we wanted for breakfast, what we liked to drink in the evening - very impressive.  When my favorite bourbon was out one night Monica noticed and ran to the bar in their sister hotel next store to get me my favorite drink without me asking.  Superb. 

Fred, the assistant manager and without a doubt the hardest working Frenchman in London, seemed to always remember what we told him we were going to do that day when we returned.  I was very impressed when we told him our next stop was France and he offered his phone number so we could call in case anything went wrong at our next stop - how often does hotel staff offer help AFTER you leave.  Fred is exceptional, a true professional, really outstanding.

On about the fourth or fifth day of our stay, Fred sent roses to our room for my wife and daughter - for no reason, just to be thoughtful.

When we wanted to get into Gordon Ramsey's restaurant, Monica made it happen as if it was the easiest thing in the world - but I know it was not.

Fresh fruit in the rooms, fresh ice every night, note cards left at turn down suggesting things to do the next day.  It was superb service without ever feeling forced, you got the feeling they really liked their job and liked helping people.

I never encountered a single member of the staff, from maids to doormen, desk staff to waiters that did not have a positive attitude, a smile and a hello for us - hard to match that.

The rooms are elegant, the furnishings are top notch  -- the quality is as good or better than anything you will find at the Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton and the service is far superior. The entire hotel is on the fifth floor, so street noise was not a problem.  Americans will think the rooms are small, but for London they are large.  Our two older sons staid in a room with a small sitting area that was larger than what I normally get as a Jr. Suite at the Intercontinental on Hyde Park.

We were able to walk easily in three minutes to the front gate of Buckingham Palace and St. James Park.  Cabs were easy to get and doormen really hustle to make sure you do not wait long - not always the case in London.

For years I have stayed at the Intercontinental when I travel to London on business, this time with the family I wanted to have something more British.  Now, I will be moving over to the 41 because of the staff - it feels like home.",5,2012,06,27
137,Shhhh - keep it a secret!,"We stay here twice a year on our birthdays. We hand over the kids to grandparents and thoroughly indulge ourselves.

From the minute you walk through the understated entrance you are treated like royalty.  Nothing is too much for the staff and they exceed expectations.  From the birthday cake in the room to the fabulous ""anything/anytime""  button on the wall.  The huge bed and amazingly comfortable bedding ensures a great nights sleep.

It exudes elegance and is always calming and quiet.  Breakfast is a feast, the Eggs Benedict to die for.

Please don't tell anyone, this can be our little secret ;-)",5,2012,06,25
137,Best service in the world,"From the moment our family arrived we were treated to the most welcoming, friendly, and professional yet easygoing service from Magda, Stef, Frederic and the rest of the intimate Hotel 41 team. In fact, Magda is so warm she can summon sunlight to shine through the skylight! The beds and pillows are super comfy; the library is a relaxing place for reception, breakfast, and just hanging out; and the food, from breakfast to snacks to hors d'oeuvres to free late night feasts, is delicious. No wonder this is the #1 rated hotel in London and that folks like us will find reasons to visit London just to return to Hotel 41.",5,2012,06,25
137,Second Review,"We were only meant to stay here once on a return trip to London shortly having moved abroad, from London. I think we have stayed here eight or nine times now in a little under three years and I still keep trying to find reasons why we have to go to London. 'What do you mean they are changing the guard again? Best go back then and stay at the 41'. 

Wonderful staff. The rooms seem to get better. My best bit? Every time you go there are examples of changes, ever so slight, but nonetheless changes that have been subtly suggested by guests and the hotel staff have listened. Amazing.  

My only downside is, being a frequent visitor, the menu doesn't change. I would love to see a revitalised menu. I thank you.",5,2012,06,24
137,Exceptional,"Hotel 41 is truly an exceptional hotel.  It exudes character and charm in a wonderful area of London.  The true masterpiece of the hotel however, is the staff.  My wife and I stayed for 4 nights and could not have been more impressed by every member of the staff.  Whether you are traveling with children, traveling casually, or traveling formally you will be treated as another reviewer noted ""like royalty"".  Would highly recommend this exceptional hotel.

EMD",5,2012,06,23
137,Fantastic hotel,"Beautiful hotel - stayed for a very short break for anniversary prior to going on holiday. Staff were incredibly helpful and the hotel itself was lovely. Huge bed, very lush bedding and great bathroom. Everything that you would want in a hotel room, with a really impressive level of service.",5,2012,06,22
137,Fabulous Boutique Hotel,"41 is an elegant, intimate boutique hotel, sitting just down the street from Buckingham Palace.  My family just returned from a four night stay there and it exceeded our expectations.  41 occupies the fifth floor of its sister hotel, The Rubens, yet has its own entrance and lobby.  The decor is all black and white, with dark woods and brass, and is very tasteful and beautiful.

We were thrilled that, unlike most every other hotel we contacted in London, 41 was willing to put our three children in one suite.  (Apparently, a maximum of two to a room is the norm in much of Europe, and we were faced with the prospect of having to incur the cost of a third room on top of the already high daily rates resulting from our weak dollar).  My husband and I were in a room next door which had the most gorgeous Victorian fireplace.  It was so wonderful to come in from a wet day of sightseeing and warm up in front of the cozy fire.  The rooms themselves addressed every detail imaginable -- there were countless outlets, lots of closet space, a beautiful desk with supplies, a towel warmer, tons of great toiletries....  In response to questionnaires we filled out in advance, our rooms contained the requested feather pillows and duvets.  Each night, we returned to a room supplanted with ice and olives, a floating candle in the bathroom, and a special treat (be it lavender spray for the bed pillows or special bath salts).  

The accommodations were rivaled only by the level of personal service provided.  We ate breakfast each morning in the cozy Executive Lounge, which is in essence a library interspersed with tables and couches.  We had our choice of a Continental breakfast or selections on the menu.  At night, we returned for champagne, cappucinos, snacks, and Haagen Daz.  All the while, we were welcomed by staff who called us by name, showed a genuine interest in us, and regaled us with wonderful stories and antecdotes.  We actually became concerned at one point because we would see certain staff members at breakfast, and they would greet us again late at night with a smile and refreshments.  Do these people ever go home, we wondered?  When we wrestled with how to get home with certain purchases, the staff offered to pack and ship them for us.

We couldn't have asked for anything more in a hotel.  41 made our stay in London a truly memorable one and we would most definitely stay there again.",5,2012,06,22
137,Can I live here?,"Can't wait to return.  Staff amazing, rooms comfy, location superb.  Stephan Ott made our stay over the top.  Didn't lift a finger.  Food awesome.  ",5,2012,06,22
137,Awesome!,"My husband and I spent three days at 41 during the Jubilee celebrations in June.  From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty, lots of special touches, ie champagne, flowers, fruit basket and excellent service.  Our room was large and well appointed with a very comfy bed.  Breakfast was a feast with good food and white table cloth service.  The hotel is well situated to walk to all the sights and there were lots of good restaurants close by.  I would highly recommend this property to anyone traveling to London, you will love the staff they work very hard to make your visit special.",5,2012,06,21
137,Perfect London Hotel if you want service and pampering,"Hotel 41 is simply divine. But it’s not the fabulous rooms, the amazing Executive Lounge, the exclusivity of it that makes this hotel simply stunning. It’s the level of service almost unparalleled in any other London Hotel that makes this place exceptional.

We came to Hotel 41 for 10 days for the Diamond Jubilee celebrations and for London in general. We wanted luxury, pampering and a great location. Hotel 41 is right across the road from Buckingham Palace, and about one block from Victoria tube station. Check-in was smooth and professional, and it started the way it went for the whole of our stay – everyone knew our name and we were never anonymous. We were treated professionally but with personal attention and always with a smile. Perfect.

First the rooms. We had a Junior Suite – split level, impeccably decorated in black and white. The attention to detail is fabulous. Soft white towels and robes and Penhaligon bathroom products. The ice and olives delivered nightly. A pillow menu. A shoe horn and a pair of scissors and a drawer full of minor stationery needs and… well, this place has thought of everything. There wasn’t a single thing we could fault with the room, both aesthetically or in terms of requirements for comfortable living. The bed was great. The chairs were comfy. Quirky decorating touches and a spa bath with a TV set (encased in glass). Nightly turn down service with little Union Jack chocolates on the pillow (it was the Diamond Jubilee!). I am raving, and rightly so.

We breakfasted every day in the Executive Lounge. The lovely Sneja served us most days. She remembered our order and got it right – the poached eggs were cooked to our taste, and when she heard that we liked certain juice or tea, that’s what we got. ‘Your tea is a bit cold – let me get you some more’. A selection of lovely jams. We dined in-house one night and the food was plentiful and well prepared. The ‘plunder the pantry’ service served us well, too – we went several nights to the theatre, and afterwards had cheeses and ham and smoked salmon and salad and breads and ice cream. Lovely idea and everything was fresh.

The Executive Lounge is an oasis of calm. Recent magazines and lots of books. Comfy lounges to sit on. Champagne and canapes if you want them, or coffee and home made cookies.

But no matter how great everything else is in this Hotel, it’s the service and the staff that make it memorable and above anything else in London. This is more than having a great concierge available (which I expect from any great hotel) – this is like having your own team of staff who not only respond to your needs, but also anticipate them. For example, we received a ‘guest preference’ questionnaire before our stay (lovely touch) and indicated that my husband cannot drink cow’s milk and needs ‘lactose free’ milk (soy if that’s all that’s available). When we arrived we discovered that they had arranged for 2 different choices of lactose free milk as well as soy! Frederic (who never seemed to sleep) and Monika were amazing – theatre tickets and transportation and arranging to post a parcel and arranging a dentist appointment within 20 minutes! We were even invited to watch the ‘Jubilee Flypast’ from the roof of the hotel with the staff – a special memory we will treasure forever.

During our stay, we went to the Lanesborough Hotel for afternoon tea. I have to say that that hotel was amazing, but the staff were so stiff and formal (after the professional and personalised service at Hotel 41) that we knew we could never again stay anywhere else in London. We loved chatting to the staff and truly valued their attention and service during our 10 day stay.

An amazing place. Just go – you won’t regret it.",5,2012,06,17
137,A great experience !,"I chose this hotel for a trip to London to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday having done a fair amount of research on the internet. From the moment we arrived we were very well treated by the team, in particular Magdalena, who ensured we had all the necessary information for our stay.  When we arrived we were handed a glass of Champagne as we registered. The room itself was very comfortable and had real character. Nothing was too much trouble and for us the level of service struck just the right balance. We are now looking forward to booking a return visit later in the year !",5,2012,06,17
137,"Sorry, rip off.","I booked this hotel on Costco Travel.  It sounded too good to be true.  This is NOT a five star hotel by any stretch of the imagination.  It is a wanna-be.  The restaurant part of the package is horrid in the library at Ruebens. Hotel 41 is only the 5th floor next to the Reuben's and the floor above us was very noisy with kids and lots of creaks and cracks.  Save your money for a real five star.  I would give this 3 star at best.  The wifi is intermittent and the free drinks and appetizers at cocktail hour does not include any alcohol.  This package is fine for the non experienced traveler, but all others find somewhere else as you will be happier.  The staff here was friendly but too intrusive.  Read the fine print.  Sorry for the lousy review but let others be forewarned.  As my husband said, that is why Costco is getting a deal on these bookings.",3,2012,06,14
137,Most memorable stay,"My wife and I staed at 41 in March 2012 and had a wonderful time. It was our second stay at 41 and at the end of our first stay we said that the service was amazing, the food great but our room was a bit small. Well, on check in at the start of our second stay we were absolutely delighted to find that they had given us a bigger room (with no complaining just a reference in our check out review). We  were treated to the usual amazing service during the  stay but I must confess the topper was on my birthday when without requesting it, the staff gave us the romantic turndown (look it up) without notice and without charge!! I have never stayed at a hotel that has read my mind on what I wanted and did it before I could ask like 41. Iwish all hotels were this amazing. Please stay here when you are in London, everything else pales in comparison.",5,2012,06,14
137,Wonderful experience!,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for 2 nights during the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations and picked it specifically because of its great location (right next to Buckingham Palace) and the excellent reviews we’d read on Trip advisor. We'd stayed at another Red Carnation Hotel previously (The Milestone) and enjoyed the experience so much we thought it couldn’t get any better but we were wrong!  The team at 41 really do make this hotel rank as the best we’ve ever stayed in.

The service was truly exceptional and is what we’ve talked about most to anyone who’d listen since we got back home! From the minute we arrived until we left, everyone we met treated you like a member of the family rather than a hotel guest.  A special mention goes out to Frederic, Monika and Malcolm, all of whom went out of their way to ensure we had a really special stay, the highlight of which was watching the jubilee flypast with them all on the hotel roof followed by overindulging a little on champagne and snacks in the lounge afterwards!  

The lounge area is spacious and comfortable to spend time in, it felt a bit like visiting a friend’s house.  The breakfast was delicious.  The ‘plunder the pantry’ is a lovely touch too. Our room was larger than we expected for London standards and was really quiet with a huge bed.  

We had the pleasure of meeting and chatting to Terry Holmes and his family during our stay and it’s clear that everyone at RCH shares the same passion for delivering the best customer experience possible.  We’ll definitely be back at 41 again!",5,2012,06,13
137,"Great Service, Small Rooms","I am surprised that this hotel gets such great reviews on tripadvisor.  The service is exceptional, but the rooms are very small and claustrophobic.  The window from the room we had looked right out at another building.  The room was quite small, and we felt as if we had no space to move around much. The air conditioner made the room freezing when it was on, but it soon got hot when it was off.  There seemed to be no way to control it, so we had to operate it manually by turning it on and off.  We could also hear the people talking in the narrow hallway leading to the rooms and in the room next to us. The hotel is really one exclusive floor of rooms in the Rubens Hotel.  It has a very nice executive lounge where you can go to have drinks and snacks in the evening.  The snacks are complementary.  This was a very nice touch, but to me it didn't make up for the small room, the noise from the hall and from next door, and the other issues.  The hotel is conveniently located near the Victoria tube station, so it was good for getting around London.  It isn't exactly the most attractive area, though, or the best for restaurants.  It advertises that it is right across from Buckingham Palace.  Well, this is true, but it is the back wall of Buckingham Palace, which isn't at all the attractive part.  Overall, it is a good hotel, but not the exceptional one that the ratings on tripadvisor seem to suggest it is.",3,2012,06,12
137,If I could live here....,"I have relied on tripadvisor for years without ever even thinking of leaving a review (I was even always suspicious that hotel staff wrote the reviews!).  Now I am writing a review for a hotel that I haven't even checked out of yet!  This hotel experience is by far and away the most wonderful I have ever had - and I have had a lot of great ones!  The service is indescribable...the staff knows you by name the minute you arrive and treats you like family, anticipating things you didn't even know you needed!  The rooms are plush and comfortable - with small touches everywhere you look and special treats dropped off while you are away.  You feel like you have become a member of an exclusive club with an intimate library and well-stocked 24-hour ""pantry""  - check out the hotel's own video tour and you will see what I mean.  Free wireless internet seems like a silly thing to be happy for, but everything at this hotel feels like a little gift - no ""nickel and diming"" here. Our group included an ""over 70"", ""over 50"" and a teenager - all generations are enthralled. I would return to London if only to stay here again.",5,2012,06,11
137,Our 2nd Visit and even better than the first,"My wife and I returned here and this time we stayed in a Junior Suite which was wonderful.
Frederique the Manager and Monika the Assistant Manager made our return stay very very comfortable indeed and we loved every minute.
This hotel offers such a wonderful experience so different to any other offer available in London and is a really great place to stay.
We had afternoon tea there this time which was very nice indeed and enjoyed the canapes in the early evening, as did our son's who joined us early evening.
Location is wonderful and the service offered by all the staff is really first class.
Hope to return again for another special occasion.",5,2012,06,11
137,Simply superb,"We stayed at Hotel 41 in early June.  We based our stay at hotel 41 because of the reviews on Trip Advisor.
We were not disappointed in any regard.  We selected an Executive Double room for our 6 night stay.
Their attention to detail was marvelous.  The staff has obviously been highly trained.  They were able to answer any questions we had and always went one step beyond to make us feel ""right at home.""
The beds were very comfortable. Both the room and the bathroom were done in black and white and large by London standards.  Both were well appointed.  Our morning breakfast was always excellent.
During our 6 day stay we worked our way through the Breakfast menu.  Service was always outstanding.
As worldwide travelers, we would easily recommend this hotel as one of the finest small hotels we have ever stayed.
We saw and agree with their # 1 ranking.",5,2012,06,11
137,Exceeded our expectations,"We loved, loved, loved our stay at Hotel 41.  The staff were incredibly accommodating and friendly.  They greeted us by name and it is really nice to feel so remembered.  The room was comfortable and the turn-down service was a real treat.  Their breakfasts (both Continental and Full English) are INCREDIBLE as is their afternoon tea.  The location was perfect, the service was extraordinary and our trip was unforgettable.  Thank you, 41!!  I hope to come back soon.",5,2012,06,07
137,Amazing experience,"Hotel 41 is the best experience I've ever had at a hotel in the United States or abroad. I can't talk enough about the staff because they are what makes the experience so memorable. Every member of the staff goes out of their way to help you in any way they can, from arrival to departure. They are happy to help plan your trip and give advice on what to see and when to see it, and also place reservations at restaurants and theaters. They make special occasions a top priority. It was wonderful. The hotel is simply beautiful and the lounge is such a nice place to sit and relax or enjoy some snacks! Another nice thing is that, with the hotel being on the 5th floor, it is very quiet at night because the street is far away. If I ever have the opportunity again, I would choose Hotel 41 without thinking twice!",5,2012,06,07
137,"Fabulous, best hotel in London","My wife and I decided to stay at Hotel 41 on a recent stop over in London. Right from the very moment we arrived we were made to feel very welcome and special. This trip was to celebrate my wife's 40th birthday, we were going on from here on the Orient Express to Venice, so I had tried to plan everything to the extreme. I must have called over a dozen limousine companies, all of which were hopeless, so I decided to call the hotel and ask their advise. Magda rang the limo company, got a price for me and organised it all within 10 minutes!!

The hotel is spotlessly clean, well appointed and in an ideal location to tour the city. Our room was comfortable, quiet and reasonably priced for a hotel of it's calibre. The little touches that we received during our short stay were lovely and really appreciated. I am so pleased that we chose this hotel and we will certainly be back as soon as the opportunity presents itself. Well done Hotel 41!!!!!!!!",5,2012,06,06
137,Amazing place!,"Having stayed at many hotels around the world, this is definitely one of the very best! It's intimate surroundings, excellent and beautiful rooms, and the friendliest and most helpful team in place (the best of any hotel I have ever stayed at), make it my number 1 preferred place to stay whenever I am in London. 

Whenever I needed help with restaurant reservations, transport, or just receiving a package on my behalf, the staff was helpful in every aspect. Frederic the manager personally greeted every guest he met and made sure everything ran smoothly. 

The lounge where breakfast is served is also perfect for light meals or even just having drinks with your friends or guests. While it is a great place to relax year-round, I especially like the lounge in the heart of winter, with its warmth being a great refuge from the cold outdoors. Very comfortable, and cozy.

The hotel is not easy to find, as many taxi drivers aren't aware of its location, but if you just mention the ""big brother"" hotel next door, the Reubens, you won't be steered wrong. A short walk way is Victoria train station with direct connections to Gatwick. Nearby are an assortment of restaurants and shops that is typical in central London. 

You can't go wrong with 41 :)",5,2012,06,05
137,Royal Treatment,"I stayed at Hotel 41 for a business trip and have to say that it has THE best service and some of the most beautiful rooms I've ever seen. The rooms are large compaired to most hotels in the UK.  Champagne checking in, little treats and snacks left in my room and a cooler filled with wine and snacks to enjoy in the executive lounge were a pleasure to have - all part of the 'royal treatment'. I really can't say enough about the staff... from the moment I walked into the hotel to the moment I left, they were wonderful - very warm and welcoming as you can read from everyone else's reviews. The cleaning staff found an IPAD my co-worker left behind in his room and returned it to him just as we were leaving the hotel (after checking out).  Situated directly across from the Buckingham Palace, this was a beautiful street to walk along and unwind after a long day of work (or an experience to see the Changing of the Guards each day). Tons of little restaurants and neat pubs nearby (within walking distance).  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to London.",5,2012,06,05
137,A wonderful start to our trip,"We started our 3 week holiday in London, at Hotel 41. It was a perfect start to our trip, from the Range Rover transfer from Heathrow, to the champagne at check-in, we felt immediately welcomed. We stayed in the Conservatory Suite, with glass roof, and it was just lovely. We realized, much to our dismay, we had left our large camera behind on the plane. The hotel, particularly Remus, was instrumental in working with Virgin and ultimately getting our camera delivered to the hotel (much to our relief) the next morning.  Prior to our trip, we had asked the hotel to arrange Wicked tickets and had wonderful seats. We enjoyed snacks and wine in the executive lounge each evening, and enjoyed talking to the managers and staff.  The management team was outstanding, and very warm and welcoming. The staff was equally warm, but if we had one complaint (and we use the word complaint very, very  lightly) some staff didn't seem as knowledgeable on the area (e.g. the girl at reception had difficulty telling us how to get to Changing of Guard, which is literally across street).  She was very helpful and did her best to meet our needs, but some of the seemingly newer staff could be more versed in the area (sights, restaurants, etc) - this did not detract from us having a great experience.",5,2012,06,04
137,Truly outstanding service,The common theme of most TA reviews is one of great service and this is truly the case. The staff here are exceptionally well trained and managed. They help and anticipate without this ever becoming burdensome. (one example was that they saw that my wife has mobility issues and changed the room they had planned to give us to one which was nearer the executive lounge). The food is good quality and the rooms are well decorated and laid out. I was really looking forward to staying at 41 and this sometimes builds expectations that are not met. I am very pleased to say that this was not the case with Hotel 41. We will be back.....,5,2012,06,04
137,Wow!,"We've had the great fortune to stay at some wonderful hotels in our travels.  We have to say that Hotel 41 takes the award for most personalized service.  The staff is attentive and friendly, every wish a traveler could have is anticipated, and anything you would want to pamper you is available by request if not already provided.  They had me at champagne as we checked in!  It only got better with the water, chocolates, slippers and linens by the bed at night, not to mention the candles lit in the bathroom.  They arranged tickets for the sites we wanted to visit and arranged transportation to the airport for us.  My husband and I had a wonderful time and will definitely stay here for every trip in London from now on!",5,2012,06,03
137,Loved it!,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel 41 last week and loved every day spent there. It is centrally located and less than a block from Victoria Station and literally steps away from Buckingham Palace.

From the minute we walked in, we were greeted by friendly staff at their first floor mini-lobby and escorted to check in on the fifth floor. Check in was very easy and straightforward and we were then escorted to our room and we were surprised by complimentary champagne and mini desserts. So lovely!  This was  perfect as my husband and I love anything sweet. 

The room itself is small but well appointed-Bose station with ipod/iphone docking, flat screen wall mounted tv in the room & bathroom and free wi-fi. The bed is very comfortable but took up most of the space in the room but it was ok with us since we weren't planning on spending alot of time in the room as we were more intent on sightseeing and shopping. When we were at the hotel we spent our time in the Executive Lounge for breakfast, tea and canape.  

The food served were very good, especially food served as part of the afternoon tea. Monica was so kind to set it up for us after she found out that it was something that we wanted to do during our trip for no additional charge. We actually got there after there normal hours for serving the tea but they were so accommodating. Every  part of the tea was wonderful, from the tasty sandwiches, out of this world scones with clotted cream and homemade chocolate & hazalenut spread and the desserts..so pretty and tasty at same time (we were lucky, the chef was inspired by Chelsea flower festival and modeled the desserts from them). 

The staff at Hotel 41 are great, very friendly and helpful. Monica and the rest of the concierge team were especially wonderful. They helped us set up fast passes to the London Eye so no waiting and recommended great places to shop and eat.

Next time we visit London, we will definitely try to see if we can stay at Hotel 41 again.",5,2012,06,01
137,Excellence among excellence,"I have stayed at many 5 star hotels but this hotel is by far the best among them all.
The staff are all about anticipating your needs. They are professional and personable but never intrusive.
The attention to detail is incredible and nothing is to much trouble. You are always made to feel welcome and comfortable and the location is so handy to everthing. You are just a 2 minute walk to the undergroung and Buckingham palace is outside your door.
I have staryed at many of the leading hotels in London but this hotel surpasses them all.
The roomas are immaculate and well finished and the bathroom is generous and spotless.
Treat yourself and enjoy all it has to offer.",5,2012,05,31
137,Great Service,We were welcomed like returning customers despite this being our first stay. All the staff were polite and attentive and the room was lovely.,5,2012,05,30
137,Lovely stay,"We've stayed at this hotel for my husband birthday for 2 nights in March.
The hotel is situated not even 10 minutes walk. The location is brilliant and it's just next to Buckingham palace. Great for London sightseeing!

The entrance of the hotel can be surprising as it's a small door and a little desk and a corridor. But it didn't bother us. 
You are then taken to the main lounge where the check in is done as well as being the breakfast & lounge area. It is beautifully decorated and loads of natural lights.
When I've booked the room, I had a choice to pick of several extras. I've decided to go for the high tea. The high tea was lovely and the staff very polite and nice.
We've requested an early check-in if possible and when we arrived the room was available.

The hotel is small but exclusive. The staff knows who you are and were very nice to us.

We've also decided to upgrade our room. The complain I would have is that the room we had was on a split level and the bed was opposite an exit door which felt a bit weird! I did hear in the morning the staff walking down the stairs. 
And that would be my only criticism about the hotel & this room in particular...",5,2012,05,30
137,The service in Hotel 41 is very special!!,"The rooms in this hotel are small, but very confortable!! The service is very good and special!!! The breakfast is good. We liked the hotel, but the location isn't the best.",4,2012,05,28
137,Top Notch,Top place. Really good views and food was top notch too. Would recommend to anyone thinking of staying here. Great location too,5,2012,05,28
137,A perfect pocket in London!,"My husband took me to 41 for my Birthday, just lovely! How refreshing to find a hotel which ticks all the boxes, just super to stay somewhere fabulous and to be made to feel we were absolutely welcome too! Monika checked us in with a glass of Champagne, our room was great with all the smashing extras in the bathroom. After the matinee, we returned to our room to find a floating candle glowing away, lights dimmed, music playing and a Birthday cake.. Magical touches! We had a bottle of Veuve in the lounge and along came canapés. The following day the sun was still shining, so walked up to The Palace before heading back for breakfast (serve until 1pm on sundays) We enjoyed London, ate at Scotts then back to 41 by 9pm, my husband read the papers, i watched television.. Happy to simply relax in our room with goodies gathered from the lounge pantry - Complimentary Chocolates, Strawberries, Cheeses etc. Another night of deep sleep in the super sized bed, another feast at breakfast then we headed off. We loved the privacy and the total ease of the hotel, its a charming Den' set high above the streets of the bustle below!",5,2012,05,28
137,Fails on a value for money basis,"It's like expecting a trip in a Rolls Royce and then being ferried around in a Toyota, even though you've paid Rolls Royce rates.  This place lacks typical hotel infrastructure and must be very cheap to run.  There is little character and atmosphere.  The big trick is how the staff like Monica and Magda are constantly all over you, distracting you from pondering the shortcomings.   In other words, the chauffeur of the Toyota tries to make the trip worthwhile.  You will never find royalty, captains of industry, movie stars or such people staying here - it simply lacks too much to be in their sights. I think that this place is very poor value for money and would find many better alternatives at the price point.",2,2012,05,23
137,Didn't want to leave,"This hotel was the perfect find.  The amenities are excellent, attention to detail impressive, and the service is fabulous.  Everything was so wonderful that we decided to extend our stay at the expense of non refundable travel tickets.  We will definitely be back.",5,2012,05,23
137,Impeccable service,"My wife, daughter, and I spent a brief stay at Hotel 41 during a recent stop over in London.  From the moment we arrived, Frederic, Magda, and the entire staff could not have been more pleasant and helpful.  We have stayed at several 5-star hotels in the past, and as far as service is concerned, I can't say I have ever had better than what we received at Hotel 41.  The building that the hotel is in is over 100 years old.  As you can imagine, the rooms are a bit smaller than newer hotels, but the entire property is very nicely appointed with all the modern conveniences.  We received a complimentary upgrade to a Hospitality Suite with a king bed, and my daughter loved having her own ""room"" with a fold-out couch.  The Executive Lounge is a great place for breakfast or snacks throughout the day.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London, and I look forward to coming back myself.",5,2012,05,22
137,Very Nice,"Great service, food, room and location.  Close to the tube, tourist attractions, many restaurants and of course Buckingham Palace.",5,2012,05,21
137,41 Hotel is the Best!,"My wife and I stayed with two nine year old twins, daughter (25) and son (28) this past April. While the London weather was stormy, the staff made our stay perfect. Monika, Victoria and Roman all did a fabulous job and could not have done more to make us all feel welcome and special.

We’ve stayed at most of the big London hotels (Savoy, Four Seasons, Mandarin, Claridge’s, etc) as well as the smaller boutiques (The Berkley, Blakes, etc), and the 41 Hotel is a gem amongst them. It’s small, intimate and situated in a perfect location in Mayfair. The rooms were fabulous and well equipped. The Executive lounge reminds us of visiting a friend’s English country house. But most of all, the staff is exceptional; friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and no task is too large or small, to accomplish.

The staff at 41 know your name after the first 10 minutes and treat you like a friend as well as a cherished guest. We’re planning on staying there again after the Olympics come and go this summer. If it’s an exceptional London boutique hotel you’re looking for, do yourself a favor and stay at 41.",5,2012,05,21
137,Pure pleasure!,"My third stay at Hotel 41 and it was perfect! Upon check-in in the beautiful library lobby I received a complimentary upgrade to a king size room without asking and a refreshing flute of champagne. The staff was as expected, delightful, attentive, helpful and anticipated my every need-including finding the boutique shop that sold a favorite brand of French clothing :)  The location is suberb and we walked everywhere and were happy to return to a pleasant dinner in front of the fireplace in the library dining area.  The room was comfortable and well-appointed and I awoke rested for another hectic fun-filled day in London.  We'll always stay at Hotel 41.  Kudos to Frederic and his staff for making my trip pure pleasure.",5,2012,05,21
137,We felt like we were a guest in a beautiful home,"This small hotel was our home away from home in London. Thanks Freddie, Madga, Jasmeet and all of the staff at 41 for making my husband's birthday trip so wonderful.The room with the king size bed, food and service was excellent. We will have to come up with some excuse to return to London to stay at this wonderful hotel again.",5,2012,05,21
137,Reality check is in order - this is not the real deal!,"When you’re top of the pile on a global site like Trip Advisor, you get the privilege of charging premium rates on the basis that people will be willing to pay more for the perception of a superior offering.  That weight of expectation can be a burden and may result in far more thorough analysis than would otherwise be necessary.  In other words, discerning travellers will expect you to deliver.

The overwhelmingly positive reviews persuaded me to stay here for 3 nights.  For just about £400 per night, I was paying the same that could have got me into the Ritz, Savoy, Langham or Claridges.  Was it going to be worth it and what would the experience be like?

First Impressions: There is no entrance area or lobby.  In fact there is nothing but a passage to a lift which takes you up to the 5th floor.  There you are met by very charming staff, like Frederic and Monica, who take care of the formalities of checking you in.  The lounge area includes the check-in desk area.  It is cosy but small and therefore not very private.  

The Rooms: I had booked a split level Junior Suite.  I got into this room and immediately had a sense of disappointment:
1. The lower level was very small with a desk area, Nesprssso machine, 2 tub chairs facing the entrance and a TV/bar cabinet.  The problem was that the space was so tight that the tub chairs could not actually face the TV, so was angled.  I could see no possible reason why anyone would spend time in this lower level, save for a businessman perhaps, who needed to work at a desk while his wife was sleeping. Its utility has been poorly thought out.
2. Upstairs, the sleeping area was over furnished, taking up all the space.  Yet another desk could be found.  The TV was on a cabinet which was simply too big for that area.  I could not believe that so much of useful space could be taken up by this unnecessarily large cabinet.
3. The TVs, both downstairs and upstairs were too small for a suite and seemed quite outdated.  In this day, anything less than a HDTV with a minimum screen size of 40 inches is unworthy of a top hotel, let alone a premium suite.
4. The bed and bedding was of great quality.  However, the foot of the bed 4 poster bed was very loose and looked like it was about to fall over at any moment.
5. Dark wood furnishing is a risk in any establishment because there is a high maintenance obligation.  It is either going to look immaculate or it is going to look bad.  Here, the marks and scuffs were visible and I would have to say it did not look like a 5 star presentation.
6. The bathroom was exceptionally large, with a Jacuzzi and I found this to be the best feature of this particular suite.

Anyway, on emerging from my room, which happened to be right next to the lounge area, I was asked by Frederic how I found the room.  I mentioned that I was not a fan of this split level as I did not believe it worked.  He immediately asked for some time and then got back to me saying that he had found me an alternative, which would only be available the next day.  Long story short, the staff took my comments (which were really a matter of fact observation rather than a complaint) seriously and offered me an alternative suite, which at that time turned out to be the Master Suite.  This was again a split level, but a lot bigger.  It has this incredible glass conservatory style ceiling which could be quite a unique feature in any room, giving you some unusual options for daytime or night time enjoyment.  In this suite, I again found the lower level furnishing to be poorly thought out.  The entrance area is dominated by a large square table, so large that you could barely walk around it.  There is a TV and drinks cabinet downstairs but with little thought given to how a guest might choose to spend a few moments of relaxation down there.  I mean you have a TV, you have a drinks cabinet yet if you wanted to have a drink and watch TV, you couldn’t really do it in comfort, let alone in the manner one accustomed to luxury would expect.  A smaller round table plus a couch and ottoman might be a far superior arrangement.  Again, a poorly thought out layout.  Upstairs, in spite of the space, there is no full length mirror.  The couch in front of the bed didn’t quite work, having a high back which negatively altered the perception of the space.  I had to conclude that overall the place lacked design integrity - it looked like a collection of random furniture as opposed to the meticulous attention to function and detail at a place like the Savoy. The bathroom in this suite is very large and totally satisfying, with a superb Jacuzzi.

With regards to the day to day amenities, I found the snacks on offer after 8pm a good gesture.  If you were out very late, you would find the entrance locked and you had to go through the Rubens hotel to get in.  If you had any really late night requests, you were not likely to find anyone to satisfy them – the place is deserted and inhospitable after 0100.  My requested newspaper only arrived one day out of 3.  Basic useful amenities like the shoe shine were not diligently replaced and had to be requested.  As it has this awkward 5th floor layout, on my final day, I advised the doorman that I was expecting an airport limo whilst I waited upstairs.  Half an hour overdue, I had to frantically call to find out why it had not arrived.  It turns out that it was waiting for me downstairs for 45 minutes  – the doorman had simply not spotted it, even though it had a sign on the window!

My impression at the end of it all was that this hotel does not deserve to be rated at number 1.   Quite frankly, it should not even be in the top 10 – not at the prices it charges.  The top level staff are exceptionally attentive and I found Frederic to be extremely personable and pleasant. If you stripped this out, however, the place itself simply would not rate alongside London’s grander and swankier establishments.  Physically and aesthetically it is very, very ordinary.   Quite frankly, I’m not even sure it can be called a hotel, lacking as it does a lobby to define its ambience & character.  There are also no bars, restaurants, spa etc.  It looked and felt like a superb bed and breakfast albeit one that was charging 5 star hotel rates.  My conclusion is that Trip Advisor reviewers must be swayed by the top level service and in doing so are forgiving of the physical shortcomings of the place.  However, if your circumstances do not call for exceptionally attentive service, you would be justified in wondering what on earth the fuss is all about, particularly if your entry rate would get you into far grander establishments like the Savoy,  One Aldwych, Claridges, the Langham or even St Ermins.",3,2012,05,21
137,My favourite hotel ever,We have just returned from our second stay at 41.  Everything about the hotel is absolutely perfect.  I almost don't want to give them another good review as it'll be impossible to get reservations if everybody finds out how fabulous this place is!,5,2012,05,20
137,justified,"believe all the good reviews! Stayed here for our wedding anniversary and were completely blown away by the service, luxury and location.
Frederik and all the staff were beyond brilliant. Cannot think of anything that would improve this hotel apart from the few things I mentioned to Frederik which were rectified immidiately.
I you want something special, this is the place to go!",5,2012,05,18
137,A perfection of timing,"Another lovely stay at 41, and this time we were on a tight schedule.  We were guests at a formal occasion nearby, during which there was an interlude.  41 is for residents only, but we had asked if we could invite our hosts to visit us briefly and privately in our suite for refreshments as this was a special day.  We arranged for champagne, fruit and snacks to be left in our suite for our  mid-event half hour.  When we arrived, the whole suite had been serviced, although we were checking out that day, so our friends were able to freshen up in a gleaming bathroom free of our used towels and soap and without passing a rumpled bed. The requested refreshments were beautifully presented (berries of superb quality alongside the famous home- toasted nuts) in the downstairs sitting area, and the chairs pre-arranged for a gathering of four.  After 30 mins, we had to leave promptly for the remaining time at our event.  Following a lovely experience, we bade farewell to our hosts, and walked back to 41 for the second time.  The room had been tidied again, and the debris removed.  We were able to freshen up and change for travel in the privacy of our suite prior to checking out.  All the arrangements we asked for, and more, were carried out with the style, attentive care and genuine interest in our enjoyment that we have come to expect from the team at 41.  This is a boutique 5* and as such, promises the best.  We have consistently found that whatever we ask of 41, they deliver, and the team is pro-active in offering alternatives and extra measure. Our friends said at the time, and have followed it up in a letter to us, how much the immaculately-managed interval contributed to the enjoyment of the morning.  41's relaxed private club atmosphere suits our style and we return time and again with confidence.",5,2012,05,17
137,Exceptional,"This place is ranked #1 in London on TripAdvisor for good reason - I've never felt more welcome at a hotel.  The accommodations, service, food and staff were impeccable.  Every details is well thought out, from the champagne reception to the late-night snack bar.  I highly recommend  this beautiful hotel for any special occasion.",5,2012,05,16
137,Exceptional Boutique Hotel,"Frederic Dallot, resident manager and his assistant Monica are the dynamic duo! Their attention to detail and friendly caring attitude made our stay at 41 memorable. Their level of service is exemplary. Having stayed at some of the finest hotels in the world, we can say with confidence that  you can not be treated better anywhere. The rooms are charming and romantic; we celebrated our 40th anniversary in style. Next year, we plan on celebrating our 41st at 41.",5,2012,05,15
137,What a Gem,"My husband and I enjoyed yet another stay at 41. Frederic and his staff go to great lenghts to ensure that everything is perfect.
Do try the romantic turndown and the Butlers pantry.",5,2012,05,14
137,A very nice boutique hotel providing an exceptionally high level of service.,"Charmingly unassuming from the pavement, 41 is a delight from the moment you step inside. Upon entering staff provide a friendly welcome, with the Front Desk Manager escorting you to the 5th floor haven above Buckingham Palace Road. A glass of Champagne is offered on arrival to the Lounge, where check-in formalities are completed efficiently (and with a personal touch).

The ‘Executive Room’ (18 square metre variant) was well appointed, with nice attention to detail – from the ’41’ embroidered linen and towels, to the Penhaligon toiletries in the bathroom. The turndown service was personable.

The ‘Executive Lounge’ was impressive, with the feel of a private club from a bygone age. Providing a personal welcome, by name, I found service was attentive whilst discrete.

Whilst it was a very enjoyable short stay, a few constructive items of feedback would be:
* Sound proofing, particularly of the door of the guest room I was resident in, was inadequate. From my guest room, located near the lift lobby, any guest passing in the corridor was clearly audible (or heard, by their feet) as were the conversions of those awaiting a lift. Not sure if this was just an isolated occurrence, however I’d recommend requesting a quiet room away from the lift just in case.
* Housekeeping: the tiles & grouting on both floor and walls in the bathroom were quite discoloured, and in need of a far greater attention in cleaning (see photos).

All said, please don’t let the couple of negatives put you off. I still highly recommend it, particularly given the service is amongst the best I have experienced. If you enjoy luxurious boutique hotels, and personal service of an exceptionally high standard, then this may be the London hotel for you!",4,2012,05,14
137,Fantastic stay,"Booked this as an overnight stay because of the fantastic reviews on Trip Adviser, it met and exceeded our expectations.  This is definitely THE place to stay in London.

137,we will be returning,"To anyone looking for a hotel which is right in the heart of london and can claim 10/10 from clients then hotel 41 is for you. the service, staff , maids and those behind the scenes makes this hotel in the category of excellent.

We will be returning.B.W. australia",5,2012,05,12
137,a wonderful place to stay,What can one say when one finds perfection - that sums up our experience at the hotel 41.From the moment we were picked up by their arranged service at heathrow to the warm personal goodbye at checkout everything was wonderful. Other reviews have gone into the rooms and amenities and food and all and these reviews were totally true. To me what makes the hotel so unusual in todays day and age is the degree of detail that goes into making the guest feel so very very special including anniversary celebrations and any and all special requests.One special example was remembering we were going to see the musical singin in the rain and that night having the cd playing as part of the turn down service when we returned.The whole staff led by general manager Frederic and Assistant Manager Monika were awesome and tried to do everything they could to make our stay be amazing - and they succeeded. We arrived as guests and left as friends - the highest recommendation we could give. We were sad to leave and eagerly look forward to a return and will keep in touch with them always.,5,2012,05,12
137,Staff and location make the stay worthwhile....,"We read all the reviews online about 41 and they were the major reason we chose it. If you've ever stayed in a suite at the Bellagio or at the Ritz Carlton on the club level.......it's NOTHING like that. They basically took the 5th floor of the adjoining Rubens Hotel and made 28 rooms into a boutique hotel. We chose an Executive King room, which is an upgrade from the standard rooms, and it was very nicely furnished, immaculately clean, and had everything we needed. Certainly small by U.S. standards, but we expected as much in London.

The location speaks for itself. Just outstanding. A very short walk to the Palace, parks, shopping, eateries, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, and even the London Eye if you're up for a longer stroll. What makes this place is the staff and service. It always seemed like there were more people working there, than staying there, which is a great thing. Magda and Monica made us feel at home and were willing to help with whatever you need while in London.

If anything could be improved it would be some of the complimentary food offerings in the executive lounge. Just not up to par for a fine hotel. We took a few granola bars but beyond that, we ate off site for the trip.

We stayed 2 nights at the 41, and are staying 3 nights at the adjoining sister property, the Rubens.

Would we stay at the 41 again? 100% YES. We highly recommend it.",5,2012,05,11
137,A great discovery,"We usually stay at the Chesterfield Hotel but on our last trip the Chesterfield was full (we had changed our plans last minute)  and the Staff very kindly arranged a room for us a room at Hotel 41. We thought the Hotel was lovely particularly the lounge area. We were greeted with a glass of champagne when checking in and the staff were very efficient, attentive and accommodating and seemed to have a genuine feeling of pride in the Hotel. We stayed in one of the Hospitality Suites which was very nice.  The only small negative comment I would make is that the room had so much furniture it it there wasn't much room to move around  in or put suitcases etc but that seems to be typical of London Hotels and it certainly would not stop me returning to this hotel. The Management and staff of Hotel 41 are outstanding and I recommend this Hotel highly. We also enjoyed the Champagne Bar which is relaxed, elegant and  and perfect for a pre lunch/dinner drink with the very charming French waiter",4,2012,05,09
137,Top of the Line Hotel,"I stayed at Hotel 41 for three nights and it was fabulous.  The room was spacious compared to other Englsh rooms, and the amenities were incredible - everything you would expect and more including a TV in the bathroom, robes, slippers, and a great turndown service.

The lounge was wonderful, an the service was excellent.   The staff was very attentive.  If you decide to stay here, be prepared to be pampered.  The personal attention is a little ""over the top"" compared to soe American hotels and takes some getting used to, but everyone was friendly and courteous to the extreme.

Hotel 41 is within easy walking distance of Buckingham Palace and St James Park, and there are some nice pubs and shops right around the corner.  We were given excellent suggestions for dinner and transportation.",5,2012,05,09
137,Loved and hated in equal measure,"My husband precisely described my feelings about this hotel when he said ""I loved and hated it in equal measure"". 

Hotel 41 has many admirable aspects. Obviously the location is fantastic. The decor is marvellous, with beautiful wall coverings, rich woods and thoughtfully chosen accessories. The bedroom which we stayed in was very well appointed with every need anticipated. We slept soundly in great comfort in the huge bed. I particularly enjoyed the wonderful rain shower. The linens, bathrobes and towels were all of the most luxurious quality. They provide, as frequently mentioned, lots of lovely snacks. We were given a beautiful cake. 

Hotel 41 disappointed us with their style of service. I appreciate that this is converse to many other reviews. I really feel that the service appeals to a particular type of person. Sadly, it didn't suit us. We work in a customer serviced based environment and I strongly feel that excellent customer service is that which matches itself precisely to the individual. I felt that many staff members were trying too hard. Each and every time we entered the Executive Lounge we were faced with endless questions. We are polite people but rather private and I think that if you are well versed in customer service then this should have been obvious.

On the one occasion that we requested a service it wasn't fulfilled. I asked on two occasions for dirty dishes to be removed from the room. In the end we slept overnight with the dirty dishes. This intensely annoyed me. I didn't complain as I didn't want the negativity of such an action to affect our short stay. 

There were two members of staff who I think are really excellent proponents of fantastic customer service. Magda who looked after so much unobtrusively with a lovely smile. A young lady who served us drinks on two of our evenings is a worthy representative of the establishment. She anticipated every need without the facile chatter which others engaged in. 

I'm sorry to report the bad as well as the good but I feel that TripAdvisor is an excellent resource for travellers and one must always endeavour to be objective and accurate. I really feel that a lot of the other reviews relating to this hotel concentrate on the more superficial aspects.",3,2012,05,07

137,Most Memorable Experience in my 28 Years,"As a seasoned traveller I have spent many nights in London's five star hotels.  Having lived in London for the last four years I decided to treat myself to a stay at this wonderful establishment.  In my university years I used to travel through Victoria quite frequently and came across 41 at one point though never really thought about staying then.  Upon arrival at the property which is very well situated with easy access to public transport and an abundant selection of sights and museums(In my eighteen years here I finally made it to see Buckingham Palace).  When you enter the property you are greeted by a warm and friendly member of staff who will let the reception staff know (upstairs on the fifth floor).   Soon you are whisked to the executive lounge (do not let the name deceive you as it is pure indulgence) where you are taken through check in, offered a lovely refreshing drink and informed about the refreshments provided complementary throughout the day(how decaden), the honesty bar as well as the history of the building which takes you back into the historical era of the British glory.  You are then shown to your room which is so well thought out that everything I have ever felt necessary from every hotel room I have been to was all available right there in the heart of London.  The rooms are so well appointed with fluffy bathrobes, a fully stocked mini bar, shoe polish service and anything else you can think of I am sure you will find it in the room.  
In addition to that as it was my partner's birthday they had even placed a bottle of bubbly in the room and a lovely handwritten card.  Just as we thought the surprises were over we were delivered a lovely assortment of macaroons and petits fours as soon as we arrived in the room.  We were very impressed and to say the least thrilled and exhilirated.  The first evening we went out to watch a musical and then when we got back we were informed that they had tried to surprise us with a cake but the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign was left on accidentally (oops) so they were unable to leave the cake in the room to surprise us.  Once again we were speechless.  
Breakfast on the weekends is served until very late and this again exceeded our expectations when we ordered our full english breakfasts we were surprised by the tantalising tastes that it presented.  In conclusion I have to say that although I would rather not have left at all I would definitely save up again for a retreat at 41, enjoy the fully attentive, kind and considerate staff who always seem three steps ahead of your thoughts.  If you think that you've seen the best service try 41 and let them surprise you. Enjoy it.",5,2012,05,03
137,Anniversary,This is a really top notch hotel with excellent service that goes beyond expectations. Very friendly without beeing intrusive. Very stylish with lots of well thought out designs. Worth the money for special occasions. To bad they could not rule over the weather also.,5,2012,05,03
137,Great hotel for Holiday,"Spent 2 nights in London with Hotel 41 was a beautiful time to me. The hotel had a wonderful location (very close to the Buckingham Palace and the St James Park). The stylish and well appointed and exceptionally clean rooms made the hotel really a great place to relax after long journey. There was a pool in the hotel which just made me want to jump into it right away. The staff was so hospitality, friendly, willing to response to any of our requests. The hotel really made me feel that I am at home not in a strange place. Come and stay with the hotel, you will experience the best service ever.",5,2012,05,02
137,Truly exceptional hotel.,"I stayed here for two nights in April. The warm staff makes you feel like you've entered a welcoming club from the moment you first enter the ""hidden"" entry. The library is simply amazing, as is the staff. I think they all knew my name within 20 minutes of arrival. I will definitely return here on my next stop in London. ",5,2012,05,01
137,Old fashioned attention to service,I stayed for one night and found the whole experience excellent. As a regular user of 5 star hotels in London I can safely say this hotel ranks with the best. Small and unusual the whole focus is upon personal service from the moment you arrive through to the moment you leave.,5,2012,04,30
137,What a wonderful hotel!,"Decided to treat ourselves to a two night stay at ""41 "" as my partner was running his first London marathon and it was my birthday the following day.Having read the many glowing reviews all I can say is that I fully agree with them! All the staff made our stay very special and everyone was so friendly,",5,2012,04,27
137,A Haven of Tranquillity and Charm,"Hotel 41 is at the centre of London's tourist hotspots but on entering the hotel guests are immediately in a calm, tranquil setting.  Reception, check-in, all guest rooms and dining areas are on the 5th floor, reached by lift. The lounge, where breakfast and light meals are served is lovely - shades of genteel grandeur. The staff, as many other reviewers have stated, are friendly, helpful and professional.  We were greeted with glasses of champagne, chocolates in the room, many extras.  We were made to feel like guests - rather than clients.  We were addressed by name and with a smile and nothing was overlooked. A very pleasant short break.",5,2012,04,23
137,"Best service ever, nothing too much trouble.","This was our second visit, the first our wedding night last year and this year for our first anniversary. To have a fantastic time yet in relaxed surroundings, this is a real treat. 

This is a fabulous place, the only thing I would say is the rooms are smaller than expected but don't let that put you off as it is a real experience in service. Monika is wonderful.",5,2012,04,22
137,3rd time in Paradise,"We keep coming back to London just to stay at this wonderful hotel. Being our 3rd time there we truly feel at home now and, as the staff is always so chatty and friendly it almost seems we go back there visiting some old friends. This time we were upgraded to the split level suite which is amazing...at the entrance you have a small tv room with a table where you can relax at evening or have breakfast in the morning, upstair you have the very spacious bedroom and the bathroom. We loved the suite and had enough space to have a couple massage in room! I also had make up and hair done in room and the artist recommended by the hotel was amazing. I am a messy person so asked for a lot of different bookings for restaurants and shopping and the hotel staff was amazing as always helping me out and making sure we were always happy. They also came with me to the tube station helping me out with the oyster card request! We had breakfast there every morning and also a dinner and a lunch and food is amazing...I truly recommend the egg florentines, egg benedict, chicken in peanut sauce, mushroom fritters and chicken burger with avocado...delicious! They also made their best with my dairy intolerance! I really cannot say one negative thing about this hotel or the staff, can just suggest anyone to stay there but be prepared...you will want to go back there very often! For the first time you go there I really suggest winter when the fireplace in the lounge is working and everything looks even more cozy!",5,2012,04,17
137,Made the wedding proposal magical,"Wonderful, friendly, conscientious and helpful staff made our stay in this beautiful hotel a fantastic experience. The room was lovely, especially when decked out with candles and rose petals!",5,2012,04,15
137,"A lovely cosy atmosphere, and superb service","My wife and I hugely enjoyed our stay at '41' for 2 nights last weekend.  

The property was not originally built as a hotel, so the rooms are not 'cookie cutter' copies of each other, and ours was quite small.  But, it was a complimentary upgrade from a standard Double, the fittings and contents of the room were well thought out, and the bed was huge and we slept in deep feathery comfort!

There are only around 30 rooms in the hotel, and the main public space is a large, bright and comfortable Library, with a cosy mezzanine level for extra privacy.  The small number of rooms, the numerous well trained staff, their attentive but not intrusive service and the fact that checkin, checkout, meals and the bar are all in this one lovely space gives the hotel a small, cosy, comfortable atmosphere.  

Speaking of meals, we particularly appreciated the 'plunder the pantry' feature, where the staff lay out meats, cheeses, fruit etc in a small buffet for you to help yourself when you get back from the theatre (or if hunger strikes during the night!).

The location is good, opposite the Palace Mews and convenient to Victoria Tube station for getting around.

Thanks to the constant attention from Frederic and his staff we truly felt welcome at 41, and it makes a welcome change from large, anonymous hotels.",5,2012,04,14
137,Above and beyond expectations,"I need a dictionary of superlatives to describe the experience here. Was it the chess game over canapes in the library lounge? Was it the complimentary overnight shoe shine service? Was it the offer of a choice of the next day's newspapers in multiple languages upon arrival? Was it the personalised card welcoming us to the hotel on our desk? Was it the Belgian chocolates and muesli bars available all day? Was it the surprise turndown service which saw our king size bed covered in rose petals? Thanks to the courteous, smiling and professional staff who outnumbered the guests, this is sure to be a highlight of any hotel stay. Couldn't recommend it highly enough.",5,2012,04,12
137,26 hours of as close to perfection as possible...,"There is so much I could write about this stay but to start with this was the best 24 hours (26 in fact) I've ever spent in a hotel! 

I'll briefly start with a couple of small improvement areas - 1) the TV cabinet is mirrored and if you're not careful you could break the mirror as the door opens on to the fireplace, 2) black out blinds would be better as in the morning the room was a bit too light and 3) a bigger TV would be ideal (and would fit in the TV cabinet)

Apart from these points everything else was pretty much perfect. There isn't huge amounts I can add to the other reviews but I'll give it a go! My immediate reaction upon spotting the 41 canopy was I'm not too sure about this location as it's on a busy road but I needn't have worried. We were greeted on the ground floor and advised somebody was coming down to greet us and escort us upstairs. The chap who greeted us was Ramon or Roman (apologies but the name slips my mind) but was very welcoming and made us feel at ease immediately.

Upon arrival in the Executive Lounge we were seated at reception and offered a glass of champagne - if only all hotels welcomed you like this! After checking in we were given a tour of he public areas (admittedly small but it's a small hotel so it has everything you need) and then taken to our room and given an in depth tour of the stunning black and white themed room. 

The room, as you can see from the photos, was stunning and a good size given the location. Waiting for us in the room were some lovely macarons (yes that's one ""o"" Karolina ;-)), nougat and chocolates. 

The Executive Lounge came complete with free snacks and an honesty bar (with, for example, 6 different gins) so we made the most of us this and sat on a comfy sofa with other snacks, popcorn and canapes as time rolled away. In the early evening they also offer a ""Plunder the Pantry"" option which included, on our evening, a number of meats, cheeses, salads and fruits of which you can eat as much as you wanted.

Before we knew it the time was 9pm so we popped out for a quick walk to get some fresh air but we couldn't stay away for long and were back within 15 minutes. On returning to our room we found a birthday mousse cake which was stunning - it looked huge but was so light that we ate it all within a few minutes. The hotel had also spread rose petals on the floor, bed, bedside table and surrounding candles that they'd lit - it's these small gestures that elevate this hotel and help it justify number 1 hotel in London on Trip Advisor

Breakfast was very tasty and was in fact more like Brunch given we got there at 11.30ish - Full English and Eggs Florentine, although they did kindly give us a South African sausage to try, which comes highly recommended. As the hotel wasn't full the next day they also offered us a late checkout (4pm) and we were never going to turn that down! 

However 4pm soon came round and it meant we had to leave (after spending 25hrs 45 minutes of the previous 26 hours inside the hotel) 

Yes the hotel is expensive but for a special treat it's absolutely worth it - will I go back? Absolutely! I can easily see why some people have called this the most romantic hotel in London; I'd also say it's the most relaxing as well - if you stay here just stay in and experience the staff, bedroom, exeucitve lounge and ambience to its full!",5,2012,04,11
137,Best guest service ever,"I imagine that people who spend thousands to stay in the best suites of the best hotels get treated like this regularly, but being accustomed to being just a ""regular joe"" staying in an average room, I have never experienced the kind of personalized customer service that we experienced at this hotel.  One morning at breakfast, my daughter saw a tray of blackberries wheeling by, and said, to no one in particular, ""yum!""  30 seconds later a bowl of blackberries was in front of her.  Another 30 seconds later and the food services manager is asking her if she's ""opposed to whip cream,"" and, upon receiving a negative answer, comes back with a gorgeous blackberry/whip cream smoothie he'd just made for her.  We went to Cornwall for a few days and then came back, and everyone greeted us and welcomed us back by name.  And then proceeded to upgrade us for our last night in London to a palatial suite.  Staying there was one of the highlights of our trip.",5,2012,04,11
137,second to none - simply the best experience in London - ever!,"as experienced travellers we  had high expectations - all of them were fulfilled and even surpassed. It started in The cosy lobby with warm handshakes, superb check-in service by 2 georgious ladies with a fantastic sense of humour to our fantastic suite. They assisted with any of of needs from reservations, limo rental etc - we felt immediately at home and highly appreciated the quitness of the hotel (it has only rooms at toplevel).  We will back - the sooner the better.",5,2012,04,10
137,THE place to stay in London!,"After spending the night with a friend and parents at Hotel 41 for my 18th, I have to agree with every other review written about the hotel. It is definitely the place to stay in London, the service is exceptional, from the moment we arrived to the moment we left everything was catered for (even a rose for me to give to mum on Mother's day, to Julien checking we had found the hair dryer in our room!). The room was lovely, and being greeted with a glass of champagne on arrival would go down well with anyone im sure! It was all the small touches that made our stay so enjoyable (like being given a little birthday cake with afternoon tea!) All the staff were willing to help with anything, again, Julien was more than helpful finding information about going out in London, even putting us on the guest list for Funky Buddah. I would recommend the hotel to anyone, and would certainly like to return in the near future!",5,2012,04,08
137,If Only There Was A 6 Star Rating... Utter Perfection,"The Hotel 41 was, in short, the best hotel I have ever stayed at, and saying that does not come lightly. The hotel is beyond words- the stay was as close to perfect as you will get, anywhere in the world. There are hotels then there is the Hotel 41- it is like having a home on Buckingham Palace Road, not just a room or suite to stay in. The hotel staff become like family, or at the very least a 'team' you have in London which you can depend on, and never need to think twice about making the most out of world requests, some which you would never make anywhere else. For someone who has experienced some of the best hotels in the world, none, and I mean none, come close to offering what the Hotel 41 offers. Forget the fact that this there is a beautiful, balanced ambiance of a luxurious, exclusive private club, or that the designers have thought of absolutely everything within the rooms/suites to make a for a very pleasant, ultra-high quality feel, for ultimately it is the wonderful staff, the people, that truly make this property shine. They will do all that they can to help you, and as previously stated, you will know each one by name. For a hotel with only 29 rooms, everyone is well acquainted with everyone, even during the shortest of stays. The attention to detail is beyond anything else, on Easter they had a beautiful collection of high quality chocolates, the small touches go a very long way- but all the major aspects you would expect of this, or any hotel are too in check.
    At the end of every busy day, I would truly look forward to come back to the warmth of 41. Prior, I was considering the Four Seasons, The May Fair, The Ritz- now I know you'd be bonkers to go anywhere other than the 41. Why would you? For within this small, boutique London hotel, you will find utter perfection.",5,2012,04,07
137,Simply stunning,"What do i say that has not been written before?
I have worked in the Hotel industry for 20 years and have stayed pretty much all over the world, Hotel 41 and the team are so good , in fact good is not the right word. Perfect.
Nothing to much trouble, everything as you would expect, everything that you read is true.
I often find it difficult to relax and turn off whilst staying at any hotel as it feels like a im working myself, but this stay was just perfect, to the point i relaxed completely.

Check in was very personal , the room ""  a suite"" was well laid out and very clean, the turndown on the first night and birthday cake was a nice surprise and the lounge and plundering the pantry really added a beautiful personal touch to the stay.

Frederic and the team really pushed the boundary of what service means and i left feeling like we have found a new home from home whilst in London.",5,2012,04,06
137,"""Our best choice ever""","For our recent stay in London , we had selected Hotel 41, mainly because it was a small boutique hotel, properly located and nicely decorated from what we could see on the hotel’s internet site.
It was also amongst the Condé Nast Traveler Gold list.
 
To our great surprise, this was our best selection ever for an hotel, not only in UK but from all our previous travel around the world!
Of course, the hotel is very well located, quiet, small and cosy; that is what you should expect from this category.
But what really makes the big difference is the quality of service and the pampering attention received from the staff members.
The team was always warm and made us feel like in our own manor in London !
 We can only recommend it to anyone looking for a “difference” when travelling to London.
A special thanks to Frederic and all his team!

137,Service beyond compare!,"I have quite simply never stayed in a hotel with such attentive and considerate staff.  They knew all of our names from the moment we arrived. I loved that all the rooms were on the same floor. It made the hotel feel small, intimate, cozy and sophisticated.",5,2012,04,04
137,Sweet satisfaction,"Like many others on this page, I'm not a regular reviewer of hotel experiences.  However, I'm more than happy to report on a wonderful stay at Hotel 41. Every aspect of the hotel exceeded our expectations. 

Service:

The service, which is justly lauded on here, made our trip to London incredibly relaxing, which is not something I've been able to say of the city before. It really is a question of 'Whatever, whenever'. If the cost of staying here makes you hesitate, remember that this adds value beyond what any normal hotel can offer. As a one-off experience, or an occasional treat, it would be hard to beat. 

Rooms:

Beautiful though admittedly compact. The most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. 

Food:

Wonderful. We ended up getting back quite late so opted to Plunder the Pantry instead of going our for dinner. The first time, I went out to collect a few plates of food. The victuals consisted of smoked duck, wonderfully spiced chorizo, rare cured meats, incredible cheeses, fresh tiger bread and various chutneys and salads. I'm ashamed to say my wife and I ordered a section helping to be delivered to our room when we were in our bath robes! The reply came: ""This will be with you in less than 5 minutes"". And so it was. Then I remembered I forgot to ask for fruit and rather tentatively pressed the magic button on the telephone again. ""Certainly Sir, would you like us to make it into a fruit salad, or just present it on a plate?"". This is turning into a review of the service again but it really does permeate every aspect of the hotel. Breakfast was to die for. I had eggs benedict. We were both able to graze on the continental selection and amazing freshly squeezed orange juice while we awaited the cooked course. The executive lounge is a lovely place to relax in while you eat and I particularly recommend the mezzanine section. The staff positively insisted on bringing anything we wanted up for us and would not hear of us getting up, even to grab something from the continental section. We were so relaxed, I'm ashamed to say we took at least 2 hours over breakfast (which had by the end become lunch). 

Service again:

One final thing. As our room was not required by other guests that evening, we were offered it for the rest of the day, while we went shopping. My wife and I were able to come back, freshen up and have another bath and relax at no extra charge. Tea, coffee and other complimentary snacks were still on tap. This would not normally be available, I'm sure, but the staff took the initiative to offer it to us when it turned out that the room was unexpectedly unoccupied for that day. We felt by the end that we'd been staying there a week. Incredibly relaxing. 

Special mention for Monika - lovely Polish lady who organised much of the above. Magda too, and Freddie, in the evening (consummate professional in the best French style). The chap from the pantry, whose name I didn't catch, was also fantastic, and the lady with auburn hair who served us breakfast should also take a deserved share of the plaudits. 

One night in this hotel is worth as much, and, indeed, in many ways more, than several nights in any good four star. Don't hesitate.

137,A totally magical end to our wedding weekend,"We booked Hotel 41 as it's rated as number 1 here on TripAdvisor...and we weren't disappointed! 
WOW - what a fantastic experience.

On arrival our car was whisked off to be parked and we were greeted by Roman at the front door. We then went up to the Executive Lounge to check in, where, once they found out we had just got married, we were given complimentary champagne.
The Executive Lounge is a great place to relax, and we ended up sitting in here for an hour before we even went to our room.
Magda and Frederic were fantastic and offered us a reduced rate to upgrade to room 4104 - the Conservatory Master Suite - an amazing room with a glass roof to see up to the stars at night. We were then brought a bottle of champagne and cake to celebrate our marriage.

We hadn't booked anywhere for dinner, but this was no problem for Magda who sorted us a table out at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon - a great choice (see separate review).

Breakfast this morning was delicious and we didn't want to come home!

The staff at this hotel made it the best experience we have ever had in a hotel anywhere - they really are fantastic.

A special thank you to Michael, Magda, Frederic, and Roman for making it the perfect end to our wedding weekend.",5,2012,04,02
137,The Hidden Jewel in London's Crown,"Having read the recent reviews on trip advisor  we booked this hotel hoping , but not expecting , this to be as good as everyone says .
Well it wasn't as good , it was BETTER ! 
From the unassuming entrance to the grandeur of the private club lounge feel , everything was wonderful .
We were upgraded from a double to a king room which was a lovely surprise , this was black and white and overlooked The Royal Mews . The bathroom was big and had lovely toiletries.
The location is excellent  as it is between Victoria train / tube station and Buckingham Palace and you can also stoll through the park to Picadilly CIrcus in approx 20 to 30 mins .
The service is impeccable , nothing is too much trouble . After hearing it was my birthday they arranged a lovely tasty cake and a romantic turn down service .
A special thanks to Frederic and all his team for a lovely stay and a worthy number one status on trip advisor , we will return .",5,2012,03,29
137,Priceless,"Hotel 41 which was originally recommended by a friend many years ago when I was going to London on business and I decided after this last trip to write a review so others can learn about what I call one London's best kept secrets. Even people who live in London don't know about this amazing hotel.  I cannot say enough about the exceptional service and the quality of this hotel and its staff.  It is hidden away within the Rubens Hotel and the only place I will stay while I am in London.  Impeccably decorated, the hotel's Executive Lounge (reception) is a combination of an old world library that is a comfortable and elegant setting where you feel comfortable and cozy as opposed to the huge loud reception areas of most chain hotels. It is very private and secluded yet the atmosphere is inviting and relaxed.  The service is immaculate and their staff anticipates your needs before you have to ask for things.  You are greeted always on a personal level, appreciated as an individual, offered a cocktail or drink (I'm a champagne girl) before you even sit down and treated royally.  Maybe that comes naturally since it is centrally located right across the street from the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace so it is close to historical and the great sites of London. They are a small but intimate hotel so make sure you call for availability.  They pay attention to the little details that so many of the larger hotels miss and the staff and management work hard to make sure that they make every effort to meet any request you may have. If you travel alone, as I often do, they make a special effort to make you feel like you are one of the family and they are there for you no matter what time of the day you call.  Check in is as personal as your check out and you don't feel (especially upon arrival) that you are just another number standing in line like you would at the airport getting on a plane. The rooms are perfectly appointed and to that point, they have just about everything in the rooms that you might have forgotten at home and if it isn't there, they find it for you. Anything that you may want from theatre tickets to arranging a car or where to get a watch fixed, they instantly work to meet your requests. Every staff member is well trained, personable and happy to serve.  Yet they are never intrusive or overbearing in their service during your stay.If you walk in at the end of the day, exhausted from business or walking the town, you are always welcomed back with a smile and an offer of a drink or food or both.  Which by the way, is excellent. Although I'd like to mention every staff member that made my trips there memorable, it would have to be every staff member I've ever come across from the Manager of 41, Frederic, who obviously takes pride in his work and staff to the room maids, bellmen and everyone involved in the goal that should be every hotel's goal...to help you have the most perfect and memorable stay possible while you are with them.  It is obvious the GM, Mr. Malcolm Hendry has done an excellent job in picking the best people for their jobs and entrusting Frederic and those on his team, to out perform even the most well-known larger hotels. They do that and beyond.   I would say that the level of service and the people that give that service is uncomparable but they don't give you that option here with only ""excellent"" being your highest choice.   I've recommended this hotel to friends and business associates all over the world.  You will not be disappointed and as the commercial goes, your experience at Hotel 41 will be......priceless.",5,2012,03,28
137,exceeded expectations of this detail oriented traveler,"i am a generally detail conscious traveler and was very impressed by this hotel and it's staff from the first communication to the last. my husband and i combined a business and pleasure trip, and all of our needs were met and exceeded. the cappuccino here is excellent, as well as the afternoon tea service was quiet and delicious. i would recommend that travelers note that they can source the concierge next door at the rubens as needed. bravo to this hotel and i would definitely return.",5,2012,03,28
137,Best Service Ever,"I am a hotel Snob! I stay in hotels like the Four Seasons Egypt and The Setai 5th Avenue, New York. I don't write reviews cos I am very busy, but I had to write this one.The service in this hotel was better than amazing! The manager Frederic Dallot was a gem. He knows your name, he knows what you like from a simple conversation and he makes anything you need happen. My husband booked a night stay as an anniversary surprise and frederic handled every detail. From the cake upon arrival to the rose petals, candles and champagne when we got back from dinner which the hotel booked. He made sure my husband was aware of every detail like how long the candles burned for. I simply felt spoilt! Breakfast was really nice a choice of anything on the menu and a buffet. The bar is always available and a choice of snacks are included. Yes the hotel is small and the style is not very modern but you can not beat the service in this hotel. When we left we did not get a chance to see him. He sent us a personal email saying sorry he missed us and wished us well on our journey.",5,2012,03,28
137,Another superb weekend. The Gold Standard of hotels.,"Many thanks to Frederic and all the staff at the 41 for yet another excellent weekend in London. This hotel is like no other and it is really all down to the staff. Yes they are courteous and efficient as you would expect, but what makes the difference is, they are all so friendly; they really enjoy looking after you.
From the moment you walk into the lobby, the first glass of champagne whilst checking in and relaxing in "" The Library "" you are in another world that is calm and warm and friendly.
The rooms have everything you would expect and more. On our latest stay we had an upgraded  room / suite with 3 televisions!! We didn't watch any of them as there was too many other things to do.
Food served in the lounge is 1st class, there is a good choice and the prices are very reasonable. There is a fine selection of drinks from the bar and lovers of single malts will not be dissapointed. 
Overall a highly recommended hotel, certainly the best we have stayed at in London, and amongst the best of the small hotels in the world.",5,2012,03,28
137,Wonderful Hotel,"I've stayed in hundreds of hotels and Hotel 41 provide the best service I can remember. Nothing is too much trouble and it's a pleasure for them to do. 

The rooms are very small, or at least the one I stayed in, which wasn't the cheapest room. That is the biggest letdown, but on balance it doesn't matter. Everything else makes up for it. Even the cooked breakfast was fantastic too, everything was perfect and the ingredients were fresh and the food was delicious. 

I wholeheartedly recommend Hotel 41.",5,2012,03,27
137,AMAZING!!!!,"We recently spent the weekend in London to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary, and I cant thank Frederic and his team enough for making it a truely memorable weekend. The room was gorgeous, as was the hotel and service. Being from South Africa, I also loved the little touches like having boerie for breakfast. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone, it was fabulous from start to finish.",5,2012,03,26
137,"""Whatever, whenever""","As a professional in the hospitality industry, I can only take my hat off to the team at Hotel 41!
The level of comfort is very high, rooms and common areas (the lounge, lobby...) beautifully decorated and always spotless. However, what distinguishes 41 most from any other hotel I've visited is the level of service. Every member of staff does their best to ensure your stay is up to your expectations, and more. Efficient, but also extremely kind, courteous and genuinely good people. 
In the lobby, you are offered instantly assistance as to organising transport, restaurant reservations etc. My girlfriend and I were welcomed by a charming young lady named Laura.
Check-in, which is done champagne in hand in the executive lounge, with Magda was more like a chat with a friend than an administrative process. Again, efficient and enjoyable.
The executive lounge is excellent. A great private club feel to it, and flawless service. One interesting young man called Michael stood out particularly. While the lounge always seemed quite full with jolly guests, he was able to provide the highest standard of service anyone could ever hope for. Fast, yet poised and calm. He is talkative, charming, and seems quite intelligent. Another was Boris, a thoroughly good chap and a true professional who often teamed up with  Rita, an experienced team leader who is always happy and friendly.
Many others in the lobby and lounge (whose names I unfortunately didn't catch) made our stay wonderful. All led by an awesome manager, Frederic (who seems to live there), and is evidently the inspiration of his staff. He leads by example. 
I will be back soon.",5,2012,03,26
137,Dissapointing,"This is a rather small hotel near Buckingham Palace area - great location . . I stayed there for 2 nights in July 20011. Shortly  ,  the place is Really  overpriced - I paid more than  £500 for a suite for one night expecting a really great place, altho the place has its charm  , the level of service and room i expect at that price is much higer.

Its all about expectation level:-)",3,2012,03,26
137,"Excellent hotel, based on service","This is a boutique/small hotel in Buckingham Palace Rd, near Victoria, so position is great. Its right next to The Rubens Hotel, part of the same group.
We had an executive king room (4117), which was very comfortable, though the lay-out was strange.
Ceiling height must have been about 2m and as I am 1.95m tall this felt quite oppressive on entering. The A/C vent is directed from the wall directly at the right side of the bed, which was a little disconcerting during the night. The Bose soundwave bedside clock/radio was on a desk around a corner from the sleeping area and could not be seen and not heard well. One of the power points at the desk was faulty.
The bed was very comfortable, room very quiet. Free wifi. Everything else worked well.
Spacious bathroom - 2 showers, one over the bath. The other was designed so it was used with some difficulty, as the door only opened inwards, so getting in and out was not as easy as it should be.
But the service - Wow. Everyone we encountered was friendly, went out of their way to help, and were very well trained. The executive lounge was fine and useful, with an honour bar for the late hours and a ""raid the pantry"" feature if you needed a snack after 8:30pm.
So, in spite of the design/lay-out issues in our room, I still rate this hotel as excellent - after all, it is an overall experience, not just small idiosyncrasies of the room that matter the most.
Highly recommended.",5,2012,03,23
137,Birthday Treat,"After reading fantastic reviews on Hotel 41 my partner asked if i would like to stay for my Birthday
we stayed from 11th-13th March as the 12th was my Birthday, we did a deal on line that included a 3 course meal at The Library at the Rubens hotel(which was fantastic) and a upgrade to a deluxe room,as soon as we walked through the door i knew we would love it, we was warmly greeted and from that moment to the end of our stay the staff couldn't do enough for us to make sure it was perfect in every way,we upgraded again on arrival(well,it was a treat) and and so pleased we did the room was beautiful and split on two levels champagne on ice was waiting for us,the evening of my birthday i returned to our room to find it lit with scented candles and rose petals scattered over both rooms....what a lovely touch, so until the next time Thank You it Was Perfect

137,The best ever,"Me and my wife were looking for an outstanding boutique hotel in the very center of London, to spend few days with our 10 months daugther. Our main concern was to pick a superb accomodation possibly avoiding the luxurious clichés, vapid and stereotyped places, the likes of Dorchester and Savoy. Browsing the booking.com web site we discovered this small and outstanding hotel, impressed by the sober but fine and splendid black&white interior decoration. Then we sorted the hotels' list by review score and suddenly we noticed that in that moment the 41 was the only one to get the highest score (9.2).

We genuinely enjoyed to be guests at the stunning 41 and we are grateful to the management for the executive king size upgrade that was kindly prearranged for free, in order to let our stay be more cosy with the child's bed in the room. We also are immensely obliged to the whole staff for the fast, constant, remarkable and considerate assistance: whatever, whenever. Everybody was incredibly warm, kind and solicitous also with our baby and the teddy bear as gift, found on her bed during the second day of our stay, was the icing on the cake. Our opinion on any aspect of this marvelous place is unquestionably positive and we recommend it to everybody, being suitable for any kind of people and journey. The 41 also is very well located, just in front of the Royal Mews, lying so very close to the most desirable and fashionable districts. I believe that it is a jewel among hotels in London, but this will not be longer a well kept secret. So hurry up!

137,A little place of heaven in a very busy city !!,"We stayed here for my daughter, Charlotte's, 18th birthday.  Charlotte found this hotel after days of looking on the internet for different hotels and I must say she has chosen well.  The service exceeded my expectations from the moment the door opened.  To be greeted on the door by a young happy and courteous man was wonderful. The staff here at the hotel are incredible and are able to communicate with all age groups.  Frederic (I hope I have spelt this correctly) was so helpful it was unlike anything I have experienced in London hotels.  Nothing was too much trouble and the hotel has a wonderful club lounge feel which actually makes you think you are somewhere completely different to a busy city.   When we arrived at our restaurant one evening in Regent Street  to find it closed Charlotte rang the hotel and Frederic was most helpful even going to the point of finding us another similar restaurant . A  table at 8.00pm on a Saturday evening is not that easy to find so bonus points for that.  Also I must mention Julien (once again I hope the spelling is correct), once again so courteous and helpful especially organising nightclubs etc for my daughter.  So Frederic and Julien your service was excellent and so refreshingand I will of course recommend your hotel.  It goes without saying that all the other staff were equally as helpful and courteous but at the time of our stay at the hotel these two young men definately made an impression on our family.  I find London very busy and usually try and avoid staying there however now I have found this amazing hotel '41' there is no doubt that whenever I visit London again that is where I will stay.  Alot of other hotels could learn alot from you all at 41.  Well done.",5,2012,03,21
137,very excellent,"I would like to thank Mr Frederic, Dhana, Monika and the other staff for the Great Great Great hospitality and welcoming. I have experienced the fabulous welcoming from the moment I have reserved the room, it was the first time in my hotels experience that such a hotel send me a forum to fell.They asked me about my preference and what I want them to prepare for me. once I arrived to the hotel they took me to the reception and ask me for any thing I would like to have while they sort me out. there where a complimentary snack and Tea in the lounge area for free. the lounge area is very nice and quite and classic. they toke me to the room no. 4114, and the lady has introduced the very nice room in a very nice way. As I was celebrating my 2nd wedding anniversary they have prepared a Turn-down romantic to the room and brought the best cake I have ever tasted. You just feel that you are the only one in the hotel. once you call the reception they welcome you by your name and deliver the service you require in just seconds. they provide you with every thing you want. the hotel is very quite and clean. simply the best hotel ever in welcoming and staff. I have visited Versace hotel in Gold coast, Atlantes in Dubai, One&only in Cape town, Intercontinental in London, and many hotels all around the world. the other hotels may be better in the lounge area as it is very big and very crowded. but non of the other hotels would deliver better service and hospitality as 41 ever. 
Trust me it is extraordinary great hotel. one more thing to mention, once the hotel ordered me a taxi it was raining out side, so the bell man has given me an umbrella to take. Also I have asked them about the tasty cake, so they told me that they will send me the recipe. Best service... Best hospitality... Best welcoming... Best staff... very clean... very comfortable very good location... in total the best hotel ever!!",5,2012,03,20
137,Thank you for a wonderful experience,"If you are prepared to pay for an intimate, cosy, and luxurious experience, Hotel 41 is the place to stay at. We have never felt more welcome and cared for than here.
We have tried various hotels in London, and we will definitely return to Hotel 41. We were there for our wedding anniversary, and in the evening we entered our room, which was decorated with rose petals and candle lights all over the place. The staff is efficient, professional and polite; the rooms are wonderful, and the service is excellent.",5,2012,03,18
137,Another pleasant stay at 41,"Stayed here in 2009 after finding it on Tripadvisor as #1 hotel in London. When we decided to go back to London again for a few days in March 2012 our first choice was to come back to 41.  Ideal position to explore both the West End and museums etc.  Service is impeccable.  Staff are all extremely pleasant and helpful - nothing is too much trouble. Beautiful Anniversary cake on arrival, together with a red rose and rose petals on the bed that night (no extra charge!) - all because i mentioned our visit was for our anniversary when booking on the internet. Thoroughly recommended for a special stay. It is no wonder that it is #1 rated hotel in London.",5,2012,03,18
137,Great place to stay,"This is one of the best hotel i stayed in. Everything was just perfect. The room was very clean,tidy , very quiet. The staff was great, good communication , courtesy, empathy.
I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2012,03,17
137,Fantastic,"We stay in London a lot, in both large and boutique hotels. Hotel 41 surpasses them all. Not only is the hotel beautiful but the staff couldn't have been more attentive. My only recommendation to the hotel is please invest in larger tv's. My husband and I decided to spend the evening in the hotel which is something we never do because we wanted to make the most of our night at the hotel and the television is rather small for the size of room. But that is the only negative point in what is a truly wonderful hotel",5,2012,03,16
137,Outstanding!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"When looking for a hotel to stay for a short amount of time but with a maximum impact when it comes to attentiveness. This hotel ticked all the boxes for us both. 

This trip was our Honeymoon (March 11 - March 14) we were married the day before arriving. Even though I'd read many glowing reviews on here prior to arriving I was still continually amazed as was my Wife at the courteous and friendly staff that made our stay here perfect in every way I cannot praise them highly enough.

We arrived by taxi and were ushered into the quaint downstairs lobby and then quickly relieved of all our luggage. We were taken up the five floors in a lovely golden elevator and shown the way through to the Executive Lounge which immediately brought a wow to my lips. Check in was smooth and quick and we were offered any kind of drink we chose. 

Next we were shown to our room (Executive King 4110) which made my jaw drop. it was exactly as the the pictures on here and the 41 website show. It has a charm about it that leaves you smiling when you enter. We were shown some of the features of the room and the flowers and chocolates which I had asked to greet my Wife were there also, along with a surprise congratulatory cake (which tasted divine by the way). We took some time to freshen up and take in the feel of the room then headed out for a short walk up the road to see Buckingham Palace which is only 5 mins away, brilliant. 

As part of our say we received a complimentary meal which was arranged for us on the mezzanine level of the Executive Lounge just the two of us a beautifully candle light table scattered not just with rose petals but with roses too. It was a night to remember. 

The following day was the best ever. We started with a little sight seeing, a little shopping and then in the evening we were taken by our private chauffeur to The Ivy for a wonderful meal. this was followed by a Show and chauffeur back to the hotel only to be greeted in our room with the most romantic turndown. It was out of this word and brought a tear to my Wife's eye. Even though I'd asked for the turndown I was not expecting the level of detail that was put into making it a very special and romantic end to our night.    

Lots have been said about this hotel and justifiably so, it is the staff that make this place what it is and the place that adds the sparkle. If you are looking for romance you need not look any further as 41 oozes romance. It was perfect for us as we were looking for somewhere quiet and special where we would feel individual. 41 hit the mark without being snooty or stuffy the staff were fantastic and were never too busy to have a quick chat each and every member of staff seemed to know our name and always greeted us in passing. 

Simply, my Wife and I highly recommend.",5,2012,03,15
137,What a Fantastic Hotel and Staff,"Stayed for two nights and all I can say is the best hotel we have stayed in bar none, as soon as we arrived from the welcoming member of staff in the front lobby, to the fantastic staff greeting you as you arrive at the reception.
Every member of Hotel 41 should be congratulated on their first class attention paid to the guests nothing was too much trouble , what ever you need they are on hand to help you..

Upon arrival you greeted with a welcoming smile and two very nice glasses of champagne (not the cheap stuff either )!!!! the room was ready upon arrival-12 midday, and we was told to take our time until we was ready then taken to our room which had the wow factor!!
Open fireplace was on and we were made to feel right at home straight away.
Loved the idea of the honesty bar and plunder the pantry, can't stress how good the staff are everytime we went though to the lounge we were greeted with smiles and asked if we needed anything.
After we had come back in from our little shopping trip there was a lovely birthday cake and card waiting for me!!!! We then went for a meal in the library restaurant next door in the Rubens when we returned there was another lovely surprise a bottle of champagne, rose petals everywhere, red rose on the bed, candles, roses everywhere and music on!

We will def be back later on in the year and have been so spoilt that we do not want to stay anywhere else in London.",5,2012,03,14
137,Amazing refuge,"Just stayed two nights at this wonderful hotel. First visit, and was skeptical given all the glowing reviews -- but Hotel 41 measured up fully. I won't repeat all the points about service levels, other than to say that I've never felt as relaxed and as at home in a hotel anywhere (and I've traveled a lot). The setting is warm and welcoming and you feel the staff is disappointed if you decline their (frequent) offers to help. A very special place.",5,2012,03,12
137,A wonderful birthday experience,"Stayed here for the third time with my husband in an Executive King room. Everything was perfect. 

We brought my husband's mother for a significant birthday weekend and both she and my father in law were enchanted with the place.

The standard of rooms, decor, food, drink, service is just that bit further than you will get in the larger 5 star establishments. You really feel like you matter as a guest here.

Special note to Federic the maitre d' who despite his tender years is the perfect host - nothing is too much trouble, politeness incarnate, no detail escapes his notice.

we will (all) return.
many thanks",5,2012,03,07
137,"Service,service,service. All with charm,warthm and a smile.","I admit this was a lash out for a couple of old Aussie duffers. Rather than the usual impersonal large international hotel we chose this most English of properties. It's an Olde Worlde experience in a remarkable 5th floor boutique hotel. The rooms are beautiful each with its own theme..our was a suite with a fireplace and staircase. Great bathroom with bath and shower. Did I say shower....the best in the world! Hot and great pressure. Lucky it was predicted to rain in London because I used half the cities water in this shower. Wow I've never been so clean.

We had a dinner and afternoon tea in our package. The first was in the restaurant downstairs called the Library. We were knackered and didn't feel like eating...till we sat down. What a meal. It was finished by a bowl of honey crunch ice cream. This had a huge ball of spun honey on it. Absolutely to die for. 
The afternoon tea was proudly presented with lots of pomp but was not quite as good as some we have had. Still good just not fabulous.

What was fabulous was e service, the breakfast, the location and did I say the service. We felt really special at this hotel thanks to Frederick and his team. ",5,2012,03,07
137,Amazing....Sexy....Romantic...everything you could want!,"We have stayed at this hotel 3 times, the first we stayed in the hospitality suite it is such a stunning room with everything in the hotel being black and white it really works. The suite is huge everything you could possible want or need my only criticism is the size of the bath it is such a shame it is not a bit bigger as this would make it perfect! Everyone is really friendly, glass of champagne on arrival, we had room service on this occasion and it was really nice most hotels fall down on room service but nope can't complain about anything. 

The next time we stayed in the conservatory suite erm it's a lovely suite the bathroom is amazing , the bath is perfect would be nice if it was in the hospitality suite. Being able to open up the blind and look up at the stars is very romantic and it is a nice room. We stayed here for my partners birthday they sent up a little cake which is a very nice and personal touch. 

We have also stayed in a normal room which was a good size. 

We really enjoy staying in this hotel and would really recommend staying here especially if you want a romantic night away.",5,2012,03,06
137,I've found my home from home at 41!,"We booked this hotel based on the recommendations on Trip Advisor and it is proof the system really works! From the minute we arrived we were cocooned in the most excellent customer care I have ever experienced, which as a seasoned traveller is saying a lot. Frederic, Remus, Julian and all the other staff made us so welcome and there was nothing that was too much trouble. The rooms, both public and bedrooms, are beautifully presented with dozens of little details for your added comfort. We had two Junior Suites - individual in design but uniformly delightful in style and amenties, and with the most comfortable bed ever!
41 - now that I've found you, you've become my second home in London!",5,2012,03,05
137,The Best Hotel I Have Ever Stayed At!,"I took my girlfriend (now fiance) to propose to her that evening at the hotel and it was the best choice I have ever made. The hotel staff were by far the sole reason for our total enjoyment. Their attention to detail is something to be desired and the rooms were outstanding. After enjoying a complimentary glass of champagne when checking in, we went to our room and minutes later had a phone call from reception to ask if we want to move to an upgraded room which had become available due to a cancellation. We were upgraded to an executive king which was very spacious and well equiped. I also ordered the romantic turndown and they must have used dozens of roses to scatter petals all over the room, the setting was perfect. This was organised while we were at dinner, and there was also a congratulations cake in the room when we returned. I cannot thank all the staff enough (including Frederic the resident manager and Magdalena the reception manager) and I will do nothing but promote this hotel to my family and friends as it was excellent. We can't wait to return already!",5,2012,03,01
137,The Best Kept Secret!,"My husband and I are seasoned travelers, and I am very picky about hotels. Hotel 41 is, by far, my favorite hotel I have stayed in. London's best kept secret is no more! From the moment you walk through the unassuming entrance, a world of elegance, refinement, charm, and exquisite service awaits you. Our two level suite was beautiful with fine linens, contemporary furnishings, an inviting fireplace, two flat screen TVs, and the added touches in the evening of burning candles, tasty chocolates, and bottled water. But it is in the Library where the true pampering awaits. Seated by a crackling fire surrounded by tasteful elegance, the professional staff greet and serve you with a sense of grace and style. Who knew the mere presentation of tea could be made into a true art form? Freddie, Monika, and all the others were outstanding - it is simply their desire to enchant and pamper that makes Hotel 41 a rare find.",5,2012,02,29
137,"Wonderful location, professional and friendly staff","My husband I were celebrating our 10th Wedding Anniversary and wanted guaranteed 5 star accomodation and service. We were not dissapointed. We were warmly welcomed from the moment we stepped inside this lovely hotel. Every single member of staff was friendly, polite and professional lead by Magda and Freddie. When I had realised that I had forgotten my inner soles for my shoes for the evening, one member of staff went out and got them for me! I couldn't believe it. 
Breakfast was amazing. The hotel is small but stunning and situated yards from Buckingham Palace and a 5 min walk to the tube station. We would definetly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting luxury and 5 star service. We will go back with our little girl next time. Thank you Hotel 41 for a truly lovely stay.",5,2012,02,25
137,I can only echo the words of others here,"""simply the best"". 10/10; 5 *; 100%.  This must be as close to heaven as you can get on earth.",5,2012,02,25
137,"""Simply the Best""","I took my girlfriend here for a surprise for her birthday back in January. I have been very fortunate to travel around the world and stayed in quite a few wonderful hotels BUT Hotel 41 is SIMPLY the BEST hotel I have ever stayed in by far!

From the moment I made the reservation and informed the hotel that I was bringing my g/f here for her birthday as a surprise I was given so many ideas/options to make her day even more special.

I was provided with a form prior to arrival so that Hotel 41 could accommodate any special requests. The form included information such as pillow menu, if we required any particular magazines, music etc. 

Once we arrived at Hotel 41 we were greeted to by a very warm welcome by the doorman, that escorted us to reception. We were offered a glass of champagne whilst we checked in.

The receptionist kindly walked us to our room and took the time to show us the amenities offered in our room and also explained to us how to contact a member of staff if we needed any further assistance.

When we entered our room, there was a special birthday cake that had been put in our room before we arrived to wish my g/f a Happy Birthday. This personal touch by Hotel 41 was priceless.

Once we returned from dinner, we went back to our room and to our pleasant surprise, our room was scattered in rose petals, candles, dim lights and romantic music playing.

Attention to detail was of the HIGHEST in every aspect of our stay.

Our room was very clean and comfortable and the pillow menu had over 10 pillow choices!! 

The following morning we had breakfast in 'The Library' which was made to order (full English) and the quality of the food was of a very high standard. The scrambled eggs were AMAZING!

To end our wonderful stay, I had booked afternoon tea for two which we had by the fire place, a perfect way to end a special birthday for my g/f.

All in all, every member of staff that we encountered could not do enough for us and made our stay that extra special.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for that something special. It is an experience you don't receive with so many other 5* hotels",5,2012,02,23
137,Best hotel reception ever,"This is the best hotel staffs I have ever experienced! 

Excellent service, wonderful attention and with heart and sincerity. I have been travelling for more than 15 years and never wrote a feedback, be it good or bad, though I had more than fair share of bad experience and at times, was really tempted to write to complain. 

However, my stay at Hotel 41 was so great that it prompted me, for the first time, to write in and compliment them. In addition to the great hotel staffs, who among many things, were helpful, offered me a boardroom for my breakfast meeting, good dessert plate in my room, brought me a set of tea after check-in. The room is exquisite and location good. 

This is more than boutique, it's a one with class and service. Now I understand why it's the smallest (28 rooms in total) 5-stars hotel in London. I stayed for 2 days and enjoyed every minute of it! Highly recommended! I will definitely come back, be it business or holiday. I think it will be the perfect hotel for someone who wants a treat or celebrating an anniversay or special date",5,2012,02,21
137,London Luxury,"I have stayed at ""41"" on average one week a month for the past year.  The hotel is my ""home away from home"" as I travel from the US to Europe quite often for business. The rooms are wonderful, but it's the staff that make my stays remarkable!

I can't think of anywhere else I'd rather stay when in London!",5,2012,02,21
137,Heaven,"If heaven was a hotel it would be Hotel 41. You 'go to the light' through a beautiful but low key front door. Whereupon you are greeted buy a very pleasant man who shows you the way. Which of course is through some golden gates, you then ascend on high in a golden elevator. At reception you are welcomed by a few angelic members of staff. Who's only job is make sure you stay there is 'heavenly'. Which is helped with a glass of bubbles. 
But seriously. This hotel is amazing. No request is to big or to small. The atmosphere is one of grand opulence and also a romantic hideaway. It has many reasons to be the best hotel you've ever stayed in, but for me the main reason is the staff. They are very professional and yet remain the most friendly people. The turn down service is the most stunning you could imagine.
And as for the honesty bar, its stunning. 
Do not not hesitate to book this hotel, it will be a memory that will last a lifetime.
Thank you God, sorry I mean Federic.",5,2012,02,21
137,A truly praiseworthy boutique hotel of exceptional standard,"My wife and I spent 3 days here during mid-February 2012, and found it every bit as good as the many positive reviews had led us to believe. What differentiates 5-star hotels is not so much their infrastructure, but rather their staff, and that of the ""41"" is quite simply exceptional. We are used to good service but rarely in 40 years of extensive travelling have we met staff of the standard of the ""41"": personable, welcoming, impeccable, polyglot, immensely helpful, and genuinely friendly, they made our stay a real joy. The crisp linens, warm duvets, heavy robes and (somewhat recalcitrant but nevertheless cheerful) gas fire also turned our spacious room into a welcome haven from the unexpectedly cold London February weather, as did the well-appointed lounge with its gentlemen's club aura and - again - impeccable staff. In sum, as one reviewer has already put it, ""There is no better place in London to spend your nights"".",5,2012,02,18
137,"Romantic, eclectic, boutique   hideaway, in central location","This is a very special boutique hotel.  The service is cheerful and attentive and was the perfect 20th anniversary treat for my husband and I.  Our stay was made all the more delightful due to the fact that the hotel became a sanctuary away from a heavy snowfall.  London had come to a standstill so after trudging past some familiar London landmarks in the snow, it was wonderful to access the delights of the executive lounge and snuggle by the open fire.  An added surprise was the fabulous romantic turndown, with rose petals scattered in the bedroom and bathroom and floating candles.  The anniversary cake, which had not been prearranged, but very welcomed, topped our evening.  The breakfast was equally tasty and professionally presented and cooked.  Would definitely recommend this hotel.  An added quirk for us was the availability of a food menu for our for legged friends.  I would assume therefore that there are even rooms available to dogs and their owners.  Definitely worth a revist",5,2012,02,17
137,What a Gem!,"From the moment I set food in the classic entrance of the 41 Hotel, I was met with friendly smiles, great conversation, top class service and a lovely (and LARGE) flute of clear champagne. I have nothing but good words for this hotel and I highly recommend it to everyone. The hotel boats gorgeous classic english decor complete with mahogany oak, black and white checks and luxurious leather couches. The rooms are beautiful, spacious and luxurious. The executive lounge has a lovely private gentleman's club feel that I enjoyed immensely. My highest praise goes to the wonderful set of staff they have at this hotel. They were genuinely interested in their guests which is rare to see in hotels nowadays. Mr. Frederic Dallot in particular was fabulously witty and interesting. 

When you drop by this gorgeous gem of a hotel (as you very well should), be sure to ask for the scrumptious 'Bloomberry' cocktail, a delightfully delicious signature concoction. There is no better place in London to spend your nights.",5,2012,02,16
137,Impeccable: perfect in every way!,"From start to finish, our experience in Hotel 41 was exceptional.  As others have, justifiably, commented the staff are brilliant.  Nothing is too much trouble and they look after their guests immaculately.  The reception staff are geuinely interested in their guests and were excellent.  

The lounge is lovely, well appointed and pristinely clean.  We enjoyed a gorgeus afternoon tea there and then in the evening a crisp glass of chablis accompanied by delicious canapes.  We did indeed ""plunder the pantry"" one evening, also delicious and served with grace by an ever helpful staff member.

Our room lived up to expectations and I am fussy about certain features such as the quality of the bed, little touches of luxury and the bathroom products.  On all counts, Hotel 41 was perfect.  The bed was exceedingly comfortable and I really appreciated the opportunity to request the type of bedding and pillows; I prefer duvets to sheets and blankets.  The room was lovely and included two types of robes, warm and cool weather options and all of the home from home touches such as tea and coffee, iron, complimentary wi fi and more.  The turn down service at night was a nice touch with water provided by the bedsides, slippers and a hot water bottle in the bed, and it was cold in London when we visited.

The hotel is very well situated for all of the main tourist sights and, of course, within a stone's throw of the palace.  Bizarrely, we found it cheaper to take a taxi if were travelling within zone 1 of the underground map.  Comfier than the tube and you get to see more.

I cannot praise this hotel highly enough and would go as far as to say that it was the best hotel I have stayed in.  Finally, two words to sum up: just go!",5,2012,02,14
137,"""First Class""","We stayed for three nights in January and had a first class experience from start to finish.  The entire staff were the perfect combination of professional and personable at the same time.  We truly enjoyed our afternoon tea after a long day, with Michael being our server.  The room was comfortable and well appointed.  Thank you Freddie and Monika for a wonderful stay!  We look forward to our return in December.",5,2012,02,10
137,Simply Fabulous,"The world is a much better place for having Hotel 41 in it. I wish for everyone that they had a chance to experience it. It really is a treasure. Hotel 41 in London is a  real gem so if you get a chance, spoil yourself and experience Hotel 41.

This hotel is everything other reviewers have said in their reviews that convinced me to book it for my time in London.  I wondered if my expectations might be too high due to such rave reviews, but I was not disappointed (and I can be picky).  It's very professional but homely at the same time. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff, any of the staff at any time....they are all equally helpful and lovely. 

My son and I shared an 'executive room' with twin beds', room 4106. I understand all the rooms are all unique in some way. The bedding is very comfortable, I slept better at Hotel 41 than in my own bed...and I thought my bed at home was perfect!  The pillow menu was fabulous and a rather special touch. The room has a gas fire place which is perfect, especially since I was there when it snowed in early Feb 2012. 

There is a  Mini bar, a room safe, a nice little wardrobe with a shoe/boot polishing service too...you just put your shoes or boots in the lovely wooden box and they come back polished. I had a wonderful day day in the snow, you should have seen Hyde Park blanketed in white....perfect.   I did so in my new italian leather boots and came back with them a little grubby. I pressed  the  ""whatever/whenever""  button on my hotel phone and they collected them right away...that was 6pm and I had them back as good as new at 8pm!

Room service is 24x7 prompt and very helpful. The spinach and parsnip soup was divine! The bathroom had two showers, one over a long and wonderfully deep bath. Water pressure is good, sink is good, towels are luxurious. You even get a round lit magnifying mirror which ladies will appreciate. Everything has been thought of at Hotel 41. You get slippers and dressing gowns...yes, more than one....a thick one and a thin one. There is DND sign to hang on the door and also a button to press by your bed if you prefer that. Also the same for ""pls service my room"". 

The 'pantry' is lovely, especially in the evening....something different every night. During the day there is fresh fruit and chocolate, dried fruit, bread, bits and pieces to help yourself to. At night...well one night there was amazing cheeses, delicious biltong, bread and the best prosciutto I have ever tasted, another time there was smoked salmon, cream cheese, bread, crackers, salad.....The  bar was very good, it's an honesty bar...though it didn't have a port or muscat.  Michael and Boris at the pantry were such delightful young men, both will go far in their chosen industry.  Michael one night was run off his feet and just delighted all of us....so much potential.  Michael also happened to make a seriously good Irish Hot chocolate. Magda was amazing, Julida and Freddy were really great, and also Julien and Jasmeet at Concierge. They all made us feel comfortable and provided excellent service at all times.  

I met other travelers in the lounge area which was nice, one night there was me from Australia, a gentlemen from Washington and a lady from Belfast. You can talk to others or just read a book, browse the Internet, research your London guide book, chat to the staff about suggestions on your itinerary, or just sip a  cognac by the fire and ponder upon life....whatever you like.

I was also very impressed that the hotel is also pet friendly. We saw one well behaved cute little furry guest with a little jumper on during our stay. 

Everything about Hotel 41 had a nice touch to it. They have a cookbook written with by the owner or head of the Carnation Group and it's a fabulous book...you can buy one, and/or the most cutest teddy ever and all proceeds go to the Starlight Foundation.

Hotel 41 has found a magical way to be. It can't be as easy as they make it seem. But it works and as others have said, Hotel 41 is hard to leave. Even my adult son who is pretty much non-plussed about most things, did not want to leave.

Thank you to everyone at Hotel 41 for making our stay so enjoyable and one we will never forget.",5,2012,02,09
137,Excellent Hotel,"I stayed at Hotel 41 in late January 2012 on the recommendation of my travel agent.  The staff were incredibly helpful (getting direction, hailing cabs, storing luggage,etc.), the room was very comfortable (comfy bed and the bathroom had a shower and a tub in it).  The executive lounge offers an elegant and quiet spot to relax at the end of the day, grab a snack, read a bit and have a drink.  Room service was also very good.  The location is superb, right next to Buckingham Palace and a 10-minute walk to Westminister Abbey.  Close to Mayfair with great shopping and, if you're in the business, lots of hedge fund offices.  I'll definitely stay here again.",5,2012,02,09
137,This is how a 'real' 5 star hotel should behave!,"41 Hotel at Buckingham Palace Road, London is just superb. This is how a 5 star hotel should behave. Warm and sincere welcome and service is second to none. Private hotel but it feels like coming home. Rooms fully equipped, even with Continental European sockets! 
Ever heard a 5 star hotel offering you instantly a coffee or tea with your wake up call??
It's like you have your own butler. Breakfast delicious and again with top service and smile (!).
Although on a very busy business trip in London, I never felt more refreshed the following morning. Highly recommended! Great to learn that Superb service and luxury really still exists!",5,2012,02,09
137,The jewel in the crown,Situated just behind Buckingham Palace this compact bespoke hotel cannot be beaten.  The staff are friendly and helpful. Nothing is to much trouble.  Your receive a wonderful welcome from you arrive until you leave.  I recommend it to anyone staying in London as you will NEVER be disappointed.,5,2012,02,09
137,Fantastic Experience,"We had asked before arriving at Hotel 41 if we could have a early check-in. Our room was ready by 11am which was great. The staff were very welcoming as soon as we stepped into the hotel. We were shown around the 'Executive Suite' and told that Breakfast, Snacks,and 'Plunder The Pantry' was served there at no extra cost ( except for drinks ). Every member of staff were very efficient, smiling, nothing was too much trouble for them especially the resident manager.
Our room was very clean and fresh. Very comfortable bed and pillows, even a pillow menus was available. The bathroom was spotless, I enjoyed taking a bath while watching the TV on the wall in the bathroom!
If we are lucky enough to stay in London again, my first choice of hotel would be Hotel 41 as this was an outstanding Hotel.",5,2012,02,09
137,41 trip,"Outstanding hotel.  the Trip Advisor rating for theis Hotel is SPOT ON 

The experience from beginning to end was amazing (even though we incorrectly arrived at the Rubens next door, we were immediately ushered through the ""secret door"" to 41, making you feel like very important guests!)
.  Monika and her team seem to have it running perfectly and make you feel like they really do appreciate your business.  As our waitress said in the lounge “you’ll never go hungry in this hotel”.  The complimentary side is fantastic, service spot on and on time with breakfast in our room which was very tasty.

I hope to be back here on a very regular basis.  We have always rated the Red Carnation Group of hotels and previously favoured the Chesterfield in the West End BUT we will now go to the W1 when in town or if full back to the Chesterfield which is still also fantastic, just on a bigger less personal scale.",5,2012,02,08
137,Awesome Experience,"I stayed here for several days while on business in London. The hotel is immaculate and the staff are extremely helpful and courteous. The atmosphere was genuine and not stuffy. The day I was leaving, London was dealing with a major snowstorm to them and the airport was canceling flights etc. I was on my way to Paris on the Eurostar and they spent time calling to verify the trains were going to run and even called a cab to come and pick me up. They also offered to allow me to stay and would even take care of getting new tickets for the Eurostar for the next day if needed. I love the place. The food was excellent , the staff were all excellent. They really do go out of their way to make you feel at home. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to be pampered..",5,2012,02,06
137,Fabulous service and lovely oasis in great location!,We recently returned from a 3 night stay at Hotel 41.  The service was exceptional. The rooms were beautifully appointed. The highlight was the lounge which was a quiet and clubby respite from the bustle of the city. Freddie and his staff are world class.,5,2012,02,05
137,Perfection,We had a fantastic 2 nights at hotel 41. The staff are very friendly and helpful and made everything very easy for us.,5,2012,02,05
137,Elegance,"The perfect hotel that is well maintained. Good services. The staff very friendly. If you want luxury and confort, you can stay there. Highly recommended.",5,2012,02,02
137,60th Birthday Celebration,"My son and I have just returned from a three night stay at the 41, celebrating my 60th birthday and I can't praise the hotel highly enough. It was wonderful in every way (apart from the television which was rather small and old) from its perfect central location near Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station, the comfort and warmth of its rooms with so many extra personal touches (there was a delicious birthday cake waiting for me on arrival) and, last but not least, the staff. The service is outstanding, very friendly but courteous and extremely personal. Nothing is too much trouble and they always asked after our day when we returned to the hotel. Everyone helped to make our stay and my birthday celebration so very special.",5,2012,01,29
137,Weekend away with daughter for my 60th birthday.,"Fabulous Hotel,lovely staff,felt very safe in a wonderful setting.Buckingham Palace just over the road.Hospitality was second to none.Had the breakfast and the afternoon tea,both were excellant.Stayed in many London Hotels,because my daughter lives there,and I  visit three or four times a year,so we stay in different Hotels,its like a little holiday each visit.This was the best ever,The room was beautiful,many little touchs,chocs,candles,olives,lovely dressing gowns and slippers,the fire was light when we returned from an evening in the lounge and a little trip in the night air.It was a little expensive,but hey what price a lovely memory,you can't put a price on that.Would love to re visit,maybe at Xmas,Thanks again to all the lovely staff,for a lovely Birthday,still eating the fab. chocs,managed to keep them for myself.",5,2012,01,29
137,Very romantic,"We came here for business/romantic trip. We loved this hotel. Staff was very accommodating. They sent us to a great breakfast place around the corner and also arranged a private car for our return to the airport. My husband was working so I checked in alone and I was very early, so they took our bags and I went exploring the area. When I came back everything was ready. Room wasn't big but we enjoyed the cozy feel to it. We had after dinner drinks sent to our room at night which was very romantic. The location is also a plus. Bucking ham palace is barely a block away and the gardens were beautiful to take a nap or people watch.",5,2012,01,27
137,I do get the hype of this hotel.,"This is a very personal Hotel with great service.  We felt as though we were a guest not just another number.

When you enter the reception/lounge area it feels like you have entered a different world.

The location is brilliant right next to Buckingham Palace.  It took the stress out of a London visit as we could walk to many places such as Westminster.  

You can pay a lot less for hotels in London but id recommend Hotel 41 as its a different experience. Couldnt fault it.",5,2012,01,27
137,DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE,"Stayed four wonderful nights at Hotel 41 in December 2011.  My wife and daughter felt like British Royalty here.  The staff (especially Magdalena and Frederick) went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and welcome.  Probably the best service of any hotel we have stayed at in the world.  Far superior than some of the Peninsula, Waldorf or other Five Star Hotels we have been blessed to enjoy.  I booked the room based on reviews from Tripadvisor.  The price was very high and we thought that there would be no way any hotel is worth this kind of money. We were wrong.  Hotel 41 is worth the price.  Every employee knows your name here.  Every employee addresses you when they see you.  Every employee asks if your require any assistance.  From making restaurant reservations to hailing a cab.  The staff always was there to assist us.  We LOVED the lounge where you can enjoy a cocktail at all hours of the day or night.  Our room was a small suite that had two rooms and two bathrooms.  While the bathroom was small, it more than met our needs.  Cannot say enough positive about our experience at Hotel 41.  As we left to Southampton to take a cruise, our entire family said we wanted to stay longer at Hotel 41.  We also wanted to wake each day to Magdalena's big smile and unequaled service.  Our thanks to the ownership and staff at Hotel 41.  Really a memorable experience!",5,2012,01,18
137,Who are these moaners?,"You really have to go out your way to find something to criticise about this hotel!! I have stayed in bigger hotels, with bigger rooms, with better views...... But to be frank, having regard to the standard of service that you get here, it matters not what the view is. I would not have cared if the view had been of Baghdad after a bad night. It would still get the five stars.

The room was small.... We did not complain, but on day 2 one of the staff came up and said that if we would like to move to a larger room he would arrange that. The one we were in was perfectly adequate and we did not move. They have thought of everything in terms of comfort - even in the desk they had paper clips, stapler, scissors, and all kinds of little bits and bobs you just might need. Free wifi!! Hurrah!!! (my regular readers will know that this is a hobby horse of mine). Extremely comfortable bed - mattress topper of feathers - cracking crisp white linen; hot water bottle in the bed for us; quiet room..... just about everything. 

The staff were absolutely superb. Special mention is Roman at the front of the hotel - who was delightful and prepared to have a bit of a laugh with us. He did claim that the reviews on Tripadvisor were due entirely to him being such a good employee. It may be true.....

The lounge is cozy and welcoming. An honesty bar; excellent free nibbles (not your usual packet of crisps, this one had fantastic cheese, bread, fruit etc etc). 

I would go as far as to say that I have never had such good service in any hotel. I highly recommend it. For those who moan that the rooms are not big enough, did they draw this to the attention of the staff? By my reckoning, such is the standard of service, they would have got Roman to knock a couple of rooms together while you were at breakfast if it would make your stay more enjoyable. 

Superb; highly recommended. Stay away if you don't like to see people working hard to make you have a good time. I am sure the travel lodge has far bigger rooms, if that is your type of thing.",5,2012,01,16
137,Doesn't get better than this,"My husband and I recently stayed at 41 to ring in the New Year in London, following a jaunt to Amsterdam and Paris for a 2-week vacation. I can't think of a better way to kick off our travels. We originally chose 41 after seeing the overwhelmingly positive TripAdvisor reviews, but I must admit I was a little skeptical of the high praise. However, I am happy to report that 41 met - nay, exceeded - all of our wildest expectations. This review is on the long side, but I thought it important to share some specific details and high points:

The Greeting: Our flight arrived at 7 a.m. London time, and even though check-in isn't until afternoon, we went to the hotel to drop off our bags. Upon arriving, the friendly staff greeted us by name and offered us a beverage while we checked in. They then offered us the use of a courtesy room where we could shower and freshen up until our executive king room was ready. This was a life-saver; being able to freshen up allowed us to go out and enjoy a full day in London. Without that shower, we'd have been dragging from exhaustion. 

The Room: Our executive king room was lovely and modern. It wasn't huge, but I never expect that in big cities, especially without getting a suite. However, it was nicely sized, and had a sitting area in addition to the bed/armoire/desk area and bathroom. The bathroom was spacious, and the towel warmer was a welcome bonus. Power adapters were already present in the room, so we didn't even end up using the converters we'd brought. A complimentary fruit basket greeted us, and they left fresh olives each evening, which was great after a long day when you're peckish, but not quite ready for dinner. Housekeeping was discreet and thorough, and they gave us turndown service each night (nice detail: they left different little surprises on our pillows each night...chocolate, mints, biscuits, etc.). They also turned on music with the turndown service each night based on our own individual preferences, which created a really nice, homey atmosphere.

The Location: Our days were spent siteseeing; we love to walk, and this hotel was perfectly situated for that. We were able to walk to most of our destinations, and the Victoria tube station is just a few blocks away if you're going somewhere farther (or aren't as fond of walking). 

The Food: Definitely plan on eating breakfast at the 41 before you start your day. We tried several different menu items (including waffles, smoked salmon, omelets, etc.) and everything was delicious and elegantly prepared/served. Because of the satisfying breakfast, we usually didn't eat again until dinnertime. We had drinks in the executive lounge a few nights, and this was accompanied by some delicious munchies that are personal recipes of the Red Carnation owner (we liked them so much, we picked up her book). 41 also offers snacks throughout the day in the lounge and ""raid the pantry"" in the evenings, though we didn't take advantage of that service. 

The Service: 41 has a boutique, personal feel; I travel for business a good bit, so having a personalized experience is much preferred over the big chain hotels in my opinion. It's important to note that the staff at 41 are attentive, but not overbearing. It's the kind of place where everyone chips in - the more senior staff are not above taking a drink order, clearing a table, or helping carry your bags as in other hotels. The three managers we worked with most were Remus, Magdalena, and Adam, who were all fantastic. I really wanted to see a particular show at the Young Vic, but I was not able to secure tickets in advance. They not only got us tickets for the sold-out show, but they got us the best seats in the house. Then, they booked us tickets for Billy Elliot and went the extra mile to leave a program for it in our room. The staff always called us by name and inquired about our day and evening when we arrived back at the hotel. We were celebrating our anniversary, so they lit candles and left dessert in our room one night. Overall, by the time we left, I felt like these managers were friends who were genuinely invested in making our experience a memorable one. 

To wrap-up, I don't typically write online reviews, so that alone shows what an amazing experience we had. The one negative that came from our stay at 41? It's now the standard by which I judge all other hotels (our hotels in Amsterdam and Paris following 41 were okay, but definitely didn't meet that high bar). My husband and I are already planning another trip to London, and 41 will be our go-to choice from now on.",5,2012,01,15
137,First stop on our European Honeymoon! Worth every cent!,"We started off with 4 nights in one of my favorite cities LONDON. We stayed at the amazing luxury 5 star boutique hotel 41. It was amazing! Top notch service! We did the open top double decker bus to get to the usual tourist attractions and walked the city, we loved every second of it, from pubs to shopping to a day trip to Stonehenge we were enchanted by the city of London.",5,2012,01,15
137,Can't get the hype,"We booked this place in December 2011 for our London Trip as it was 2011 Traveller's Choice winner. My partner and me have been in many luxury hotels all over the world but our expectations were greatly disappointed with this one. We booked a split-level junior suite and the suite is done in a way that they made two levels out of one from an old building. Thust the higher level with sleeping area and bathroom is just about 180 to 185 cm high. For me being 195cm tall this was just awful as I couldn't even stand straight and you get some claustrophobic feeling after some time. Considering that this suite costs a total off nearlly the 1000 GBP this is just ridiculous. Breakfast was not overhelming as well.

Otherwise the hotel is made to be very british and located very nice for many attractions.Staff is friendly but not without flaws and lack of knowledge here and there.Just can't get why this is supposedly the most loved hotel in London?!?",2,2012,01,14
137,Best hotel in London,"This is the hotel equivalent of 'The Fat Duck' restaurant. Service is second to none, and not in your face or over the top. We also got upgraded to the most amazing room. If you stay in this hotel, don't book to do anything else, as it is an experience of it's own.",5,2012,01,14
137,wonderful experience,"I arrived in London for two days business and was treated like royalty, the staff were second to none, friendly, helpful and caring. You get the feeling of being transported into another world. Loved the loyalty book, brings back the feeling of trust and respect, something which is now so hard to find anywhere. Will definately recommend and hopefully return to at another time in the future.",5,2012,01,14
137,The safest Hotel in London,"I stayed at Hotel 41 and had the experience of a lifetime. Your every desire is taken care of and the atmosphere is second to none. Located across the street from Buckingham Palace was a plus as I was in London a few days After the Royal Wedding, 2011.  You feel safe and pampered and I will return this year. The staff, Antoinette, Monika, PJ, and wonderful Magdalena were AWESOME!!!! They found me a program from the wedding, and trust me, this was hard to find. Thank you all for the top-notch service.",5,2012,01,13
137,A Return,"We had visited Hotel 41 before and felt a certain trepidation about returning and spoiling what is a wonderful memory. If anything our second stay was even better. The consistently excellent service, the fine balance between precision, professionalism and warmth, the serice and care make this hotel one of the world's finest.",5,2012,01,13
137,"Not up to the rating, we barely managed to get our bags in the room","We were due to stay here for 2 nights as part of our honeymoon before jetting off to america for 6 weeks, we had 4 large bags and after we put them in the room there was not much space to swing a cat.  The hotel executive lounge is nice but to be honest its a strange setup where its part of Rubens hotel.  To be honest we stayed 1 night at a cost of £300 then checked into an executive room at the cavendish for half that price and the room was twice the size.  There are far better hotels out there and its a shame its ranked no 1 as it is very misleading and we were caught out by this.",2,2012,01,13
137,5 Star .....and more !!,"The whole experience from start to finish was amazing ! From dealing with Jasmeet to confirm the booking, to being checked in (and out) by Magdalena - the service was first class. The staff treat you like royalty but manage to do this without making you feel uncomfortable. They will help out with anything from booking theatre tickets to even packing your luggage when you leaving if you want. 

I booked the stay as a treat for my wife's birthday (They provided a complimentary birthday cake for my wife). Upon arrival we were escorted up stairs to check in and given a complimentary glass of champagne. Each staff member we encountered wished her happy birthday, asked how the room was and if there was anything they could do for us. The room was amazing, a really good size, decorated beautifully and containing all the things required to make your stay amazing.  We had slippers, dressing gowns, heated towels, a choice of pillows and they even put a hot water bottle in the bed at turndown!!!!! 

The food was great, breakfast was delicious and our meal in The Library restaurant was sumptuous! Made even more romantic by the fact it was a Monday night in January, so we were the only guests. The honesty bar in the The Lounge had everything you could ever want to drink as well. 

I booked a romantic turndown as a special birthday treat for my wife. This included a bottle of champagne, candles, rose petals in the hall, the bathroom, the bedroom and on the bed and a selection of delicious strawberries coated in different types of chocolate. Simply stunning and well worth the extra. 

Overall it was an amazing experience and one we will most definitely repeat in the future.",5,2012,01,10
137,The best hotel in London*,"*in our opinion anyway!

My husband booked Hotel 41 for a romantic weekend away in December.  He regularly stays in London and has stayed at some of the best, but for him, Hotel 41 gives a truly personal experience, something the larger hotels are unable to provide.  Nothing is too much trouble for Frederic and his team.  Adam personally arranged fantastic seats for us at 'Wicked' and because the hotel has such a lovely feel about it, we decided to eat there rather than going out before the show.  The food was excellent and in the morning you could easily spend a couple of hours enjoying breakfast.  'Plunder the pantry' was perfectly timed when we returned after the show and the 'turndown' was something I have never experienced before.  It seemed like every time we left our room we returned to a different surprise, whether it was olives and ice/lemon for our mini bar, assorted mini deserts, chocolates or floating candles and a lit fire.  It is the small touches that make you feel like Hotel 41's only guests.  As someone previously described Hotel 41 has the excellent balance of 5 star professionalism with just the right informality.  We will definitely be going back!",5,2012,01,09
137,A gem of a hotel!,"What's not to love about 41? My partner and I stayed there for two nights from new years eve 2011 and were amazed, neither of us thought you could get such good service. The staff were first rate - polite, sensitive to our needs (and moods!), well informed about London and the local area, extremely helpful and were constantly looking for ways to make our stay perfect. The hotel itself was clean and well kept with beautiful furnishings, furniture and fittings. the rooms were perfect - lovely bathrooms, comfy beds, latest tech in TV's and CD player/radio, splash proof TV in the bathroom! Features wise, whilst we didn't really use a huge number of the amenities we were kept abreast of all they could offer - local gym, pool, spa and so on and everything seemed to be to a very high standard. The food was very good - my partner is from New Zealand and has never had a proper English Breakfast, Fish and Chips and so on. We ate both and it was absolutely superb. I am a fish and chips fiend and that was a special plate of fish and chips! As well as the classics that you would expect from a British hotel there was also delicious haute cuisine which was very impressive too. They also run a very clever, and free, 'plunder the pantry' service where cold cuts of meat, smoked salmon, pates, cheeses, chutneys, fruits and so on are left out for guests to enjoy when they are a little peckish later on in the evening. Again, a very nice touch very well received.

From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were totally happy and would have changed nothing. As a last point to sum up - we were late to book and so there was only one room available which, inevitably, was the smallest. However, they offered us a free bottle of champagne on arrival to help make up for it which was very well received. What's more, the next day they approached us, totally unprompted (despite the room being a little small it was perfectly charming and still very good) and offered us a free upgrade to a room which I can only describe as the best I have stayed in.

All in all an absolute delight and one we hope we can enjoy again. I cannot see any reason why similar couples, families or so on would not enjoy it as much as we did. Being a regular traveller and someone who is constantly in hotels for business as well as pleasure, I would rank 41 as the best I have stayed in. A gem of a hotel!",5,2012,01,08
137,Excellent Boutique Hotel,I stayed at 41 in December and we had an excellent experience.  It was my Dad's 70th birthday and the hotel staff and the beautiful surroundings made it a very special experience for us.  The balance of 5 star professioanlism and informality amongst the staff makes the hotel feel special without it being formal or stuffy. I am staying there again soon and look forward very much to our stay.  Thank you to Remus and all the staff.,5,2012,01,06
137,Great trip during the holidays,"The staff at Hotel 41 are not only extremely helpful and service-oriented.  This much one would certainly expect from a five-star hotel.  But the staff also exude warmth, rather than formality, and they show great skill at learning the interests of the guests.  

Typically, my wife and I can be made to feel uncomfortable by high-level service.  We don't want anyone to think that we believe we are any better than anyone else, and often ""five-star"" service creates an ambience that screams, ""You're SUPPOSED to act like you're better than the have-nots!""  

Not so at Hotel 41.

From the moment we walked in the door and were greeted by Roman, the staff made us feel at home.  Thanks need to go out to Roman, Julian (great recommendation/reservation for lunch at Quilon!), and the great young French guy whose name I did not get.  

The room, of course, is gorgeous, as is the executive lounge.  But its the staff that makes the hotel special.

Great visit.",5,2012,01,04
137,Thanks for a Brilliant Weekend,"Family wanted to stay in London over New Years.   We booked 4 days at Hotel 41 - 2 rooms, so we had a connecting room for the kids.   We really didnt know much about the hotel other than the great write-ups from Trip Advisor.  The write-ups don't do justice to the Hotel.  It was nothing short of amazing.  The staff beats any high end hotel chain (think Four Seasons) with their service and personality.  They knew the kids by name and helped with any request (dinner reservations, tickets to plays, etc).   Would highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting London.",5,2012,01,04
137,Still a brilliant small hotel with exceptional service,"We have just spent the week prior to Christmas at this terrific hotel; just over 4 years since we first stayed here. We were very pleased to find that the exceptional standards we found last time have been maintained. We took an Executive KIng Room which was an excellent size, particularly for London. There is not a lot of point in covering off the points that set this hotel apart from other luxury hotels; they are covered off adequately by many other recent trip advisor reviews.... except to reiterate that the staff are what make the difference, they are simply the best we have found in any hotel anywhere.  We thoroughly recommend ""41"" to anybody wanting a truely exceptional hotel experience without the ""machine"" like feel that you can get from larger establishments.",5,2012,01,02
137,Alchemy has a number...41,"Alchemy's a rare commodity ... but '41' has it. 
Hard to define how/why a boutique hotel is quite so outstanding ; exceptional staff  + understated luxury + outstanding attention to detail and quality +  beautiful difference + elegant charm + royal location...all there plus ..honestly...a tiny bit of magic*

We spent a perfect 3 night stay there in December. The chaos of our journey melted within seconds of arriving : the ultimate in discrete effiiciency (Frederick...manager), had conjured a perfect split-level suite, open-fire, candle light, relaxing drinks. Everything happened magically, effortlessly...doors opened, ice-bucket waiting,restaurant tables arranged.

 Adam (utter gem) invisibly made sure relaxation happened :stress doesn't exsist there, privacy respected, romance flourishes ...

Supper was perfect...Do 'raid the pantry' in the exec' lounge. The setting is superb ... Let Michael suggest another perfect (complimentary) smoked salmon...or roast ham..or exquisite pastry.

We left changed...happy, feeling bathed in magic and wishing that every 5 star hotel could be half as good as '41'.       Go ...before alchemy changes its formula.",5,2012,01,02
137,A perfect new year,"I made a last minute booking for a surprise trip for a new year gift ,what a gift ,if you want to stay in a hotel in London and want places in walking distance  then this is the place ,they could not do enough for you ,highly recommend the the Full English breakfast, its one to keep you going all day , Staff were great and helpful so thank you to them ,Hotel 41 has every thing for your stay.would definitely stay again ,",5,2012,01,02
137,Excellent hotel,"Exceptionaland luxurious hotel. You will be amazed of the detailed and excellent service you will get.Nice location, near the Buckingham palace on foot. Nice fireplace.",5,2012,01,01
137,A perfect Christmas stay in London,"My wife and I decided to spend our Christmas in London.  The reviews for ""41"" were spot on.  We signed up for the Christmas package which also included Christmas stockings and afternoon tea, which were both exceptional.  The room was classically British with a modern twist (not at all stuffy).  I liked the wireless Internet, Bose player for my iPhone, and the surround sound system in the room.  The fireplace added a cozy, romantic feel that was so welcoming after a day of sightseeing or a night at the theater. The staff was attentive, polite, and quickly knew our names and personal needs.  The breakfast was superb and filling.  Can't wait to go back! Who's going to turn down my bed tonight?!",5,2011,12,31
137,Perfect little birthday treat!,"i cannot recommend this hotel enough! the rooms are small but very elegant, they were spotless and full of little luxury items to make sure your stay is nothing but perfect.
i requested a ""romantic turn down"" as it was my wife's birthday and i was not dissapointed, very nice touch's were made to our room and i can 100% recommend this to all you fella's out there!

my last comment will be the staff, they were amazing! extremely friendly without being over the top and they actually made our stay and will definitely be the reason that we stay again in the future, they even gave us a bath robe for our 1 year old son who wasn't even with us!

just nice personal touch's that made our stay absolutely perfect!

so a huge thank you to the staff of hotel 41.",5,2011,12,29
137,Love the personal touches.,"A hotel with a difference....cozy, stylish and exceptional staff.  Rooms are small in keeping with London standards but packed with luxury and nice finishing touches.  The room turndown meant we were greeted with a warm welcoming room at the end of the day.  Location just behind Buckingham Palace, and up the road from Victoria Station is just great
Expensive YES... But good value when compared to other lux central London hotels.",5,2011,12,28
137,amazing hospitality and luxury,"I stayed here for one night to celebrate an anniversary - when I travel, I tend to spend a pretty  penny for someplace nice for one night, and I would suggest this place to anyone. Completely separate from the Rubens hotel right next door/downstairs (also a Red Carnation property), Hotel 41 is directly across the street from Buckingham Palace. After checking in, we were guided upstairs and informed of the nightly happy hour they held in their private lounge, a beautiful space on the top floor of the building (same floor as our room) with clerestory windows up top and beautiful books everywhere. This is the same space where breakfast was served in the morning. 

We stopped by the lounge to chat with the concierge about dinner plans, since it was our anniversary, and they recommended a great Indian restaurant nearby. They had left us a beautiful anniversary cake in our room and I was a little bit sad that I was so full from dinner, that I didn't have much room for it! (And it's not really the best breakfast, eh?)

The room was somewhat small, but I found it cozy and had no complaints since it was full of very luxurious amenities: ultra-soft sheets, very comfortable bed, an alarm clock/radio with an iPod dock so we could listen to music, chocolate truffles. And the clean lines made it feel very high-end. I don't mind small spaces as long as they're NICE small spaces, and this definitely fit the bill. 

The black and white marble bath was amazing, with the best shower I've ever used IN MY LIFE - excellent rainshower head and completely enclosed with glass so you could steam it up for as long as you wanted. We received a romantic turndown service while we were out at dinner, which included lots of candles lit to set the mood. Thank you, Hotel 41! We WILL be back the next time we're in London, maybe for more than one night this time. I think my husband was spoiled, and might object to staying anywhere else, period.

Note: tripadvisor would only let me choose months in 2011 for ""when did you travel?"", however this trip was actually in October 2009.",5,2011,12,27
137,A real find.,"Stayed for one night with my wife before flying out to the USA and this was the first night of our special 30th wedding anniversary celebratory trip. We have stayed at a number of the Red Carnation Collection Hotels and this is one of the best. Located in Buckingham Palace road next door to Reubens hotel it is about a twenty minute walk to Picadilly Circus and theatreland.

The Hotel is quiet, clean and extremely comfortable and the staff are just superb. Extremely professional and helpful even assisting us with our internet flight check in. Our room (4121) was beautifully appointed and comfortable and the only minor criticism is that the bathroom was a bit small. Nevertheless you could not ask for a higher standard of furnishing and decor.

Arrival and departure were smooth and efficient and breakfast taken in the Executive Lounge was both exquisite and charmingly served. Highly recommended and we will certainly stay here again.",5,2011,12,23
137,Incredible luxury boutique hotel!!!!!!!,What more can be said about this hotel then has already been added by Tripadvisor members?!?! We searched for a hotel to stay in for one night (the first of our honeymoon!) before travelling on - we wanted somewhere special that would reflect the occasion and considered a wide range of hotels in the London area. In the end there could be only one - Hotel 41!! This is an amazing hotel where service and standards are taken beyong the 5 star level that is too often banded around to mediocre hotels!! The staff cannot do enough for you in the nicest possible way and made our stay forever memorable! The pictures on the website speal for themselves! I would finish by adding - don't think - just book - it is well worth it!!!!!,5,2011,12,23
137,Purcells,We stayed at this wonderful location on return to London after 11 years. It could not have been more enjoyable. The hotel is perfectly located just behind Buckingham Palace and near to Victoria Station. It is beautifully presented. The staff could not be more welcoming and hospitable. Our compliments to Frederic and Adam and all the staff who were most helpful during our stay. We will return.,5,2011,12,22
137,Long Weekend,"Had the best long weeking in London ever. Stayd here from thursday to sunday and the staff here is amazing. 
They get everything you need and mutch more. Will defenitly stay here next time we are in London.
Great location, near everything you need in London. Luxary all the way.
Thanks for the stay 41",5,2011,12,21
137,Extremely Romantic Experience!,"We stayed here for one night for a special occasion and wished we could have stayed longer! The service was excellent, the staff were very helpful, we were upgraded and the food was very good with a wide selection for breakfast. We recommend the afternoon tea which was very filling. We had booked the romantic turndown as a surprise which was lovely. Our stay was very peaceful and romantic- just what we were after. In fact we liked it so much we are planning our honeymoon here for next year- Frederic spent time showing us the different rooms so we could see what else was on offer for that. Wonderful hotel that definately deserves its reputation on here.",5,2011,12,21
137,A Truly Special Place,"I can hardly do justice writing about our great experience.

I chose this hotel because of it location, boutique-feel and its outstanding Trip Advisory rating.  I took my son to London to see our beloved Chicago Bears play in Wembley for his 7th birthday.

I was bit worried upon arrival that the hotel was too intimate for a child and our presence might alarm the mainly adult guests who paid handsomely to be away from children.

My worry was wasted as the staff was so incredible with my son, Luke.  Perhaps most impressive was the staffs versatility; they could cater to the whim of an opera going adult couple and then effortlessly shift gears to cater to the much different whims of a 7-year old boy.  Bravo.

The hotel itself is a oasis from the hustle and bustle of touring London.  The afternoon tea was well done and again, they went out of their way to make a little boy's first tea a friendly and welcoming environment.

A heartfelt thank you to all of the staff members at the team.  There is no doubt my next trip to London will include Hotel 41.

It goes without saying that one expects great service from a hotel in this category, but this was different.  This was truly special.",5,2011,12,19
137,Very Nice Hotel,"Stayed here for a night recently and it was very nice. The staff was extremely attentive, helpful, and friendly. The room was very comfortable and well prepared. Location is great as it is very close to Victoria Station which makes it very easy to get around. The only word of caution I would give is that the hot water in the sink and shower is immediately very hot which led to me slightly burning my hands the first time I went to the restroom. It wasn't a problem once I knew it was coming though. Overall I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a very nice hotel in a great area with a very helpful staff.",5,2011,12,19
137,"Hotel 41 London, what a treat!","Having been in the travel industry for many years and been lucky enough to visit some very beautiful hotels, none were as welcoming and hospitable as those at Hotel 41.  An absolute treasure tucked away in a quiet location with great shops and restaurants.  I hope to return with my partner as soon as possible.  Well done to all the staff....",5,2011,12,18
137,the 41 for ever...,"The best 5 nights ever spent in a hotel. The staff of this hotel, without any exception, give you the best service ever.You are looked after like nowhere else. Their input and commitment are guaranteed to make your stay a success. The hotel decoration is tasteful and pleasant. The location is perfect and as the hotel only has abt. 28 rooms the service has a much more personal approach.Here you are not a number but a guest. As I said to the staff upon getting back at the hotel every day...""it's good to be back home""...because that is how it felt. Here you get more for the money. Centrally located, quiet, and safe as the hotel is located on the 5th floor.  This hotel has an amazing team working together well. No need to look further..if London is the palce to be, then the 41 is the place to stay.",5,2011,12,14
137,Totally exceeded our expectations (which were already pretty high!),"We stayed at 41 for our honeymoon and it is a wonderful, special, treat of a place that we will re-visit in the future for our 'special' weekends away.
Freddie and his team were brilliant.  A perfect mix of super attentive yet friendly and fun with it.
My fiance, now husband had booked it as a secret and I was blown away.
The breakfasts were fabulous, my favourite being the eggs royal.  Oh yum yum yum!  Then the Plunder the Pantry at night was a feast in itself.
Candles and Rose petals all over the room too.  I just cant speak highly enough about it.
We had seen the few bad reviews and can only imagine they were either masd, blind, or in the wrong place!!
The worse I can say is the bed was very soft but hey, thats merely my preference, not something wrong with the place.
Thank-you 41 team, we had a superb and memorable time. Mr and Mrs Smith xxx",5,2011,12,14
137,Tranquility  in chaos,"Just returned from a 3 day trip. The whole experience was incredible. The team, surroundings, service and professionalism was superb. If you are looking for a very tranquil setting in the heart of busy London, then this is the place.",5,2011,12,13
137,The best we ever had!,"We have been in lots of hotels, also in London, but this was the best we ever had. The decoration of the rooms and the lounge is sophisticated and pleasant. As soon as you walk in, the staff gives you a warm welcome and not only because they have to. You really feel like coming home. They take care of you and they assist you in word and deed, giving you advice about the musea, shops, restaurants etc. Well, we can only speak in superlatives about this hidden secret near Buckingham Palace. We loved every minute of our stay. Surely we 'll go back there next time. 
Hans and Alicia Winters, The Netherlands.",5,2011,12,13
137,A Tranquil Oasis,"What a lovely place to stay! As a Londoner, I have seen so many glitzy 5 star hotels. Thankfully, those who want glitz don't come here: Hotel 41 has none of the stuff and nonsense of most of the competition. From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave, you will be aware (but only vaguely) of the amazing personal, professional service with so much attention to detail - like a swan moving on water, all their work is unseen. The relaxed but stylish surroundings, typified by the hotel lounge, is so stylish and restful; a real home from home, if only home were this good!

Mike & Susie.",5,2011,12,13
137,Outstanding and a hotel experience I doubt that will ever be matched!!!,"This hotel is absolutely perfect! Having stayed in London on many occasions and in various 5 star hotels and spa resorts the world over, I have never had an experience or level of service like it! Attention to detail, luxury and the most attentive and friendly staff are but part of the beauty of this hotel. The exquisite and chic decor is outstanding, yet homely and inviting at the same time.

Arriving for a birthday weekend treat, we were immediately greeted by the friendly concierge who offered us a lovely hot coffee while waiting for the manager to whisk us up to the 5th floor paradise. While checking in, we were then asked if we would like a complementary champagne as the staff asked with real interest about our plans for the weekend. At that point we were told if we needed anything at all over the weekend to let them know and how true that was!

While out for breakfast, our room was prepared and the detail that was going into this, I was yet to be blown away by. Unbeknown to myself, even the pillows on our bed were personally chosen by my partner from a list of eleven!! On entering the beautiful room, alongside added birthday treats we had a complementary collection of small fruits from the manager. Ten minutes later came a knock at the door with another complementary treat of homemade macaroon, nougat and chocolates!

The room itself was perfect with luxurious robes, slippers and toiletries. For those staying with business in mind, the desk was well equipped with stationery and items such as staplers, highlighters and hole punches. The tea and coffee making facilities had an expansive collection although shortbread biscuits were unneccessary given the collection of complementary food we had already received!! There was even a list of DVDs that could be ordered for use in the room. When my partner had forgotten his hair gel and phoned to ask if reception may have any he could purchase, a staff member was actually sent out to buy some which was promptly delivered to our room free of charge with no expectation that we even paid for the product!!! 

Dinner in the executive lounge was as close to private dining as one could get! Cosy fireplace, gorgeous Christmas tree and impeccable service. We were greeted by Frederic, the resident manager, who asked about our day and asked if we would like a complementary birthday cocktail. I was then astounded that he specifically asked if I may be interested in one of my two favourite cocktails! I was so astonished that it took me a second to realise this was another pre-visit feature of the hotel-my partner had filled in numerous questionnaires about us both to give the stay that personal touch.

The food was great quality and so filling that we only had two courses prior to leaving for our Wicked theatre experience included as part of our package stay. Only a couple of minutes walk round to the Apollo Victoria theatre, the location couldn't have been better. 

On arrival back to the hotel after the theatre, we then indulged in 'plundering the pantry' where a great selection of complementary snacks were available for us to take back to our room for a late night nibble. We returned to an immaculate room where candles had been lit, music was playing, fresh ice and lemon were put out for our drinks and a signed poster from the theatre show was placed on the bed!

From the above review, you probably don't need to be told how good breakfast and checkout was. Faultless from start to finish!

A special mention has to go to Frederic Dallot, the resident manager at the hotel. He leads his staff by example and is a credit to Hotel 41 and the Red Carnation group. An absolute gem and a gentleman, thank you and hope to see you again in the New Year!",5,2011,12,13
137,Wonderful!,"We loved our stay at 41 Hotel in London. The team was exceptionally attentive, very helpful and had a kind, generous spirit.   Free internet/computer usage was a plus. They also provided ipads to guests who wanted to use them in the privacy of their room. Breakfast was wonderful with a full menu as well as a continental choice. 

Service was exceptional.  The hotel felt more like a private club than a hotel.   We stayed for four nights and then returned a few nights later for one additional night before our flight home.  When we returned,  a beautiful bottle of wine, cheese platter and a huge piece of cheesecake with a welcome message was in our room.

The rooms are very comfortable with luxurious sheets, towels and robes.  The best part was that our room was very quiet. A huge plus in London. Similar to most of the rooms we have had in London, the rooms are a bit on the small side.  The location is good in that it is 2 blocks from Victoria Station, across the street from Buckingham Palace and just down the street from St.James Park. You can easily go every direction (Mayfair, Chelsey etc...)

Frederic, the manager was wonderful and so helpful. He is great with guests but not too intrusive. We feel as if we have found our home away from home in London and look forward to our return.",5,2011,12,12
137,Excellent service without being stuffy,"My husband chose this hotel because of its high TripAdvisor ranking, and we were not disappointed. We typically would not stay at a top-of-the-list (nor top-of-the-price-range) hotel but we booked this last-minute with the intention of spoiling ourselves a bit. Mission? Accomplished. The staff at Hotel 41 - especially Frederic, Monica, and Remus - literally tripped over themselves to make sure we were taken care of. Everything about the service here was extraordinary and well worth the price. At tea one afternoon, my husband asked if they had chocolate tea, and they regretted they did not. No less than ten minutes later, however, they appeared with chocolate tea, for which they had sent someone down the road to purchase! They booked us amazing seats at two great shows and provided excellent restaurant recommendations time and again. Our room was comfortable down to the fireplace that warmed our toes every evening and the special presents on the pillows each night. Classy yet comfortable, relaxed yet refined, personable without being nosy, British without being stuffy, Hotel 41 makes all their guests feel special and welcome. I can only hope we may  again pay them a return visit. They've set the bar by which all our future hotel stays will be judged!",5,2011,12,11
137,Excellent Service,"The hotel is not the easiest to arrive at if your driving but we drove into the lane behind it and a porter parked our car for us offsite. 

We were taken to the executive lounge and made to feel very welcome with complimentary champagne, tea , etc.
 
 Our room was small but packed with everything you might need.  The bed was very comfortable.

Service is the trademark of the hotel and all of the staff work hard to make you feel at home.  

Breakfast at £25 was a bit more than I would have expected to pay.

Great hotel in terms of location, brilliant service!

",5,2011,12,11
137,Fantastic,"I booked this as a present for my fiancé, after checking the reviews from trip advisor. I am so glad I did. From the moment we arrived we felt so welcomed, so relaxed and made to feel special. We were greeted at the door and helped with all our baggage and pushchair, and taken to the executive lounge. All our luggage was taken care of, and there was lots of it due to baby necessities. We had come to london to visit some friends, and they were welcomed in too, given access to the executive lounge, refreshments and nibbles. At all times you were just made to feel special. 
Our room was decorated to the highest standard, and I loved the sense of quirkyness and individuality that came across unlike standardised layouts and sterile environments. Having asked for a cot in the room it was a touch cosy, for us that only enhanced the experience. The bed was comfortable and bathroom superb. The furnishings complimented the style of the room perfectly. The tv was perhaps a little dated, but we were more comfortable with music played on the Bose docking station anyway. 
We did order room service for our baby, as he would struggle to wait for our dinner reservation and it was prompt and appropriate, apparently the chips were fantastic as my fiancé finished the ones our boy couldn't. 
Our booking included breakfast, and along with the help yourself continental breakfast, fruit and cereal, there was a fantastic selection of cooked breakfast options. I managed to get my cooked traditional breakfast and share my boys pancakes, and they were both fantastic.
At all times the staff were fantastic, could never do enough for us, and took a very personal interest in ourselves and our son. It was as if you were staying with friends who just wanted to look after your every need. We would especially like to thank Magdalena, who played tirelessly with our son as we had breakfast or enjoyed a coffee break, following him climbing the stairs in between sharing hugs. 
On our leaving day we were leaving our return travel didn't return home till 16:30. We asked if we could keep our luggage in some storage while we enjoyed some last looks at London and they arranged a late checkout for 16:00, just because it was helpful to us. Those little touches do not go unnoticed. 
When I returned home I emailed the hotel to thank them for a lovely time, and every member of that team has replied to say how nice it was for positive feedback.
I would like to say again to all 41 staff, thank you for making our weekend. London has much to offer, but when you have a place like 41 to stay, it becomes a magical experience.",5,2011,12,07
137,"Just perfect, an oasis of peace in London","This was our second time at the Hotel 41 and we decided to come back as our first stay had been truly great and romantic. This time we were less busy than the first one and we could enjoy the hotel more and I have to say they can create such an amazing atmosphere that one enjoy almost most being at the hotel than being in the city. Every single member of the staff if always there to help, everyone is kind and caring and they all do their very best to assure you the best possible vacation. Rooms are comfortables and our had a lovely fireplace which was great, I think the best night was when we just stayed in bed sipping hot chocolate and watching a dvd at the fireplace light! We also managed to have a pre dinner cocktail in the lounge every night and have to say the christmas setting made it extra special! Hope one day we can celebrate New Year's Eve there! About food...the first time we didn't try cooked breakfast but this time we did and be sure not to miss the egg royals, simply excellent! But the best part of the hotel, a part from romantic turndown, is that is a truly oasis of peace. London is very crowded and busy but when after the short walk from Victoria tube station you enter in the hotel you simply relax...there's lounge music playing, a wonderful relaxing smell everywhere and being a very small hotel you know that if you decide to go in the lounge instead than in your room it will be peaceful and you will be pampered from the staff. Really recommended for couples and for those looking for a truly ""royal"" holiday!",5,2011,12,05
137,Luxurious as ever,"This was my fourth stay at 41 and my first during christmas time, so when I arrived in London, I was excited to see what my ""home away from home"" would look like.

Arriving at the hotel I was greeted by a wonderful christmas decoration around the door, which made me feel comfy the moment I stepped in (even more comfy than normally, which is impressive). I was sleeping in room 4111 this time, and my high expectations (I had slept in one of the suites last time) were instantly fulfilled when I discovered my room had a fireplace. Espescially during christmas time this is a wonderful feature to have in your hotel bedroom.

The room was big, with one window facing to the rear of the hotel in the direction of Victoria station, the other, in the bathroom, towards Buckingham Palace. One of the things that never cease to amaze me is the water pressure in the shower, which is enormous. You get the feeling of standing under a waterfall and I don't know any other place in the world where you step out of a shower more refreshed than at this hotel.

Breakfast was excellent, as usual, and although I always eat the same thing (smoked salmon with cream cheese in a bagel) from the menu, I can tell that everything on the menu is excellent from the feedback I got from my companion. 

On my second night I was staying in the Lounge until around half past 2, and being the only guest in the Lounge at that time, had the tranquility to enjoy sitting in front of the Lounge's fireplace and listening to the music. A wonderful retreat from the busy city of London, while still actually being in the middle of the action. I also had a very nice chat with the night concierge, Peter from Hungary, at that night who I have to give a special mention here for making me feel like staying in the home of long time friends.

Hotel 41 never ceases to amaze me. It's not just a hotel, it really has become a home for me, and I love coming here. I am so happy that I stumbled over this luxurious gem 2 years ago and I'm looking forward to returning as soon as possible.",5,2011,12,05
137,Wow,"We booked because of travel advisor reviews. On arrival the lady at the lobby greeted us with enthusiasm and explained how the hotel worked. It would be easy to miss the entrance, a discrete door between a restaurant and the Reubens Hotel, but the taxi man knew it - usually a good sign. Three staff attended to us in the executive lounge.  Our room was super with it's own gas fire, comfy bed and bathroom which had a real bath and a separate shower.  We went with the hotel recommendation for dinner an
Indian restaurant Quillion which was great.  Later we noticed some faults in the room to do with lighting and tv.  Next morning the hotel fixed these and offered free drinks as an apology - always the test of an establishment, what it does when things go wrong.",5,2011,12,03
137,Completely satisfied with stay,"We stayed at the 41 for over a week and every day was a delight. It is well situated for tourists in particular with Buckingham Palace a 5 minute walk in one direction and Victoria underground and train station about 5 minutes walk in the other direction. 
Our room was very comfortable, we stayed in an executive king room and had plenty of space. The bed was so cosy and wonderful, it was hard to get out of some mornings! The room, including the bathroom, was spotlessly cleaned every day. We appreciated the little touches at turndown every evening including restful music and weather information for the next day.
We had breakfast included in our rate and afternoon tea during our stay, the breakfasts were delicious and filling and the afternoon tea was fantastic! In particular the pastries during breakfast and the tea service were scrumptious. 
I agree with other reviewers that the employees are what make this hotel. The staff is so accommodating, friendly, kind and thoughtful. They go out of their way to make sure your experience at 41 is your idea of perfection. 
Our many thanks to Frederic, Monika, Victoria, Rita and all the other employees who helped make our stay so delightful! We could not have been happier with our stay.",5,2011,11,30
137,Sadly disappointed,"I have never stayed in a 5 star hotel with such a small double bed. Our room was small, with a tiny bathroom. The bathroom tiles had been partially patched, leaving an obvious rectangle on the wall where perhaps something had been removed.  On our first night, after asking not to be disturbed, and going to bed early after a long journey, we were woken by reception phoning to check that everything was alright with our room. 
We also had a sheet with a small hole in it and a towel that gave way on the edge. 
The staff were all very friendly, a bit too friendly for our introverted selves! We couldn't get from our room to the street without saying hello to two or three staff members on the way. 
In summary, if friendly, attentive staff, and a cosy atmosphere are what defines a good hotel for you, you will like this hotel, as many others have. 
If however you prefer privacy, spaciousness and opulence, then you may well be disappointed, as we were.",2,2011,11,29
137,"Fantastic Hotel, Great Staff, Wonderful Experience","My wife and I just returned home after 3 great nights spent at Hotel 41.  From the location close to Buckingham Palace, Victoria Tube Station, and many of the have-to-see sights of London to the fantastic service from the 41 staff, you cannot go wrong with this lovely boutique hotel.  Some folks may say it is expensive, but not if you consider the gourmet breakfast, snacks all during the day, and evening hours-dourves.  You need only to find a place to eat lunch while you are out enjoying the sights.  This was our second stay at the 41 and it only re-inforced the wonderful experience we had in 2005.
This is a must stay hotel.",5,2011,11,29
137,Wonderful Experience,"Our family alway consults Trip Advisor before reserving hotel accommodations.  The reviews of this hotel were ALL positive; especially about the staff.  My father served in the 8th Air Corp during WWII; so one of the reasons for my trip to London was to visit WWII memorials to the ""Mighty Eighth.""  The hotel concierge (Julian) was so helpful in this regard (finding the addresses, printing out directions and what tube/trains to take).  I stayed at the hotel for 10 days and was treated royally.  The king-bed room was clean and very comfortable.  The location is excellent...block from Buckingham Palace and St. James Park; down the Pall Mall to the Nat'l Gallery etc, etc.  But it is the hotel staff that makes 41 such a great place to stay.  I will return soon",5,2011,11,28
137,Wonderful,"Stunning hotel, superb staff, great location.  Perfect!",5,2011,11,26
137,Wow - what an experience,"I was lucky to stay here thanks to a gift from my former employer and what an experience.  I can not fault ANYTHING about this hotel.

From the service of the staff to the quality of the hotel room nothing can be faulted.  

I will definitely be returning again.",5,2011,11,26
137,a private club,"This establishment is more like a private club with rooms than a hotel. After the initial confusion of trying to check in at the Rubens, a plump boutique hotel with a more public face on Buckingham Palace Road, I was led next door to the less obvious entrance - street number 41 obviously - which amounts to a small foyer with a concierge and a lift with a single button, for level 5.

Out the lift and around a few corners of the snug corridor that zig zags around the floor brings you to the ""executive lounge"", a plush double-volume internal room stuffed with furniture, fireplace and a mahogany desk in the corner for checking in and out, and from where a watchful duty manager keeps an eye on guests taking breakfast, tea or drinks in the evening.

This is pretty much the heart of the 41 and its a pretty comfortable place to relax or entertain. Apart from a small boardroom which I used for a private meeting, the rest of the floor consists of the rooms leading off the irregular corridor.

Judging from some of the other reviews here, the rooms can be spectacular. In my case I was installed in a pokey room with barely enough space for the furniture and a small window looking into the building's internal well so natural light was minimal and clearly there was no view. Even the cupboard didn't fully open as it banged into the room door's hydraulic arm. Let's just say the bed was hugely comfortable, which is a blessing because there wasn't much else you could do in the room except sleep.

Fortunately most of my stay was over a mild, sunny weekend in London, and I was in town for meetings so the room really was just a place to sleep but if it had been my own coin on holiday I would have asked for something less claustrophobic.

The service is pretty good and is quite personal if at times ideosyncratic. It was nice to find biltong in the complimentary lounge snacks, a signal along with the South African wines the 41 is part of a small chain apparently owned by a South African woman.

A quick walk around the corner takes you past the front of Buckingham Palace and if you head across Green Park you will be on Picadilly Road and from here its easy to find the night life or, during the day, the shopping and central London tourist sights. Even Covent Garden is an easy stroll in that direction.

This was my first visit to London since the installation of the ""Boris bikes"" a network of city bikes similar to Paris' Velib scheme - pretty easy to use and an excellent way to do some long-distance sightseeing on a Sunday.

There is a bike station just on the corner. And if you feel more comfortable with a helmet, the extremely helpful manager of 41, Frederic Dallot assures me he has a set of pink ones for your use (which I declined of course!).",4,2011,11,25
137,Best decision I ever made,"I picked this hotel based on reading reviews from trip advisor. I couldn't be happier. Room, staff, food and facilities were excellent. My room 4102 was spacious and dead quiet  i was able to walk to Kensington, leicester, oxford, regent, picadilly and westminster. I didn't need to lift a finger. The staff took care of everything including theatre tickets. The hotel is rigt outside where the horses and carriages leave from buckingham palace. There was a state visit going on my last day and It was exciting watching everything take place. I struggled between 41 and the other top rated hotel. I made the right choice staying at 41. All the staff were great  Highly recommended. ",5,2011,11,24
137,the best service ever,unique hotel. The best service i had experienced ever. (and i have a handfull hotels in my belt),5,2011,11,23
137,Superlative Hotel,"Exceptional 5 star service. I won't repeat the accolades that others have showered, but I assure you they are all well-deserved. I will surely be returning very soon!",5,2011,11,22
137,No 1 for a reason,"When you see somewhere thats got such good reviews its difficult to ignore. In the case of Hotel 41 this is easy to see why. From the moment we arrived till we left we were made to feel very special. The Hotel itself is a boutique hotel, part of the Red carnation group, who's sister hotels we have also stayed in.  This was the best by some way. The hotel is located in Buckingham Palace road, 5 minute walk from the Palace and 5 mins to Victoria tube. From there its 15 mins to Harrods or Oxford st for shopping - so great location. When inside its like an Oasis of calm. A lovely drawing room and bar full of character. Again all the staff were great and attentive when required and discreet too. We had the afternnon tea which was really tasty and great quality and the service was impeccable. The bedroom itself was nice and spacious and quiet, a black and white theme runs throughout. The breakfast was above average - especially the cooked breakfast - maybe the fruit bar could have been a little more - but thats nit picking. What makes this hotel is the staff - all of them , and all very young and professional - to be commended. Roman who met us and saw us when we left was great too - special thanks. Having stayed in London over the years, including the Ritz, Dorchester and Claridges - all of which were good - we'd come back here again - because of the staff, service , quality and value. Highest recommendation - we will be back next year.",5,2011,11,21
137,Hotel 41,"Stayed at Hotel 41 for the first time last week. I must tell you, I have been to many hotels around the world and this is up with the best of them. Every part of the stay was fantastic, faultless service, clean rooms., great location etc

Would definitely recommend this hotel when staying in London and will be staying there again.",5,2011,11,16
137,Best kept secret in London,"I was curious to know what the fuss was all about at Hotel 41. A 5* hotel in London I never heard off? Worth a try. Boy, was I in for a great surprise! The hotel is opposite the Palace mews adjacent to the Rubens hotel. You need to know this because cab drivers do not know, which in itself is a surprise, black cabbies with the ""knowledge"" who do not know this 5* hotel? 

This is part of the allure of ""41"". You feel you are entering into a private member's club and this is how they make you feel from the minute you open the rather unassuming street door. A small entrance clad in marble and oak takes you to a single golden elevator that takes you directly to the 5th floor. Only 28 rooms or so and hence the exclusivity of this place. I feel like I am giving away a secret (despite the hundreds of reviews here!).

You are taken to the lounge which is both the reception and the restaurant/bar and business lounge of this boutique hotel. It looks like an old gentleman's English club, all wood paneling and the old elegant charm of a bygone era, but with the modern touches of any top hotel.

The Staff are young and very well trained. They make you feel like a VIP. The Resident Manager Frederic was specially attentive and accommodating when by mistake I overstayed one more night than my original reservation. I was not aware of this and while I was shopping in London they were left with the task to tell the other guests the room was still occupied. I can only imagine how difficult this was both for the annoyed guests and for the hotel Staff that did not understand what happened. I was oblivious to it until I returned to the hotel at midnight, to their dismay now thinking something had happened to me as they could not contact me all day. They were genuinely relieved to see me and I clarified that I was actually leaving the next morning and that it was a misunderstanding as my flight was Sunday. They were all smiles and understanding and the following morning I vacated my room before breakfast to help the relocated guests. I know they took care of them despite the difficulties  and  they never made me feel bad.  I believe that you can tell excellent service by experiencing how people react to problems and they clearly showed me that they are in a class of their own at Hotel 41. Thanks!

I stayed in a junior suite, duplex room with a small sitting room downstairs and a bedroom upstair. Dark wood, black velvet chairs, fantastic mattress and a bathroom to die for. Separate jacuzzi with TV on the wall. Separate shower with a candle lit every night before you get back to your room. Linen is 5 stars too. 2 more Tvs, one in bedroom and one in sitting room. Ipod charger and radio. 24-hour room service, Free WIFI, shoe-shinning service, etc.  My junior suite  was a good size, being a duplex, but not large per American standards, however I know you can get smaller rooms, and this being London is normal, but i would not what to be in a smaller room.

The lounge bar/ restaurant is great. Try their excellent full English breakfast. After work, relax in the lounge with a drink and some complimentary  ""tapas"". 

I will certainly return, either for business or pleasure. In either case you are going to get a superb personalized service that you will remember.

Now, you are not a secret any more :)",5,2011,11,14
137,My Number One Hotel in London,"The Hotel 41 is the best Hotel in London, bar none. You will not be disappointed. From the first time you walk in to the time you leave this perfect hotel you will not be disappointed. The button on your room phone says it all “anything anytime”",5,2011,11,10
137,Great Place in the center of London,"My wife and I spent 2 nights at the hotel 41 last week. We really enjoyed this stay. We loved the fact that this hotel combines the quality of a 5 stars with the charm of a small hotel. People there are very kind and do everything to make your stay perfect. Last but not least, the location is perfect for a short stay in the city center! We will definitely come back for our next romantic stay in London.",5,2011,11,10
137,magical romantic 40th,"This is a hotel that caters for your every whim....my wife booked a weekend in London for my 40th and choose the 41 from the comments posted here and from their wonderfully descriptive website. After a delay on the flight and a bit of stress we arrived to be welcomed by champagne, strewn roses and a beautiful birthday cake.The stress started to disappear!!! After trip to the west-end we returned to a wonderful late nite supper followed by drinks from the 'honesty bar'.....you serve your own drinks!!!!! Room was decadent and sexy!!! We had a wonderful meal on the following night downstairs in Rubens............as part of the same chain it was up to the same standard......i only wish it was my 40th every year!!!!",5,2011,11,09
137,Best Hotel we have ever experienced !,"We have been staying at the ""best"" reputation hotels in USA & Europe so far ...but there is no one we can compare hotel 41 against with.... 
... Just briefly :  It was and excellent costumer service like no other! They made us feel home at all times, the room was always perfectly neat and cozy with cute little details everywhere & every day. :) it's worth every single pound! breakfast was fresh and tasty! And the best of all ""staff"" they have an awesome crew! Including Frederich, Magda, Monica, Victorial and Komal,  we felt in love with everyone working there as they were always so genuinely  friendly and ready to help and accomplish any requests...I reckon once you try this hotel you will Always want to go back and your expectations level will grow bigger  and will hardly be reached again... 
***We are now at Berlin Ritz Carlton and it is no-where near as nice and good as our 41 :( we miss it already! 
No wonder they are n1 in trip advisor! ",5,2011,11,09
137,Impeccable London Haven,"We landed on the doorstep of ""41"" after a disappointing one night stay in another tony part of the city--felt like we'd died and gone to heaven!!! While its all been said before, there simply aren't enough superlatives for describing ""41""! 

This haven in the heart of London nails luxury and style. But compared with other world class hotel/resorts we have experienced, what catapults ""41"" to the very top is staff quality and warmth--truly beyond compare! The team works together seamlessly and like a family (though more perfect than a family--lol). We could acknowledge more than a half dozen staff by name--rare among hotel patrons--but wouldn't want to risk leaving anyone out inadvertently. We will always cherish our memories of thoughtful personal interactions, along with impeccable  service, throughout our 5 night stay. 

The inviting Executive Lounge was our favorite place to begin each day and unwind each night, with incredible breakfasts, beverages, delectable snacks and ""plundering the pantry"" (a term we've adopted for home). Romantic turn-down gifts provided a sweet surprise nightly.  We also valued complimentary access to a fantastic fitness facility nearby, with an excellent pool and yoga classes. We had one of our best dinners in London at the BBar restaurant next door--fabulous South African cuisine. The hotel-procured airport car/driver was a perfect and stress-free endcap to our stay. 

Bravo ""41""! We hope to return!",5,2011,11,08
137,can't complain (after complaining),"yep, so we checked in on the friday, and we were quite blown away. just arrived from paris, did our usual trick of walking past the place, but once inside we felt like we were in a film.

champagne for check in??? go on then! was all very good, got shown to the room, unbelievable! very large floor space, massive bed and they even accommodated my fussy none feathery pillow needs. went and played scrabble in the lounge, got a burger (the food's great, by the way) and some beer down, all good.

however! we noticed soon after that the toilet wouldn't work. i'm not too fussy so i had a bash at fixing it, but to no avail. after that, the TV packed up. at this point, as we were paying close to 300quid a night, we were left a bit ""hmmmmm"" like. so anyway, we went out and had a good night in soho.

we went down for breakfast in the morning and mentioned the problems with the room to the staff, and to be fair she looked quite concerned that we weren't satisfied. i mean, for 300quid a night, it'd be nice not to worry about the toilet blowing up. so they were very accommodating, offered to switch our room immediately, which was great. so we popped off to the tate.

upon our return, we were shown to our new room, and it was a suite at no extra charge. blimey! we were a bit stunned, i expected a new room, but this had a staircase in it and a fireplace in the downstairs lounge. we felt quite ridiculous, but in a good way! needless to say, the suite(!!!!) was huge, and the bathroom worked and the TV('s) were all good and happy.

to sum it all up, we can have no complaints at all really!!! we were a bit disappointed with the quality of the first room, but when they pulled out the suite for us, we couldn't believe it!!! 

cheers to everyone at 41! it was (ultimately) a great experience!!!",4,2011,11,06
137,"Fantastic ""boutique"" 5 star hotel","We stayed 2 nights at the ""41"". We were first surprised by the ""intimate"" feel of this hotel (part of the sister hotel ""Rubbens"" next door): no grandiose entrance or corridors (as for other 5 star hotels), a small lift to the all the rooms on the 5th floor and the executive lounge operating as the ""hub"" for the hotel (including reception desk).
We quickly came to appreciate this hotel, especially the staff who were always very attentive and try their hardest to make you feel as special guests. The lounge has a gentlemen's club and homely feel and was great for tea and breakfast. Our room was of good size and well appointed with a very comfortable bed and good size bathroom. Although perfectly adequate, do not expect the latest entertainment systems with super large TV and sound surround...

What makes this hotel special is the impecable service, attention to detail (such as rose petals and candles in the evening) and perfect location (next to Buckingham Palace).",5,2011,11,03
137,As good as it gets!,This is the best hotel we have ever stayed in. The staff are incredible. The service is beyond first class - it is world class! In our opinion the service is as good as it gets! The hotel has the best attention to detail in everything that it does. Congratulations Hotel 41. We are already looking forward to coming back again in the near future!,5,2011,11,03
137,5 star exclusivity in the heart of London.,"My wife and I had a wonderful stay at Hotel 41 last week. I had booked a one night stay as a surprise for our wedding anniversary. The hotel is on the top floor of Rubens Hotel which is from the same hotel group. Upon arrival we were taken up to the Hotel via lift and when you enter the executive lounge you immediatly realise what an exclusive place you are in. With only 28 rooms the stay feels very personal and unlike some hotels the staff seem to be able to dedicate more time to each guest. We stayed in a deluxe king size room which was amazing. We were given a lovely platter of fruit and all our favourite magazines were there for us to read. We went to see the show Wicked which is just a short walk away and upon our return there was a lovely white chocolate cheesecake in our room with a message from the manager wishing us a happy anniversary. We had a nice drink in the lounge and had a lovely chat with the manager who is very personable guy. When we returned to our room the lights had been lowered the bed turned down and an open fire was on which really added to the romance of the occasion.

I would happily go back for another stay at Hotel 41 as the attention to detail is amazing and would recommend to anyone looking for 5 star exclusivity to consider a stay here instead of some of the other bigger 5 star hotels nearby.",5,2011,11,01
137,GREAT Stay at Hotel 41!,"My wife and I stayed here in October 2011.  This is not a big, glitzy Ritz-style hotel - it is a smaller, well appointed boutique hotel.  Hotel 41's success is simple - they absolutely nail it  when it comes to service!  The hotel is very clean, and the rooms are great.  Our bed was very comfortable and the main bathroom was quite large.  However, the best feature of the hotel is the guest lounge and the associated staff.  The lounge is the center of the hotel with a fire-place, big comfortable chairs, and 24/7 hour food/drink.  Think 5-star club level but more homey and with more personalized service. The staff is personable, helpful, and goes out of its way to ensure your comfort.  We would often end up here after a day of sightseeing or a night of dining.  We always found a staff member who remembered our names, favorite drink, etc.  In particular I would want to give cudos to Nuh of the night staff.  This gentleman was relentlessly pleasant, always had a smile on his face, and took a genuine interest in our comfort.  On our last night at the Hotel Nuh took the initiative to reserve our favorite table for us in the Lounge.  This is just one example of countless ""above and beyond"" moments by the staff. I can honestly say that during our 4 night stay, we did not have 1 instance of even mediocre service in the lounge.  The location of the hotel is outstanding.  You are right across from Buckingham Palace and all the parks.  The sights are all within walking distance.  If you haven't been to London before, Chelsea is a short walk - and a fine area to shop, dine,  and pub.  Overall, I could not have been more pleased with our stay, and we will certainly stay here again when we return to London.",5,2011,10,31
137,The Best Hotel,"Our stay at 41 was one of the most memorable vacations ever!  The hotel location, dining and atmosphere is an experience that we will never forget.  The 41 staff is so wonderful and delightful...Antoinette and Magdalena made our stay at 41 the best.  Their professionalism and hospitality are amazing!  We are hoping that we can return to London and the Hotel 41 someday.",5,2011,10,27
137,Most Excellent,"41 Hotel is entirely delightful; well-appointed rooms, excellent dining room and snack bar, and a 2:1 staff-to-guest ratio.  This is my first choice when visiting London.",5,2011,10,27
137,Our Home In London,"Stayed here for the second time early in October. Love the location and the exceptional  service. The rooms are somewhat small - this time we stayed in a regular room and preferred it to the suite we stayed at last time.(The suite had a small room down with a steep staircase to the bed/bath upstairs).
  Some great restaurants within walking distance (Quilon,Petrus).
  Usually visit London at least once a year and this is where we will stay!",5,2011,10,24
137,excellent standards  a well deserved 5 stars.,"have stayed at this hotel a number of times over the last few years, and cannot fault it.  attention to detail,  hospitality,  and comfort,  amazing. will always try to stay here when in london.",5,2011,10,24
137,Beautiful boutique hotel in London,"We stayed here for the first night of our honeymoon, as we were flying from London the next day and wanted to treat ourselves to a luxury overnight stay.  The hotel is on a busy road but is absolutely beautiful inside and very quiet.  The library/breakfast room is stunning and we were welcomed there with a glass of champagne on arrival - very nice! Our room was also lovely - not huge, but beautifully decorated in black and white and very clean.  There are lots of nice touches, such as bottles of water beside the bed, a good turndown service and penhaligon's toiletries in the bathroom.  We went out for dinner in the evening and, on returning, found that the hotel staff had put candles and rose petals in our room - a nice touch as they knew it was a special occasion.  The staff were all very friendly and helpful.  The only slight negative comment is that the member of staff assigned to us when we arrived was a bit too formal - but I think he was relatively new to the place and just hadn't quite got the tone right yet! Overall we thought this hotel was great - did exactly what we were looking for.   It is expensive but if you are looking for luxury boutique in London this will do the job very well.",4,2011,10,23
137,Fabulous!,"Thank goodness we read your reviews and decided to stay at this exceptional hotel. 
     We have done a lot of travelling around the world and both my husband and I felt this place was right up there in quality, particularly for London where rooms are generally smaller. The luxurious  rooms were decorated with exquisite  taste and included everything you could possibly need. The beds were very comfortable, the location was great for walking and close enough to get to the Theatres and Museums. Really an unique, beautiful hotel worth booking!
     But most important was the outstanding service. The hotel ""comrades' were so friendly and very helpful in every way! They assisted us with planning our itinerary, had great recommendations for places to go for Dinner, provided snacks, were very accommodating in every way and made us feel at home. We even had hot water bottles put in our bed at turn down service!
A terrific place to relax in luxury!",5,2011,10,20
137,Small rooms but excellent service,"I have stayed at the Hotel 41 before and once again found it to be a wonderful experience.  The location is great.  It's a quick five minute walk to Victoria Station and right across the street from Buckingham  Palace.  The rooms are small, but have everything you need for a great stay.  The beds are exceptionally comfortable and the rooms are very clean.  The service, however, is what really sets this hotel apart.  The staff always goes out of their way to help and to make you feel welcome.  They always have a smile for you and welcome you by name.  I highly recommend this hotel!",5,2011,10,19
137,Stop looking and Say at Hotel 41,"This was my first time to travel to London so I was researching for wks. of a Hotel in the city. I was so exhausted by the entire process, price plus location. Stop reserching now. Hotel 41 was the best experience I have ever had in my travels. I thought it was on the expensive side but well worth it. I was celebrating my 50th. B-day, the entire staff treated us like royalty. I can't say enough about how helpful the entire staff was. The Butlers Pantry was a very nice relaxing atmosphere. We enjoyed having a night cap in that area. The rooms were very comfortable. Loved all the extra touches. The location is perfect, close to everything plus great places to eat also. We will return!!",5,2011,10,14
137,Wonderful Experience !!!,"Wow ""Hotel 41"" was a lovely Boutique Hotel which is about 5 mins walk from Victoria tube station and a pleasure to stay there !!! We were treated like royalty the moment you stepped through the door, the staff were a delight, all smiles could not do enough for you and made you feel very special !!!  The attention to detail was fantastic.  We stayed one night and wish we had booked for longer I did not want to leave, I felt so relaxed the next day and felt like I had been away for longer than one night.  The rooms were very comfortable with great beds and pillows and so tastefully decorated and had everthing you could have wished for, nothing was ever too much trouble, and the food was of great quality with so much choice !!
I think this hotel would cover every type of visitor as you could stay even on your own here,  the atmosphere was great. How refreshing to stay somewhere where everything was perfect the hotel has to be congratulated a real little gem - will be back !!!",5,2011,10,13
137,"Treated like a ""Royal""","My wife and I are no stangers to excellent hotels all over the world. Very few hotels can deliver this high standard of warm, genuine and attentive hospitality that Hotel 41 offers. This was our first stop on a vacation to include a 12 day cruise leaving out of Barcelona. We decided to stay in London for 4 days. Although Hotel 41 stands out to us as a premier hotel, nothing is perfect however, so I will overlook the sometimes toast, sometimes warm bread and the cold Eggs Benedict orderd in the restaurant. (Minor detail.) That out of the way, the Staff are absolutely incredible. They are all attentive, gracious and very welcoming to North American Tourists. They were also very intuitive to our needs from the first day of our stay. Show tickets were arranged for us as well as restaurant reservations were made with only a brief conversation with a member of the staff. As this was our 21st wedding anniversary, rose petals adorned throughout our room and after we saw Wicked, that theme was decorated in our room. We only stayed in a Deluxe room, but it was spacious for London standards. The shower and bath were fantastic with water pressure I only wish we had at home. The black and white theme of the room was great and had a very clean look. The staff in this hotel make you feel like you are very special and that the hotel is there to be a special place just for us.",5,2011,10,08
137,Great week in London thanks to the staff of 41,"My wife & I could not have had a better trip thanks to the great staff at 41.  Prior to our trip, I contacted them regarding restaurant reservations and theatre tickets.  They came through brilliantly, then followed through with all the details making our trip worry/hassle free.  They were incredibly helpful, attentive, welcoming and engaging.  We loved coming back from the Theatre & relaxing in the Lounge (and raiding the pantry for a little nibble with our nightcaps).
The hotel itself is in a great location with easy access to Theatre, pubs, restaurants, sight seeing, & the Victoria Tube station.
This is a very special place.",5,2011,10,08
137,Keeps getting better and better,"When a hotel says they aim to be a 'Home from home' you can take it with a pinch of salt.  This is different. Not only do they keep records of requests and the special things we like they make sure you get them on a return visit. 

For example.  My wife said she loved the Twiglets they have as part of plunder the pantry.  On our latest visit on arrival a bowl of the (beefy?) snacks was in our room.  

My wife is lactose intolerant. Do we have to mention it? Never.  They proactively make sure soy milk etc is available at breakfast etc.

This hotel is amazing.",5,2011,10,05
137,Absolutely perfect experience,"My husband has to travel periodically to London for conferences, and I was looking online for an upscale hotel within walking distance of the venue, which changes every time. Although the visit was primarily for that reason, we always combine it with pleasure. We'd never heard of Hotel 41 but it sounded and looked like our type of place....and it definitely was! More like a private club than a hotel, 5 floors above the street, quiet, sophisticated, centrally located, and with a lovely and attentive staff. We couldn't find a fault this time, and it will definitely be our place to stay in the future. Thank you!",5,2011,10,05
137,Great hotel.  Excellent service.  Small and intimate.,"I really wanted to give this hotel 5 stars.  They deserve 6 stars for customer service and trying to resolve any issues that come up.  The hotel itself is charming.  The rooms are beautiful and very comfortable.  As I said, Service is impeccable and there's nothing they won't do for you.  At checkin, you are offered Tea, Coffee or Champagne.  Nice touch indeed. 

My only issue is that I am a light sleeper and specifically requested a quiet room.  The room I was given was below the dining room and in those old London buildings, it was very noisy as people walked around in the middle of the night and in the morning setting up breakfast.  So little sleep the first night, they graciously said they'd move me to a quiet internally facing room when I got home from work that night.  I packed up and left everything for them to move.  Got home at 11 pm and the room they had chosen for me was facing the busy outside street and wasn't what they had promised.  The only other room was a handycapped room which was small and such a downgrade from what I had before.  I wasn't told it was this type of room until I had moved all my things.  Then decided to go back to the original room facing the street traffic.  This whole thing took about 1/2 hour.  About 10 mins later, I get a knock on the door and am offered a quiet room - in fact a suite.   This room was lovely and extremely quiet.  So it worked out in the end, but the process was not great especially as my only request was a quiet room and if the suite was available, I should have been moved there first.

In any case, I will go back.  It's a lovely hotel and the location is very central.  Having the park close by is paradise for those who enjoy nature or just want to run in the mornings",4,2011,10,05
137,Hotel 41 in London is fabulous!,"We arranged our travel to London, Paris and Dublin through European Destinations on line.  It was our first experience in using them and we were a little anxious, but their arrangments were top notch and everything - flights, hotels, and tours went exactly according to plans.  Hotel 41 in London was the highlight of our trip.  We stayed there five nights and I highly recommend this boutique hotel to anyone traveling to London.  The service and accomodations were top notch and the staff made us feel right at home.  They arranged another tour and travel to and from the airport for us.  The food was delicious!  We plan to stay there again when we return next year.",5,2011,10,02
137,fabulous,"My Partner won a trip to London to see a show and as part of the prize we had a night at the fab hotel 41.  I have been to many hotels around the world as i have been very lucky to travel with my job.  However the 41 hotel has to be one of, if not the very best hotel i have had the privalige to stay in.  It has to be on a par with the hotels you will find in Dubai.
The accommodation is brilliant, but this is not the reason for my praise.  The staff make this hotel truely 5 star plus.  need to get saving!!!!",5,2011,09,30
137,Elegant & Charming,"So impressed with the elegance and charm of this tiny boutique hotel. We had a nice breakfast and were shown to our beautiful room. A bit small- but spotless with lovely decor. The hotel is situated across from Buckingham Palace; probably not the best location for shopping or restaurants, so be prepared to do some walking. Every day, on our return we were greeted with a perfectly made bed with a treat on the pillow. The linens and towels are the best- all white Frette. The price of drinks and food at the hotel are very high- be prepared to spend the equivalent of $18 or so on a drink, and $40 per breakfast; although breakfast was included in our room rate.  Every person on their staff is polite and efficient. The hotel is so beautiful, decor is perfect!  A special shout- out to Monika, who was especially pleasant and helpful!",5,2011,09,30
137,Excelent,"Very nice hotel, great location, all members of staff where very friendly. 
The room was amazing!
You fell like if u are in a palace. 
Great value. ",5,2011,09,28
137,A haven of elegance,"I was booked into Hotel 41 by my company travel co-ordinator due to the usual hotels being full, but I was not disappointed in the slightest.  The closest it comes to is Raffles in terms of staff competence and efficiency, and the room I had was on two floors with a really big bowl of fruit to snack on.  I've tried hard to come up with any criticism, and would say the only downsides are the cost of drinks in the hotel and the usual disgusting milk for tea in the room (although I'm sure they would have provided fresh milk if I'd asked!).  At £500 for one night compared to the normal £150-200 I pay, the value is so much better than anything cheaper.   It's unlikely my company will put me there again, but I'd have no complaint if they did!",5,2011,09,25
137,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed at this Hotel as past of out honeymoon. It is only  a small hotel but the service was excellent. 
We were made to feel very welcome and they were very efficient.One night we returned to our room and it had rose petals and candles , another night a honeymoon cake
It is located behind Buckingham Palace which was good as the Palace was open for summer viewing so it made it easy for us to walk there as well as watch changing of the guards.
Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay.One of the best.",4,2011,09,25
137,The most amazing hotel you will stay at,"We stayed here for our honeymoon in London in September 2011 and without a doubt this was the best hotel we had ever stayed in.  The staff were amazingly helpful and assisted with everything from planning our days to making our stay as great as possible.  The plunder the pantry is fantastic and prices for drinks in the lounge are very reasonable.  The beds are extremely comfortable and we both had great night sleeps.  The location is great as Victoria station is a quick walk away and a major tube hub for London.  Very close to Buckingham Palace, short stroll to Big Ben and there is a great pub Phoenix around the corner, Highly recommend this place to anyone and we will definitely be back again and again.",5,2011,09,24
137,Above and beyond boutique hotel,"I contacted Hotel 41 for a last-minute reservation to stay for a night on our anniversary weekend. The residence manager went above and beyond my expectation on making our weekend fantastic - great room, champagne, anniversary cake, romantic turn-down with rose petals everywhere, chocolate dipped strawberries, and so and so on. And, more than these 'things', each member of staff was helpful and treated us personally. Great location to visit Buckingham Palace, the Royal Mews, etc. It was my best London hotel experience, ever. My husband loved the 'club' feel of the lounge/library area. Can't wait to go again and I have already told all of my friends to book there.",5,2011,09,17
137,"In a word, this hotel is spectacular","This hotel is by far the best hotel stay I have ever experienced.  The staff at the hotel go above and beyond to make sure that you are comfortable and every need of yours is met.  My partner and I stayed here in September of 2011 for a week and wished we could stay longer.  We stayed in king sized bedroom and the room was kept immaculate at all times.  We spent most of the time out in the city seeing the sights, but we could tell that housekeeping would visit more than once a day to make sure that every time you returned to your room, it was is pristine condition.  Other little touches that make the room even more special are the turndown service in the evening, the dim blue light in the bathroom to allow you to use the rest room in the middle of the night without having to turn on the lights, and the good thermostat controls for the room.  To say the staff is responsive and attentive is an understatement.  Everyone there is friendly and is interested in what you are doing that day and if you are enjoying your stay.  They were very helpful in procuring Buckingham Palace tickets and London Eye tickets for us in advance so that we could avoid having to wait in line.  This was done seamlessly.  The ""Plunder the Pantry"" feature in the evening was not what I expected, but by no means disappointing.  I had expected just minor snack foods, sodas and water, but instead a fine array of beverages, breads, salad, cheese and lunchmeats are available and this is a wonderful service to have especially when one comes in from a rather late evening.  I also want to praise Antoinette and Janine on the staff.  They both really took the time to get to know us and make sure everything was to our satisfaction.  It was.  Antoinette was kind enough to provide us with a free afternoon tea in the Executive Lounge just because we were on the go a lot and did not get to spend a lot of time in the lounge.  The tea was superb and this unexpected but kind offer was greatly appreciated.  Janine was also charming and friendly and provided us with a farewell selection of fresh fruit which was another lovely touch.  After this lovely stay, I simply will not consider staying anywhere else in London but here.  Lastly, I must comment on the very few negative reviews I read on Trip Advisor concerning this hotel.  After reading them and staying here I realized the people who wrote these reviews must be individuals who are impossible to please and wish to complain about the tiniest thing.  If you cannot enjoy a stay at this hotel, there is something seriously wrong with you.",5,2011,09,16
137,"Great small hotel, great location","Look and feel of a private club and the staff were welcoming and friendly.  Very quiet and very comfortable bed.  We just had breakfasts at the hotel, quite well done.  We had an excellent  dinner at the ""Library"" at the Rubens hotel next door, first rate.  Highly recomended if you love to walk and take in Westminster.",5,2011,09,15
137,"Terrific, boutiquey hotel","In fact it comprises one floor of the unremarkable Rubens Hotel, in, as far as I'm concerned, one of the least attractive wedges of Central London. It was my fifth choice, and I was getting desperate. 
But...lovely surprise...it's delightful; reminds me in many ways of the late, much lamented 121 Jermyn Street...and in fact the hilarious Annie McCrann, the splendid ex-manager of the latter, is now with the same group and popped-in for tea and reminiscence one afternoon (their intelligence network is thus impressive!)
The hotel is a mixture of chic modernity and Edwardian charm, and appears to be run almost entirely by efficient, charming, and pretty girls from Poland. (With the exception of a lovely bloke who is, I think, the Concierge, and is happily henpecked). 
This is now one of my two top choices for London visits.",5,2011,09,12
137,great London club feel hotel,"Staff very friendly and helpful. Lounge is very attractive with leather chairs and small snacks throughout the day. Just across the street from Buckingham Palace. Rooms are small, but comfortable. Easy walk to all Westminster attractions. Rooms are quiet with comfortable pillows and linens. Two blocks to Victoria station.  Highly recommend hotel. A small caution, when emailing hotel, the staff who respond work for its sister hotel next door, the Ruebens and often don't share information about airport transport or dinner reservations with 41 Hotel staff. You should double check a few days prior to arriving.",5,2011,09,12
137,a keeper,"Lovely hotel to stay in, staff are very helpful.  When we next stay in London we will stay here without question.
Didn't have any food as we ate out so can't comment on stadards of the food but the standards of the rooms and service are very high.",5,2011,09,06
137,Terrific!,"I agree with the superlatives offered by other reviewers.  The staff get special raves:  friendly, accommodating, helpful...we could not have felt more pampered.  Planning to return next year.",5,2011,08,30
137,6 days of heaven .....right in the middle of London,"My husband and I wanted to spoil ourselves with a nice extra long weekend in London. To do some sightseeing, theater and shopping and to have nice food and drinks. We wanted the hotel to be half the fun of our stay, so we looked for a nice small luxury hotel, with excellent service and a pleasant though unpretentious atmosphere. We decided to stay in 41. And I must say all our expectations  came trough. Really a very intimate top hotel with superb service.  It was 6 days of heaven.....",5,2011,08,30
137,Fantastic and we re-booked,"The service and attention to detail was outstanding, nothing was too much trouble.  I have stayed in many London hotels but I always come back here.",5,2011,08,29
137,Superb place to stay,"This is a superb place to stay in London, Ideal for site seeing. But what really amazed us was the kindness of the staff, from the moment we arrived it was as if they were friends, so warm and welcoming. Whenever we visit London we will come straight to Hotel 41.
A great place, and I miss it already.",5,2011,08,28
137,Great hotel and will return.,"I can't say enough good things about this hotel. The service was impeccable.  So many little touches from the next day's weather forecast on your pillow to a cozy, wonderful ""library"" where you can have a drink and eat complimentary snacks.  The ""whatever/whenever"" telephone button was also a great touch!",5,2011,08,23
137,One of the best,"This is a very nice hotel at a beautiful area. Its one of the best hotel I have ever stayed, nice place to stay for a few days for a short break in London. I will be back",5,2011,08,22
137,Hotel 41 exceeded all of our expectations!,"We have no hesitation recommending Hotel 41 for anyone traveling to London - with or without children. The location is ideal for a family and very convenient for traveling throughout the city. The rooms are beautiful with every convenience and luxury you could imagine - perfect linens, great toiletries and modern electronics. The extra touches throughout the day: water as you leave, treats at turn-down and tea-time are absolutely delightful. It was a pleasure to be in the Executive Lounge - and the food is delicious. Most of all, the service at Hotel 41 is beyond belief. We have traveled throughout the world and have never experienced such lovely and accommodating and helpful people. We were truly touched by their kindness and thoughtfulness - every day we stayed. We were spoiled! And, are eager to go back!",5,2011,08,22
137,Amazing hotel - a real find!,"My husband and I stayed here for our wedding anniversary - our first trip away together without children for four years!  Reading the other reviews, the hotel had a lot to live up to - and I'm pleased to say that it exceeded our expectations in every way.  We stayed in an Executive King room which was a lovely size, with a separate entrance hall/study with wardrobes and desk.  The bathroom was all in marble, the water was always hot as soon as you turned on the tap and the bath was lovely and deep.  The bed was HUGE and extremely comfortable.  The view from our window wasn't the greatest, it overlooked another wall - but we preferred this to overlooking the noisier street on the other side.  The staff were fantastic - always asking how we were and if they could help us.  It really felt like nothing was too much trouble - everything seemed effortless and that it was a pleasure to them.  Anything we needed or wanted, we got and with a smile too.  I really cannot rate it highly enough and will definitely be going back!",5,2011,08,22
137,The little details make the difference,"I booked Hotel 41 as a surprise for my husband's birthday. I was sent a guest preference form beforehand which covered choices of pillow, favourite music, drinks etc. this is so the hotel can make your stay as comfortable as possible. “No request is too large, no detail too small.” is the saying of the Red Carnation hotel group to which '41' belongs and it is so true. On returning to our room on the first night of our stay we walked in to find candles, rose petals scattered on the floor, the bed and in the bath, and a tray with a cheesecake with congratulations piped on icing. All because we had mentioned our anniversary. On returning to our room the second night after a trip to 'Wicked' (conveniently just round the corner) we had green candles in our room and a signed cast photo. 

The staff are very friendly and always greet you by name. Monika, assistant manager, is wonderful and shows genuine interest in all her guests. The executive lounge is a haven from the bustle of London. There are nibbles available all day and from 8:30pm you can 'plunder the pantry' and have crackers, bread, cheese, salmon, salad, fruit and other delights, all included in the price of your room. If you have drinks from the honesty bar these are accompanied by little snacks and a bowl of fresh popcorn. The afternoon tea we had was delicious, as was the breakfast. 

We had an Executive King room which was a good size as was the en suite which had a bath and separate shower. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept in away from home. We will definitely be going back to Hotel 41.",5,2011,08,21
137,Fantastic loved this Hotel,"After spending days looking online at all the 5 star hotels in London and looking at all the tripadvisor reviews this gorgeous little Hotel looked the best ..... and it was, the service was excellent! we were given an upgrade which was a lovely suprise ( it was part of my 50th birthday celebrations ) Anna showed us to our room explaining how everything worked which was very helpfull. The full English breakfast was devine about the best i have ever had. This Hotel is a little bit of magic in the middle of London and totally relaxing when you come back from the crowds and noise of the city. A big thankyou to Monika the assistant manager she is so friendly and helpfull and is a big part of the reason for anyones return. A brilliant little magical place !",5,2011,08,21
137,Worth the visit,"Very high level of service in a near private hotel.
Very well located in walking distance of central london,  very near to Victoria station. Also good connections by bus.
Rooms average size, beautifully decorated and with all the amenities required.
Highly recommended. Worth the money.",5,2011,08,15
137,"Incredible service, but..............","We enjoyed some of the best service ever at this boutique hotel. However, there are some caveats: the hotel is across the street from Buckingham palace...with no views (ours was a brick wall) but lots of traffic. The hordes of tourists and tour busses in the neighborhood made for an unpleasant environment. The room was beautiful, but beyond tiny! On reflection, another, more pleasant neighborhood would have been preferable.",3,2011,08,13
137,Excellent Service,"I have travelled a little in my time and this was an experience second to none.  This hotel is all about service and I mean excellent service, you really feel like a guest in this warm and friendly establishment, The great staff will help you with anything you ask.  The hotel itself is ""tres chic"" indeed and adds to the whole intamate encounter, I highly recommend it",5,2011,08,11
137,Excellent Hotel,"I love this hotel.  From the moment you arrive you receive fantastic  treatment.  This is without a doubt a hotel that cares very much about your comfort.  Monika is absolutely WONDERFUL!    I repeat, Monika is great.  I have stayed at some of the best hotels in the world and this little boutique hotel is lovely.  I am staying in the Balmoral Suite, I have three bathrooms and quite a bit of space for European standards.  You can tell when a hotel cares about your sleep -- this place does.  Darkened room, great pillows and a strong air conditioning.  Might be pricey, but worth the expense!",5,2011,08,10
137,I love 2 colors black & white & hotel 41 black & white theme is awesome,"It was business  trip but I am lazy person who love leisure & comfort. London is not for me city to rest or to find peace its all busy city & to find peace in London hotels is hard trust me, no matter how rich u are anyway I stayed for 3 days,,with business I get tired but as soon I enter my room heart gets relaxed eyes gets a view of 2 beautiful colors black & white theme rooms, excellent interior, & great English hospitality from manager to waiters all are helpful..The other best part is location Buckingham Palace is just behind & nearby many good restaurants. Most of London's tourist places are nearby. As far breakfast goes hotel got best breakfasts,the lounge is glass roof again a beauty. The bar is must to visit. I am still in love with the theme of black & white ,what you see in pics mostly looks good in pics but 41 is exceptional what you see in real is more elegant & beautiful eye soothing..Yes I won't recommend this place for honeymoons romance like that. Best hotel or one of the best hotels of London what you pay you get so its not expensive,,,luxurious rooms great service & excellent lightning which for me is very impressive it makes a lot of difference, its London so clean toiletries. One must check hotel 41 for one nite & find whether I am wrong. I loved the decoration theme service breakfast lounge ,what more one can want . Love to stay again. just taxi service is small problem else its gem of a place.",5,2011,08,10
137,Wonderful stay in London,"Our visit to London was highlighted by our stay at  Hotel 41.  Not only were our rooms luxurious and comfortable, but your service staff was
most gracious and accommodating.   We would especially like to
complement the assistant manager, Monika.  Her attention to our needs far exceeded our expectations, and her extremely pleasant manner was most appreciated by both my wife and I.
We would definitely return to ""41"", and would highly recommend your hotel.

Thank you for a wonderful stay in London.",5,2011,08,08
137,"Excellent, Sublime, a wonderful suprise","Yes this is expensive, but its comparative to other London 5 star prices. What is different, is the personnel attention to detail. The quiet, the security, the well lite and appointed surrounding thinking of everything you may need and then some. You can arrive as a weary traveler and after just one evening, you will feel as if the clock has turned back a full year of stress.  Be sure to ask about the butler pantry upon return from a show or long bubble path. This black and white decor is so much more elegant then what the pictures lead one to believe, just try it at least one night.
Incredibly convenient too for Buckingham Palace.",4,2011,08,07
137,The best in London,I spent four days at the outstanding Hotel 41 with my parents in late July. We had a fantastic time! The atmosphere of Hotel 41 is definitely unique and the people working there are just amazing. They will do anything to make your stay unforgettable. The location is right next to Buckingham Palace and very close (5 minutes walk) to Victoria station. I can only recommend Hotel 41 to anyone who wants to spend some time in the great city of London.,5,2011,08,04
137,"Is it Art Deco... is it country lodge? Either way, it's pretty awesome","I stayed here with my partner last week during terrible London weather (of course) for a treat.

Actually, I'm a Londoner but sometimes you need to stay in the city and experience the city properly rather than trudging too and from work.

The Hotel 41 is the top rated hotel at the moment and this was the reason we booked although, like always we noticed loads of variance in the prices so used compare-hotels.co (.co not .com) to establish the very best price for our superior rooms.

Decked out in black and white and with a decent size for central London we were thrilled with our rooms, the toiletries, the fireplace was a surprise, it was like staying in a top class Kensington apartment rather than a hotel. Until of course, it came to breakfast and service, which were both sublime.

The breakfast menu is extensive and rather pricey if you haven't got it included in your rate, fortunately we did. Located close to Victoria station, the whole of the west end is on your doorstep, we saw Priscilla Queen of the Dessert and can highly recommend it for a great London laugh. The concierge was very helpful but really, we knew where we were going already, we were just testing them :)

The hotel does deserve its top ranking, the service here is incredible, the moment you walk through the door nothing is too much effort. Truly recommend this hotel for outright luxury although clearly it is not the #1 bargain in the city. A Treat.",5,2011,08,03
137,Rather a luxury Bed&Breakfast than a five star hotel,"There is no lobby. You enter a corridor and an elevator leads to the fifth floor under the roof, where the hotel is located. Narrow corridors form a maze to the rooms and to the only larger room, which has multiple purposes: reception, breakfast, lounge, library etc. We had a junior suite, which was very small, but was tastefully decorated. Every space is carefully used and thought out. The staff is very friendly but not too knowledgable. And there is no taxidriver, who knows this place",3,2011,08,03
137,Loved everything! Great service.,We stayed at the Hotel 41 for 3 nights and had a wonderful experience.  Service was tops especially P.J.  The staff knew who we were every time we passed through.  A real hidden gem in London.,5,2011,08,02
137,Great service but average room,"This hotel is a refreshing change from the big London 5* offerings with a level of service which leaves no stone unturned. The room phone sums it up - single touch auto dial titled ""whatever you want whenever you want"". So great staff. 

However, we were in room 23 and this room and bathroom were very tight, so much so that it was fine for a 2 night stay ( with little luggage) but a longer stay would have been a challenge. The wardrobe door hits the door closer on the room door and the desk cupboard door totally closes the gap between the desk and the bed making it very difficult to access   the coffee making facilities. Difficult access to shower over the bath tub.

Summary - we may have been unlucky with the room and if the room had been larger then this would be an unequivocal top marks hotel. Unfortunate that the one thing they can't change is the building!",4,2011,08,01
137,"It's all been said before, but it's all true!","Words cannot truly describe the experience you get when staying at this hotel. From the moment you walk through the door to the moment you collect your luggage after check-out, the service is second to none. 

This was the second time that I stayed at 41, but this time I came with my sister to celebrate her 18th birthday - and it was so lovely to find a little birthday cake upon returning to our room after a night at the theatre, so THANK YOU 41!!

The room that we stayed in was tastefully decorated, but far from bland and the beds were sublime. The amenities were everything that you would wish for - there were even little tubes of lip balm in the bathroom! The bathroom was a good size with a separate bath tub and shower cubicle. The only thing that might irk some people is that the floorboards outside the room creaked constantly, but as our room was just directly off the main lounge it was only to be expected that there would be a high volume of traffic.

In terms of the lounge, you never feel as though this hotel is overcrowded or bustling. In fact there is such an air of peace and tranquility that you really do feel as though you belng to a private club. Snacks are available throughout the day and there is an honesty bar. 

The staff really do go the extra 10 miles in this place. Upon returning to the lounge after a scorching hot day spent shopping a member of staff offered to fill up my sports bottle with water. I very happily accepted and I found that the water was beautifully chilled with ice cubes in it - bliss!! And it didn't just end there. On our last day we spent the day sightseeing, but left our luggage at the hotel. When we got back to the hotel we were ushered up to the lounge to rest our feet whilst our luggage was being fetched. When we were in the lounge we were offered drinks and canapes. I explained that my sister and I had already checked out of the hotel and the reply was that we were still more than welcome to have drinks and canapes if we wished. 

I know that these may only seem like small things to some people, but it is these little touches that make all the difference. Would I like to move into 41 permanently given half the chance? Absolutely! And it is clear that my sister is of the same opinion as she is always dropping ""hints"" about the next time we go to 41...",5,2011,07,31
137,A truly wonderful experience,"We were going to one of the Royal Garden Parties at Buckingham Palace, and it was also our 41st wedding anniversary, so my husband decided that we wanted to stay somewhere really special.
41 was certainly that. So good, I don't really know where to start!
We had two nights at this wonderful venue, in Buckingham Palace Road, a couple of minutes walk to the Palace itself, and the staff could not have been more helpful and attentive, the room was lovely, and the food delicious.
We arrived tired and frazzled having had a difficult journey getting through outer London in our car. A Doorman met us, sorted our bags and then took the car to the nearest car park. We then checked in, had a quick tidy up and then went to have a gorgeous champange afternoon tea. 
The experience just got better, the inclusive ""Plunder the Pantry"" where one can help oneself to salads, meats, fruit, breads etc., was wonderful, supported by an honesty bar for drinks. breakfast great, and the sense of peace and quiet provided a wonderful oasis in a busy world.
The hotel even provided an anniversary cake for us. scrummy.
The staff were always ready to go the extra mile, and the most amazing thing for me was the help I got with my hair - having to style it while putting in my Fascinator was proving far beyond my skills - one of the female staff came and did my hair for me,even providing the hair spray!!
If anyone wants a truly magnificent experience in London, feeling very spoilt and looked after, this is the hotel for youl.",5,2011,07,29
137,Excellent in every way,We stayed here last week for my husband's graduation. The first night we had a little glitch-the electricity blew in our room at about 10.30pm. in fairness all the girls could do was move us to another room. We had to be up very early the next day (so I started to get very stressed!!) However after this little blip Magda offered us complimentary afternoon tea and when we returned from the graduation service there was a bottle of champers for us and a cake!! The service in Hotel 41 is excellent and this is because of the wonderful team they have working there. Magda and Monika are two of the best hospitality staff I have come across. Their manner and attention to the customer's needs are to be highly commended. Sure this is an expensive hotel to stay in.....however we have stayed in very expensive hotels and have been fobbed off if we complained about anything. Not so in this hotel where they strive to give you value for your hard earned dollar! Hope to get back again!!,5,2011,07,28
137,Fantastic Hotel,Took my partner for our anniverssary and they made the stay very special. Its not cheap but you get what you pay for and to me it was worth every penny!,5,2011,07,28
137,"""Wouldn't hesitate to come back""","Ellegant, but not overdone. Very professional and personalized service.  Great location. Walking distance from places like Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and Houses of Parliament. Loved the neighboorhood's public spaces, restaurants, retailers and Victoria Theater . Quite room on the top floor. Very confortable bed. Highly recommend.",5,2011,07,26
137,Exceptional,"We stayed at the Hotel 41 this past May. As other reviewers have noted it is located next to and over the Rubens, as sister property. The 41 is not like the big luxury hotels – Mandarins or Four Seasons, but is very similar to a private club property. From time of arrival until departure you will be treated with a personal interest by every member of the staff. 

 The room we had was small with a little too much furniture for it size but otherwise was immaculate. The bed is about as comfortable as you will find anywhere. The room we had was extremely quiet. 

The 41 is located across from the Palace grounds and along with the Rubens are probably the closest hotels to the Palace itself. The hotel is ideally located within walking distance to many of London’s attractions. A number of pubs are a block or two away.  

The entire staff will try to meet your every wish. From providing directions to answering the most inane question they were informative and helpful. My wife asked if they had a flat iron for her hair since hers was not compatible with the voltage. Thirty minutes later a flat iron was delivered to our room – they went out and purchased one! The staff often surprised us – from a welcome cake, and assortment of berries, a bottle of Champaign and an invitation to high tea.  We would single out Antoinette and Monika. They made our stay particularly special. 

The 41 may seem a bit pricey, but in London you get what you pay for. And the 41 is fairly priced and in our opinion a good value.",5,2011,07,23
137,Best hotel I've stayed at.,"Enough said really. The service and friendliness and quality just spoke for themselves. There were a couple of minor things, but to be honest they were so minor I'm not even going to mention them. The service is just spot on, not pompous, not over bearing just nice and friendly. I'll be back!",5,2011,07,23
137,Huge service-tiny room,"If only the room had been larger I would have given it top billing as the service they provided was top notch.  Nothing was too big/small for them to help us with.  Hotel is very convenient and cabs come by often.  Not all cab drivers knew of it but they knew of Reuben's next door (sister property).  With just 2 people and 2 suitcases, 1 bed and table we were constantly bumping into each other in our room, the chair was in the way and the bathroom was only 4-5' across. Perhaps they had larger rooms I did not think to ask but that was the only negative.",4,2011,07,16
137,Eccentric...,"Having stayed at many wonderful hotels around the world, and reading the great reviews on TripAdvisor, I was greatly looking forward to trying Hotel 41.  Unfortunately, it was a disappointing experience.

It's difficult to know whether this is really a hotel, a large B&B, or similar to staying at your wealthy and eccentric in-laws.  You enter a mirrored elevator (""through the looking glass"" as we joked to ourselves upon each return to the hotel) and emerge into a warren of hallways.  You find your way to the ""executive lounge"", which is nice, but small.  Other guests and staff know you and all your movements.  And you always end up walking through this lounge on the way to your room.  Private it is not.  

So addressing some of the strengths described in previous reviews:

Staff:  they do indeed seem to try, but they are not very capable.  Don't expect minor repairs to be made properly, your room service order to be correct, or any insight or help from the concierge service.  They're a chatty bunch, inquiring all about your day, your plans, etc. etc.

Location:  Indeed, the hotel is located on Buckingham Palace road, but to say it's ""right across from Buckingham Palace"" is a slight stretch.  The hotel is located on a busy intersection, across from the Buckingham Palace Mews (horse stables)

Rooms:  Uncomfortable and unsettling.  The black and white decor might look good in photos, but is neither warm nor welcoming.  The bath had some expensive-looking fittings, but besides that, the room seemed much past its prime.

2nd best hotel in London:  sadly, not by a long shot.  They do offer something unique -- but it's a nice 3-star hotel, not anything remotely comparable to the best hotels of London.",3,2011,07,11
137,Hidden Jewel,"All good hotels in my experience have something of a conspiracy about them: you feel like you are on the inside of something. 41 is like this, more than most in fact. There isn't even a sign outside when you go in, just the door number; if you didn't know about it, you wouldn't even be here. The receptionist is charming; then someone comes down and takes you up in the lift. There's only one button, it's like going up to a particularty luxurious Space Shuttle launch platform. 
It's not so much like a hotel, more a luxurious club. You sit down to check in, and have a drink. The staff are outstanding, the rooms are charming, the food is excellent. 
Looking out the window that night, the traffic in the road below seemed strangely foreign and exotic. Now there are words I wouldn't have used about Victoria before ...",5,2011,07,10
137,Best hotel service experience,"My husband & I stayed at Hotel 41, London for over a week.  It is a small & beautifully appointed hotel in a great location just across the street from Buckingham Palace.  It is quiet, clean & private. The staff is exceptional!  Amenities are many and very thoughtfully provided. We have told our friends that this is the place to stay in London.",5,2011,07,08
137,I've never seen hotel with better services,"We were there for our honeymoon back in April and were not disappointed. 

Seriously, Hotel 41 staffs really go beyond expectation in services. There are (positive) surprises everyday in our room (roses, chocolates, candles).  The staffs are also very helpful in finding what we need (e.g. tickets for attractions, city recommendations, etc)

The hotel's breakfast is also among the best we've ever tasted. 

I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody who is visiting London.",5,2011,07,07
137,It's all about service,"The 41 may not have the most impressive decor, may not have the most advance technology gadgets, but it has most impressive service I have experienced in many years. The attention to detail is everywhere: from the email you recieve days before asking for your pillow preference to the personal attention you receive each time you cross the lounge area.
Without any doubt I will return to the 41 on my next trip to London. One interesting detail: most of the guests were savy Tripadvisor users.",5,2011,07,05
137,Just perfect......,"We have stayed in many hotels and this one is now in our top 5. Room was fantastic, had everything and more to make stay just perfect. Hotel staff were smart, friendly and couldnt do enough to help. Will definately visit again. 5* without a doubt.",5,2011,07,03
137,Lovely end to a great honeymoon,"Extravagant and expensive, but the attentive staff, comfortable room and great location made it worthwhile.  And we're going back next year!",5,2011,07,03
137,Will always stay here in the future!,"The service begins at the door with a quick and friendly check in. The room was not large, but had every amenity and some.  The shower was especially wonderful.  

The biggest reason my husband and I loved this hotel was the service. From making excellent dining suggestions and reservations, to drinks and canapés in the gathering room, every request was met with a smile and prompt attention.",5,2011,07,01
137,"Great location, not sure it warrants five stars","We stayed at Hotel 41 for six nights.  The location is ideal for touring London.  However, the hotel didn't seem to warrant the price.  The rooms were nice, but not what I have experienced at other five star locations.  The service depended upon who was on duty.  The concierge did a nice job securing tickets, however, some of the other staff was slow to respond to requests, if at all.  Nice hotel, but not sure it warrants five stars.",3,2011,06,30
137,Most amazing hotel,"Can't fault this hotel in any way. Fantastic service from all members of staff. Clean, inviting room. Breakfast was excellent. It was certainly the little touches that made this hotel stand out from the rest. Expensive but well worth it for a perfect weekend stay in the best city in the world. Just down the road from Buckingham Palace and within walking distance of most major attractions. Will definitely return.",5,2011,06,27
137,"Things that make you go ""hmmmmm."" 3 points from me and I am in a generous mood today.","Things that make you go hmmmmm. Kinda scratching my head at the number 2 spot this hotel snagged on TripAdvisor. Oh well... here is my experience.

First of all we arrived after we booked short notice on their hotel website. We originally had booked at the new St. Pancras because we were coming in by EuroStar train and changed plans to come into Gatwik by plane instead. We caught the Gatwik express train from there and it landed us about 3 blocks from Hotel 41. Loved that.

So about the hotel... Let me break it down into the good; the bad and the ugly. 

THE GOOD:

The location was fabulous. That is the main reason we picked this hotel and why we changed hotels. It is almost right across the street from Buckingham Palace. The part of the Palace where they keep the horses is right across the street. It is called the Royal Mews. For us, that made it worth staying there. It also was only a short walk to all kinds of other historical attractions including Westminster Abby; Big Ben and Trafalgar Square and more. We loved the location. To the right was all of this and to the left were some great British Pubs with load of character and charm. Also just a few doors away were several mini grocery marts so we were able to easily restock baby supplies. 

More good stuff... the hotel is decorated really cute. An interior designer went to town with it. Fabric wall coverings of every pattern lots of fun patterns everywhere really. I liked all the unique details and plentiful amenities in the rooms. They had many extras that you don't find in most hotels. I loved the towel warmer bars. 

The room was set up nicely with a candle lit in the bathroom when we arrived in our room. We also had some welcome goodies waiting for us. 

The beds were very comfortable.

In general the welcome was pleasant and they were gracious about the fact that we had little ones with us. I had emailed the hotel in advance to let them know that we had little ones, even though we booked a room that was really for 2 people, but I never got a reply email. That may have been because we booked only a few days prior to our arrival.

Anyhoo... they were gracious about the fact we had kids with us and brought an extra bed into the room. We were grateful for that.

On the second night there, we also received cute little baby slippers for our wee ones. That was over the top. Reminded me of our stays at Four Seasons.

They were very good at details of amenities with the turn-down; milk and cookies, bath salts, and on and on.

All that stuff was very good. They do try really hard here.

Where it falls apart for me is the lack of ""real"" staff. I'll explain this in more detail below.

The Bad:

This hotel really is the top floor of their sister hotel; The Ruben's at The Palace; which has an entrance next door. The hotel next door, although as staff at 41 pointed out is only 4 star seemed more like a ""real"" hotel then The 41. Hope that all makes sense. If it sounds confusing, just imagine being there. It was odd and that is being kind.

You enter into a tiny foyer with a small desk smashed up against the wall. I thought we were in the wrong place when we walked in. But before I could tell my husband we must have entered the wrong door the man at the desk was whisking us up some stairs, storing our strollers in a closet near the elevator and leading us into the tiny elevator. My 7 year old son immediately notice the lack of buttons on the wall. Only one floor and it's number 5. Hmmmm. He asked why and the man replied, we are ""special here at The 41 and you are V.I.P., do you know what that means?"". Of course my kids being slightly spoiled replied ""Yes, we are very important people."" Oh my. By the time we got upstairs and out of the elevator we were led down a series of very narrow hall ways. My head was spinning. We were led to the ""parlor room."" At this point, I was thinking, this was all a new experience and good for my children. It was charming. But weird too. More about that in a minute. We were offered chairs to sit in as we registered ourselves and were given room keys. The children were offered chocolate and we were offered drinks. Check in was swift and we were led again through a maze really of narrow hallways to our room. Upon entering the room it was very stuffy, no air-conditioning turned on a bit claustrophobic feeling, yet kind of charming all at the same time.  Our bags were brought up and husband started to unpack. ""Wait!"" Let me go back and see if we can get a bigger room, we were told the only room that they had available that was bigger was a split level. So I took a peek. This was not good for small children either, split level? It was more like a 2 story room. But not spacious. Glad we didn't book this one, I almost did and would have been really upset with it. So back to the room, after a second request someone finally came to show us how the air-conditioning was turned on  and we unpacked and settled into our room ... now here is where The Ugly starts...

The Ugly:

I am a clean freak and a bit of a germaphobic. And I know obviously there are going to be germs, but when I went to dry my hands I grabbed a neatly folded wash cloth and to my abhorrence there was bright pink lip stick on the underside of it. Yuck!

My guess is housekeeping didn't change out all the towels and assumed it was clean because it was neatly folded on the shelf. Did I say yuck already? Well, double yuck. I was not happy. What else isn't clean I had to ask myself. Sure enough I found another sign the room wasn't thoroughly cleaned. Near the phone was a letter, I peeked at it and it was a note from the manager, but not for us; it was for a previous guest. The note was an apology for some mishaps and an offer of a bottle of champagne. I looked for the bottle of champagne. LOL. Not there, just the note. 

Also, our toilet seat was scuffed and worn and the toilet didn't flush very well; and the sink drained very slowly.  The towel bar burned my son when he backed into it. There was too much clutter of trinkets and chatskis so it was hard to find your own things that you set down.

Anyway, the first day I mustered my way around the maze of hall ways to the reception desk and asked the very attactive young girl sitting there if she was the concierge. Hoping that if she wasn't she would surely direct me to him or her. She didn't answer that she was she simply said she could help me. I told her since we only had a few days in London we wanted to hit the best historical points for our kids. I explained that it had been years since my last visit and I needed help.

She pulled out a map. The kind that already has all the main points starred. She proceed to circle the starred points ....oh my. I was hoping for a little insider info. Nope. None available. I asked the best way to get around and she said, ""You can walk or take the Underground Tube."" She circled that too. Still no special hints of any  kind. She did remind me that Westminster was where ""The Wedding"" was. OK great. That was it. BTW... we found lots that she failed to mention including the fabulous theater district  and we caught the second opening night of ""Shrek the Musical"". We were lucky to find this on our own as it was nearly sold out.

Also on our own we learned about a great tour bus called The Original Tour. A double decker red bus, that you can hop on and off of for 24 hours. We loved it. 

Why didn't our hotel tell us about this? There was an Original Tour bus stop less than a block from the hotel. Why didn't our concierge tell us this? The answer to why; my dears is this is not a 5 star hotel. The girl was not a real concierge. And the man who let us in was not a real door man, I never saw him again, certainly not at the door, we were locked out at night and had to ring and give our hotel number to enter the door with a buzz in.

 And when I woke up early to check my reservation details the man who popped out of the kitchen was not really the night manager. Or was he? Why was he preparing breakfast? And why did he go from the computer at the desk right back to the kitchen food, I didn't see him wash his hands. Strange stuff. IF this hotel was billed as a B&B fine. You would expect this kind of stuff and it would be charming. But when you expect a 5 star it is not charming. It is weird.  I mentioned that the hotel felt like a B&B to the chef, I mean night manager, but I said it in the nicest way, defensive he retorted, ""oh no, this is a 5 star boutique hotel. Blah blah blah....""

Also, the ""business center"" was open up a few steep stairs in the ""parlor"" and the ceiling is really low. A tall man or woman might have more trouble, hence the signs to watch your head. I almost tripped down the steep stairs but I caught myself. 

On the day we were checking out we called for a taxi ourselves. Only because we met a nice driver the night before and he told us that the rate to the Heahrow airport was approximately 55 pounds. Odd. Our hotel quoted us 120 pounds. Hmmmm. What was that all about. Maybe I misunderstood the woman at the desk. I called again, and she repeated that they would be happy to arrange a taxi to the Heathrow airport for slightly more than 120 pounds. She had an exact number but I can't recall it. It's buried in notes somewhere. I think she actually said 122.60 but let's be safe and call it 120. 

Surely the taxi cab driver was wrong... nope. Our fair to the airport was just under 60 pounds and that was in traffic in the rain.

Lastly ugly detail. We received a call that our taxi was waiting for us from the girl at the downstairs desk. I asked her to double check the drivers name as I had just talked to his partner and he said he was a ways a way. She huffed in my ear and said something like; ""But it's raining outside, I guess.""; and then she told me she would call me back, we asked for some help with our bags.  

Worried that the taxi was waiting for us, as time went on with out a call back and no help with the bags, we gathered ourselves and hurried downstairs. 

What happened next was really appalling. She scolded me. She said; ""I told you I would call you back!, the taxi was for M. Brady not M. Bradley!""

Are you kidding me? Unbelievable. I could use a bunch of other words here but I can't if you know what I mean.

My family went upstairs and two men were already cleaning the room. They were really confused when we explained what happened. I am guessing they may not have spoken English but they got it that we needed the room still and they left.

I went back downstairs to check out and again the woman annoyed said that check out was upstairs. This is the point where I decided that this is really not a hotel, it's a comedy. Only at the time it was soooo not funny. So back upstairs I went and sat down to check out. A woman sat in the desk to check me out she handed me over my bill. I noticed that it was one pound over the correct amount. I asked what the discrepancy was. She replied that it was a ""donation"". I felt like asking if it was a donation for better trained staff, but I bit my tongue. She took back the bill and redid it. How odd is that? She didn't ask if I wanted to make a donation, just added it to the bill. A pound donation to every bill could really add up. There was a brochure under the bill, I suppose it described the charity. Believe me, we give to charities, but this is just odd, not to ask first; just add it to the bill without a word about it. 

Then another woman came and hovered over me. She asked me how my stay was. She didn't introduce herself. I asked if she was the manager and she said she was.  I explained the fiasco and the rudeness of the treatment by the girl downstairs. She apologized and explained that she was new. Whatever. 

Before I got back to my home I received an apology letter via email for the rude treatment regarding the taxi mix up. I didn't even mention all the other details listed here. I was offered a room upgrade and the infamous bottle of champagne on my next visit. 

Things that make you go ""Hmmmm.""

My tip is this is an OK place to stay; but now you know what to really expect. I however will not be back but I might check out the other part of the hotel; next door called The Rubens at the Palace.

If you thought this review was helpful please check that little box that says so. I love tying these reviews, I love reading them too. I am also writing a book about tips for traveling with young children watch out for that sometime next year. Thanks! P.S. Sorry for any typos, I have to run, I have gotten a bit carried away with my typing and have other things to do. P.P.S. London was fabulous, our best stay ever! Loved it! Cheers!",3,2011,06,23
137,"Wonderful Stay, Simply the Best","My wife and I stayed for a weekend to celebrate our Ruby Wedding and what a wonderful choice we made. The location was superb being located near Buckingham Palace, particularly as the weekend coincided with Trooping of the Colour. The service at the Hotel is something quite special extremely warm and friendly absolutely nothing is too much trouble. The rooms are lovely and there is nothing at all that can be faulted. We stayed for two nights and took advantage of the late night complimentary ""plunder the pantry"" which was ideal after the theatre. The atmosphere is peaceful and away from the hustle and bustle of normal 5 star city hotels. We really liked the boutique atmosphere and will definitely revisit.",5,2011,06,19
137,11 out of 10!!!,"Wonderful, relaxing, made us feel at home from the moment we walked in. We came with huge expectations and left wanting to return again and again. I was shown the hotel on my last trip to London when staying at the sister hotel and promised to try it out... best decision ever. The ambience is like a gentleman's club but for everyone! it feels private and there is always a table and lovely staff smiling wanting you to enjoy without any snobbery. 
The manager welcomed us with a glass of champagne and after some paperwork went straight to the room... spotless (the housekeepers were great throughout our stay). The room 28 is huge, with a separate lounge with sofa-bed if needed. My wife loved the walk-in wardrobe. 
For breakfast I recommend the eggs benedict, seems to be a speciality there, and the cappuccinos are to die for!
All the team are knowledgeable of things to do in London and spend all the time you need explaining and helping out.
Will return to my new home away from home...",5,2011,06,17
137,My number 1 choice,"#41 happened to me this Feb as I didnt get a booking in my usual place of stay The Goring and was booked into this hotel. My ask of my travel agent is always proximity to workplace, hence I only stay in Buckingham Palace road.

I just loved this place. Its a small suite of about 12 rooms and attached to the bigger Rubens hotel.  The minute i walked into the lobby I knew I'd be back here again. Its got a lovely fireplace with very comfortable sofas laid across the lobby. Theres a small stairway up leading to the business centre.

The rooms are good and I loved the attention to making it cozy, with a stuffed toy on your bed. Each room also comes with its own fireplace and that to me added a lot of charm to the entire set up.

Didnt dine much except breakfast, which is not too elaborate but tastefully set up. But an absolute must try is the 'afternoon tea'. Suggest you skip breakfast as it comes along with a three tier tray full of sandwiches, desserts, scones etc. The desserts were absolutely gorgeous.

Another thing that stood out is the warmth in the service & staff, bit tough to describe but surely stands out as compared to Goring or St James

For me the first choice henceforth.",5,2011,06,17
137,A wonderful place to stay,"This was our first visit to Hotel 41.  We had high expectations based upon other reviews in Trip Advisor, and these expectations were easily met and even exceeded.   The location is ideal – just a short walk to Buckingham Palace in one direction, and minutes in the other direction to Victoria Station/the underground.  The hotel is small and intimate.  You are met at the entrance by an attendant who takes you up one level on the elevator and walks you to the executive lounge.  All 20 or so rooms are located on this level. The lounge also serves as the hotel restaurant, check-in desk, and concierge desk.  It is very attractive and homey.  Friends of ours took the train from Birmingham so that we could see a London show together.  We really liked being able to welcome them in the hotel lounge before the show, as it had the same feel as if we had invited them into our own living room.

We often like being able to eat smaller amounts food at various times of the day, and the hotel made this very easy.  Various kinds of small snacks were available for free between meals, and we could order a lighter fare at pretty much any time.  The hotel staff went out of their way to provide us with any type of food we wanted at any particular time.  They had provided us with a bottle of champagne as a welcoming present for our eight-night stay.  We explained that we didn’t drink alcoholic beverages, and the champagne was quickly substituted with soft drinks.  We asked for ice one evening;  it was delivered to our room along with lemon, lime, and olives.  On subsequent evenings the bucket of ice with the lemon, lime, and olives were provided without asking, as the staff learned our particular needs and sought to anticipate them.
 
The hotel staff treated us superbly.  Part of this was because there was a high ratio of staff to guests, but it was more than this.  The hotel prides itself on its service, and this is evident in many ways.  For example, Sunday was a down day for us as we accustomed ourselves to the time change by remaining in our room for most of the day.  We had expected that our room would not be made up that day – as would certainly be the case in most any other hotel.  However the maid service showed up at 8 PM Sunday evening to make up our room!

All of the staff was wonderful, but we came to have our favorites.  For example, Rita's service at meal time was effortless, gracious  and attentive to detail. She made us feel at home.   Jean and PJ's service set a perfect tone our first 24-36 hours at the hotel.  They gave us impeccable service.
 
We love London and we will definitely return from time to time.  We are spoiled now, and the only hotel we will consider for future stays is Hotel 41.",5,2011,06,05
137,Outstanding,"Decided to go big ($$$) on this trip to London, and we're so glad we stayed at 41.  Total of 4 nights in Room 17.  Impeccable service, we were treated like gold.  Perfect location for both walking and for hopping on the tube.  Only complaint - toilet in room took some getting used to; problem apparently fixed after we left.  We will definitely and absolutely stay at this amazing hotel again.  Worth every penny.",5,2011,06,05
137,Absolutely the BEST in London-- Look no further.,"The service here is absolutely fabulous. The staff will accommodate whatever (and I do mean WHATEVER!) you could possibly want or need even before your arrival in London. They are superb, friendly & nice and are on top of everything they do. The location is prime and the rooms are excellently kept up. They offer endless amenities in your room (even a towel warming rack in the bathroom)  and the dećor is a beautiful, in a classic yet chic London style with gorgeous woodwork throughout. The beds are very comfortable and there are plenty of restaurants and shops in the vicinity. Trust me.. This is the place you want to be while staying in London!!",5,2011,06,05
137,The perfect hotel of quiet luxury,I was in London on business as a solo traveler and wanted a hotel close to the heart of town and one that i  felt comfortable to stay in by myself.  The Hotel 41 exceeded my expectations and at night i could not wait to return to the hotel and sit by the fire and have dinner and drinks.  The staff was lovely and could not have been more accommodating.  The hotel is a gem!,5,2011,06,04
137,The Ideal Place to Stay in London,"Incredible hotel and impeccable service!   One of my top 3 all-time favorites.  I chose Hotel 41 to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary based on its high Trip Advisor ranking, and the hotel and staff lived up to my very high expectations.  

My wife and I arrived in London at 7:00 AM on the overnight flight from Houston.  We arrived at the hotel at 9:00 AM, well before normal check-in time, yet we were welcomed with a glass of champagne and shown to our room so we could freshen up.

We received attentive service throughout our stay; the staff is very friendly and eager to help.  They paid attention to the details: when the anniversary cheesecake they sent to the room went uneaten, they asked if we didn't like it.  When I told them that I had dropped it on the floor (after too much anniversary champagne) another appeared in our room that evening.

The hotel is located two blocks from Victoria Station (the Underground), although many tourist sites (Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey) are within easy walking distance.  Several nice pubs in the area as well; I particularly liked the Westminster Arms.

We also enjoyed the food at the hotel, particularly the breakfast buffet (and I'm not a person who likes buffets).  In the evenings they have an honor bar, snacks (including a very nice cheese plate) and an opportunity to meet some of the other guests in the common room.

Our room was comfortable and very nicely furnished.  We loved the decor of the hotel in general; lots of dark wood, yet clean, bright and open.  It is a unique hotel comprised of a single floor of what used to be offices, although you could never tell that today.

I used the complimentary computers every morning to check e-mail.  I was given a pot of wonderful hand pressed coffee to help me wake up.  There is no on-site fitness center, but guests are given passes to the LA Fitness center located one block from the hotel (I used it once and found it acceptable).

I like to try new things, but will stay at Hotel 41 again if I ever return to London.",5,2011,05,31
137,Attentive luxury in the heart of London,"We stayed at Hotel 41 with friends for three nights in April 2011 based on the excellent reviews on TripAdvisor. We were not disappointed. The location, small-size, breakfast quality, decor, ambiance, and attentive staff make this a memorable hotel. After an initial problem with our room (small and awkward despite having paid for an upgrade to a larger room) we were moved to a larger and more comfortable one with which we were very pleased. The staff was very helpful regarding this issue, as they were with all aspects of our stay. Do insist on an adequately-sized room (all are of different sizes and configurations) but in all other respects this is an excellent choice for a central London location close to Victoria Station.",5,2011,05,27
137,Absolutely The Best!!,"My daughter and I recently returned from a trip to London for the Royal Wedding and a 6 night stay at Hotel 41.  Trip Advisor should allow 10 stars for those hotels that truly exceed expectations in every way!  

I had e-mailed Manager Antoinette several times prior to our visit and she was wonderful answering my questions and making dinner and tea reservations for us so that everything would be in place upon our arrival. 

It was most welcome to arrive at Hotel 41 after a long overseas flight and be welcomed with our choice of beverage while checking in.  Even though we arrived at 10 a.m., our room was ready!  It was great to take a little time to freshen up and unpack a few things before heading out to sightsee. 

We were very pleased that our room request for a room with a view of the Royal Mews was granted. I enjoyed seeing the riders taking their horses out to exercise in the morning. It was also fantastic to see the royal vehicles and carriages come and go for the Royal Wedding. The hotel's location just a block from Buckingham Palace and a couple blocks from Victoria Station was perfect. 

Everything about our stay here was perfect. The room was large by European standards and had a good sized closet with a mirror on the door. We had a room with two twin beds and our room also included a sitting area with a small sofa. The bathroom was wonderful.  It had a large, deep tub (I loved it!) and also a separate shower across the bathroom.  The Penhaligon amenities are amazing.  They were restocked every day even though some of our bottles were still half full.  Amenities included shampoo, hair conditioner, bars of soap, showel gel and bath essence.  Also in the bathroom were toothbrush and shaving kits.  

Our package included full English breakfast every day, a cream tea, and a 3 course dinner.  All were incredible.  It usually took about 20 minutes for the English breakfast to arrive once ordered.  The scrambled eggs, streaky bacon and hashbrowns were excellent.  We could also help ourselves to the Continental breakfast items.  The offerings included excellent fruits, meat, cheese, pastries and about 6 choices of cereals.  

The cream tea, which we asked to have served in the Hotel 41 Executive Lounge rather than in the Lounge of the adjoining Rubens Hotel, was a nice treat.  My daughter needed gluten free items, so we requested that in advance. We were served scones which were out of this world.  The best we have ever had - we couldn't believe they were gluten free!  The clotted cream, jam and chocolate spread they were served with were excellent. Our 3 course dinner was also very nice.  We also asked to have our dinner served in the Hotel 41 Executive Lounge because it was such a warm, relaxing atmosphere. There were hardly ever other guests around, so it was a nice respite from the busy streets of London. Staff were happy to oblige.  I ordered the Beef Carpaccio as my appetizer, the sea bass as my main course and the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert.  It was all very, very good. 

We were very pleasantly surprised at the afternoon ""snack"" offerings set out in the Executive Lounge.  I didn't expect the large bowls full of Belgian chocolates, dried fruits, granola bars and bags of chips to be complimentary!  The iced lemon and mint water was wonderful when we came back to the hotel for an afternoon break. We also found an ice bucket along with a dish of green olives and lemon slices delivered to our room every afternoon.  

Plunder the Pantry was fantastic!  Every evening starting at 8:30, guests are allowed to help themselves to a wonderful array of things in the Executive Lounge.  The smoked seafood (tuna, salmon and mackerel) was incredible.  One night there was the best shrimp. Very fresh, high quality items. There was also salad, fruit, olives, cheese, several types of wonderful, crusty bread, sliced meats and South African jerky.  Everything was so good. This alone made staying at Hotel 41 worthwhile! 

The staff of Hotel 41 were professional yet friendly. In the morning, they asked where we were headed for the day.  In the evening, they inquired as to what we had done that day and whether we enjoyed it. On the day of the Royal Wedding, Assistant Manager Monika made sure to give us 2 small British flags to wave so that we would fit right in with the celebration going on in the streets!  When we left, I felt like we were leaving friends behind!  

I do have to give a plug to Costco Travel for offering the package that included our stay at Hotel 41. Every part of our package was perfect, from the private car transfer to and from Heathrow, to the hotel, to the cream tea, the full English breakfast daily and the 3 course dinner. The price was incredible for everything that our package included!  We had a ""trip of a lifetime experience"" thanks to Costco Travel. 

We LOVED Hotel 41!  We are considering another trip to London next year and would not consider staying anywhere else.  In fact, we are already excited just thinking about the prospect!  Hotel 41 set a standard against which all of our future hotel stays will be measured.  I can pretty safely say that none will be as magnificent, relaxing or as memorable as the stay we had at Hotel 41. We will remember our stay here for the rest of our lives.  Many, many thanks to the Hotel 41 staff for making our stay such an incredible experience.",5,2011,05,21
137,Exemplary Service!,"I was working in the lobby trying to get ready for a big meeting and needed some help with the logistics of my meeting. Nikhil Mulane, one of the night managers went out of his way to help me out. I know very little about London and I know that Nikhil had other things to do, but he made sure that I was completely comfortable with my transportation and scheduling for my presentation.

I spend a fair amount of time on the road and I also get to see a lot of hotel employees who do a very good job serving guests - Nikhil is better than good, he is absolutely EXEMPLARY - someone who truly understands what a guest is, what customer satisfaction is, and was able to help out so enthusiastically. 

Many thanks to Hadi and Mao the other two night people - these guys really came through.",4,2011,05,18
137,Would love to stay here again,"Excellent staff - very friendly and efficient. 
Great location. 
Lovely room.",5,2011,05,17
137,It's so good to return,"Our monthly trip to London and back to 41 for some R&R.  We walk the short distance from Victoria Station and arrive at the discreet entrance to take the private lift to the fifth floor where only residents may enter.  A swift check in with welcoming smiles while we sip a complimentary glass of champagne (or whatever you wish) with luxury nibbles. There are lots more to choose from yourself at the bar, with luxury chocolate and other sweets if you prefer.  We sink into the settee and smile.  Half an hour later, we are ready to face the world again, and we go off to our room to freshen up prior to our business meeting.  We have chosen 01 this time, which is a lovely room looking out over the Royal Mews, with opening windows or a/c - whichever you prefer, and a working fireplace for colder weather.  The bed is huge and the linen crisp.  Everything feels just right.  Returning from our meeting, we kick off our shoes and watch an inhouse movie with room service bringing us a welcome pot of tea.  We shower, using the lovely Penhaligon toiletries, and go back to the club room for a pre-dinner drink.  Members of staff who have not already seen us come over to welcome us back, and we enjoy complimentary canapes before departing for the restaurant.   Back again to 41, our London home, and we kick off our shoes and sit awhile before bed.  A gentle sleep, and then a glorious breakfast - our choice is fresh fruit then superb eggs.  Another meeting in their extremely comfortable ""board room"" and then we depart for the station and home.  Already booked for next month, and we know exactly what to expect - swift, discreet and friendly service in lovely surroundings.  Thank you 41, for being there for me.  It's not just about five star and  value for money.  It's about feeling good.",5,2011,05,14
137,Perfect Location,"What a treart to stay at Hotel 41! The location of the property is excellent, opposite the Royal Mews and next to Victoria Station. The rooms are beautifully decorated and they have a bath as well as a shower which is rare in London! Great executive lounge with the plunder the pantry each night which has chocolate dipped strawberries, meats and cheeses and billtong. They selected some movies for us to watch and they were the perfect combination. Thank you 41 for such a memorable stay!!!",5,2011,05,11
137,Exquisite!!,"After reading the fantastic reviews on Trip Advisor, we were excited for our stay at the Hotel 41 and it did not disappoint.  Even before we arrived, the service was superior.  The hotel itself is small, elegant and charming and the staff is first class.  Service is impeccable without being overly intrusive or contrived.  The staff arranged a car service for the day to take us to Silverstone racetrack in Northampton, and the driver was delightful.  The staff at the hotel even packed us a takeaway lunch for our day trip.  

We reserved the two-story Conservatory Suite for a special occasion, and although pricey, it is one of those special experiences we will never forget.  The glass ceiling with retractable shades was so unique, and simply magnificent.  We loved the extras too, including the chocolates and champagne.  It was the perfect luxury suite, very romantic, truly one of a kind.   

In sum, our experience at the Hotel 41 was exceptional from start to finish, and we will most certainly be staying there again on our next visit to London.",5,2011,05,03
137,Treated like Royalty,"My wife and I have just returned from 13 days in London at Hotel 41, our second stay at this fine Hotel.  The service and attention we received from the staff at 41 was again the best, by far, that we have experienced anywhere in the world.  Each member of staff we encountered was impeccably dressed, greeted us by name, with a smile and kind words - every time!  Being welcomed for breakfast in the beautiful lounge each morning by several members of staff, each of whom knew our surname (and by day 2 also your food and beverage preferences) was wonderful.  The staff are very genuine and obviously share the hotel's commitment to impeccable, professional service, because the high standard was consistent throughout, including reception, lounge service, food preparation and housekeeping, which unfailingly and discreetly slipped in while we are at dinner each evening for turn-down service, including soft music, bottled water with glasses on the bedside and slippers.  We once returned from a day of site-seeing to an unexpected and very welcomed bottle of champagne on ice!

Entering Hotel 41 is like entering a fine private club where you are respected members.  No bustling lobby or reception desk line-up.  Staff at the front door welcomed us with a smile and quickly offered assistance.  Later in the evening, we used our room key to access the hotel, as if it were your private residence.  We were escorted upon arrival to the library/lounge on the fifth floor where we were invited to be seated at a desk and offered a glass of champagne while the paperwork was efficiently sorted.

The corridors and the library/lounge are wood paneled and the our room was beautifully finished in a black and white and was very comfortable.

The real hallmark of 41 however is the discreet, attentive and very professional service. We can't say enough good things about the people that made our experience of Hotel 41 so special .  

We felt like royalty.",5,2011,04,30
137,Hotel 41 is like coming home!,"Having been lucky enough to stay in many fine hotels in the UK, I can honestly say that Hotel 41 is the best of all our experiences.  The location is great for sightseeing and transportation and yet at the same time, it is an intimate hotel where the  comfort of the guests is upmost in the minds of the staff.  THe hotel itself is beautifully furnished and attended with large bedrooms and the most heavenly bedding. Each morning one awakens completely rested after sleeping on a cloud.

But the most outstanding recommendation for Hotel 41 is the staff. Guests are greeted and cared for like family. No request is too small for prompt , courteous attention. The food is not only delicious, but  with a bonus of snacks available twenty-four hours a day. Hotel 41 is like coming home after a long trip. A 100% wonderful memory!!!",5,2011,04,30
137,Excellent from the first step into Hotel 41,"I rarely give a very high rate review of a hotel, but i have to admit Hotel 41 is flawless.
1. They make connection to their guests (trying to remembering guest's name for example).  They always try to give answer for every question you asked (and you know sometimes tourist have questions that quite unusual) but just see them trying hard for you make you feel that they are serving you.
2. I love the interior, executive lounge, the room have all everythings you need.
3. very safe surroundings and very strategic location
4. We all love the green doorman, he just so nice and very helpful to everyone.  He is like the icon model of Rubens and 41 (they are in the same group).

I booked Hotel 41 for 2 nights and 3 nights @ one of the top hotel in South Kensington which i rather stay my 5 nights at Hotel 41.

Next time i go to London, Hotel 41 or Rubens (depends on the budget) is definitely my choice",5,2011,04,29
137,"Fantastic hotel, tipical English! A must go in London!","I really enjoyed this marvellous hotel. Room rate are quite expensive but what a marvellous experience and rooms with sweet deco! Located at 250 meters from Buckingham Palace and 5 min Taxi to the best French Restaurant in London: La Poule au Pot on Ebury Street!

Can only recommend it!

PS: Ruben's hotel next door is the same company. There are some nice rooms also at a lower level but is a good alternative. If you go there ask for the renovated room especillay the London Style one!",5,2011,04,20
137,Remains First Class in every way,"We returned here for my birthday trip to the city.  We have stayed before and know full well we will be welcomed with a smile.  From the minute the door is opened for you, you can relax
take a deep breath and just chill.  The room was lovely, nice large bathroom, comfy bed and every amenity.  In the lounge area the service is impeccable as always.  Any help you need it is there and you are served with professionalism and politeness.  We were upgraded on our last night to a junior suite......wow, so nice we booked one for our next overnighter before going to Heathrow.

Do not hesitate to stay here, you will be hooked and the location is fantastic across the road from Her Majesties pad.

Thanks to the team for once again not dissapointing.",5,2011,04,19
137,First class and consistant,"This was our 3rd stay at the hotel, it is now the only place i would consider staying at while in London as it never dissapoints, staff excellent and servce / food first class, it may cost more than other good hotels but it is worth it as it makes the break for us, its a haven in a very busy city. Well done to the management and staff, you have it right.",5,2011,04,17
137,Perfect stay,"Excellent location, lovely staff, very comfortable rooms. Very good value for London. We'll be back.",5,2011,04,13
137,An incredible experience,"I recently travelled to London with my husband and chose to stay in the Hotel 41 for 3 days. We had an amazing time!! The attention that we received was absolutely incredible. The staff was very friendly and cordial.Always willing to make suggestions. The rooms were very comfortable and beautiful. As for the location, it would be hard to ask for anything better. There are so many attractions  that are within walking distance; and when you need a taxi, they are readily available.",5,2011,04,10
137,Best service ever!,"My wife and I stayed here for a week over spring break with our two college age daughters, in two rooms.  Without question we received the best service we have received in any hotel in our lives and we have stayed in some very fine hotels that are much more expensive than 41.  Every staff member seemed to look for ways to please.  It was such a joy to spend time in the lounge where we had superb breakfasts every morning (the breakfasts came with the room rate and included choices like Eggs Benedict, Eggs Royale, Kippers and Haddock in addition to an excellent full English and Continental).  And the coffee was to die for, coming in French Press, insulated pitchers that the staff would brew and refill at the drop of a hat! 

The rooms were immaculately clean, quiet, with excellent beds and decorated in exquisite black and white with what appeared to be original framed caricatures on the walls.  I like to listen to music in a hotel room and  was impressed that I could do so in three different ways:  alarm radio next to the bed,  a Bose dock for ipods and a 4- speaker surround sound connected to the TV-dvd system.  And the location isn't bad.....right across the street from the Royal mews of Buckingham Palace!  

When we return to London, 41 will definitely be where we stay!",5,2011,03,29
137,We can now stop looking for the best hotel in London!,"Every time i travel to London I look to find a good hotel, thankfully i stumbled across the Hotel 41!  We were so well looked after and all the staff were amazing.  With all rooms full we never heard any noise from any guests and would occasionally see other guests in the executive lounge.  We felt like we were staying at a friends house with how well we were looked after.  Nothing seemed like too much trouble and the complimentary drinks were always appreciated.  The 'raid the pantry' idea was genius and we made much use of it.  

If i was going to be overly critical it was a shame that there was no separate shower, but this did not detract from the fantastic time we had at this hotel",5,2011,03,27
137,Whats gone wrong ?,"Regular visitor and always rated highly.  Room not overly clean (I had to re-clean bathroom); car booked to take me to LHR, confirmed at checkin but didnt turn up and front desk seem dis-interested so booked a quick addi lee.  I would return to see if it was a one off but the previous staff seem to have changed and no longer did I no longer felt like a valued returning guest (last stay in Feb 2011)",3,2011,03,27
137,A perfect wedding anniversary,"I decided to book this hotel after reading tripadvisor comments and I am so happy I did it. The staff was great and helpful since the moment of the booking. I sent a lot of email to the resident manager, Mrs Antoinette Bromfield, asking for tickets, restaurant, theatres and she was very helpful and kind even if I changed my mind and programs so many times! The hotel is very small but I didn't find the room was tiny, we put our luggages in the closet, after hanging the clothes and there was plenty of room left. The room was great, we had champagne as welcome gift and turnover everynight with the fireplace on. We spent most of the time visiting the city so we couldn't taste the menu or the pantry snacks but have to say the breakfast was nice even if we are not used to salty food in the morning anh had only tea, toasts, pancakes and brioches. The juices were freshly made and organic and they also tried to accomodate every request for particular teas. Every single member of the staff was great and they made us feel pampered from the moment we arrived 'till our departure. I really like the fact they always remember your name and tastes! The location is superb, walking distance from every important monument and from victoria tube station. If you wanna feel spoiled...go there, you will love it!! Obviously it is not a budget hotel but for the service they offered it was the right price!",5,2011,03,21
137,"The best hotel, bar none","Hotel 41 came highly recommended, and after staying there, even exceeding my expectations. 
We were kindly greeted with a glass of champagne while we checked in, and staff member ""lilo"" (Li Long) explained we should consider the hotel ""our home""... He couldn't be more right, all staff members have an extremely cheerful disposition, constantly look after you without interfering too much, there's really not a single thing wrong in the entire hotel, the food, or the staff.
When you decide to go out to eat, please do ask the hotel to make reservations for you. Even if you know where you're going, the reservation by 41 gets you some of the best tables in the house.
I usually don't like hotels, but this time, we were sorry to leave. Definately will be back soon !",5,2011,03,15
137,Speechless after an absolute breathtaking experience..,We stayed at 41 during the Festive Season last year and were blown away by the overall experience. The staff were impeccable and the hotel itself looked fab! We don't know what to say other than to highly recommend this hotel to each and everyone looking for the very best.,5,2011,03,14
137,Nice atmosphere,"Everything was great from A to Z.  I liked best the shower, heated bars in the bathroom for drying towels and cloths.  

Next to Buckingham Palace.

its next to Rubens Hotels, but the this hotel is actually a one floor hotel part of the same building of Rubens hotel.

I wish price would drop a bit.",5,2011,03,10
137,"Hotel 41 is the reason to go to London, the city is just a bonus","Unfortunately I haven't stayed in this hotel since 2009 as I only got day trips to London, but now I returned and after a 11 hours meeting I just returned and a coke on ice with fruit was waiting for me in the room and the fireplace was lit - this really, really saved my day. I didn't order it, they just knew my preferences from my last stay almost 2 years ago.

This is really the essence of the Hotel 41 - excellent service no matter what you compare it to. The rooms are very nice, the food is great - but at the end of the day you will remember Hotel 41 for their service.

I'm now looking for an excuse to return to London asap.",5,2011,03,10
137,The best hotel in London,I have been traveling to London for work for many years and I have stayed at London's finest hotels.  This was my first stay at this hotel and it is simply the best hotel in London.  My partner came on this business trip with me and has been raving about how wonderful everything was since we got back.  My thanks to the incredible staff.,5,2011,03,07
137,A night of pure luxury,"This hotel is amazing!!! There is no other way to describe it.  An absolute gem, hidden away from the hustle and bustle of Victoria station and its surrounds.  Service is perfection, food is to die for and the rooms are immaculate and classy.  Make sure you take full advantage of their ""plunder the pantry"" hours as its a lovely added treat, all included in your bill...and the range of food and drink is spectacular.  Nothing but good things to say about 41.  Would definitely (and am planning to) go back.",5,2011,03,01
137,It's five stars all the way,"Stopped here with my wife for her 40th birthday, following a search on here for the top London hotel. In spite of reservations that any hotel could possibly be this good, and that maybe some had exaggerated their reviews, I could not have been more pleasantly surprised. First class service all the way, with pleasant staff who make it their business to make you feel most welcome, in an environment that is warm and relaxing, with good food and zero attitude. We stayed for two nights, and I can honestly say that they have been the best two nights I have spent anywhere. I will recommend this hotel to anybody looking for the best available.",5,2011,02,27
137,Unique Hotel with style & top notch service!,"We recently stayed here after reading all the positive reviews. The hotel has a class of its own. A very intimate hotel more like a private club where you can escape from the hustle & bustle of the city! Booked from tigerhotels.co.uk. The staff & service were excellent and to the point. Our room was unique in style and had all the facilities. The hotel is centrally located so all attractions were easily reachable. We enjoyed breakfast in the mornings which was delicious and filling. All in all we had a great time at this hotel where we made friends with the other guest, sight seeing, service and facilities was all memorable!",5,2011,02,25
137,Luxury and exceptional service in a brilliant location!,What a find! Amazing location- we even saw the Queen being driven past! The staff could not have been more helpful. The decor was stunning and the bed was luxurious and the most comfortable I've ever experienced. The breakfast was outstanding. We felt really special and 'looked after' which was a real surprise in the centre of London!,5,2011,02,25
137,Not your average hotel,"Let me start by saying: 41 is not a hotel. It's a home away from home.  A colleague recommended this place to me, and it's easy to see why 41 is the Number 1 hotel on TripAdvisor. The facilities, while giving a homely and comforting feel, aren't take-your-breath-away modern and state-of-the-art, however it's the service and personality of the place which charms. 

The exclusive feel is begun with the hallway with a concierge at a desk in the vestibule. The staff were welcoming and organised for the receptionist to accompany me up to the fifth floor, where the rooms are situated. My luggage was taken care of and placed in my room ready for me, after I had checked in with reception, in the Executive Lounge. The staff were pleased to offer me a drink on my arrival.

Throughout my stay here, nothing ever seemed to be too much trouble for the staff. At times, there were more staff in the Executive Lounge than there were guests! owing to the fact that reception and food/beverage were in the same area. The waiter was keen to ensure we had all we needed, and kept and eye on things, however didn't keep annoying us to see if we were alright - this is very important. A lot of places seem to think that good customer service is asking if we need anything every five minutes. There were enough staff to ensure every need was met, however weren't overbearing or made you feel uncomfortable. A special effort was made by the staff to remember you personally, so that transactions such as food/beverage, and check-out were seamless. 

The lounge itself was rather nice, as prospective guests can see from the pictures on the website. There were a few tables and couches, on two levels, spacious enough to spread out, but not too large as to make you feel isolated. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, just what I needed after a long day at work! One of the most notable things was that after my long day, I could relax in the lounge, enjoy a nice cup of tea or a martini with a few extras like little bites, olives, dips, popcorn(!) etc., just as I would at home, without any fuss from the staff, and without making it feel like a restaurant or bar. ""Plunder the Pantry"" as they deem it, was a quaint selection of cheese and biscuits, breads and spreads, and cold dishes, such as fruit salad, meats, salmon, and an African version of jerky. 

As for the room, it was what I expected, with a small vestibule with a desk, wardrobes, etc., opening onto the spacious bedroom with large bed and open fireplace. There was ample lighting which could be set on or off for different areas of the room, and the black and white colour scheme made the place look bright and sharp. The bathroom had a large bath, enough sink space for one person, and a separate shower, as well as the toilet. Hot water was ample and there was enough light in there as well. The features in the room and bathroom weren't amazingly outstanding, however they met Five Star expectations. 

Turndown was early (usually before 7pm) and included the room lighting set to a relaxing level, some light music on, the fireplace lit, and a candle adorning the bathroom. Apart from a few housekeeping 'oversights' which were corrected after a call to reception, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay, and look forward to returning soon when work or leisure brings me to London.",5,2011,02,24
137,Quite simply the best hotel I've ever visited,"The key strengths of this hotel are:
1. Excellent decor, the most beautiful interior decor I've seen in a hotel
2. Excellent service, all staff remembered our names and that we were vegetarian. I believe there isa  staff:guest ratio of 2:1. 
3. Excellent extras, free snacks are offered including a fantastic 'plunder the pantry' in the evening.
4. Excellent facilities, our room had every facility imaginable: giant TV, 2 bathrooms, jacuzi bath, windows in the ceiling to let in extra light...the list goes on.",5,2011,02,08
137,"Fabulous, would stay again!","All I can say is that I agree with the previous comments.  The hotel is just fabulous, everything from the beautiful rooms to the facilities.

I travel world wide for work and stay in a variety of hotels, I would definitely stay again and have no hesitation to recommend to my clients, colleagues and friends.",5,2011,02,03
137,Second visit - still the best,"Our second visit to 41 was every bit as good as the first.
Once again the service provided by the staff is the best ever. You can't help but be in a good mood once you're inside the doors of 41.
This time we had dinner in the Library restaurant included in our deal, the restaurant is in the adjacent Rubens Hotel and was incredibly good value for excellent food and wine.
Breakfast on both mornings was extremely good, we weren't rushed even though we turned up at 10:30 each morning and of course everything was cooked to order and brought to our table.
The highlight is ending the evening in the lounge, picking at canapés, cheese and meats.
Hotels don't get any better than this. It's like staying with friends.",5,2011,02,01
137,One of the best hotels in the world.,"Arrived at Hotel 41 unplanned and with no booking, this was no problem for the staff who were courteous and helpful. someone escorted me to the lounge where i was given a coffee whilst my room was prepared. After about 10 mins someone came back and showed me to my room. I was impressed that they didn't mention that i arrived at 10 in the morning because usually check in is at 2. 

My room when i got it was absolutely spotlessly clean and well maintained with a large and very comfortable bed. The black and white theme to the rooms is nice and should appeal to everyone. Turn-down service was performed very well and the staff waited until they saw you leave to do it so that they weren't in your way. When i came back to the room there was an ice bucket and cold water next to my bed.

The room service food and bar food is excellent if maybe a little over priced. The lounge is a nice place to be especially in winter  when they have a fire going, its very English, very comfortable and like everywhere else in the hotel spotlessly clean. The staff are all very polite and address you by your name and nothing is to much effort for them to do anytime of the day. Good business facilities upstairs with fast wireless internet everywhere in the hotel.

The location is good, just around the corner from Victoria train station and just down the road from Buckingham Palace which is well worth a walk up to at night. The staff were also helpful in organizing a taxi and bringing my bags down and loading them up in the car.

All in all a very very good hotel, if your looking for a place in London of this price, Hotel 41 is the only choice.",5,2011,01,30
137,perfect birthday gift,"I had a little difficulty finding the hotel at first, but when I finally did, i was pleasantly surprised. The staff were polite and approachable and check-in was more than I expected from a five star hotel. I had briefly mentioned that it was my birhtday, so I was pleasantly surprised to find a birthday cake in my room, when I returned from a shopping trip. The service was excellent and the standard of the room the same.

It is around the corner from Victoria station, so is easy to get to and there areplenty of shops and restaurants near by.

There wasn't much to complain about, it was a shame that as I was only there for one night, I was unable to take advantage of the ""plunder the pantry"" service.

 I would deffinately reccomend the hotel, and I look forward to staying there again.",5,2011,01,25
137,Excellent,"I stayed here to do a Jewellery Product Launch and used one of their suites. It was very nice, could not fault it in any way at all. Very efficient friendly staff. I had previously tried to book the Dorchester and I'm glad I gave the Dorchester a miss.

I especially liked the executive lounge which was a wonderful little haven after a busy day or two - perfect to kick back with a bottle of wine and either a book or a laptop (I was working but that didn't stop me having a bottle or two!). They have decent fast wi fi which is useful and included in the rate.

When I arrived I was offered use of the boardroom for meetings if I needed it and although we did the product launch in the suite the boardroom could have been extremely useful for meetings (it was free of charge). If you need a meeting room in London a great place to have one! Not sure if its always free though - you might want to ring them to check.

In conclusion, very nice, very expensive but worth it!",5,2011,01,25
137,100% perfect.,"This was meant to be !! We were originally booked into another Hotel a few minutes away, however after looking at this site decided to cancel it!! Thank goodness.  Hotel 41 was everything we expected and more.  The service was impeccable, staff very friendly and helpful and not over the top. Lovely room, fantastic food AMAZING PLACE . STAY HERE YOU WONT REGRET IT !! Will return when my lovely friend offers to have my children again !!",5,2011,01,23
137,Easy to understand why it's no1 in trip advisor in London - SUPERB!,"We stayed at the hotel for 1 night on 8th January 2011. From the moment we arrived, we were spoilt! What can I say? Location: 3 mins walk from Victoria station. Greeted warmly, intimate check in area, staff could not have been nicer, hotel has an intimate feel, loved the pantry. Our room (a junior suite) was amazing - it had its own mini lounge, bed was super comfy, shower was amazing with it's huge shower head. Even the basket of fruit was amazing!
We certainly did not have any complaints. I even emailed the hotel to thank them for their service and they replied with a personal email 24 hours later.
I would definately like to stay there again and would recommend to everyone.",5,2011,01,19
137,Any excuse to go back please!,"Excellent, excellent, excellent. We will be back - service absolutely first class - they really do understand what service is here - they are way ahead of most if not all other hotels. Room, beautiful, smart, clean and comfortable. Tiny glitch with out hot water in the evening but soon remedied and a bottle of Laurent Perrier arrived by way of an apology. Can't really ask for much more than that. Amazing staff, outstanding concierge, lovely breakfast.  Totally perfect start to our honeymoon and within easy reach of Heathrow for our departure. We will definitely be looking for a reason to go back to 41.",5,2011,01,17
137,Simply The Best,"My partner and i actually changed our original booking in another hotel to Hotel 41 based on the reviews from trip advisor. We were burnt badly once before in London and did not want a repeat of that. Every good word written about this hotel on this site is 100% accurate. We have stayed in many beautiful hotels around the world including 4 Seasons Costa Rica and to say that Hotel 41 exceeded our expectations is an understatement. The key to an excellent hotel is simply good service and attention to detail, of which Hotel 41 has both. The cost was very reasonable for what we had in return, outstanding service, a cake waiting in our room to mark our anniversary, champagne on arrival the list goes on... My favourite would have to be the one button on the phone in the room which pretty much sums up this hotel- not a button for every issue but simply one button with ""Whatever, Whenever"" which is exactly what we got. As an executive traveller with seasoned experience I would highly recommend this hotel and I hope the staff at Hotel 41 read this comment as it is a testament to their exceptional service and standards.",5,2011,01,16
137,Another great stay at 41 Hotel,"We booked last minute (like an hour before arrival !) as we couldn't face a packed M25 back from a trip to Gatwick. They handled everything beautifully and in particular we rated the Argentinian Manager who recommended Gaucho for steak. The place looked gorgeous for Xmas with lots of lovely free sweet treats..we love this place, it's so intimate compared to larger 5 star hotels.

Keep on doing what you're doing !

137,Absolutely Fantastic!,"The trip on the 27th December 2010 was a Christmas present for my girlfirend with a twist.  I proposed to her.  Now my fiancee.
The hotel was just the perfect place.  It has style, luxury, quality, ambience, great position but most importantly, the best most attentive staff that I have ever experienced without being intrusive.
I name only the manager, Andrew, however I refer to all the staff as well.  They were excellent and could not have done enough.  Andrew himself ensured my evening went superbly without a glitch and for that I am grateful.
I could go on and on however I will leave everyone else to make their own judgement.  All I will say is, ""you won't regret it!"".",5,2011,01,04
137,Best hotel of our trip,This hotel lived up to all the great reviews and more. The staff were fabulous. Nothing was too much trouble. The lounge was really homely and we spent a number of hours just sat by the fire. The attention to detail was also very good - something you don't find in a larger hotel.,5,2011,01,02
137,An original concept hotel which proved the perfect place to see in the New Year.,"There is much to recommend this hotel; in particular the fact that in the heart of London there is a fifth floor bijoux hotel situated within a hotel which often felt like a home from home. Throughout, the decor is stylish and elegant; the black and white theme was far from cold or overly-masculine. Our room was snug but cosy and was equipped with everything the discerning individual or couple on either business or leisure would want/need. As most reviewers have noted, the two key selling points of this hotel are the attentive, courteous staff who are efficient and willing to 'go the extra mile' and the seemingly endless supply of complimentary food and drink. The invitation to raid the pantry is a case in point, but I would not advise you to see this as an alternative to a full meal as we had thought. Unless, of course, you really do want a hunk of cheese, bread and cold meats for dinner. Having said that the lounge in which many of these freebies were to be found is a wonderful place in which to hole up. There are not many 'public' spaces in a hotel which manage to feel both warm and homely.
Any other quibbles are just that; the tv did not work in the bathroom but then who is watching tv in the bathroom? 
So, would I recommend this to a friend? Very much so and I have done so on a number of occasions already! Will we be going back? I hope so, if only because we are unlikely to find a similar hotel in London. 
Thank you Hotel 41, and my partner, for a wonderful place in which to see in the New Year.",5,2011,01,02
137,"Beautiful, unique, cosy, excellent staff.","I was taken here by my mother for one night as a birthday present - the staff knew this, but my mother had not suggested the stunning birthday cake in our room on arrival, chocolates or drinks; all complimentary. After noshing the scrummy cake, we went to the glamorous lounge and were served drinks by a friendly impeccably dressed waiter. The staff on arrival to the front desk (once you're on the top floor of the building and in the Hotel 41, not the doorman on the ground floor who was very unhelpful and unfriendly) were lovely! So helpful, anything we wanted! We even rang for them to bring a Nintendo Wii up to the room at about 11pm which was ""no trouble at all"". The shower was huge, the shower head was lovely, and lovely hot water. The decor throughout the hotel is stunning, with every attention to detail, however the best bit of the entire trip was the GIGANTIC bed. I kid you not, 4 people could have slept in its lovely ironed, smooth,  bright white egyptian cotton sheets that were heavy with a beautiful duvet. Gorgeous firm pillows, and so warm. I would describe it as cosy but roomy, which does seem like an oximoron, but you feel snug, whilst having plenty of space. I think this is because of the low ceilings. It's lovely to see a hotel that does go the extra 10 miles, and please, anyone that goes to this beautiful boutique hotel, Plunder their Pantry!",5,2011,01,01
137,We loved this hotel!,"My daughter and I stayed at Hotel 41 for two nights on a trip to London last July.  We wish we could have stayed longer and will definately stay here when we return.  The hotel is small, elegant and specializes in service.  The staff is amazing.  The rooms are typically small for a London hotel but very well appointed.  The lobby is intimate and comfortable and we enjoyed the complimentary food provided as a light snack.  The location is good, in a nice section of the city.",5,2010,12,20
137,"Not as advertised, a bit dissapointed","We stayed two nights in December and must say that this was not up to par. We chose this hotel because it promised that intimate feeling with very attentive staff, but we found the staff to be anything but. 

Firstly: The hotel is quite beautiful and has some great fixtures. The lobby is very nice, the room all over good and so was the turndown service at night. We also got some good advice on places to visit during check in. 

But we had several problems:
Firstly the staff could not remember us and we were constantly asked for our room number. In a hotel like this I expect the staff to remember me. I had to ask the staff to exchange the cheese on the breakfast buffet because it was old and dry and sweaty.  Also I observed staff touch the bread with dirty hands (so disgusting!). When we were showed around the room lots of different aspect were left unmentioned (like how to turn the fireplace off - so I had to call reception in the middle of the night for help!). We wanted pancakes for breakfast - it took them 10 minutes to tell us that they did not have pancakes (dear chef: Pancakes are made with flour, egg, salt, butter and some milk. I'd be happy to teach you. It's simple - really...) Also there were no soy milk and one day no english breakfast. To top it off the shower smelled funky and there were bulges in the carpet. 

I believe this hotel has seen both better days and better staff. Too bad - I really wanted to like this hotel, but it's just average. Pricy average.",3,2010,12,20
137,One Word Unbelievable,One of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to stay in London. It has the opulence of a any of the top marques in London coupled with the intimacy of a private members club. Go and stay. I cannot rate this hotel enough.,5,2010,12,14
137,World Class Hotel and Staff,If you want to be pampered then stay at this hotel.  They go out of their way to make sure you are treated like royalty.  The customer service they give is truly world class.  This hotel is worth every pound you will spend.  The location is excpetional and is within walking distance of most places you will want to visit.  We would love to go back to London and when we do we will stay at this hotel!,5,2010,12,12
137,"Superb service, beautiful hotel","Went to London to celebrate my husband's birthday, and selected this hotel based on the promising reviews on this site. It certainly met and exceeded our expectations! From start to finish, everything was beyond our dreams! Extremely friendly staff, who pampered us during our whole stay. Champagne at check-in, beautiful room with lovely fireplace, the lounge area in which you could spend hours just enjoying the atmosphere. Yummy birthday cake as a surprise waiting in our room. 
On our second night we were a bit tired from shopping all day. The staff inquired about what we were up to for the evening, and when we confessed we did not have any plans, they offered us a choice of DVD film and freshly made popcorn and snacks, and we ended up having a really cosy movie night at our room. On our last day, our flight did not leave until 6pm, but we were welcome to return to the lounge after a last shopping tour, despite having already checked out. Unfortunately, my husband suffered from a severe headache, but was offered a courtesy room to have a lie-down - totally unexpected but very much welcomed. 
All in all, those small touches made us feel like royalties. Our needs were anticipated and taken care of before we had even discovered them ourselves! Can't wait to return, just have to make up a reason to take the trip...",5,2010,12,11
137,Brilliant Experience!,"It did exceed all expectations! 41 is a stunning hotel deeped in the most charming English mood. A true example of what British style can give at its best and staff has been very helpful, professional. Location is great as well. Hotel is just behind Buckingham Palace. I would definitely come back in this hotel.",5,2010,12,11
137,"Fantastic service, great location and good value","We stayed four days in 41, on a combined business and pleasure trip to London. The service was really astonishing, from the moment we arrived until we left. There was not a thing they could not help with. The General Manager greeted us with champagne, and help us find an excellent ""gastro-pub"" for a late lunch right after arrival.  I should also mention the excellent follow-up prior to arrival, with several emails asking if we wanted any transport, bookings or items for our room.  We didn't book any transfer, since the hotel is just a few blocks from Victoria Station where the Gatwick Express arrives.

The hotel is small, located on the fith floor, with a relatively modest street access. On that fith floor, you feel like you are in an old luxury London club.  Everything is centered around a small, but very cosy, executive lounge, where the front desk is also.  It's furnished in a colonial library style, with dark wood, fire place and the perfrect place for afternoon tea.  All the meals are also served here, but we only had breakfast in the hotel.  The breakfast was great.  There is also a small self-serve bar, where you simply note in a book the drinks you take.  Wifi everywhere is in my view a necessity these days, and that worked flawlessly on all our devices.

If you are disabled, ot travel with several kids, I probably wouldn't recommend this hotel, since there are many narrow corridors to navigate.  Also, the rooms are not big, but more it was big enough for us.  Flatscreen TV (also in the bathroom) and a Bose iPod dock was the little extra we really liked. 

The location is also great, right by Victoria Station and Underground, and, of course, the hotel is right behind Buckingham Palace.  We found it great for shopping (being right between Harrods and Sloane Street in one direction, and Oxford Street in the other  one.  Both tube and taxis were convenient, and nothing felt far away.  Only two tube stops to Oxford Circus.

As an extra, visit the Royal Mews right across the street from the hotel.  This is the Queen's stables, where all the fantastic carrieges are kept, as well as the royal Rolls Royce and Bentleys.  They have a nice visitor program.

To sum up, we knew Hotel 41 had great reviews, but they still surprised us positively.  I would especially not the great service, and the price is competitive compared to other 5-star hotels.  If you want a small, cosy, boutique style hotel, with excellent personal service, I wouldn't hestiate to choose this place.",5,2010,12,09
137,Magical,"My wife and I spent oir 20 th anniversary at the 41 Hotel in London. It EXCEEDED all expectations for a 5 star hotel. Check-in was by the hotel manager who personally settled us in in (early) and arranged for theater tickets, two choice restaurants (both walking distance) and ""touched base"" daily. Every employee was professional, courteous and attentive- yet in an infomral manner, not at all supercilious or cloying. On leaving in the morning, the person at the desk(usually Marie)  made sure we had an umbrella (if indicated), directions or would hail a cab.  I have never stayed at a hotel with an endless supply of hot water,a  most welcome deep soak at the end of the day.  One night we were surprised with a romantic turndown, rose petals everywhere and scented candles lighting the room. I would return here in a heart beat.  Located just across from the Mews and walking distance to Buckkngham Palace, Westminster Abbey & Cathedral, Parliment., etc. as well as nearby Victoria Station. Try as I might, I could not find a single thing to criticize.  Late at night, they have an open ""honor"" bar with a variety of goodies- fill your plate and the attendant insists on carrying it back to your room.  Worth every penny (or, I guess, shilling).",5,2010,11,24
137,Good Hotel but not No.1,"Booked the hotel as a birthday treat for my wife and as it was no.1 on Trip Advisor I thought they'd be no better place to go.  We are fortunate to have stayed in some fantastic hotels throughout the world and whilst this is a good hotel, I do not feel it is worth the money we paid.  The room, whilst comfortable, was a little on the small side and the TV reception was not great (a small point I know but everything should be spot on at this price).  The biggest issue was lack of wardrobe space.  We were there for 4 nights and there is simply nowhere near enough space to hang shirts, jackets, trousers, blouses, dresses etc for this duration of stay.  Half of the wardrobe is taken up by the safe and and some drawers and at the back of the other half of the wardrobe is the ironing board which does not leave much room to hang clothes.  The bathroom was very small and the bath extremely narrow.

Another issue I had was a slight communcation problem with the staff.  I do not consider myself to have a strong accent but a number of them appeared to have difficulty understanding my requests.  Aside from that issue though the staff were great and are, without doubt, the hotel's biggest asset. Very helpful and nothing was too much of a problem for them.

Beds are very comfortable and the hot water bottle a nice touch but for some reason we only got one and they switched which side this was on each night instead of just giving us one each!

We only ate once in the hotel and that was a full English breakfast.  It was tasty enough but not sure why I had to wait 30 minutes for it when there was only two other couples in the lounge.

Overall a good hotel, in a good location but perhaps not worth the money I paid.",4,2010,11,23
137,waow,"we have spent the week-end at hotel 41 and have been treated like kings, the hotel being on buckingham palace road, i guess it was just normal.
as we arrived, we were greeted by the head of reception, Antoinette, a very nice woman who spent a good ten minutes with us in the executive lounge to check us in and tell us a bit about the hotel. she also upgraded us to a junior suite (4119). 
the junior suite is a two floor room: on the lower floor you have a sofa, a TV, the mini bar and a fresh fruit basket was waiting for us. the upper floor is the room itself, very classy, just like the bathroom. the room was not huge but the size was more then decent considering it's London. the three windows let a lot of light inside the room.
they have a special button on the phone that they call the ""whatever, whenever button"", meaning that basically you can call them at any time for anything and they'll answer you.
 the common area is called the executive lounge and basically it's just like if you're a lord in your castle, the room is beautiful, the staff is taking good care of you, there's a fireplace and books and a free food bar and also the ""honesty bar"", the drinking bar where you write what you take yourself.
on the second day, which was my birthday, we received a bottle of wine and a birthday cake in the evening, which was very thoughtful from the hotel staff.
there were a couple of details in the room that did not match the rest of the hotel: one of the lamps was partly burnt and had not been replaced before our stay and one of the joints in the shower should have been replaced, the room was a bit noisy.
other than that, it was perfect from one end to the other and really you have this feeling when you're there that you're living the life of an englishman in a private club. the small size of the hotel, the location, the black and white decoration make the overall experience very particular. i would definitely recommend this hotel",5,2010,11,23
137,Deffinatly not number one!!!!!!,"Stayed here for a short week end in London We usually stay in the soho hotel but fancied a change and being so hotel 41 is the top rated hotel on trip advisor thought we would give it ago, firstly the rooms are tiny very well furnished but tiny with just normal double beds and a very small bathroom tv very small with just the normal uk channels very 3 star, service is ok but a bit over the top considering they couldn't even organise a daily newspaper even after the third request they should concentrate on the basics rather than trying to be something they clearly aren't . All in all not a bad hotel but certainly not 5 star and no where near as good as the soho (which has the location) we have also stayed in the Halkin which is close to hotel 41 but of much better standard.",3,2010,11,21
137,"Elegant private oasis; perfect blend of luxury, service, and comfort","I had a terrific stay at 41 in London. I felt like I'd been welcomed into one of the best private clubs, with every need attended to but without any stuffiness or pretension. The hotel has a private entrance that makes it feel like a real retreat; my room was beautifully appointed and very comfortable; and the executive lounge and its attentive staff provided the perfect place to relax and enjoy tea in the afternoon, canapes in the evening, or breakfast in the morning. I really felt that the staff wanted to help make my stay as perfect as possible. One of the best hotels I've stayed in.",5,2010,11,20
137,Great ambience,"Very nice english ambience. Very good stuff attendance at our every step, always very helpful. A bit cracking floor. Rooms cosy but not with very much space. Small shower. Very enjoyable stay.",5,2010,11,19
137,Just Perfect,"Everything I expected and more... 

From arrival to departure ... simply a perfect stay ...   The motto of the staff COULD BE 
 "" If the guest needs your attention, you know you have failed "" ...     At all times ... full attention... everybody just tried to make you feel comfortable. 

Especially the executive lounge is a chapter of its own.. Fine wines and  canapés.. The lounge feels cosy and with its mahogany panelling, glittering chandeliers, and glass roof, you find no better place to relax. 

Stayed in room 4111 which is absolutely recommendable. 

Going there again in February ... no doubt... 41 Hotel is my choice in London...",5,2010,11,18
137,Top class,Booked hotel 41 as a surprise for my now fiancé when we got engaged.. Have to day the was fantastic and everything we expected it would. As they could not accomadate us with an upgrade they had a complimentary bottle of champange on our arrival ( nice touch) could not reccomend it enough ,5,2010,11,14
137,"Very nice, good location, room's a little small","Highly luxurious, great service, and you will feel pampered here.  Our room was a bit small however, but still very nice.  Tub shower was also small and difficult to stand in for me (average height).  The bed was awesome though, as were the pillows.  The appointments were very nice.  Great concierge service and nice lounge.  You will love this hotel.",5,2010,11,12
137,great hotel,"We loved that hotel,good location with nice decorated rooms and perfect customer service.
Definetely i recommend.",5,2010,11,11
137,Just one detail spoiled our stay,"Wonderful service - the pleasant staff are spot-on paying attention to every detail.
Good location.
Room had rather too much furniture- chairs etc. which made less space - layout not particularly  good.
Loved the ambience of the lounge -like a gentleman's exclusive club!
A point against our whole stay was the fact that one wardrobe door  had the full length mirror inside, but the door would only open half way due to being blocked against the room door. As my daughter and I were attending a dinner at a very exclusive venue that evening, we wanted to make sure that we looked our best. The problem could easily be rectified by attaching the mirror to the opposite door which opened fully. Manager take note!",4,2010,11,08
137,Hotel 41 amazing,"If only every city had a Hotel 41 , travelling would be dream.
From the moment you step inside the personal service starts and continues throughout your stay. Luxurious rooms, we were upgraded to a junior suite WOW!!!
I would highly recommend to anyone",5,2010,11,08
137,Very nice boutique hotel in a good location,"We arrived very early after a 24 hour flight from Australia to a very welcoming and accommodating staff.  They greeted us with a glass of champagne and managed to have a room available for us at 8am.  They had emailed us a special request form a few days before our arrival, and it is worth while to return it because we had requested the early check-in which they had obviously read.  During our stay, the staff was always friendly and responsive to requests.  The location is very good, a few minutes walk to Victoria Train station and Underground and a few minutes to Buckingham Palace.  There are also lots of good restaurants close by.  The rooms are not huge, but are quite roomy, very clean, and well appointed.",5,2010,11,08
137,Children welcomed with open arms,"My wife and I won four nights at Hotel 41 in a competition but paid for an upgrade to take our two young children (boy 5 and girl 2).  The welcoming attitude to our children commenced immediately.  

We arrived mid-morning (before checkout) after a long flight and, naturally, our room was not yet ready.  But the staff welcomed us and our children, even providing two small teddy bears (for the children to keep) for them to play with.  When we returned to the hotel at the end of every day, we found the bears tucked up in the children's bed.  It's a silly, inconsequential thing but gives the feel of the staff's acceptance of and care for young families.

More generally, the hotel is beautifully presented (not exactly my style) and impeccably clean.  The staff are diligent, friendly and helpful.  In fact, after our trip, the manager of Hotel 41 wrote to us personally thanking us for filling in the feedback form and advising us of a change that would be making.  I have never had that happen before in all the holiday stays and business trips I have had over the years.

More generally, the location is fantastic: overlooking the Mews at Buckingham Palace, a stroll to Victoria Station and 30 metres to the stop for the big red double decker bus that tours the city (which, by the way, we loved!)",5,2010,11,02
137,Sets the bar high ..,"I absolutely loved this hotel. Having had a recent bad experience with a Parisian hotel and feeling that generally customer service was a dying art, this hotel made me smile and gave me faith that there are still companies out there willing to go the extra mile.

I didn't want to leave the lounge at any point during my 3 night stay and even bought a friend back to drink cocktails and hang out there in front of a roaring fire with every recent magazine edition imaginable to hand. 

The staff were above and beyond excellent. The rooms were elegant and every need was met. 

My only suggestion, which I was meant to leave with the front desk, but forgot, was the possible addition of mattress toppers on the beds and you can feel the 'nobbly button bits' of the mattress through the cotton sheets. If they did this I would probably sell my house and move there!",5,2010,11,02
137,If only there were a Hotel 41 in every city...one of the best hotel experiences to date,"The caliber of this hotel was evident even prior to arrival.  In making arrangements, the staff was friendly, helpful, provided guidance and were extremely organized. From the moment we arrived, we were treated like royalty!  The room was beautiful, with all the amenities. We ordered room service everyday and we had afternoon tea everyday in the study next to the fireplace. It just had a really quaint and elegant feel and an outstanding location.  The service was impeccable! Julian Dorien (who works there) was helpful, attentive and able to respond to our questions (where to go? what to do? how to travel? etc.) and whenever we requested anything -- it would be done for us immediately (when we needed more coathangers, had questions about the internet, forgot to order something for breakfast). I can honestly say that I recommend this hotel more than any others in which I have stayed (and I've travelled quite a bit)  Just looking for an opportunity to return!",5,2010,11,01
137,Won't stay anywhere else in London,"We absolutely loved staying at Hotel 41.  The beds are very comfortable, decent sized bathrooms, nice decor, and AMAZING service.  This hotel is very nice and offers all of the amenities, but does it without feeling too pretentious.  There is a much more intimate feeling than most other similarly ranked hotels.  The staff is really helpful and friendly without being overbearing. They were especially great about dealing with our bags when we arrived much earlier than check in.  The location was also great... so close to Victoria station and so many tourist sites.  Very good breakfast, and free snacks in the evening are just the icing on the cake.   All in all, a great place to stay for business or leisure.",5,2010,10,23
137,Simply the best Hotel in London,"My wife and I stayed in The 41 for one night, although we checked in Thursday morning and were still clinging to the place on Friday evening, we were in no hurry to leave.
The staff are all the most professional, courteous and friendly people we have ever encountered in any hotel.
A stay here is like staying in a private club where the staff who know you personally, wait on you hand and foot and anticipate your needs before you even knew you needed something.
We knew what to expect when the manager greeted us with, ""Hi Mr and Mrs X, I don't think we've been introduced yet"". 
After checking out, we reappeared for some lunch and were greeted by name, which is impressive given we'd only been there one night.
My wife mentioned that the stay was a birthday present, cake appeared as if by magic.
My wife only drinks diet coke, diet coke appeared in the mini bar.
We went out to see a show and the room was tidied when we got back.
I'm trying hard to find something to criticise about 41 but honestly can't think of anything they could do to improve. Already planning a return visit.",5,2010,10,15
137,One of the best hotels we have ever...,"One of the best hotels we have ever stayed at. The service is excellent, staff is friendly and helpful, rooms are gorgeous, and the lounge is great. Great location. Would recommend without hesitation to anyone.",5,2010,10,14
137,"Fab stay, made to feel very ""exclusive""","Superb hotel. Won't replicate what the web site and other reviews have said. The room was great, staff fabulous and the ""private dining area / lounge"" a real oasis after a busy day. Great location, great everything really !

Recommended !",5,2010,10,10
137,BEST HOTEL ON OUR HONEYMOON,"This is the first time i write a review for any hotel ever. But this hotel really deserves it. During our honeymoon my wife and I travelled to Paris, London, and NY and booked really nice hotels but this one really ranks on top!

The hotel even had a cake waiting for us in the room as they knew it was our honeymoon!!!

amazing!",5,2010,10,05
137,Excellent service and really focused on THE customer,"This hotel was a fantastic experience! Once you arrivé in this hotel, it feels like coming home. The enormous attention you get as a customer from THE staff is wonderful! You, as à guest, get 100% attention and you feel being taken care off. Everything goes very smooth! Enormously attention for detail! THE button on the phone named 'everything anytime' is very practical and they do keep promise to those 2 words. just one minor thing was the bathroom. We booked a Double executive room and we got a beautiful room but a very small bathroom. Also the dangerous step going from bedroom to bathroom needs to be taken care off. Great breakfast and again attention to detail. A fantastic experience.",5,2010,10,03
137,Privacy and luxury with top class friendly service at all times,"We stay approximately once a month at 41, and it really is ""home from home"" for my husband (co-director), and me.  We expect the best, and we get the best.  The location is perfect for us, coming from the south coast into Victoria Station, five minutes walk away.  The most attractive parts and interesting venues of south central London are within walking distance if one has time for sightseeing.  The rooms are stylish, cosy and elegantly comfortable, with the attention to detail we have come to expect from The Red Carnation group, in various parts of the world.  The Executive Lounge is actually a private club room because as you will read in other reviews, this is a residents' only hotel.  It affords the peace and tranquillity one needs when between meetings or after a long day. Whenever you come through the door, your welcome by all staff is like a warm cloak. Senior general managers frequently come through from The Rubens, and the atmosphere of excellence with every comfort is maintained at the highest level.  No hotel can claim to be perfect, but it is the way any queries or problems are handled that is the telling point, and this is done with the same positivity and care as everything else.  If you need to stay in another part of London, go to another Red Carnation hotel.  This small group's attention to detail is second to none. We dine informally in the club room, and also next door in BBar, which has a more buzzy atmosphere when we want that.  The gourmet Library Restaurant downstairs in The Rubens has an excellent new menu that we tried last week,   The superlatives are endless.  So - if you are a brash person who likes to dominate rooms and particularly if you tend to use a mobile telephone loudly in public areas with no care for others, please go somewhere else and keep 41 for people who understand and pay for this quiet style of club atmosphere.",5,2010,09,28
137,Fabulous.............,Our stay was perfect!  The rooms although a little on the small side are very well presented complete with all those little extras.  The staff are more than helpful.  The location is perfect - so close to Buckingham Palace - perfect base for sight seeing.  The executive lounge is very well stocked with an honesty bar and free snacks during day and night.,5,2010,09,27
137,Everything you could possibly wish for,"We recently booked the `Wicked ` package with our friends at 41.
From check-in to check-out the expierience was truly outstanding. My wife have stayed in many fine hotels but the service we received at 41 surpassed anything we had recieved before.
The rooms were spotlessly clean and beautifully furnished with everything and more available. The location is probably one of the best In London. I cannot recomend this hotel enough.",5,2010,09,23
137,I see why this hotel is rated Trip Advisor #1 and entirely agree!,"I stayed at Hotel 41 for three nights and think the 41 is quintessential London.  Snazzy but not pretentious, stated elegance from, this is a truly beautiful residence.  I am always upset by an alarm clock, but surprisingly relived when it’s highlighted by Buckingham Palace and from a refreshed sleep in a beautiful, splendid hotel.  The shower is fantastic and actually allows enough water to be a good , hot shower, especially when filled with the Penhaligon toiletries.  Don’t worry; the staff knows your name and what you like as you ramble out to the supple lounge or out for business.  Very near sites and the Tubes, ideally the hotel is kind of camouflaged.  The minus – it all comes at a price and the rooms are small.  But if you left your ascot and monocle at home but want to feel English elegance, you can’t go wrong here.",5,2010,09,22
137,Service beyond your imagination...,"This hotel offers an impressive level of service and distinction. Every member of the staff is EAGER to please the guest and GENUINELY interested in seeing that you enjoy your stay.  I LOVE this hotel, and the warm and caring staff made our London trip extra special!  I want to give a special thanks to PJ, Ines, Roman & Anna, they where always EXTRA helpful, kind and quick to assist. Thank you Roman for always bringing me Turkish Delight (my new obsession), and for always assisting us with a smile! Also I have to recommend the car service the hotel offers to/from LHR - A brilliant Mercedes pick up with a professional, kind and pleasant driver.  There was NO STRESS whatsoever - only bliss!",5,2010,09,21
137,A True London Delight,"We planned our last two nights in London to be pampered at  ""41"".  Happily, our expectations were exceeded.  The entire staff was professional, knowledgeable and genuinely interested in making sure that we enjoyed our stay..  They arranged an incredible tour of Buckingham Palace, Royal Mews and Queens Gallery.   The Executive Lounge was a delightful and elegant British experience.  The staff offered impeccable service and made us feel pampered at every turn.  High Tea at ""41' was one of the best we have experienced.   My wife and I had a great time and would highly recommend ""41"" to others.",5,2010,09,20
137,One of the best hotels ever!,"Just recently back from a stay at Hotel 41.  The service, attention to detail and personal touches were unbelievable. Whatever, whenever is truly their mantra, the entire staff knows your name (even people you've yet to meet) and everyone is simply looking to ensure guests are happy. It's been a long time since I have been pleasantly surprised by anything when traveling -  this place has earned a spot on my short list of best hotels worldwide.  If you are looking for a quaint, boutique hotel that will spoil and pamper you - Hotel 41 is your spot!",5,2010,09,20
137,Amazing customer service & staff. Gave the feeling of one-on-one service!,"The location of the hotel was great. They had a continental type breakfast each morning, then in the evening they had cold cuts, cheese, breads, fruits that stayed available until morning. It was nice to have snacks & relax at night. The only complaint I had was the room was TINY! I felt chlostrophobic in there. The bathroom had no outlets for anything other than a shaver. I didn't enjoy being in the room, but the hotel, service & staff were excellent. It was also very clean.",5,2010,09,17
137,Still A Fabulous Hotel!,"We stayed at the 41 for 2 nights in mid-September at the end of a two week trip.  We have stayed there many times before and, as usual, it was wonderful.  It is not a large hotel; it is like staying in a private club.

We were offered champagne upon arrival which we naturally accepted.  We were then shown to our room; at our request we were moved to a slightly different room and we really appreciate the fact that the hotel staff wants to ensure that you are satisfied.

We were happy to see that Antoinette was still part of the team.  She is always incredibly friendly and a pleasure to deal with.  We wish her the best of luck in her upcoming wedding!!

As always, breakfast was more than adequate with attentive service.

Again, we have stayed at the 41 hotel many times and though we have debated staying in other hotels, we keep coming back.  We recommend that you do the same.  As an aside, we have also stayed in both the 1 and 2 bedroom apartments that are affiliated with the hotel and highly recommend those if you want to pretend you are a London resident.   They are another great option.",5,2010,09,17
137,Impeccable service,"My husband and I had a wonderful 3-night stay at 41 this past April.  We enjoyed the location, hospitality demonstrated by the staff and the room itself (split level suite), outfitted with every accoutrement.  One particular employee, Lauren, deserves a special mention.  While journeying across Europe during the volcanic ash 'crisis', we found ourselves re-routed overland from Prague to Amsterdam. Our pleasant but overwhelmed Amsterdam concierge had difficulty arranging transport on the Eurostar to London (with an interim stay in Bruges) for our impending stay at 41.  I gave a call to 41 and had the good fortune to connect with Lauren.  Rather than spend any more of our precious vacation time trying to negotiate an alternate route to London, Lauren spent a considerable part of her day working on our behalf and successfully resolving our travel concerns, allowing us to enjoy our Amsterdam sightseeing.  Lauren's manner was consistently eager, responsive and registered not a note of exasperation given 41 was undoubtly dealing with like issues.  Although we had never stayed at 41 when in London, we felt like time-honored guests returning to an away-from-home sanctuary. My husband and I stay in 5-star hotels on vacation with usually great concierge service, however, 41 demonstrates they indeed belong at the top.",5,2010,09,17
137,Did Not Disappoint!  Enjoyed our stay.,"We stayed for two nights prior to a cruise, September 1 and 2.  We booked Hotel 41 based on all the wonderful reviews on Trip Advisor.  It certainly lived up to the great reviews and can see why Hotel 41 is in the #1 position on Trip Advisor.  Staff is very gracious and accommodating.  We booked a special offered on the website that included daily breakfast and a dinner next door in the sister-restaurant, in the Library Restaurant.  The breakfast was very good and so was the dinner.  We found the location to be ideal.  We booked the lowest price room category, and my only complaint is that the room is so tiny.  We were expecting that, and it didn't really matter that much, except there was abolutely no place to put our luggage.  We did not want to unpack as this was only a 2 day stay prior to a cruise.  Loved the complementary wi-fi and the complementary goodies left out in the afternoon.  Would definitely stay here again and only wished we had stayed longer.  Next time would book a larger room.",5,2010,09,17
137,"Warm, engaging staff, spotless rooms, over-the-top attention to detail.","Since Hotel 41 continues to be #1 in London trip advisor ratings, I thought I would add just a few additional comments about the details that meant a great deal to us, that no one has mentioned previously.

Whether you arrive in denim or furs, the staff treats everyone with courteous respect and actually listens to you and your requests, acting on it immediately. You feel pampered and special from the minute you check in.

I abhor dirt and demand cleanliness, and this hotel gleams! Bathrooms were spotless so you could slip into those big, enviting tubs without a worry. Cocktails were served in luminous glasses, buffets had no spills unattended, and there was a freshmess throughout the hotel, enhanced by beautiful florals. The Executive Lounge has a huge skylight that floods the room with sunlight as you relax in comfort with bright, white table linens and not a spot of dust on the gorgeous woodwork and library. In the evening, candles are lite by the staff and the room becomes an intimate and cozy hide-a-way after a day of sight seeing.

Just a few other amenities were heated towel bars, beds and pillows that 
welcome you softly and comfortably, window coverings that block out the sunlight for late sleepers, umbrellas, long handled shoe horns, hair dryers, and morning newpapers left hanging on the outside of your door in a little cloth sack.

Hotel 41 is the ultimate 5 star boutique hotel that should not be overlooked for your next London visit.",5,2010,09,11
137,"Superb hotel,no detail left to chance","It all starts on arrival with luggage whisked up to room,then complimentary champagne whilst checking in.The nibbles of olives,cheese straws and walnuts are fantastic.room was beautiful and every detail thought of.Breakfast was lovely even the hash browns are home made.Had dinner in lounge on first night,and in Library (reubens) on the second night.both were really great and service top notch.didnt take advantage of the complimentary snacks in the evening,but what a great idea.staff all friendly and very attentive without being intrusive.Fantastic location.unable to fault this hotel in any way.we only had 2 days here to celebrate wifes birthday.but would definetly return if planning another visit to the capital.",5,2010,09,08
137,Lovely hotel very relaxing and deccadent staff wonderful,"Stayed for 2 nights (Friday & Saturday) as a special birthday celebration, mum & daughter
Our room package included either a bottle of champers or a romantic turndown - we opted for the champers and it was served lovely and chilled at the time we had ordered it
Staff are so eager to help with anything and make the stay wonderful
I have stayed in many hotels around the globe and found the service here to be among the best
Room fab - amenities fab
Food lovely - (though my mum did find a bone in her smoked salmon!) 
We loved the breakfasts and snacks and pantry
Loved Bbar next door - also Bumbles over the road was very reasonable and delicious!
Only downside was that from the pillow menu we ordered a memory foam pillow and had to repeatedly send back normal pillows which were brought and no memory foam pillows could be found
Also on checking out there was a mistake on the bill so check carefully in case your breakfast is included in your rate
Beware - VAT charged on top 
Expensive but worth it!!!",5,2010,09,06
137,There is nothing to beat this hotel,"We were welcomed as ever with warm friendship and unequaled professionalism.
Hotel 41 is like coming home for us, we feel safe, comfortable and above all valued by each and every member of the team there.  Our room was impeccable as usual, spotlessly clean beautiful and comfortable.  I always look forward to breakfast here and love the eggs benedict.  The pink bubbly is lovely.  There really is not a single aspect of this hotel that warrants a negative comment.
If you want to book a place to stay that has a perfect position, faultless service and to be honest for what you get a pretty good price and feel confident your expectations will be met then this is the place for you.

C.Sunley",5,2010,09,04
137,Beyond Expectations!,"All I can say is that my wife, my son and myself enjoyed every minute of staying at 41!  This is definitely the best hotel we've ever stayed at!  Tastes and requirements differ, no doubt, but our PERSONAL experience was awesome. The staff were great - welcoming, attentive and helpful.  41 is really beyond expectations in each and every detail and this is definitely the place we will stay when in London next time.",5,2010,09,02
137,Fantastic birthday weekend,"For a city with so many hotels, London nearly broke my heart! 
I trawled for months through Tripadvisor to pick a hotel for my mother's birthday this summer. I always try to go for the highly rated hotels if I can but London has a strange mix of establishments in those top few places.
I knew I didn't want ornate, chintzy furnishings or sleek, uber-cool modernism, which pop up with annoying frequency. I came back time & again to Hotel 41 but 2 things kept putting me off:
1) I kept reading that it was a ""floor"" adjoining Ruebens at the Palace, which brought to mind a small, cramped hallway. There was no lobby, so I wondered where we could relax, apart from in our rooms?

2) The black& white colour scheme seemed a little overpowering to be in every room

False alarms on all counts, this a great gem of a hotel. From the moment we set foot in the (small!) reception area, we were made feel welcome. The hotel manager came to greet us & offered us a glass of champagne to mark my mother's birthday. 

Yes this is a small establishment but the service & standards are top-notch. You enter the reception area & take a lift to the 5th floor- there are no other floor options, the entire hotel sits atop Rubens at the Palace, but you have no contact with this hotel. There are only 20 odd rooms, with the Executive Lounge situated half-way along the main corridor.

Here you have breakfast & Plunder the Pantry in the evenings. The food was very nice, I didn't notice a huge time delay ordering our hot breakfasts, as you had a selection of fruit, cereals & pasteries to work through first. Plunder the Pantry is a complimentary selection of food from 8.30pm onwards. We had smoked salmon, breads, salad & fresh fruit on the night we tried it. There is an ""honesty"" bar, where you write what beverages you have taken from the bar into a ledger & settle up at a later date.

I booked an Executive Twin Room which was spacious & spotless. It was at the back of the hotel so no noise from traffic. I asked for a birthday cake to be in our room when we arrived & a delicious raspberry & chocolate sponge cake awaited us. Free TV internet was available in the room, very useful. The bathroom was lovely, great rain shower.

The location is brilliant for exploring London- Victoria train & tube station is literally round the corner and you are only yards from Buckingham palace.

We ate out mostly- the BB bar next door did a lovely lunch.  We had pre-theatre dinner in Criterion restaurant in Piccadilly, highly recommend that. If you are looking for afternoon tea, go to the Dorchester. We had a fantastic time & they surprised us with another birthday cake for my mum which was such a nice touch.

I definitely would return to Hotel 41. It is expensive but the experience is memorable.",5,2010,08,29
137,Excellent personal service,"I was very impressed with the service provided by the staff at this hotel. Service was always personal but unobtrusive. Attention to detail was second to none and no request however big or small was too much trouble. We were welcomed by a glass of champagne in the lounge upon arrival, as our suite was prepared which was a lovely touch. Standard of accommodation was excellent with superbly appointed bathrooms soporifically lit by candles as part of the evening turndown service. Greater choice in Room Service Menu would be a benefit.",5,2010,08,25
137,They took care of us. Very good care.,"Facts:

- Check in was fast, comfortable and painless. They offered us drinks and dealt with our luggage.
- Breakfast was excellent.
- We didn't have a reservation for the second night (hotel was full) and they told us to leave and enjoy the city while they solved it for us. Worst case scenario, they would make arrangements for us in a different hotel. They gave us a suite for the second night.
- The library lounge is the place to hang out after being out in the city. They like to say you eat and drink at your own pace. But they are always there to help.
- The bed was comfortable, the room was quiet and everything was clean. 
- They offered help with reservations, directions, tickets and made sure we had umbrellas when it rained. 

Feelings: I didn't want to leave, ever.",5,2010,08,19
137,Hugely disappointing,"I recently stayed at Hotel 41 for one night with my fiance and dog (medium sized, well trained). The reason I selected this hotel was because it appeared to provide the 5* service we enjoy when travelling alone whilst also being pet friendly. On arrival we were left to struggle with our bags and our dog despite a member of reception accompanying us to the 6th floor. Check in was a lengthy process even though we pre-booked all requirements and returned the preference form. When we were shown to our room the Bollinger I had pre-ordered at extra charge had not been placed in our room as requested. The champagne was delivered approximately 10 minutes later which was somewhat embarrasing as the waiter entered without knocking and my fiance was in a state of undress! The bathroom had cracked tiles and mildew in places (we quickly realised we would not be having the bath we had hoped to enjoy!) and the room was not of the standard we expect from a 5* hotel (TV was old and did not work properly, we had a feather quilt despite asking for it to be changed due to a feather allergy, the room really wasn't large enough to have a king sized bed in it). We were left unsure of whether our room was reflective of the hotel standard generally or whether we were given a 'pet friendly' room in case of damage. We did provide a £500 security against pet damage so we would not have expected our dogs presence to affect the room we recieved if indeed it did. I informed the hotel at the time of booking that we would be accompanied by our dog as per the instructions on the website. However, he did not receive his welcome hamper, check out gift, or any of the Pet Concierge Services, the full inclusion of which was listed as chargable at £50.00 which we happily paid. Hotel 41 emailed me their pet policy several days after the booking was confirmed at which point I became aware dogs were not allowed in any communal areas nor were they to be left alone in the room at any time even if we were in the hotel. I therefore asked the concierge to arrange a dogsitter for a few hours on the Saturday night as per their listed services. This was arranged however it was at the additional cost of £100 + VAT which I wasn't informed of until we checked in.  I fully appreciate the challenge of allowing pets in hotels but if an establishment lists itself as dog friendly I do expect them to be just that. It was therefore a great shame that my finance and I were made to feel very uncomfortable because we had our dog with us despite adhering to all the hotel's policies. 
Pet issues aside, we found the hotel service to be very lacking. For example, we ordered room service at which point my fiance reiterated a number of times that I had a severe allergy to onion and none was to be included in my meal. However, my sandwhich came with onion in the filling (the inclusion of which was not listed on the menu). We did receive an alternative sandwhich approximately 30 minutes later (which we were charged for) however by then it was too late to enjoy. We had to make repeated requests for trays, glasses etc to be removed from our room (rather poor considering we stayed for one night only). My fiance and I had to eat our meals on our laps on the bed as there was not room for a table to be pulled out and we couldn't leave our dog unattended to enjoy the lounge. In fairness the steak we had for dinner was well cooked. Sadly it was completely ruined by the peppercorn sauce I requested which seemed to be a vinegar and cream mix with a few peppercorns. We ordered breakfast in our room. Given our past room service experience my fiance was very clear that our dog had a wheat allergy and that he must only have what we ordered. Needless to say we found bread under a mound of scrambled egg!! By the time we checked out I was being very sick. We were therefore keen to make a quick get away. However, when we were presented with the bill there were no fewer than 6 errors. It took 3 members of staff to work out what amounts corresponded to what as they were all listed under the same code. Our breakfast had been charged despite booking a King room to include breakfast. 20 minutes later and having already had to leave the desk once as a result of sickness we paid £680 (the initial bill was £800) for a one night stay in a standard room, requested a bottle of water and left. I often use Trip Advisor (as I did to select this hotel) but have never written a review. However in this instance I felt compelled to do so. Our stay was a catalogue of errors, the hotel was one of the least pet friendly places I have ever stayed in and the service was anything but 5*. The food was lacking to say the least. Even so I had hoped to avoid 24 hours of sickness. It would appear fish for breakfast was a poor choice on my part! It is with real regret that I write this review as everything I'd read on Trip Advisor led me to believe all 3 of us would have a lovely stay. Bitterly disappointed.",2,2010,08,17
137,Exceptional Service,"Wonderful helpful staff who were very welcoming. This hotel felt like home, only with extra perks and helpful staff to assist you with everything!
Stayed in the hotel for a romantic anniversary and would highly recommend it to anyone with the same intention. 
Central location right beside Buckingham palace and the ""Victoria"" tube station makes it the perfect location.
Highly recommended to any potential guests!",5,2010,08,16
137,"Great Location, Great Staff, Great Experience","Very convenient location near Buckingham Palace, Hotel 41 is located two blocks from Victoria Station and an easy 15 minute walk to Westminster Abby, Parlament and other Westminster sights.  The outstanding staff pampers their guests and provides very helpful information for seeing London.  The ""Executive Lounge"" is a quiet haven for food, drink and relaxing with the feel of an exclusive club.  The ""Raid our Pantry"" provides great night time snacks that are perfect when coming in after that evening event.  I will not even consider another hotel when I stay in London.",5,2010,08,16
137,A-Ma- wait for it... ZING !,"Great hotel, great and nice service for a romantic 2 -night-stay at the heart of London.",5,2010,08,16
137,"Beautiful, personal, hotel in the heart of Westminster","We just returned from staying at Hotel 41. I had read all the wonderful reviews on Trip Adviser, and I have never received bad advice.  This was my Daughters first international trip, and she wanted to stay somewhere nice. So we picked Hotel 41. When we informed the staff that this was part of her birthday present, they had a beautiful birthday cake waiting upon our return one evening. 
  The decor of the hotel is sumptuous and polished brass against the black and white. The rooms are quiet, and the beds and pillows are so comfortable. 
  But I have to say, along with everyone else,  that the staff are so helpful,courteous and friendly, that they make you feel right at home. We enjoyed talking to them, and they were so nice. A real pleasure to be around.",5,2010,08,15
137,A gem in the heart of London,"Hotel 41 was such a find. It is tucked into an unimpressive building through a well hidden lobby. But then you go to the 5th floor and you are met with smiles and welcome. You get a continental breakfast and you can order a full breakfast, pancakes, haddock and bagel and lox on the breakfast rate. The service at breakfast is impeccable and friendly. At 11am, an array of specially packed snacks are laid out - pistachios, chocolate, apricots, Kettle chips. In the evening, you get cheese and crackers. We felt very comfortable here, and really appreciated the convenience of having Victoria station nearby. The room is not large but still fairly luxurious.",5,2010,08,14
137,"Great location, great staff","We stayed at Number 41 during March for a city break.  We picked this hotel due to the excellent reviews on Tripadvisor.
The staff were extremely helpful and the lounge area is absolutely lovely for breakfasts and drinks.  Lovely to relax in front of the gas fire on a cold, winter night.  
The hotel is in a really good central location if you are going to see all the sights.  We were unlucky with the first room we were given as it had an issue with a mechanical noise above us during the early evening of our 2nd night - which we think was coming from the penthouse apartment as the hotel is on the top floor of the building.  We ended up having to be transferred to another room as it was unbearable.  The 2nd room was of the same standard and had the bonus of being incredibly quiet so we slept really well.  The staff were very considerate assisting us moving to the other room.  I think the sign of a good establishment is how well they deal with issues.  Overall we had a comfortable stay.",5,2010,08,10
137,Lovely staff and great hotel - but the best in London?,"A very nice hotel - rooms great and nicely furnished but not that big given that we upgraded - problems over parking a car (it was a sunday and they had no one to park it) and Wii wouldn't work in the room for the kids, the aircon was noisy and the shower smelled a bit - but thats being picky! The staff were really nice - nothing too much trouble and dining area/library very intimate. It is the intamacy that makes it special but there are other hotels with better rooms and facilities in London at similar prices that are superior in other ways. That said we really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to others.",4,2010,08,10
137,The MOST BEAUTIFUL hotel we have ever stayed at!!,"Endless attention to details and care!!!!  It was absolutely amazing, warm, lush, and delightful!!  It is a small boutique hotel.  Cutting edge electronics and amenities.",5,2010,08,01
137,Absolutely Magical Hotel!,"We had the most amazing stay at hotel 41, and the staff were fabulous and accommodating and looked after all our needs. 
My boyfriend actually proposed to me in the hotel and the staff had set up our room beautifully with flowers, candles and champagne. It was a wonderful night and and wonderful hotel. 
Breakfast was very comprehensive and all the food was great. 
Great central location too. 
It is all you would expect from a 5 star hotel and more!",5,2010,07,29
137,Would go back in a heartbeat! Excellent!,"From the moment we walked into Hotel 41, we knew we were in good hands. The staff was unbelievably helpful, friendly and accomidating. Our two day stay in London, as part of a week-long anniversary trip to Europe, was simply perfect. 

The room, while a little small (but not unexpected for a major city), was tastefully decorated and the bed was extremely comfortable and even had feather pillows. Upon our arrival the staff had left an anniversary cake in our room and the executive lounge two doors down had every possible offering we could imagine: cold water bottles, soda, food and a full bar including opened bottles of champagne on ice. 

The location was perfect for London sight-seeing with Buckingham Palace just a walk away and  Westminster Abby, The London Eye and Big Ben just a 10 minute walk up the street along Hyde Park. 

Our first night they recommended ""Santini"" restaurant for dinner and it was an excellent choice and some of the best food we had while in London. 

The staff was second to none. They helped us print out directions to the train station and endlessly provided assistance with everything thing we needed. 

I wouldn't dream of ever staying anyplace else in London. It was the highlight of our European trip and I would highly recommend it to anyone.",5,2010,07,28
137,Give me more of this; but of course!,"Hotel 41 is a simply a magical place, clearly if there were a yellow brick road it would take you there. We just stayed at Hotel 41 in London and we absolutely loved the place. I can not begin to tell you how much we loved this elegant hotel, wow. We ordered breakfast each and every day from the menu, something we included in our reservation plan. Frankly, we picked this hotel based strictly on all the reviews we read here at tripadvisor.
Thank you all for the outstanding advice, the great direction and wonderful reviews on this outstanding hotel. Thank you J.P.Lilly and Andrew at Hotel 41 for the personal attention you afforded us, we appreciated all your efforts. This is the place to stay when in London, you can thank us later and you will. Enjoy.",5,2010,07,27
137,Amazing Boutique Hotel,"This is my second stay at Hotel 41. It's attentive staff, quiet and dark rooms, and homey feeling brought be back a second time. If you enjoy staying in small boutique hotels, you'll love the 41. It's located in central London, just across from the Queen's Mews, two blocks from the front of Buckingham Palace, and a few streets away from ""The Prisoner's"" home (for those of you who remember the TV series).

Hotel 41 is entirely on the 5th floor. After you walk through the street entrance, you'll be greeted and taken to the 5th floor ""lobby"". Unlike most hotels, check-in is a civilized affair that you complete seated at a desk, drinking a welcome beverage of your choice. The lobby is really a living room of sorts that serves as a restaurant and gathering area 24 hours a day. With only 30 guest rooms, the lobby is never too crowded. The plush furniture, drapes, and rug contribute to the intimate feeling and keep talking subdued.

I have a philosophy about hotel rooms—never book the least expensive category. So each time I've stayed at the 41, I booked an Executive King. I found the size to be quite adequate, the bathroom extraordinary, and the decorating tasteful. 

I love the turndown service --- candles lit, music on, bedside water, and chocolates on the bed. Other special touches include—plundering the pantry, daily newspaper delivery, and late afternoon olives, lemon, and ice delivery. I did think this a bit strange, but I found that a glass of ice water with olives and lemon is quite refreshing. After the first day I began to look forward to my daily olive delivery!

The staff are very attentive. If you are sitting in the lobby, they will offer to do anything necessary to make you comfortable and to make sure you accomplish whatever you want in London. If you don't like being fussed over, don't sit in the lobby. At home, my husband and I are always working or doing things for others, so we really enjoyed being attended to. 

If you are an aficionado of small, luxury, boutique hotels, try the 41. It is amazing!",5,2010,07,25
137,"Thanks to Tripadvisor, this was a fantastic stay.","We saw this was number one hotel on TA so we went for it.  Its a tiny little thing which makes it so intimate.  You actually have breakfast in the same room as reception, sounds odd but it's brilliant.  The room was so clean and the bed was so comfy.  Very helpfull staff.

The smallest hotel i've ever stayed in but it's up there in my top five.",5,2010,07,25
137,Cozy Retreat - Great Location,"I stayed five nights in June on a business/pleasure trip, and found Hotel 41 to be a great retreat.  I agree with other guests as to the room size (somewhat small)... yet the bath and other amenities/services offered more than compensate.  All of the staff are super, and the Resident Manager, (Andrew) was very welcoming and helpful.  I usually stay in a boutique hotel in Kensington – however ""41"" will be first choice in the future.",5,2010,07,24
137,Expensive - but worth it,"My wife and I stayed one night in Hotel 41's signature room - a split level marvel with glass roof, seperate dining room downstairs, hot-tub jacqouzi - a perfectly delicious room in a marvelous hotel. One caution however, when we booked the price was quoted excl taxes so when the final bill came for one night not much change from 1000gbp - hence the expensive comment ! The only other negative I could reference was the waitress reaction when, in a jet-lagged state I left my breakfast table in the exec dining room without leaving a tip she very pointedly shouted a sarcasm ridden ""Thank You Sir"" at me as I heading down the hallway - perhaps a staff training/renumeration issue considdering the costs !!",4,2010,07,19
137,Great service but some issues,"We had a king size room which was spacious and well appointed. The staff members were very attentive and always tried to be helpful. However, constant in your face factor turned me off a bit, since most of the times I like to be left alone rather that being asked 4-5 times in less than ten minutes time if I need anything, when I am trying to relax after a long day. I liked the location of the hotel, next to the park and close to all the transportation. The executive lounge was very charming and welcoming, but as other people mentioned it’s was on the 5th floor and there was not a real lobby to speak of, which was not an issue for me though. There were nice little touches such as pantry snacks and honesty bar, which I found endearing even though I haven’t used it. 
Not sure about the other rooms, but we had to have the AC on all the time, and not because the weather was so hot; the problem was if you opened the window there was an industrial type of noise coming from the roof outside, which was almost inaudible when the windows were shut but the room became incredibly stuffy in an hour or two if the air conditioning was off. The AC was not very quiet either but it was the lesser of two evils.
Breakfast was expensive and bland but it was included in our room rate. Well the problem with “hot” breakfast was that it never was. Because the 41 is actually on the top floor of the building there was no kitchen, all orders had to be sent downstairs.  By the time food was delivered it was lukewarm at best and cold at worst. In addition every time we ordered hot breakfast, instead of sticking with cold cereals, it took an extra 30-40 minutes to get done, which is unacceptable for breakfast dishes. 
There was a tea kettle in our room with selection of teas and instant coffees but the cups were not replaced after the first use.  So the second time I wanted to have tea I had to ask for the tea cup. Also I had to ask two times to remove the featherbed and finally I had to show exactly what I meant to the staff member because the maid service said there was nothing on top of the mattress, not sure if it was a miscommunication or just featherbed is called a mattress in Britain. 
Another thing that I found off-putting it seemed that staff members were barging in all the time, once a person came in without knocking, a few other times the difference between knocking and using access card was less that 2 seconds. I am unused to having to constantly having do not disturb sign on just to make sure no one will be barging in when I am resting.
Confirming a prior reservation that I myself made took me three separate conversations with different concierges. I think they should have a better request and task completion tracking system. In addition a friend of mine wanted to send us a bottle of champagne which usually takes a phone call and a handy credit card. He told me that it was a production and he was even asked if he wanted to put the charge on or room which would be weird to say the least. So it took more than a day to actually process a simple request that should not have taken more than 5 minutes; at least it never did for me when I wanted to surprise my friends or relatives on vacations even when the hotels had 3 star ratings.
To summarize, while I would recommend this hotel to those unafraid of a sizable bill and some small issues described above, I would probably stay somewhere else on my next trip to London.",4,2010,07,18
137,Excellent!,"We stayed two nights at Hotel 41 and loved it. A dinner at The Library in the Rubens [41 is actually the 4th floor of the Rubens - but under separate management] was part of our package and it was outstanding. Full English breakfast both mornings was also included and it was excellent as well.
Everyone did everything they could to make our stay perfect. I felt like the Queen!
I can't say enough good things except ditto to all the positive reviews here.
Yes, it's a wee bit pricey so probably not for the budget-minded.",5,2010,07,18
137,You get what you pay for!,"The service here is amazing. From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave every need is anticipated and handled accordingly. The hotel is pricey, however You get what you pay for. The location was great for sightseeing and the metro nearby. It is very close to the Victoria Train Station. Great place!!!",5,2010,07,06
137,High End - but Beware!,"We stayed at the Hotel 41 for 4 nights in June.  The service was impeccable.  The lobby/lounge area was luxerious and superb. The rooms were large (for London) and very luxurious.  The bath and shower were out-of-this-world.  My complaint, however, is about the hidden costs in the lounge.  The lounge area, which has wonderful snacks and 24-hour open bar, does not provide receipts. In fact, there is no way to know how much anything costs or what you are actually charged for, and no one explains it upon arrival.   For all appearances, it seems like a club-level (such as a Ritz-Carlton) where the food and drinks are complimentary - part of the higher price for being on the club-level.  In fact, the Hotel 41 is actually just an entire floor of the Rubens hotel, which makes it seem even more like a club-level.  But when we got our final bill at the 41, there where very significant charges and absolutly no way to determine if they accurately reflected our expendatures in the lounge. We were able to determine that one substantial charge on our bill actually belonged to another party staying at the hotel at the same time with the same last name as us. They had booked some entertainment tickets through the hotel, so we knew it was not our charge.  Other than that, we will never know if the charges on our bill were ours or not. The extra charges were quite a surprise, and tarnished what would otherwise have been a perfect experience.",4,2010,07,01
137,Wow...,"After a trip to Canada, we asked each other : Want to go to London to finish it off ? And boy, it was the right decision. We decided to check for the first listed hotel on trip advisor and found this one. 

We absolutely love it.... !  The hotel was magnificient and lived up to what was said about it ... To the point where... to be honest, I've got nothing more to say, Loved it loved it and loved it. My wife already wants to come back so... i guess it's a good sign!",5,2010,06,30
137,"Very nice hotel, great location and attentive staff","My wife and I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  The reviews on this site and the hotel's ranking as no.1 in London were major factors in us selecting this hotel.

The hotel is conveniently located about 3 minutes walk from Victoria tube station and a similar short distance from Buckingham Palace, Green Park, etc.  There a number of pubs, bars and restaurants around the hotel.

Upon arrival we were seated in the small lobby before being taken up to the 5th floor to check in.  All the rooms and the lounge (which is the hub of the hotel) are located on the 5th.  We were wished a happy anniversary by the staff and offered a glass of champagne whilst we checked in.  5 minutes later we were in the room and our bags were already waiting for us.

The room was nicely decorated and had quality furnishings.  The only downside for us was the size of the room - we stayed in 4121 and it is very small indeed.  We did know that if we paid more we could get a bigger room but were still surprised by how small 4121 was.  The bathroom was also tiny.  That said, the room & bathroom was well equipped, soundproofed and comfortable.

After a nice walk and a couple of drinks at a local pub, we had dinner on the first night in the Library Restaurant at Ruben's next door.  This was a top class experience; great setting, service and fabulous food.

Breakfast on the second day was a little bit disappointing.  Service was a little slow and we had to request toast twice and by the time it came, the rest of the breakfast was over.  Food was fine though, especially on Sunday when I had eggs benedict; absolutely first class.  Service was also first class on the Sunday.

The lounge is very pleasent and the ""plunder the pantry"" is a nice touch.

In summary, this is a really nice hotel and we would go again without hesitation.  We would however push the boat out a little more and pay for a larger room!  The staff is good, if not entirely faultless.  All in all a mermorable experience and happy memories!  If you go, have dinner one night at Ruben's.",4,2010,06,29
137,A touch of luxury and relaxation.,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for one night. The entrance is small and unlike other hotels you report to consierge on arrival before being taken up to the hotel in a lift by a member of staff. We were greeted by the hotel Manager on arrival and made to feel very special. The service is impeccible and the staff are very polite. On learning that it was my birthday, we were upgraded to a King room. The room was beautiful and I have never slept in such a comfortable hotel bed before. What makes this hotel different from any others is that because it is small, it is very personal and they have many extra little touches to make your stay more enjoyable. It is an ideal hotel for a quiet weekend away and we would definately stay here again.",5,2010,06,28
137,"A very good hotel, but could have been better","We really looked forward to staying at Hotel 41, and it was a nice hotel. However, not as good as we had expected.

The room (King) was nicely decorated, but the view from the window was partly blocked by the banisters outside the window (not possible to go out), the carpet could really need a good clean (was full of burlings) and the drainage in the shower was very very poor). Further, the breakfast was good, but the service was sometimes a bit slow (you had to order eggs etc.).

Other than that, the hotel had a nice relaxed atmosphere, and good service. However, we will probably try somewhere else next time we go to London.",4,2010,06,25
137,Our home base from now on.,"We got to Hotel 41 after 3 plus weeks traveling from Amsterdam, through Germany and France. Our stay in 41 was for 3 nights. This was the second time that we stayed with 41. We found it several trips ago when we booked in to the Ruben which is connected to 41. From the moment you arrive at 41 you are treated like you belong there. They secure your luggage and whisk you up to the club room where you are checked in. The bags are in your room when you finish check in. 
All of the other reviews cover the furnishings and decorations which are very up to date. We both feel that this is home base from now on when we travel Europe. The bathroom is large with both tub with shower and a separate shower. The room is well appointed and the bed is very comfortable. The staff is excellent and very knowledgeable. We had them obtain tickets to a play for a Saturday evening and they arranged High Tea in the club room for 3 friends that visited us on Sunday who traveled up from Brighton. 
Last summer in August we discovered that the Palace (which is across the street) is open for tours and we enjoyed the tour through the Palace, Gardens and Queens Museum. We obtained Oyster cards for the use of the subway prior to leaving the US. The Oyster Card is good forever and the balance that is left from the current trip is available for the next trip. It is also very easy to add money to the card or check the balance at any station and it makes the subway much more user friendly.  
My last comment is that when we left Paris we took the Train to London. This is a two hour trip and you are only under the channel for 20 minutes. Our travel in Europe was by Eurail and we both agree that travel through Europe by Train is the only way to go. From now on we will home base out of London or Rome and use the Train for all of our Europe travel.  
When we left the hotel the doorman made arrangements for a cab to Heathrow for a flat rate and this made the transfer very easy and cost competitive as we wound down from 28 days of travel.",5,2010,06,09
137,Believe it all,"Spent Memorial Day weekend at 41 Hotel with my wife, arriving on Saturday and leaving Tuesday AM.  I'm usually skeptical about hotels with so many great reviews, but after a great weekend, believe it all.   We landed at Heathrow, and were met by the limo driver the hotel arranged for us.  Pleasant gentleman, gave us tidbits about London.  Got us quickly to the hotel.   Check in was occupied with another guest when we arrived, but they offered us cocktails while we waited.  We received our room, nicely outfiited, very clean, and contrary to some other reviews, we never heard anyone.

Everyone at the hotel was service oriented, and made us feel at home the entire stay.  The lounge is fantastic, and really does feel like a private club.   Each night upon our return, we had a nightcap - after the first night, they remembered what we liked, our names, etc.  

We also had dinner at the Library at the sister hotel next door as part of our booking - while not the largest menu, the rabbit terrine and lamb were perfectly executed.  The stick toffee dessert with clotted cream was delicious.   Wine list was nice as well.

Yes, we will certainly stay here again - worth every pound!",5,2010,06,07
137,Hidden gem,"Got a booking via Late Rooms. com, what a lovely surprise !

My husband and I thought this place was very special. The staff were most helpful. It's not a place to stay if you're in a hurry getting in and out but if you want a break with a capital 'R' for relaxation, this is the one.

The bed was AMAZING, the food lovely. the private lounge, understated elegance. Only thing that spoiled this was an awful American guest complete with baseball cap barking down his mobile phone as if he owned the place (maybe he did ?!) Slightly took the buzz off the nightcap we were enjoying before retiring.

We would stay again, albeit not at rack rates.",5,2010,06,01
137,It Simply does not get any better!!!!,"Pure perfection is how I would describe Hotel 41.  The location is outstanding, just steps from  Victoria Station..Buckingham Palace is a stones throw away...But what really sets this place apart is the staff.  Most helpful in every possible way.  When I travel I like to feel like someone on the other end of the reservation has my ""vacation experience"" set as a priority, Hotel 41 and staff exceeded this expectation.  Providing last minute car service, suggestions for dinner ( which were fabulous!!!)..not one complaint from this happy couple!!!!
Lastly, the rooms are wonderful to come home to at the end of  a long day..comfy beds and linens to match...
I cannot say enough good things about this hotel.  If it is within your budget...RUN to Hotel 41.",5,2010,06,01
137,Fabulous pampering from real pros,"The staff at 41 are magnificent.  The property is exceptionally clean, quiet, and well appointed.  Ideally located within walking distance of many major attractions, and convenient to the Underground.  One of the few upscale properties to offer king accomodations; this made the room just a bit small but they compensate well with lots of hidden storage areas.  Stayed for a week and never felt cramped.  The wonderful folks at the desk and in the ""Executive Lounge"" went out of their way to be helpful.  We also observed them providing the same great service to other guests.  We went for a memorable occasion and the entire staff at 41 ensured that we had exactly that.  Highly recommended.",5,2010,05,31
137,Not Quite The Stay I Had Hoped For,"Having read the reviews I thought this would be a great place to stay for this business trip and perhaps for a visit with the family in the summer. The booking process was excellent, person taking the booking was very helpful and said that a note would be placed on file so that I could see one of the suites suitable for a family on arrival (alas none were available for viewing when I arrived). Booking confirmation arrived very shortly after booking was made for a double room with Breakfast was made.
Arrival was a bit laboured as there was no doorman and the main entrance door is security locked. I arrived at 530pm and it was a little busy. Check-in was efficient and I was offered a drink whilst signing in. I was informed that I had been upgraded to a king room and first impressions of the room were very good. 
I used the Lounge which was comfortable and provided a great place to meet a colleague prior to going out for dinner. On return from dinner the main entrance door was locked and there was no doorman again. I tried to use my room key to gain entry but without success. I used the intercom and was given access some moments later - all a bit clunky.
On returning to my room, the bed had been turned down, the curtain/blinds closed and a pair of slippers left by the bed. Excellent. I had one of the best first night sleeps ever in an extremely comfortable bed.
Up until this point I fully agreed with all the positive comments I had read. But ....
The toilet seat in the bathroom was loose and worn. Shower controls were broken and would not stay in position set so temperature was not adjustable. Bath towel was very badly frayed.
Went to breakfast and ordered the full English. The tea was lukewarm and no hot water refill was offered. When the cooked breakfast arrived, grilled tomato was raw, scrambled eggs were cooked perfectly but sat on a muffin that was black burnt on one side and not cooked on the other, bacon was swimming in grease and the hash brown was cold and dry. I asked for some English mustard but was given a grain mustard portion. Asked again for English mustard but was told that grain was all that was available. 
Asked to speak with someone about the minor problems encountered and the Guest Experience Manager sat down at the breakfast table looked at the breakfast, listened, noted down my points and apologised. He said he would discuss with his Manager and Housekeeping Manager.
I asked reception to order a taxi for me and was told that this would be done.
On departure, the Guest Experience Manager informed me that he had spoken with his Manager and that should I stay again, then everything would be put right. Having made my way down to the hotel exit I was disappointed that the taxi that I had ordered was not there and had been forgotten.
Overall, I have very mixed feelings. A 5 star hotel with a great Lounge, excellent bedroom but a below standard bathroom and a very poor breakfast, which I was still required to pay for.
Will I go back and give it another try - I am undecided right now, but probably not.",3,2010,05,30
137,Rare luxury in London,"Everything other reviewers say about this hotel seems accurate. In my view, it is the equal of the old Savoy Hotel, although obviously a lot smaller. I particularly rate the service as first class. I have never experienced such attentive hotel staff in London over the many years I have been traveling there. It was very good value considering the inclusion of sumptuous buffet breakfasts (I loved the incredibly varied fruit, and salmon Benedict - a favourite of mine), free internet, and free access to a nearby commercial gym (with pool). My room although overlooking a rather derelict rear area of the hotel was very quiet and benefited from direct sun. My room had a separate sitting area to the bed area and seemed thoughtfully designed with every amenity you could want. The location, adjacent to Buckingham Palace, is handy to Victoria station and tube, and you can walk to Hyde Park and the West End for some exercise if the thought of a gym workout is too much. It was delightful to be able to take breakfast leisurely each day (until 11am weekdays and 1pm Sundays) in the cosy and very comfortable Library reading the papers or watching the BBC - very civilized indeed! The hotel looks like it occupies the top floors of several old terraces and has been fitted out to high standards, although the floors have the odd slope and can creak a bit under the carpet, but that only adds to the charm. There seems to be some loose connection to the Rubens hotel next door. By the way, give the Rubens restaurant a miss - the food there was terrible.",5,2010,05,29
137,"Comfortable, Clean and Great Location","I wanted to stay at a Red Carnation Hotel, as they are listed as GLBT friendly. This was my partner's first trip to London.  I also wanted a location that was not the usual Hilton or Westin. The place had to be special. This was our 5 year anniversary. The 41 London fit the bill.

We were escorted to the 5th floor and checked-in. The receptionist, tried to up sell to a different room. I asked if it had a fireplace and she stated, ""No, but it is larger."". I had emailed requesting a room with working fireplace, facing the mews with walk-in shower. When I mentioned this to the young lady, she acted put out by my response. She then went on to add this was her last day and her visa was revoked and moving back to S.Africa. OK...I was tired, jet lagged and in all honesty just didn't care about her visa issues,  but her attitude was not needed. My partner did not even notice her as the Hotel 41 is so beautiful and graceful. We were shown to room 4105. The room was just what I had hoped for from the pics.When we returned from sight seeing, there was a large cake/ pastry with cream. It was AMAZING!   But the fireplace didn't work!! We had to have someone start the fireplace, as it was turned off for the season, but it was still cold and wet in London.

The house keeping staff, needs training , with how to react with the guests. They acted upset  that we walked in while they were working on the room.The olives and lemons left in the room while wonderful touch, were never changed in 5 days! (I placed a tooth pic in them to see if they would be replaced.  The house keeper did not even say ""Good Morning"" or ""Hello"". It is the small things, like this that people notice. The room and bathroom  were cleaned (FABULOUS SHOWER!!)  and no complaints except the floors were not vaccumed on a daily schedule. The soap bar was replaced once in 5 days.

 The wireless was also a problem. It worked about 50% of the time and one of the printers did not work in the Library. This was frustrating, as another guest was living at the other computer! We were not able to print our boarding pass for our next flight. 

The evening manager was a true professional. He understands the true concept of hospitality. This hotel is lucky to have such a great managment team!! 

I would say that the biggest issue with our stay, was that the desk staff hear what you say but they don't listen to your issues. (I asked 4 times to have a light bulb replaced in the bathroom, it was Never replaced) 

We would gladly stay at Hotel 41 and will tell our friends and family members about this wonderful property in London!!  We were treated with respect and made to feel appreciated for our business, which makes this our new home in London!

We were taken

137,An outstanding hotel,"We had a two night stay in this hotel for our wedding anniversary.  The staff are extremely helpful and friendly, the hotel has a  quiet, relaxed atmosphere and we loved the black and white decor of the bedroom, which had a very comfortable, king size bed.  The bathroom had a bath, a shower  cubicle plus a second shower over the bath, was well lit and had a decent shelf for toiletries.  Arriving back at the room in the evening we were greeted with slippers, sweets on the pillow and the next day's weather forecast, and a scented candle burning in the bathroom - very romatic!  On the day of our wedding anniversary we also found a delicious raspberry mousse cake sitting on the table!  Despite the fact we were in central London, the double glazing kept out traffic noise very effectively, and the thick blinds kept out the light which meant we could get an excellent night's sleep. 
Our anniversary meal was in the Ruebens Hotel next door (sister hotel to 41) and was delicious and good value for money.  For breakfast there is a choice continental, with an excellent range of pastries, meats, cheeses, breads, yogurts, etc, or a cooked breakfast from the menu.   
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at 41.",5,2010,05,17
137,"based on the opinions decided, and quite right","Tried after reading already the positive bulletins, looking for a hotel in London. Dicided to take # 1 the 41. And indeed it me has not disappointed. On the contrary. Nice chamber, (4119) nice bed, fine bathroom (shower a litlle bit to small), nice people, nice breakfast, sociably after a day walk what drunk in the lounge. In short very well amused. Certainly in the fine environment of 41. Must therefore.",4,2010,05,17
137,Exceptionally helpful staff,"To me, this hotel is very pleasant, rather than exceptional, but the staff is really incredibly accommodating. I had let our room go and checked out not realising that our daughter was intending to change there (and she wasn't even staying there!) but they let her into the room with no fuss and let me take things in and out of the luggage store several times without a raised eyebrow. I really was a bit of a pain.

The hotel is very comfortable with great comfy beds and attention to detail like a choice of pillow type, there were a few minor irritations like a vicious self closing door on our wardrobe where the mirror was so we had to hold it open for each other and, as someone else has written the proportions are tiny especially in the bathrooms, anyone very large would be a bit squashed and the corridors made me feel a little claustrophobic but the sitting room, in the style of an English gentleman's club is very comfortable and pleasant.

I noticed someone commented that the location was not good except for Buckingham Palace, I don't get that at all, we walked to New Bond St in about 15-20 minutes and I am plump with rheumatoid arthritis so not the fastest! Within the same sort of walking distance are (obviously Buckingham Palace, the Mall etc) the Palace of Westminster (Houses of Parliament), Tate Britain, London eye, the river Thames, Trafalgar Square etc etc.  So I would have thought the location for tourists was great. I can also see it would be very romantic.

So the best thing is really the fantastic staff, my husband was worried it would be too in your face, it's not, they are just charming and helpful and apologetic if something goes wrong which makes your stay very pleasant. The manager Andrew Gortacow was particularly helpful. Because it's small I wouuld feel happy and secure staying here as a woman travelling alone too.",4,2010,05,14
137,I wish we had more time at Hotel 41 - excellent experience!,"I booked the Conservatory Suite (holy moly) for our final night in London as a special treat, and it blew all my hopes and expectations away.  

The service was absolutely top notch, the ""executive lounge"" area is awesome, with its honor bar (with bartender!), late-night snacks, fireplace, and great ambiance.  The room itself is easily one of my favorite hotel rooms ever.  The bathroom is GORGEOUS, the room has two floors with tons of space and many closets, a hidden television that pops up out of a piece of furniture at the touch of a button, and the glass ceiling is absolutely incredible. Even though we had a cloudy night, it was still romantic and fun to sleep beneath the sky.

The bed itself was by far the most comfortable bed we slept on throughout our European vacation.  It's large (and for once wasn't just two twin beds put together to appear to be a large bed), soft, and cozy.  

Oh, and the jacuzzi tub has 28 jets in it (yes, I counted), and the ""rain"" shower is GREAT.  Tons of water pressure - I loved it!

Location-wise, it's ok.  It isn't the most fun area at night.  We also stayed in Soho for part of our trip (at the Soho Hotel, which I also loved!  Excellent spot with a location that can't be beat), and that was a lot more fun area to walk around at night.  Soho has a lot of bars and clubs and restaurants and shops with a million people out having fun.  I didn't get to explore the area around Hotel 41 as much (we were really only there one night), but it seemed a lot more dead at night, and we were there on a Friday night.  However, the tube (subway) is only a couple blocks away, and there are plenty of cabs right outside the hotel happy to take you anywhere you'd like to go.

For me, the small downside of the nightlife is completely overshadowed by the rest of the experience at this hotel, and I'd stay there again in a heartbeat.

We've been lucky enough to stay in some pretty amazing hotels, and this one is right at the top with my all-time favorites.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could, and will absolutely stay there again when we return to London.

(one last note - Nancy Neimann from travelwizard helped us plan out our trip, and she is AMAZING.  She's been our travel agent before, and once again she knocked it out of the park.  I won't go anywhere without checking with her first.  Definitely look her up!)",5,2010,05,09
137,Some glitches but as nice as they say,"We would agree with most reviewers who praise the 41 for excellent service, beautiful rooms, and overall quality. There were a few glitches during our stay that warrant attention if only to post a more balanced view of the place. We had a very beautiful room and spacious bathroom but the toilet on two occasions refused to flush and had to be fixed twice. That was, needless to say, unpleasant. Also, the internet was slow and unstable during our whole 5 day stay so if you rely on internet you might want to check ahead how it's working.
Otherwise, a lovely stay.",4,2010,05,09
137,The 41  will understand your needs and exceed your expectations!,"EXEMPLARY STAY FROM START TO FINISH

My stay at Hotel 41 was exemplary from my arrival through the experience to my departure! Here’s my story:

My first impression as I entered the front door of 41 – the style, décor and cleanliness jumped out at me and the attention to detail was immediate and obvious.

The girls on the desk were great (one was training the other – both were very affable and extremely courteous).  The lead receptionist smiled and asked how I was and I replied ‘Exhausted’!   The sense/feeling I got was that she was thinking ‘Then we’d better get you to your room ASAP’!   I gave them my name and it ultimately transpired that while making my booking on Monday 26th that my ‘fat fingers’ had booked Monday 26th rather than Wednesday 28th as intended.   A feeling of absolute dread came over me and I thought – “I’ve made a genuine mistake and odds are I’m about to be ‘nailed’ for a no-show on the Monday!”  The girls maintained their courteous approach as they tried to ascertain if there was availability.  The lead girl emphasised with my quandary, offered to discuss the situation with the manager and said a manager would get back to me.

I was then brought through the executive lounge and was further impressed by the room, complimentary charcuterie, cheeses, snacks and soft drinks available throughout the night.  I noticed the consistency of the aforementioned style, décor and cleanliness all the way to my room.  I got into the room and my immediate reaction was extremely positive.  The room was visually very pleasing and the layout was a very intelligent use of the space.  Further ‘nosing’ around made it very clear to me that the room had been designed by consummate professionals, decorated implemented with impeccable quality/style and was spotlessly clean.  Every detail was thought of from the handwritten note on the desk (+ the sweeties!), roman blinds that avoided ‘dragging the beautiful curtains to get some darkness! Ancillaries like the iPod dock, dect phone & loofah were appreciated

While it is obvious that I am very impressed with the hotel and its staff, the ‘no-show’ issue made me think…  “These guys are consummate hospitality professionals.  Will they be true to the vision that they project/I had OR revert to ‘The terms & conditions of the contract’…  I was equally intrigued both financially and from a business positioning strategy to see what would happen?

I came back at around midnight after a leisurely walk and visited the Lounge – the guy on duty was very helpful and I enjoyed the snacks.  I went to sleep a happy man and the bed was up to the standards detailed above….surprise, surprise!  Loved the bathroom!

My thoughts regarding the ‘no-show’ issue at this stage can be summarised as follows:  “I made the mistake, I love the 41 and how will I recover from a 100% no-show charge in terms of my impression and willingness to stay next time?  

THE CLINCHER…I sat down for breakfast and a manager called ‘Antoinette’ (apologies if I’ve the name wrong?) approached me and let me know that I would not be charged for my no-show on the Monday, smiled broadly and suggested that I’ve have to come and stay again!  To say I was taken aback is an understatement!   In my experience (circa 2,000 nights in all sorts of hotels!), ‘when the chips were down’ many of your contemporaries adopt a homogenised pure money based approach, rather than focusing on ‘Losing the sale & KEEPING the customer’! 

I have actually recommended the 41 to at least 14 people since last week!  The 41 staff made every effort to understand my needs and then exceeded my expectations! TRY IT!!",5,2010,05,06
137,High Trip Advisor rating is warranted,"We stayed at Hotel 41 for 5 nights in room 4105, an Executive King.  The room was rather spacious for this type of hotel.  The bed was extremely comfortable, however the linens were not quite up to the level of other hotels of this caliber.  The service might be the best of any hotel we have ever stayed in.  The staff generally stayed one step ahead of us on all requests, seemingly knowing what we were going to ask for and suggesting things that we would have asked for had we known to ask in the first place.  We had tea on the second day of our stay and greatly enjoyed the food, tea and service.  Having had this at several other fine establishments this was one of the best, by far.  The location is also excellent.  It is easy to walk to many of the major tourist sites and being next to Victoria station makes is easy to get anywhere in the city you need to go.  This hotel is at the top of our list for all future trips to London.",5,2010,04,28
137,We didn't want to leave!,"My husband chose Hotel 41 as part of our anniversary treat. Having seen that it was number one hotel in London, on Tripadvisor, we were really excited but nervous that it wouldn't live up to the hype. I am so pleased to say that this was not the case! 
On arrival at the hotel we were taken through to the lounge to check in where we were given complimentary drinks, including champagne, and the staff chatted with us about our visit. I usually feel uncomfortable in 5 * hotels and I like service to be relaxed and I have to say that the balance between friendliness and luxury is perfect at Hotel 41. 
We were shown to our room where a special cake had been placed to help us celebrate our anniversary. The room was spacious enough to be comfortable, yet cosy enough to feel right at home. The bed was incredible, as were the bathroom facilities of a separate bath with shower and a shower cubicle.
When we returned back from our theatre visit in the evening we went to the lounge to take advantage of the 'Plunder the Pantry' option. Cold meats, salad, fish and fresh bread were laid out in the bar area and after a heavy lunch with lots of snacks, this complimentary service was just what we needed. Service was available in the bar area or for people who prefer you could help yourself and simply make a note of what drinks you had taken. My husband enjoys good service, whilst for me I prefer to be able to help myself and not feel watched. I feel that Hotel 41 had just the right balance for us both to be happy and comfortable.
The next morning we had breakfast delivered to our room and enjoyed a leisurely morning reading the papers and drinking tea. The late check out time of 12 meant that we weren't rushing to pack and breakfast is served all morning until one on a Sunday so you can still have that lovely weekend lie-in.
Although Hotel 41 seems pricey we would definitely say that it is worth every single penny and we're definitely in agreement that we'll never stay anywhere other than here when we visit London in the future!",5,2010,04,27
137,"Great hotel, friendly staff","I was really impressed by this place, the staff were wonderful. We especially enjoyed the afternoon tea, the best we've ever had! It was served in their lovely lounge area which is a perfect setting. My husband enjoyed his birthday and we have the hotel to thank for that.",5,2010,04,22
137,Amazing,"I would highly recommend this hotel, from start to finish it was a truly wonderful experience.  The staff are so friendly and helpful and nothing is too much trouble for them to help you with.  We were staying to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary they even organised a cake.  I have stayed in many 5 star hotels and this one puts most to shame with the personal service you receive.  Would defintely stay again if ever back in London.",5,2010,04,20
137,Exceptional Hotel with Exceptional Service,"There are lots of great things about Hotel 41 but in the interest of keeping this review short (you can read the 5800 prior reviews for this hotel if you want to spend the time getting details) I will keep it short an simple. 

The hotel is small. Located on the top floor of a building attached to the Reuben's Hotel next door. There is a small host's desk inside the locked street level lobby. The entrance is rather non-descript and most first time guests mistake Reuben's more conventional lobby for the entrance to Hotel 41.

3 main things you need to know about Hotel 41: 

1. The decor, finish, and luxury appointments are first class. I've stayed in hotels all over the world from Bora Bora to the Holiday Inn Chengdu China and Hotel 41's appointments are top quality.

2. The lobby/concierge's desk/breakfast room/lounge/business centre are all located in a single room. What I referred to as The Library. 18' ceilings with built in bookcases and a giant skylight, traditional victorian mouldings, fireplace, big leather couches and chairs, antique globes, crystal vases filled with flowers, and a fully stocked bar with premium drinks. Absolutely stunning! This room made the hotel for me and added a lot of ""British Empire"" context to our visit to London. I only wish they allowed cigar smoking in this room. I would have sat by the fire and tipped the barman extra if he'd allow me to refer to him as ""Watson"". Brilliant!

3. The service staff are exceptionally well trained and work very hard. My wife flew in separately from myself on a red eye flight. She arrived at the hotel around 8am and our room was ready and the hotel staff were expecting her. During our 4 day stay the staffing never seemed to change. The same people taking care of us at 9am were mixing us a nightcap at 11pm... and they never forgot our names and were exceedingly courteous, formal, and pleasant despite what appeared to be 14 hour days (or perhaps just clever scheduling on the part of Hotel 41 management. Eaither way, kudos).

If there was anything that was not exceptional it was the location of the hotel itself. Thought the address name is impressive (41 Buckingham Palace Gate), and the hotel sits in reasonable proximity to most landmarks of interest, its location is in itself quite a dead spot. Both from a shopping and a sightseeing perspective. This is a minor note however and nothing a short cab ride can't fix. 

Lastly.... I recommend booking directly with the hotel and not using a travel service. You can't experience their pre-arrival service if you're not in direct contact.",5,2010,04,20
137,Great luxury hotel,"This is a great hotel.  The location is fantastic.  It is quite easy to miss but once you get inside, you see why it has all the good reviews.  The service is excellent and not too fussy.   The rooms are very clean and of a high standard.  
The lounge has the feel of a members London club.  The food was good.
Overal, the hotel is great.",5,2010,04,13
137,Amazing everything !,"Loved my experience and the location of ""41"".  At your arrival you are greeted at the entrance by a smiling friendly host, and then through a charming hallway for check-in where you immediately feel welcome ... 
The design of the rooms in classy black and white are of great size and elegantly decorated ... the amenities are wonderful and the plush towels are heated for your convenience.  The Lounge is a lovely place for an evening drink or any gathering. 

The amazing staff equally contributes in making this hotel a true shining star.  
I am not quite sure when i will return to London but i know where i will be staying again !",5,2010,04,12
137,Impeccable Service,"We spent our last two nights of a four-city tour of southern England at the 41, and I wish we could have stayed longer.  Our preference is for the country villages and smaller towns of England, but we could spend weeks in London if we could afford to live all that time at Hotel 41!  We had one of the larger rooms on a hallway with only three rooms, so we experienced none of the noise mentioned in earlier reviews.  As a matter of fact, our room was like a haven from the cold, rainy city.  It was so chilled on our last day that when I went to bed that night, I was rushing--with flannel and socks on--to get under the covers; when I lifted the comforter, which had already been turned down for us, I discovered that some kind soul had prepped our bed with two hot water bottles!  Along with the ""plunder-the pantry"" benefit, the well-stocked minibar, the towel warmer in the bathroom, the ice, olives, and lemon slices for cocktails in the late afternoon, among other amenities, this personal touch of warming the bed on a cold night was over the top and wonderful.  Each staff member greeted my husband and me by name whenever they saw us, and we wanted for nothing.  This is the loveliest little hotel I've ever seen, and I can't wait to return!",5,2010,04,09
137,Nice people. Nice Hotel.,"Excellent traditional English hotel atmosphere. Close to tube and local tourist spots.
We spent (2) nights there. The quality of the hotel and service provided are excellent and have a personal touch.
Highly recommended.",4,2010,04,07
137,Great service but too creaky and noisy!,"We stayed here for 5 nights recently. I was impressed by the service and decor which have  been well noted on the reviews on this site. However, our stay was marred by the noise level in this hotel due to the thin walls. Our bed was against the wall that was shared with the hallway and we could hear the footsteps of all the guests/staff outside our bedroom whenever they walked by. This was especially bad in the early morning around 7am as the maids/staff started their morning rounds and would quickly stomp across the hallways, shaking the walls of our room and even the door knocker. My husband and I would so often be woken up by the sound of footsteps that we started taking sleeping pills at night. We did tell the hotel staff one especially loud morning but there's nothing they could really due as this was an acoustical problem rather than a service problem. Funny enough, we couldn't hear any street noise - the noise was strictly due to the sound of footsteps walking across the hallway. Due to number of times my sleep was interrupted, I cannot recommend Hotel 41. It is truly a lovely experience in all regards, except to the noise level. But at the end, all those other redeeming qualities cannot make up for the lack of a good night's sleep.",5,2010,03,29
137,The best money we've ever spent on a hotel,"I feel a little redundant writing this review, but you really can't find a better place to stay in London.  My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights at the beginning of our honeymoon and couldn't have been happier.  Thank you to Andrew and his wonderful staff for making us feel welcome our entire stay!  What a wonderful indulgence.  The room was perfect, the location excellent, and the lounge was elegant, cosy and comfortable.  We felt very lucky to have made the decision to stay at the 41!",5,2010,03,29
137,Best end to a fantastic trip to England,"My wife and I decided to end our 2 week stay in England with a one night stay at the 41 for one last bit of English hospitality.  We simply enjoyed every single second we were there from the moment we entered the foyer door to the personal escort to our private car to Heathrow.  Our only regret is not simply being able to have spent all of our 2 week stay at 41.

The reviews are correct, outstanding staff and an atmosphere of being home (albeit a very rich and posh relative's home!).  Drinks at the executive lounge were somewhat pricy compared to other places around London, but then again, one is also paying for the service and the quiet relaxed atmosphere.  Not once did we feel that we were overcharged, and I must commend the server who was on duty the evening we were there (March 22nd).  He did a fantastic job and it seemed like he genuinely wanted us to have everything we wanted without being insincere or smarmy as it quite often happens.

Our room itself though not being one of their nicer deluxe rooms or suites was more than adequate and luxurious.  The toiletries provided were great, and the turndown with ice/lemon/olives were a great touch.  The room was clean, linens were fantastic and the bed was heavenly resulting in one of the best sleeps we had in England which certainly helped prep us for a long flight home.

Even the driver they hired for us to send us to Heathrow was a pleasure and took his job seriously...he mentioned to us a lot of history we found fascinating on the drive there, and also mentioned that the notable people he used to be a driver for.

All in all, if you're looking to stay at an intimate boutique hotel which offers great English luxury in the heart of London you cannot go wrong here.  My wife and I will definitely return to the 41 whenever we're next in London.",5,2010,03,24
137,What a wonderful place to stay,"41 was an incredible experience.  Private, secure with impeccable service and a convenient lounge.  The location is perfect, close to pubs, restaurants, Victoria Station and, of course, the Palace.  Availability of The Rubens' hotel amenities is a plus.

We will definitely return to 41 on our next visit to London.  We highly recommend this hotel as an alternative to the large hotels in the market.  Nice sized rooms and baths, excellent soft goods......simply as close to perfect as possible!",5,2010,03,23
137,There is a reason why everyone who stays here raves about this place!!,"I just returned from the Hotel 41 traveling with my 8 y/o daughter. The 41 is everything promised and more. The basics such as hotel location, room cleanliness, room size, bed comfort, food, etc. are all up to par with other 5 star hotels. However, what distinguishes the 41 is the level of service and the staff who work very hard to consistently deliver service not only efficiently but with sincerity. The 41 offers personal service, its public areas are only accessible to registered hotel guests, thus exuding a private club atmosphere. What sets the 41 apart from other 5 star hotels is the people they have working for them. Any hotel can have a whenever/whatever button direct to the concierge, but efficiency does not always go hand in hand with sincerity or kindness. Words such as excellence, exceptional and service are truly delivered at the 41. I highly recommend this hotel and hope to stay at the 41 when I visit London again.",5,2010,03,21
137,WOW - Are they Good!,"Hotel 41 was ranked #2 when we booked and by the time we arrived in London they were #1. No doubt why. The staff is excellent!!! The phone has one button titled ""whatever/whenever"" and that says it all. 

We felt like rock stars at this hotel. And we kept waiting for the staff to realize we were only average folks and kick us out. But they didn't and we had a GREAT time.

We stayed in a suite with our 2 kids (11 & 4). It was spacious with a separate bedroom, comfortable and very quiet. Not cheap -- but cheaper than 2 adjoining rooms elsewhere. After a day in the beautiful February London weather we came back to the upstairs lobby for tea and to thaw out by the fire. Of course my wife opted for champagne (they have at least 4 kinds open and ready to pour 24/7) and I chose brandy...but we called it ""tea"".

I have never stayed at a hotel that had a better staff. Whatever we needed they got it: buy, beg, steal or borrow, they got it.

They deserve a #1 ranking -- no doubt whatsoever.",5,2010,03,19
137,41 out of 41,"I stayed in Hotel 41 as a birthday treat in February and from arrival to departure the my stay was 1st class. 
Complimentary champagne on check-in, beautiful bedroom and bathroom, delicious breakfast and staff who were will to give every possible assistance - what more could you ask for.",5,2010,03,11
137,Truly Wonderful!,"A recent long weekend at ""41"" with our son was a wonderful treat.  The intimate, club-like setting provided a sense of privacy and comfort, with service and an address that proved second to none in London.    Our dual-level suite was nicely appointed, and was much more spacious than any other propery we've had in London during our many visits there.  Service was superlative, easily exceeding that of many more well-known properties in which we've stayed.  Our son took greedy advantage of the nightly opportunity to ""raid the larder,"" and the drawing-room lounge provided a warming fire and cold champange to soothe long days touring London.  In short, ""41"" met and exceeded our expectations in every way.  It was well and truly a cut above its peers.",5,2010,03,10
137,"Best hotel i've ever stayed in,everything we needed was there,service was excelent,even had a birthday cake for me!","I would deffinately stay here again & recomend it to anyone i know. Ideal location to Billy Elliot,Buckingham Palace,St James's park,Hyde park.London eye.Service was great & nothing was too much for staff to make everything a pleasant stay.Ideal hotel for couples who want a quiet and romantic break. Anna & Mark.",5,2010,03,09
137,Excellent- at every point with every person who works there,"I just returned from staying here for a week and will say that every detail was exceptional. On the first night I took the Tube there and got a little disoriented because it's a few minutes walk.  To be helpful- Just walk towards Buckingham palace and look for the Rubens Hotel, you will find it.

Also on the night I arrived- they had remembered my birthday and  had a cake waiting for me. I can't tell you how amazing it is to come to a place and have that level of detail at every corner.

The rooms are gorgeous and simple- with an evening turndown service complete with still and sparkling water waiting for you.

I ordered room service one night (a risotto) and it was cooked perfectly- definitely worth the money.

No it's not the least expensive but it's worth the cost and the attention to detail. I loved staying here and the people and would come back in a heartbeat. If you're looking for a great deal- book on Orbitz. They had the best rate on the room and you get to pay in USD so no additional fee if you're coming from the US.",5,2010,03,08
137,Probably the best money I've spent on a hotel -- ever,"If you are looking for a very comfortable, cozy, quiet, relaxed place to stay -- I highly recommend this little gem.  
If you are looking for a 'scene' where you can 'see and be seen' -- you probably won't be happy here.  I was told there are only 29 rooms, so it is a rather intimate place.
The beds are incredibly comfortable, as are the facilities generally.  I loved the little lounge area, and the quality of the food was generally outstanding.
They noted that I celebrated an appropriate birthday during my visit and left a little cake in my room -- a very nice touch.
They also left me an ipod speaker dock and a humidifier, per my special request, as well as a yoga mat, DVDs and a DVD player.
They have an agreement with high quality gym with a pool nearby for free use, but I didn't schlep my exercise gear to London.",5,2010,03,01
137,Flawless Service/Elegant Surroundings,"I was only going to be in town for one night on my way to friends in the countryside and had heard marvelous things about this hotel.  It did not disappoint.  It was comfortable, luxurious, well appointed and the staff really does bend over backwards to meet your every need.  The rooms are small...really small, but the beds and the linens are superb.  Baths are elegant and the cleanliness throughout is first rate.  Food and drink in the Executive Lounge are first rate and I would highly recommend the hotel's own wine which was excellent.  As I told them - if I had to critique something it would be the Penhaligon's amenities which, although quintessentially English are just not as good products as they could be or one expects from a hotel of this caliber.  Be sure to have a cocktail in front of the roaring fire before dinner or a glass of port after.  Or both.",5,2010,02,28
137,A great stay,"As a woman traveling alone, I appreciated the discreet location and the safety of limited access to the hotel from the street after dark. Even when I returned late from the theater one night, there was someone there to buzz me in. The bed was a dream and I enjoyed the ""clubby"" feel to the area which doubles as a restaurant, bar, and check-in area. I ended up meeting several other travelers there and we had several evenings chatting companionably by the fire about what we had all done during the day. I would love to return!",5,2010,02,21
137,A very good hotel,"This was an absolutely very good hotel. i traveled with a couple of friends for a week at London and all i can say was that this hotel made our holiday.
Location, staff, facilities, everything was great. Next time i visit London i will book Hotel 41. My stay at this hotel was a really nice experience and an unexpected lovely surprise.
A big thank to the guy behind the front desk.",5,2010,02,18
137,A hidden gem,It is lovely to stay at a hotel that actually lives up to expectation and portrays itself correctly.  A lot of 5 star properties overplay their service levels and I have to say 41 was just exceptional...everything they said the experience would be.  A great place to spoil yourself or someone special,5,2010,02,18
137,Extraordinary Staff,"As the other reviews testify, this is a wonderful hotel with an extraordinary staff.  Beginning with Andrew, the resident manager,and continuing through the reception and lounge staff, each person is genuinely interested in providing excellent service.  A primary attraction for me is the size - a boutique hotel small enough to recognize every guest by name.

One cautionary note:  rooms that face an adjoining alleyway may encounter noise from a recycling receptacle - crashing glass at odd hours of the day were a distraction to me on more than one day.",5,2010,02,09
137,This is a special hotel,"5* Quality
The staff were the most attentive I have experienced in London and the attention to detail was excellent.The room was extremely well presented with all the touches you would expect in a hotel of this quality.
The Executive Lounge was a delight and a wonderful place to enjoy breakfast.
We would stay here again on our next visit to London",5,2010,02,08
137,Real class Hotel,"have stayed at many hotels throughout the world, in fact 120 nights plus per year, and must say that in London many hotels claim to be 5 star< where in fact many dont come near, if you want a true 5 star experience I can not sing the praises highly enough of this hotel it may lack facilities such as pool, gym etc, but for sheer quality and attentive service in my opinion there is no better hotel in London>
The staff are exceptional, everyone of them, and they really do care, which in London does make a change, they will go that extra mile to assist and always with a smile.

in London you will struggle to find a better place to stay!

This Hotel does have CLASS!",5,2010,02,03
137,Simply something extraordinary,"I spent three nights with a mate here in December 2009 and had some specific requests regarding the room. All requests were met and exceeded. Large room with great bathroom and comfortable beds. The very cool thing about this hotel is the lounge/reception/drinks/business/breakfast area. Could they succeed in having all these services in one large room you ask? Yes indeed. It actually feels like a home away from home (and more). Staff was very friendly and went above and beyond on a consistent basis and with a smile. Cannot think that I will stay at another hotel in London ever if this hotel continues to deliver. 

Lennart Pettersson, Stockholm",5,2010,01,26
137,Another lovely stay,"My husband and I have just enjoyed another stay of three nights at Hotel 41, and found everyone to be very helpful, courteous and happy to do anything to make us comfortable. It is a pleasure to return to the same hotel and find that nothing has changed, in a very positive way! A lovely hotel, great staff, with all the home comforts.",5,2010,01,26
137,It's Home in London,"We stayed and ate for four nights.

The hotel is quiet, comfortable and well protected from the hurly-burly of the surrounding city. The physical attributes are wonderful: rooms, lounges and all areas are smart and intimate. But the outstanding strength of this hotel lies in its staff. The management team is extremely unobtrusive but is obviously supportive of its staff, who were always courteous and cheerful, and never stressed. 

Looking behind the scenes, the managers must be exceptionally good at chosing staff who are genuinely good natured and attentive. There was absolutely no falseness about the warmth of care and attention that we received from them; we enjoyed amiable pleasantries with them all, were given everything we needed almost before we knew we needed it. The rapport and shared  humanity between guest and staff is quite remarkable here. I write from the viewpoint of an amiable retirement in which  I enjoy human society in all its forms. But if on the other hand, you are a more self-important guest who demands professional and attentive service with merely the courtesies of impersonal service, you will find it here. Such guests were plainly  and faultlessly getting the attention that their egos demanded.

I would stay happily stay here again.

Anton Edwards",5,2010,01,21
137,Quality and Value,"This small (about 30 rooms) hotel has no street presence whatsoever; good thing it's next door to another hotel (the Rubens), or it would be impossible to find.  No lobby either, but a reception desk and a lift to the 5th floor.  Once there, a comfy dining/reception area, and well-equipped rooms with excellent beds.  Specialty of this hotel is personal service and amenities.  They will happily print boarding passes for flights, cater to you in every possible way, and really try hard to make your visit pleasant.  Nice to have drinks readily available to pour yourself; very comfortable and good value for the price; but not if you want a big-hotel feel.",4,2010,01,17
137,Absolutely wonderful,"I chose to stay at this hotel after the wonderful reviews it received on TripAdvisor and because I prefer to stay in small hotels rather than impersonal large chains.  I was not disappointed and in fact the experience was beyond my expectations.  It does feel like you are staying in an exclusive private club, particularly when you arrive and there is no obvious sign outside that it is a hotel.  If you are arriving by taxi it is best to ask them to take you to the Rubens Hotel as they dont know where 41 is.  We loved the decor of the public areas as well as the bedrooms and we particularly loved the evening turn down service and the hot water bottle in our beds.  I was travelling with my sister and both being mothers who are used to looking after our families, it was so nice to have someone pamper us for a change!  The staff were friendly and attentive.  I would highly recommend this hotel if you appreciate attention to detail and personal service.",5,2010,01,13
137,The reviews are true!,"We booked Hotel 41 because of TripAdvisor. I never really thought any hotel could be as wonderful as the reviews sounded but I figured i'd give it a try.  IT SURPASSED my expectations!!!  -- luxurious, yet cosy and friendly. No detail overlooked - from the warmed bed sheets to the office supplies in the desk drawer -- every touch was 'brilliiant'.  You can trust the rave reviews --- We had a wonderful stay and we can't wait to go back. Thank you Hotel 41.",5,2010,01,10
137,Close to Perfect,"If you want to stay in a big glitzy shiny hotel, this is not the hotel for you, but if you enjoy a friendly comfortable cozy atmosphere, Hotel 41 is perfect. There is a very English feel to this small hotel, and my family found the executive lounge to be a very comfortable and casual place to relax. The staff were all exceptionally warm and friendly and helpful.We loved the beautifully presented trays of beribboned dried fruit and chocolates, and it was nice to be able to plunder the pantry for a quick tasty snack when we returned from the theatre. Returning to our room to find a hot water bottle in the bed and a candle lighting the bathroom was lovely and welcoming. The location is excellent and we walked from one end of London to the other, but if we needed a taxi it was never difficult to find one. In fact it was cheaper to catch a taxi than it was to catch the train. Overall, we enjoyed staying at Hotel 41 very much, and we highly recommend their afternoon tea.",5,2010,01,08
137,Beautiful hotel,"We booked this hotel on the strength of the trip advisor ratings, and were very happy that we did.
From the moment that you arrive, to the moment that you leave, you are taken care of in the most wonderful manner. The hotel has its own separate entrance to the Reubens next door, accessible via a small private doorway with swipe card entry. Upon arrival you are warmly greeted and shown up to the 5th floor for the check in process, and offered a choice of drinks including champagne. The check in process is quick and friendly, and then you are shown to your room and given a tour of the various amenities. We had requested an early check in after  a long overnight flight, and this was dealt with without any problems. 
Our room, although smaller than some London hotels, was actually all the better for it, and with an open fire making the room a fantastic place to be. The flat-screen tv had a good choice of channels including sports, a surround sound dvd and super audio cd player and also a Bose sound dock for your ipod were all available in the room without asking. We decided after a quick nap to go out and do some shopping. I would actually say that it is a short, pleasant walk in to the St.James/Bond street area. Come out of the hotel, turn left past  Buckingham Palace and across the road to a short walk down the Mall. Turn left in to St.James and you are then only a hundred yards or so from all the shops of Old/ New Bond St.
Upon arriving back to the hotel, it was wonderful to come in to such a warm and welcoming place, especially as it was snowing and very cold outside. We went to our room to freshen up, and the turn down service had already been completed. Olives and lemon slices and a bucket of ice were on one bedside table and some petit fours were on the desk. A candle had been lit in the bathroom and the fire was also ready for use. Another nice touch was chocolates on the pillow and a lovely ""happy anniversary"" cake and note upon the table. The little touches like this make the hotel a cut above the others, and make you want to return again very soon.
The executive lounge has a well stocked honesty bar and the ""raid the pantry"" complimentary snacks of cold meat, salad and breads etc was a nice touch.  Breakfast in the morning in the lounge was very nice, plentiful and as a very lazy person, I also liked the fact that it was available up to 11am!
Having stayed in many  very good hotels around the UK and USA, I have to say that I only write trip advisor reviews if they are exceptionally good or very bad. Hotel 41, although a small boutique hotel, falls in to the exceptional category. It is obviously easier to run a smaller place, but the attention to detail, fantastic staff (particularly the girls on reception and the front desk, and also the doormen) friendly and not over bearing service and the general experience, I found to be truly wonderful.
I think the owner, a South African lady, is to be congratulated on making a beautiful hotel and judging by her staff, she is clearly a nice person to work for, which is what seems to make all the difference. Happy staff, happy hotel.
I cannot recommend this hotel enough, and will be returning as soon as possible. Thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2010,01,07
137,"The Ultimate In Luxury, Indeed","First off, the location: fantastic. Less than 2 blocks from Victoria Station, directly opposite the Royal Mews, about a 3-5 minute walk to the Buckingham Palace gates, and a 5-7 minute walk to Hyde Park.  The rooms at Hotel 41 are beautifully decorated and well-appointed. We stayed in one of the smaller Executive King rooms without a hallway, full closet or fireplace, but the room size was still good in London standards. The bed was cozy and comfortable and the nightly turn-down service with the hot water bottles and classical music was heavenly. There were also some delightfully noteworthy inclusions. For example, the extensive (and free!) DVD library, the shaving kit with a wooden-handled razor, and the exfoliating bath mitts were some of our favorite little perks.  But without a doubt, the very best extra was the Christmas stocking left on our door on Christmas Day that was packed full of goodies! This personal touch really made our stay.

The executive lounge was a great place to frequent throughout the day. In the morning, we enjoyed the breakfast (continental was more than adequate) of hormone-free and organic yogurt, cereal, fruit, juice, milk, toast and pastries. There was also a wide selection of teas and herbal infusions. The afternoon tea at 41 was great, but at next-door Rubens, the tea menu is exactly the same, the ambiance more traditional/quaint, and the cost significantly less in their Palace Lounge than at 41. 

One of our favorite features at 41 was the abundance of complimentary snacks and drinks set out in the executive lounge during the day, featuring smoothies, natural sodas, healthy fruit and snacks, as well as chips and candy, which outshone the much-hyped ""plunder the pantry"" offering at night, which only had a limited selection of fruit, sliced meat and cheeses. At night, it is great to sit by the fire in the executive lounge, order a glass of wine or serve yourself at the honesty bar, and reflect on the day while gazing at the stars through the vaulted glass ceiling. 

Despite all the other lovely features, the service at this hotel is really what makes it stand out. The hotel staff is incredibly friendly and attentive, without coming across as pretentious. The staff knows all the guests by name and are great at remembering little details, like sightseeing or theater plans, for points of conversation. The management stopped by our room twice just to see if we were enjoying our stay and if we had everything we needed.  In sum, we highly recommend this hotel, especially if you can book a good package on LuxuryLink (we bought our 5-night package for roughly $1,500 this past summer, which included daily breakfast, a 3-course dinner, an afternoon tea, flowers, and a bottle of Laurent-Perrier champagne -- not a bargain, a steal). 

When in London, stay at 41!",5,2010,01,06
137,"Amazing, Beautiful Hotel - The Best in London","We booked the hotel for our 'Mini-Moon' and it met and surpassed every expectation we had. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special. We were given a very generous free upgrade to a suite and enjoyed a complimentary glass of champagne and nibbles in front on the open fire in the executive lounge, before being shown to our room.
(We arrived an hour earlier than the specified check in time, but this was no problem - the room was ready for us). They had even left us a 'Happy Honeymoon' cake in the room.
The rooms are immaculate and beautifully decorated with great views over the Royal Mews.
Whilst at the hotel we enjoyed a brilliant afternoon tea, and helped ourselves to the complimentary juices, smoothies and snacks several times a day.
The breakfast, which was included in our room rate, was really tasty with a great choice of the usual continental style fare.
Whilst on the way out of the hotel for a day's shopping we picked up a free Starbucks coffee, which considering it was raining was a nice pick-me-up.
To sum up, this is a quite superb hotel, with brilliant staff, which is well worth the price tag - you will not be disappointed.",5,2010,01,04
137,Great Boutique Hotel,"My wife and I had an unbelievable experience at Hotel 41. We prize our privacy and don't have much interest in large hotels where you end up being a ""number"". Getting to know our service staff was a pleasure and they truly went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. The room was immaculate and everything functioned the way it should. The food was very good and much better than we had expected. We also scheduled a tour of Avebury and Stonehenge through their concierge. What an experience! Our guide was very knowledgeable and entertaining as well. The day trip was spent in comfort with great conversation and lots of fond memories created. We truly can't wait to go back to London and plan on booking the 41 again.",5,2010,01,04
137,"Lovely Hotel,","I chose this hotel for it's amenities and service for a special occasion and I would say I was 90% happy with my stay. We drove to the hotel but there is nowhere to stop outside, just double red lines and traffic lights but fortunately the concierge (from the Rubens hotel) offered to park our car for us which was good as the nearest car park is a 10 minute walk away. I was surprised that there was no doorman at the front entrance to 41,  there was one at the Rubens next door though? The lobby and entrance were nice, we were escorted up to the 5th floor to check-in where we were offered a drink/champagne which was nice but check-in was almost like being at an interview - I would think a lot of people prefer a more discreet and fast check-in process. The hotel will email you a few days before arrival for your preferences and they had supplied the items I requested in the room but our room did not have a fireplace or separate bath/shower and was quite small and oddly shaped. The double bed was also very small, I would say go for a king room unless you are a single guest. I would have preferred another room but the hotel was fully booked. They also could not supply a DVD player as these were all taken by other guests but they did give us a free pay per view movie instead. We received a free birthday cake and lots of little extras but did get a bit frustrated with the continuous knocks on the door. The free snacks in the lounge were not as good as I expected and the drinks were not free. Mini bar was expensive which is to be expected. Breakfast also very expensive in my opinion. Overall I enjoyed my stay but I did expect more so I would rate this hotel as a 4 star with great service but I would say it is slightly overpriced for what you actually end up getting.",4,2010,01,04
137,One of the best in London,"Hands down, this is one of the most welcoming hotels I have ever stayed in. The rooms, bathrooms and little extra touches are all well done, but not out of the ordinary for a good (and expensive) hotel. What makes 41 stand out is rather the exemplary service - which strikes just the right balance between efficiency and friendliness - and the public lounge area which feels like a sanctuary after a busy day in London. The sole negative is the location which is only passable: in summer it would be a pleasant half hour walk to the West End but in winter you'll probably want to take a short taxi ride. Overall though, this is one of the best hotel experiences we've had in London or elsewhere.",5,2010,01,02
137,A perfect place to stay with amazing staff,"We have just spent 7 nights at Hotel 41 and cannot speak highly enough about it.  From the moment we arrived to when we left we felt special and welcome.  The service of the staff is outstanding, nothing was a bother.  We had 2 meals in the library restaurant and they were very gpod.  Our room was very comfortable and spacious enough particularly considering we were in the centre of London.  The hotel location for us was perfect, close to all the main sites and well placed for shopping.  We felt quite sad checking out this morning as our stay had been so nice.  We hope to return again soon.",5,2010,01,01
137,"Five-star room and service in a wonderful, if unexpected, location.","The hotel was everything it claimed to be. The room was stylish and comfortable and the executive lobby was wonderful. The staff were friendly, relaxed and highly efficient. We were only disappointed at the food on offer for in-hotel dining, not up to standards. They could also do with a dress code for the executive lobby as one guest appeared for breakfast in his bath robe and nothing else.",5,2010,01,01
137,Oh my ... what a great stay!,"December 1-8 ... two US couples staying at Hotel 41.  In the city to see the sights, make train excursions to Bath and Salisbury, and enjoy the holiday atmosphere.  Great hotel location, near Buckingham Palace.  Pre-booked special rate that included full breakfast and one lovely dinner at the sister restaurant next door,  the Ruebens.  The hotel seems to be popular with both business and leisure clients.  We two had a king room with fireplace and view to the street -- precisely what we'd requested.  En suite bath, of course ... exceptionally appointed.  Tub & shower PLUS separate shower.  Towel warming rack.  All fresh and sparkling clean.  Turn-down service.  Talented, caring housemaids.  We risk gushing about the incredible concierge staff service at this 30-room boutique hotel.  Willing and ready help for any visitor need -- restaurant recommendations and reservations, tourist tips, etc.  These men and women were truly amazing in their devotion to service to hotel guests.  All very friendly and most sincere in their approach.  The ""Executive Lounge"" is such a wonderful concept.  It is the venue for breakfast, check-in desk and personal concierge service, ""plunder the pantry"" evenings, and is a most inviting place to relax at the end of the day after walking your sox off in London.  We have had several hotel stays in London over the years -- higher end hotels -- Hotel 41 is the very best of them in our experience.  Thank you, hotel staff!",5,2009,12,30
137,"Great stay, GREAT staff","Me and my wife stayed at the 41 hotel in december 2009 and we loved it. It was our first stay at a hotel of this class and we were a little nervous that it wouldn´t be worth it. I mean there are much cheaper hotels a little bit further off from the city centre but it was still totally worth it. The great room, the FANTASTIC lounge and the staff. I can´t say enough good things about the staff. 
One detail. My wife had a knee operation recently and the hotel was able to get us an exercise bicycle for our room for her to be able to do her rehabilitation practice. Great. 
Will definitely come back.",5,2009,12,29
137,excellent in every way,"Just got back from a 3 night stay. The staff and hotel were great. This was a stressful time due to terrible weather, Eurostar cancellations and the threat of Bristish Air strike. The staff took it all with ease and performed very well. The room, a Jr. suite, was very nice but small. The bed was only a queen size and it had a steep staiway up from the sitting area to the bedroom and bath. The bath was small but well equipped and water from the shower would spray everwhere. It was very comfortable and the sitting area was fine and enjoyable. The ececutive lounge was very nice. The food was very good. We will certainly stay here again.",5,2009,12,25
137,Exceptional,"My wife and I have just returned back from 2 nights at 41 for her birthday.

Before we had even left home I thought the service was exceptional. I called them to help book dinner reservations, we had wanted a table at The Ivy but had failed, it being the Friday before Christmas and us being mere mortals. I think through pure perseverance they managed to get us a table after a month of trying. You definitely get the feeling even before you leave home that they will do anything in advance to make your trip more enjoyable when you get there, such as the pre trip checklist of 'other options' (Range Rover airport transfer, 4 different types of pillows, exercise bike in your room etc etc).

I would agree with everything said in the previous positive reviews. The service is at a level that you probably will only get with a smaller hotel (this has 28 rooms). We normally prefer big hotels, but 41 was like a private club but with a homely feel thats hard to fault.

Once you've been you'll see why the reviews are consistently high, it really is a brilliant hotel.",5,2009,12,21
137,Fantastic service - treated like stars,"We booked hotel 41 mainly because of the location, we wanted to see Wicked (not so good!) so chose Victoria as an area to stay.  As a result of the reviews on here we decided to try Hotel 41.  We met up with friends over from Oz so wanted somewhere really nice for them to enjoy London from as they were having an extended stay.
From the moment we arrived we were amazed at the service we received, we were made to feel valued at every opportunity rather than just another guest at the hotel (as we have felt at other 5 stars a number rather than a valued person).  
The rooms are small but very nicely furnished (it even had a tv in the bathroom) and we couldnt fault the bed, bedding or towels.
We were also impressed with the free drinks and snacks throughout the day, canapes at teatime and plunder the pantry (breads, meats, fruits) available in the evening in the lovely lounge and all complimentary.
We celebrated our 10th anniversary and were thrilled to receive a complimentary cake in our room again another nice added touch.
All in all we wish we could have stayed longer and will defintely stay there again on our next visit to London.
It was well worth spending a little bit extra to receive a whole lot more and a memorable stay.",5,2009,12,17
137,Service with a smile,"Just got back from a business/leisure overnight in London. We always use Red Carnation hotels as we have found the service to be superb at whichever hotel we stay at. It is a while since I stayed at 41 but the service just gets better and better. Every member of staff treat you with friendly respect and I have yet to stay anywhere which does this better in London. The staf are sincere and talk to you rather than trotting out a few well worn phrases. Nothing appears to be too much of a problem and you would be a ery difficult customer indeed if you found fault with the service.

The rooms are well appointed and it is true that they are not the biggest but everything that you could want is here. The bed is comfortable and everything is immaculately clean. The lounge is superb and with this facility why spend more time in your room than necessary?!

Overall an excellent choice for a stay in London and once again well done to Red Carnation for setting the standards that others should aspire to.",5,2009,12,12
137,Hotel 41 is a pleasant surprise!,"Having been to London many times, we wanted to try something new. We booked Hotel 41 purely based on the previous reviews on Tripadvisor, so a big thanks to the other reviewers.

The hotel is located near Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station, which is very convenient and close to the tube, buses and taxis.  The reception is located on the 5th floor of the hotel in the lounge area. When we arrived, the floor manager welcomed us with a glass of champagne and a brief explanation of the hotel. The lounge is where all the activites happen: breakfast, afternoon tea, evening snacks, etc.  Snacks are complimentary all day long as are some fruit juices and water, which is very nice, offering a needed break druing a hectic day in London. WIFI is also free in the lounge area.

The rooms are quite small (normal for London), I would say it's about half the size of the Landmark London (which we stayed in the past), but everything you need is there including iPod dock station and DVD player. The bathroom has all the amenities you'll need (vanity kit, toothbrush, etc.) but again, it's tiny.  The bed is about an American full-size bed, which would not be comfortable for anyone over 185cm tall. If you are tall, request a room with a king-size bed.

You can eat lunch & dinner in the lounge as well. One night we had dinner at the Rubens Hotel, which is adjoined to Hotel 41. The food was good as was the service. 

There is no gym in the hotel but I believe you can get free access to a gym closeby upon request.

The service is fantastic. The staff really goes the extra mile to help the guests. Useful information was volunteered before asked. We really appreciated their efforts.  We will definitely consider coming back next time we're in London.",5,2009,12,11
137,Quality and service...,"We stayed in Hotel 41 for a few days in August.  The service was great, the people running the hotel were pleasant and couldn't do enough to make sure we enjoyed our time at 41.  The room was well decorated and had everything we needed.  It was a bit snug, but we were out all day so it didn't really matter.  The bed was comfy and the hotel was very quiet and peaceful.  The room had a full bathroom with plenty of hot water and heated towel racks.  Our every need was attended to (special thanks to Carey for helping us with tickets to the Mousetrap, directions etc).  We had dinner in the restaurant which was delicious and they mix a very tasty gin and tonic.  We also enjoyed 'raiding the pantry' when we got back late at night.  The library is a beautiful room where the guests can go day or night to relax and have a tea or coffee or something stronger and a snack.  It was good to go in there and wind down instead of straight back to our room after we'd been out.  Hotel 41 was convenient in that we were heading off on a bus tour and the departure spot was just around the corner over the road from 41.  Very convenient.  We would stay at Hotel 41 again and would recommend it to others.",5,2009,12,03
137,Hotel 41,"This hotel has a prime location right across from Buckingham Palace in the heart of London. It is a short walk to Green Park and Victoria Station. The service is most accomodating, though the prices can be a little steep, if you're travelling on a budget. Probably ideal for couples or small groups of friends",5,2009,11,30
137,"Impeccible service, lavish settings and perfect location. A+","I had the pleasure of staying here with my girlfriend during a weekend away in London for our anniversary, I cannot recommend it highly enough. We arrived late (after 11pm) on the friday night due to our flight being delayed and on arrival were greeted by the manager (Andrew) who had a very warm welcome and greeted us by name. The hotel itself is actually the 5th floor of reubens hotel which means that in order to gain entry after hours (without a room key) one must go through the reception of the adjoining hotel. The check-in was fast, efficient and friendly. We had booked a king-size room which in hindsight was a good idea as even the king size room was smaller than we had expected however the finishing touches were amazing. There were hot water bottles in the bed (sounds silly but on a cold london night in November was a welcome surprise!) and a small cake with ""Happy Anniversary"" on the icing waiting in the room. The detailing in the room was brilliant everything was just that little bit better than you would have expected (even from other 5 star hotels), the toiliteries were in dainty bottles with ornate screw tops, there were toothbrush and toothpaste sets of good quality design, shaving sets with an excellent razor (gold and wooden finish!) and ample towles, dressing gowns (one cloth/cotton one and one lounge one per guest). The mini-bar was well stocked if a little pricey- 5 pounds sterling for a portion of cashew nuts and 5pounds for a bottle of becks alcoholic beer. The entertainment provided in-room was fantastic with movies that are literally just out of the cinema available on-demand. Free wifi, tv-internet and ethernet, and guest services such as wake up calls etc were of course available.
From the moment of our arrival the staff were exemplary- an absolute credit to the hotel. We decided the day before our arrival that we would like to take in a show in the westend- the ""Wicked"" performance- and as it was sold out from every online source i could find I rang the hotel to see if they could arrange tickets for us. They did, not only did they find tickets to a sold out show they got us tickets four rows from the front, centre-stage! (the show is fantastic and anyone getting the opportunity should try to catch it). Similarly they recommended an Italian restaurant near the Apollo (at my request) and organised a reservation for a time after the show finished (10:45) even though the restaurant usually didn't take reservations after ten thirty!
In summary, the hotel itself was lavishly decorated with a modern black and white theme, the staff were amazingly professional and accomodating and the location of the hotel is perfect (2 minutes walk from Victoria tube station).
The only drawbacks (if you can call them that) is that the room was smaller than one would have expected and that if you arrive late in the evening then to gain entry you must go in through the adjoining Reubens 4star hotel.",5,2009,11,30
137,Best hotel I've ever stayed at,"Hotel 41 has elegance and charm without the stuffy upper class attitude. We were greeted by name throughout the hotel which added a nice personal touch. We spent the last night of our honeymoon here and were upgraded to a suite complete with a fresh bowl of fruit and a special dessert. The room was amazing - spacious, luxurious, and comfortable. It had a fireplace, two tvs and was equipped with surround sound. The shower had incredible pressure, and the robes/slippers were nice amenities. If you can afford it, do it!!",5,2009,11,28
137,Good Service but not great location,"Unless you are planning to visit the Queen, the location is not so great. The service at the hotel is very good, but the rooms are quite small and the air-conditioning is very noisy.
I definitely found it overrated.",3,2009,11,25
137,This must be the best place to stay in London,"The service on arrival set the tone for the whole of our stay.  The staff were friendly, welcoming without being falsely so, everything about the hotel makes you feel so relaxed.  Dinner in The Library was excellent.  Recommendations for eating ""out"" were also well thought out, and were always followed up by an enquiry as to whether we'd enjoyed it.  We used to think it wasn't possible to get this level of service in UK, but this would rival Dubai and the Far East.  Excellent.",5,2009,11,24
137,Upgraded to No. 41,"My original booking was with 41's sister hotel (within the same building) the Rubens, however on arrival I was advised we'd been upgraded to their 5* property on the 5th floor.

We were escorted to the 5th floor and to the Executive Lounge, where we were given champagne while we checked in.  Our room was ready ahead of check-in time (at around 1.15pm) and we were escorted to our room, after having received a guide around the facilities in the executive lounge (honesty bar, free fruit juices and snacks) and where breakfast would be served.

Room, although narrow once the king bed was split into twins, was nicely appointed with more than we needed for our one night stay!

Turn down service nice - scented candle to fragrance the room, slippers, choccie on the pillow, tomorrow's weather forecast etc.

Staff in the lounge were extremely attentive and pleasant.

Overall a very nice experience indeed!",5,2009,11,21
137,Incredible service!!,"We recently stayed at Hotel 41 for my husband's birthday after reading such excellent reviews on Tripadvisor.   The location is a stone's throw away from Victoria Station which is a perfect base for exploring London.  What makes the hotel so special is the service, which is incredible.  Right from check in and throughout the whole of our stay we were made to feel so welcome.  All the staff take the trouble to remember your name and nothing is too much trouble.  The whole experience was very relaxing.  My only quibble is the size of some of the rooms.  I chose a boutique hotel because I wanted something more intimate but was surprised at how tiny our room was; it was beautifully decorated but felt extremely cluttered and I did feel a little let down given the exorbitant room rate.  Nevertheless if you want a fantastic hotel for a special occasion I would highly recommend Hotel 41.",5,2009,11,17
137,"Hotel 41 -- Great location, good rooms, and good service.  Recommended.","Summary:  My wife and I stayed at the Hotel 41 in May 2009, as part of a business trip.  The rooms were somewhat small, but well appointed.  The location of the hotel is great, a short walk to Buckingham Place and Big Ben.

Pros:  Good location, good service and well-appointed rooms.  Tea in the library is also a must.

Cons:  Smallish rooms (this is Europe) and price.

The hotel is small, and located on the second floor a building just a few blocks from Buckingham Palace.  The check-in is accomplished in the Library, which is a large room, with a small bar, where they serve breakfast and afternoon tea.  I highly recommend taking a late afternoon tea here, especially after a long day of walking and seeing the sites.",5,2009,11,16
137,super service,"We recently stayed at hotel 41 for one night. From the moment you arrive you are very well looked after by friendly, efficient staff. The rooms are decorated to a very high standard and are very clean and tidy. 

We decided to take our breakfast in our room and I can not recommend this too highly. It arrived bang on time and was piping hot. 

The staff are very helpful and pleasant (this makes a nice change from some other 5* london hotels) and are a credit to the hotel.

Lovely stuff.",5,2009,11,08
137,Little Gem,"I visited this hotel with my 17 year old daughter on October 2009.  I stayed for one night before travelling on to my main holiday and then returned for a few days before returning home.
I initially walked past the front door as it is extremely unassuming but it is right next door to Reubens Hotel.  Once we walked through the door the service began.  The staff were friendly and extremely helpful and the whole experience was 1st class.  Andrew, the Manager was polite and very helpful and nothing was too much trouble. 
Everything you could wish for is provided in this hotel from free internet access to an honestly bar were you write down the drinks you take in the library and are trusted to do so.  In the evening there is a Butler's Pantry which has an assortment of food for the guests to eat (free of charge).
One of the nicest things I found was to return to my room and find little tea lights lit and the radio playing in the background so that I did not come back to a dark empty room.  If you are travelling to London then this is definately the place to stay.  I have stayed in a number of 5 star hotels and this one ticks all of the boxes.

ANDREW - I WILL BE BACK.",5,2009,11,07
137,Superb,"Stayed here for one night (wish it could have been more) and can only describe the experience as faultless. This hotel has  many fine qualities but the one that stands out the most is the professionalism of the staff. They were extremely attentive ,courteous & seemed extremely happy to make our stay as enjoyable as possible,nothing seemed to much trouble. I have no hesitation in reccomending this hotel to everyone.",5,2009,11,04
137,The best luxury hotel for the money in London,"This is without a doubt the best value in London if you are looking for a luxury hotel experience without the jaw dropping prices some of the other 5 star hotels charge.  First of all, the service the staff provided was top notch.  They are so friendly and accommodating it is almost a little too much (but believe me, I'm not complaining).  The staff tries their very best to accommodate you in every way.  They were constantly asking if there was anything they could do for us or get us to make our stay more enjoyable.  There were only two problems with the service that I experienced, one having to do with a maid who got a little pushy about giving us turn down service when we hadn't left our room because we were going for a late dinner, and with a mixed up dinner reservation (which I think was actually the restaurant's fault), and would not hold either of these experiences against Hotel 41 in any way.

I was going with my girlfriend for a romantic four day sightseeing weekend so I booked one of their king size rooms instead of the regular double to get a little more space.  For only a marginal amount of pounds more a night I think this was a wise decision because the room was larger than expected.  It had a king size bed, a small sitting area, large closets and a bathroom with a shower and a tub.  The room is immaculate and the black and white decor is very, very charming.  My girlfriend was very impressed and knowing how much luxury hotel rooms can cost in London I was very grateful that they made me look so good.

The location in my eyes was perfect.  It is right next to the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace.  This means that you are not too far from the action of the Picadilly Circus/Leicester Square/Trafalgar Square tourist attractions, but far enough away to not have to deal with the craziness that comes with being right in the middle of it all.  You are also equally close to Knightsbridge and neighborhoods like Kensington and Notting Hill.  The hotel is a two minute walk from the Victoria tube station and the Victoria Palace Theatre where Billy Elliott is performed (great show by the way).  

I loved Hotel 41 for all of the above reasons.  The staff and their service, the decor and style, and the location and access met our needs perfectly.  If I had to say one thing that you might not like about it, was the size.  I believe it is on one single floor.  The hallways are small and the rooms are not huge.  But like I said, we thought it was perfect for us and I just thought I would point this out in case somebody is not looking for a smaller boutique hotel which this one is.  One of the best hospitality experiences I have ever had.  Would stay there again in a heart beat.",5,2009,11,02
137,A home away from Home in a great location,"My husband and I  have just spent 7 terrific nights at hotel 41. The loacation is great , a 2 minute walk from Victoria Station, across the road from the Royal Mews and Green Park, St James Park and The Mall are around the corner. The rooms are charming, very comfortable bed, spotlessly clean, lovely touches at night like candles lit in the bathroom, a treat on the pillow etc. There is free internet for guests in the business area. The staff are the best. Nothing is too much trouble they always have time for a chat, and the service is excellent. Andrew the Manager is a friendly charming man who goes out of his way to ensure that you stay is a wonderful experience. During the day small treats and bottles of cool drink are left out complimentary for guests and in the evening, complimentary ,plunder the pantry, where smoked salmon, cold meats, crusty bread and salads are put out for guests is fantastic. We stayed at the Raffles Hotel in Singapore on our way home to Australia and we were somewhat disappointed in the level of service after staying at Hotel 41. We will be back next year we had such a great time. Thank you Andrew and staff for making our visit a memorable one. If you truly want a home away from home stay at Hotel 41.",5,2009,11,01
137,"The hotel, location, room, food & staff all made this stay an absolutely wonderful experience and I can't wait to return","This was our first time to London and I wanted to stay in a really nice hotel.  I picked 41 because of the TripAdvisor reviews.  I don’t think I could have made a better choice.  We had 5 nights to spend in London and only stayed here.  From the moment that we walked in, the experience was awesome.  All of the staff was welcoming and ready to do whatever was needed.  We stayed in an Executive King Room, which was beautiful and roomy, as was the bathroom.  We were celebrating our anniversary and after a day of activities, we returned to find a cake in our room.  Our package included a complimentary dinner in The Library (a hotel restaurant).  I expected it to be good but it was excellent.  Both the food and service were wonderful.  A full English breakfast each day was also included in our package.  There was a nice selection, the food was great and the service was wonderful.  I believe the hotel is in an excellent location to see London.  The Victoria Station is nearby for underground access.  Buckingham Palace is right down the road and walk just a little bit further you will get to Big Ben, Parliament and Westminster Abbey.  I have no complaints about our stay here and when we return to London, we know where we’re staying!",5,2009,10,29
137,a pearl,"relaxing atmosphere... room not very roomy but very clean and well furnished.
I recommend. Staff very welcoming and helpful.",5,2009,10,28
137,Hotel 41 is outstanding in every way,"This boutique hotel absolutely surpassed our  expectations.  We have traveled to many of the world's most beautiful cities and regions, but have never had such a relaxing stay in such fine surroundings, due in part to the wonderful staff and their level of service.  The decor is very stylish and well done, but it is the attitude of staff and the level of amenities and service that elevated our experience here to one of true excellence.  Daily complimentary cocktail and canape hour (it actually lasts for two),  complimentary internet (not yet common in London hotels), and wonderful suggestions from staff for things to do and see while in London all enhanced our stay.  The location was outstanding....directly across the street from the Queen's Mews portion of Buckingham Palace.  The rooms were stylishly finished with quality as a priority, the turndown service surpassed any previous experience we've had (it included soft music playing, floating candles lit, etc), the washrooms have a separate shower in addition to the charming bathtub, we appreciated the heated towel rack.....and on it goes.  There is a gorgeous glass ceiling in part of the executive lounge (which is available for all guest to use).  Thank you to all of the wonderful staff at Hotel 41.  We hope to return to London in the future and look forward to staying again with you.",5,2009,10,23
137,Best stay anywhere,"Having stayed in many beautiful hotels, Hotel 41 set a standard hard to match. The room was luxurious with a bed that was like sleeping between two clouds. But the single thing that makes Hotel 41 such a stand out was the personal, friendly service. The staff provded outstanding service on every level with genuine care for our comfort and enjoyment. Location couldn't be better with transportation or walking to destinations easily accessible.
 In the  gorgeous lounge, complimentary snacks and beverages are offered anytime day or night. A daily delicious breakfast was availible before beginning each day. A visit to remember! I highly recommend Hotel 41 and will return someday.",5,2009,10,21
137,An absolute treasure,"My favorite of 5 boutique hotels during a 3wk trip to London and Scotland. The entrance is a little tricky to find but worth the search. Another world awaits each guest once inside. An understated, unpretentious elegance permeates every aspect of this hotel, from the personal service to the appointment of the guest rooms to the food. Every request was tended immediately and with graciousness. A quiet haven in the midst of the hustle of Buckingham Palace Road. I was sad when we had to leave.",5,2009,10,19
137,Fantastic,My daughter and her husband booked us in to this what I can only describe as magical hotel to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary and my 60th birthday. What heaven hotel 41 is the staff are fantastic and we were bowled over by the whole experience. We shall be going back and I would recommend this hotel to everyone. The resident manager Andrew Gortchacow makes you welcome from the moment you step in the building to the last moment you leave. Truly Fantastic.,5,2009,10,19
137,"Very cozy and clubby - staff tried very hard""","This is really more of a ""clubby"" hotel than the traditional hotel.  Without sounding ""over the top"" this is the first time in 40 years of traveling to London that I did not stay at one particular 5 star, world renowned hotel - my only past London hotel to compare to.  I was impressed once I got used to the size.  The rooms are great and the staff gives it their all  to please - and most of the time they are spot on.  If you're a NYer in a rush - bring a patience pill.  The ""front desk staff"" (which is just someone at a table) treats everyone with great detail so if there is someone ahead of you, bring a magazine or your blackberry to kill time and they don't have the same level of expertise as a 5 star luxury hotel would have for recommending and getting reservations at the top / hot restaurants.  But that's it for the downside... the staff was absolutely willing to do anything to accomodate.  We were there for tea which was lovely and there were many personal touches throughout our stay that quite frankly, for the cost of the room, was as good as any 5 star luxury hotel.   It was a happy, charming place.",5,2009,10,18
137,Absolute perfection!!!!!,"Wow - this hotel was just perfection from the second we stepped in.  The service was impeccable.  Everyone was SO NICE!  The room was beautiful - the shower was AWESOME.  I think I could have stayed in the shower and the bed the entire time we were there, only there's too much to see in London!!  
The location is also really great, as it is less than a two block walk to the Victoria Underground station - the underground (subway) is really easy to maneuver, so the fact that the station is so close to the hotel is very convenient.  It is also walking distance to some more simple eateries like EAT and Garfunkles for a quick meal.  The hotel even has cozy bathrobes and slippers.  There is also complimentary snacks every night.  I liked this place so much I didn't want to leave!!!  I can honestly say this gets a 100% positive rating.  I can't wait to go back!!",5,2009,10,14
137,Unbelievable service,My brother and I spent 2 nights at 41.  The service was unbelievable.  They seemed to anticipate our every need.  The location was perfect and we took several walks to nearby spots of interest.  Always had a little snack for us and even an early breakfast ready for us on the morning of our early departure. The bellman was waiting for our 6:30 call for our luggage and was at the door in less than 30 seconds. I would love to go back and let them take care of me for a month.,5,2009,10,14
137,Excellent Service in a Beautiful Hotel,"This was our ""Splurge"" hotel of our anniversary trip and it was well worth it.  The staff was polite and attentive from check-in to check-out.  We stayed 2 nights and had high tea and breakfast in their Library, which was very nice.   They even held a bag and sent it on to our next hotel, for a small fee.
This was not a cheap hotel or a budget stay but that's not why we chose this hotel.  We wanted a luxury hotel in a convenient location with excellent service.  We were not disappointed.",5,2009,10,11
137,Pure indulgence,"This was our second time at Hotel 41 and it was everybit as good as our first experience. It is hugely expensive but worth every penny to stay somewhere so gorgeous and be made to feel so special by the excellent staff and surroundings. All the extras (plunder the pantry, welcome drink etc) help to set it apart from other 5 star hotels but what really makes it is the excellent customer service that the staff give - they make you seem as though nothing is too much trouble and the level of attention that you recieve is just right. We will hopefully be back for more once we have saved enough!",5,2009,10,05
137,Amazing Service makes up for small rooms,"We stayed 5 nights this September, and found that any of the ""con's"" were surpassed by the large number of ""pro's"". 

Pro's: 1) EXECELLENT service- the hotel has a ""whatever, whenever"" policy- staff was always asking if they could get us something. Staff was very helpful with recommending places to go and see, and staff was always friendly. 
2) room and hotel was very clean
3) beds were comfortable & linens very soft yet crisp
4) breakfast, snacks and drinks were always available & plentiful

Con's: 1) hotel desperately needs wireless internet throughout (in the rooms)
2) our room was extremely small, and had bulky unneccessary furniture which if removed could have made room seem larger
3) the tub/shower needed a shower curtain- while the set up looked sleek, it allowed water to get everywhere in the bathroom-making things very slippery",4,2009,10,03
137,Absolutely magnificent!,"It was a wonderful experience!! We arrived really early in the morning (remember to tell the taxi driver that Hotel 41 is next to The Rubens Hotel as ours did not know where it was). We were allowed to freshen up in another room as ours was still occupied.  Our room was small but gloriously luxurious: gorgeous range of toiletries; olives and ice in buckets; candles illuminating the bathroom in the evenings; heated towel rails; fluffy towels; wide choice of pillows; billowy mattresses; large mini-fridge selection; excellent room service and food; and, best of all, there are ""midnight"" snacks available in the dining area/library from 20h30.  The hotel is really central : we were able to walk everywhere as I did not want to catch the underground and miss out experiencing London (although there is an underground nearby).  Hotel arranged chaffeur for airport (and will arrange anything else you require during your stay). Our time at Hotel 41 was absolutely fantastic!!! A big thank you to all the staff who spoilt us so much!!",5,2009,10,01
137,Service you dream about,"Our stay at Hotel 41 was just perfect. The staff treats you with great respect as if you belong to an exclusive club. Any request was tackled with gusto and we were pleased with all aspects of the hotel.

You have got to stay at Hotel 41 if you like terrific service and a small hotel where everyone knows who you are.",5,2009,09,29
137,Wonderful,"Fantastic service and great attention to detail. The rooms are beautifully decorated and have all the things you would expect. Location was brilliant, two minute from the tube and office. I love the fact it it has a beautiful entrance hall and then you go up in a lift to the floor where the Hotel 41 rooms are. Rooms are very quiet and safe,

Breakfast is all a la carte and very good.

I would stay here again.",4,2009,09,27
137,Fantastic Birthday Treat!,"I booked Hotel 41 for  2 nights purely because of the fab reviews it received on TripAdvisor and was not at all disappointed. The room and facilities are pretty much on par with any other similarly priced 5* hotel in London, but what set it apart from the others was the fantastic staff. All of the ladies were genuinely friendly, polite and nothing  was too much trouble for them. Highly recommended!",5,2009,09,24
137,Best place for excellent service,"We wanted  a place to relax and spend a couple of days after disembarking from a Northern Europe cruise, as a nice transition before heading back home. 41 was ideal for this - as my husband put it, it was the closest to being on the cruise ship without actually being at sea. The service and attention to detail is wonderful. My husband is diabetic, so having the ""plunder the pantry"" feature was great for him - he could nibble throughout the day and keep his blood sugar under control. Afternoon tea was wonderful, with the very best scones we've had in a long time. 

The hotel is located in a wonderful spot, right across the street from the Mews, Queen's Gallery, and just down the street from Buckingham Palace. The staff will assist with anything you need, from making dinner recommendations/reservations, booking theater tickets, providing maps, arranging for airport transportation, confirming your flight arrangements - whatever you need. They make a point of knowing who you are and addressing you by name. The private entrance is a nice touch and adds a feeling exculsivity to the hotel.

Our room was nice in size, with all the little touches we've come to expect: thick fluffy towels, nice tub for soaking, luxurious robes/slippers, and a heavenly bed that is SO comfortable.  Yes, it's pricey (especially with current exchange rates), but it is worth it.",5,2009,09,10
137,"Once again, perfect in every way!!","I just got back from a two week holiday to London, Paris, Venice, Florence, Rome and Barcelona, and Hotel 41 was by far the best!!! This hotel is beautiful, quite, charming, in a great location, and the staff is outstanding! I really do not have anything but great things to say about this Hotel 41, my only regret is not remembering all of the names of the staff members so that I could mention them in this review. However, I do remember that one again the resident manager, Andrew Gortchacow was extremely helpful and went out of his way to make sure that my girlfriend had a special 30th birthday by surprising us with a fabulous birthday cake in our room.",5,2009,09,08
137,Just superb service as always,"I don't normally write reviews, but I just couldn't believe that someone had seen fit to write a poor review of this wonderful hidden gem. I guess some people will just never be satisfied. The hotel is small. That's the point. It means you get just wonderful personal service. I've stayed at the Landmark, 1 Aldwych and other big 5 star hotels, and yes they have nice spas and hugely expansive menus, but  you feel just like any other hotel dweller. Here, the wonderful staff get to know you, find out about your stay and add nice little touches to suit. For example, romantic turn-down service on anniversaries, cake on your birthday, etc. For staff attitude, politeness, and not over-the-top stuffiness, this is simply the best hotel in London.",5,2009,09,01
137,Hotel 41 Never fails to deliver,"We have just returned from our second stay at Hotel 41  and after such a special 1st visit I was a little anxious that as sometimes happens things may have changed for my 2nd visit. I should not have worried from the moment we entered the intimate pre-reception hall we were welcomed as special friends with a smile and a ""good to have you back"" despite it being over a year since our 1st visit. Again guided to the private lift that only goes to the 5th floor of this boutique hotel. First to the Executive Lounge to process the formalities of check in, this lounge still exudes the calm and excellence of an exclusive gentleman's club. Throuhgout our stay ALL the staff attended to us in the most friendly and courtious way taking a genuine interest in our daily plans and in an unobtrusive way making it clear they were there to help in any way possible to make our stay at Hotel 41 and indeed London an enjoyable one. Our room was immaculate upon checking in and kept that way throughout our stay by the housekeeping staff. This is no ordinary Hotel experience, I love Hotel life and I am going to make it my mission to travel the world to find a hotel as good as Hotel 41 ..... I don't doubt it will take me a VERY long time....To be treated in a friendly way and made to feel special on a special occasion then Hotel 41 is the place for you.",5,2009,08,31
137,FIRST CLASS PERFECTION,"This was a return stay for us, private entrance at the side of The Reubens this hotel is the top floor and much like a gentlemans private club of the old days, it was amazing from the minute we entered the door we were treated with the utmost respect and care and this was highlighted by the genuine way in which we were spoken to.  When they say have a nice day here they really mean it.

We had a double exec room facing the royal mews, the room was quite large, lovely bathroom and every amenity provided, nice to have a hotel room that looks plush and classy but isn't all girly in its design.

The food is brought from the hotel downstairs and is of a high quality, there is a good menu for most parts of the day and night, even a light menu from 11:30pm to 7am.
Breakfast is lovely and substantial if you go for the hot food.  

We love the honesty bar its nice to feel trusted and every night there are complimentary nibbles too.

For location you cant fault it, out the door turn right and its a 5 min stroll to the front of the Palace, then down The Mall to Trafalgar or through the park to The Ritz.

Basically this hotel is the best for service, quality and attention to detail.

To all the team thankyou for making my stay perfect again.

C.Sunley",5,2009,08,28
137,A perfect wedding night!,"We stayed at hotel 41 on the night of our wedding and the following night.  We were expecting a most perfect stay and we were not let down!  Staff extremely hospitable, cosy and well decorating room and the little extras were lovely.  We were so excited at our wedding reception party that my husband and I ate very little.  On our return to the hotel at about 2am we were starving!  We went to the lobby and the staff prepared us a platter of hams, cheese, salad and bread!  It was delightful!
The breakfasts are first class.
On our second night we had a 3 course meal in The Library (part of the 2 night hotel package we had booked) and it was PERFECT.  A elegant and romatic experience, and again the staff were wonderful.

We recommend this hotel to our friends and family...and to you!",5,2009,08,18
137,This hotel is fantastic,"This hotel is really going the extra mile.  I spent the weekend there with my husband, brother and sister in law and we cannot fault it.   Far better than many well known five strt hotels. The staff are exceptional (Andrew the manager, ladies who served breakfast and staff in library restuarant in particular) and it lays on many of the extras other hotels promise but never quite live up to expectations.  This hotel exceeded our expectations at every turn. The location is great - right beside Victoria tube station and a two minute walk from B palace.  Lovely breakfast and dinner in the Library, great bar with pianist, v. comfortable room with turn down service including water and chocolates, nice toiletries, drinks on arrival.  One observation (not criticism) rooms and in fact whole hotel very compact.  Would certainly recommend and return!!",5,2009,08,17
137,Lived up to all of our expectations...,"Stayed at Hotel 41 for one night to celebrate our anniversary and were not disappointed. The staff made us feel welcome from the minute we walked through the door and, although we had booked the Sparkle Package (and so anticipated the very welcome bottle of Laurent Perrier on ice when we returned after a long day's shopping) it was the unexpected extra touches that made our stay. The room was lovely, with the biggest bed I've ever seen (and a docking station for your iPod a nice touch) and the bathroom was clean and well stocked with all the luxuries you'd need. The hotel is perfectly placed for anyone arriving into Victoria Station, as it's only a short walk away. The exclusive entrance and reception for Hotel 41 guests (separate from the Rubens Hotel which occupies the lower floors of the building) gives a VIP feel. As other reviewers have said, the executive lounge where you are greeted/checked in and which also incorporates the bar and breakfast room is in the style of an elegant gentleman's club. There are, of course, cheaper hotels in London but, if you want to treat yourself and are looking for somewhere that bit special, I'd wholeheartedly recommend this hotel.",5,2009,08,16
137,"Outstanding Comfort, Service and Hospitality","My husband and I recently stayed at Hotel 41.  It is impossible to share every reason that our stay was a delight.  The room was beautiful, with a comfortable bed and luxurious linens. Not only was the ""standard"" service beyond our expectations (ice, lemon slices, olives, cookies and candlelight delivered with the nightly turn-down service), but the staff went out of their way to meet our individual needs.  For instance, the first night we stayed, I telephoned the front desk and asked if they could give me the weather forecast for the next day.  Then, each night when we returned from a long day of sight-seeing, perched on the bed was a neatly typed notecard with the next day's forecast..  This is just one example of many of their attempt to fulfill and anticipate our every need.  I highly recommend 41!",5,2009,08,12
137,Treated like Royalty,"We stayed at the 41 for 5 glorious nights in room 4101. I was traveling with my 13 year old daughter to celebrate her birthday. Our room was beautiful and it faced the Royal Mews and around the corner to Buckingham Palace. It was like being the Queen’s next door neighbors. Every morning we were greeted with a friendly wake-up call (a real live person and not a mechanical prerecorded voice) follow by coffee and pastries in our room, and then we would go into the Executive Lounge to enjoy our breakfast before we leave for a full day of sights-seeing and shopping. Andrew and his team of staff could not have done more for us during our stay to make this a truly most amazing trip for me and my daughter. Each evening we would retired to the lounge for drinks and on more than one occasion we would “Plunder the Pantry” for delicious treats after returning from the theater or shopping.

It would be our pleasure to return to 41 and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who would love to live like a Queen, even if it is just for a few days.
   
To the staff of 41, you guys are the best and we hope to see you next year.",5,2009,08,11
137,If only I could afford this luxury everytime,"Wow, what a place, beautiful boutique hotel, fantastic location, impeccable rooms and fantastic service. We just loved the whole atmosphere and there seemed nothing that we wanted for.

The old gentleman club feel, black and white decor, armchairs for breakfast and the attention to detail would mean that we would always want to return, but it's a little costly and therefore would only ever be a treat.

The only negative point is that the front door is around 20 feet inside the congestion zone and therefore you end up paying £8 midweek just to drop you luggage off.

If you can afford it it's well worth visiting, an absolute delight.",5,2009,08,08
137,"I was very, very disappointed","Let me begin by saying that for my girlfriend's birthday, I wanted to take her somewhere special, and Hotel 41 seemed as though it would be the perfect place to stay in London. The website sold it to me really well, with nice little touches such as a complimentary glass of champagne on arrival, complimentary fruit and jellybeans in the room etc. 

These 'extra touches' did not exist. They were a fallacy; we were not offered our champagne reception, and the jellybeans etc were actually a chargeable purchase from the minibar (with the price printed on the side). Despite confirming with staff beforehand that we would be arriving early, we were still made to wait hours for our room even though we had been assured that this wouldn't happen.

With regards to the room itself, it was generally clean although very small. Our 'state of the art entertainment system' however, was an old small tv without good enough reception to watch any channels. Although we found the bathroom to be generally clean, this did not excuse the PUBIC HAIRS that we found on the bathmat and in the bath. Needless to say we decided against using it. 

The last point I will make is that the staff, although friendly, do not appear to understand the concept of their own  'do not disturb' light. Despite only staying for one night, we were disturbed whilst we had indicated that we didn't wish to be, asking if we wanted clean sheets. I can only assume the sheets were clean when we arrived, and we'd only been there a few hours, so it was hardly an emergency worth annoying guests who had made it clear that they didn't want disturbing!

Overall it was a very disappointing experience. The hotel is nice but my time there was marred by not receiving what I was promised, the hairs in the bath and being disturbed and offered clean sheets just hours after checking in.  I have stayed in many hotels in London and can tell you that there are cleaner and more honest hotels for less than half what i paid to stay here. It was a huge letdown and not the experience that I had promised my partner.",2,2009,08,06
137,City centre opulence,"Stayed two nights to celebrate my wife's 40th in June on the weekend of the Trooping Of The Colour (not planned!) A discreet entrance from the road and a trip in the lift from 'reception one' takes you into a place of luxury and 'reception two' which I imagine to resemble a scene from a discreet  House Of Lords Gentlemans Club from 50 years ago! (wood pannelling, great fireplace, leather sofas and large bookcases with a small bar area where the night porter serves your night cap!) all this overlooked by a mezzanine floor and atreum if you like to look down on your fellow guests! The bedroom/lounge and bathroom were tastefully decorated in the signature black and white. I imagined the bedroom to be a little more spacious and I'm at a loss as to the need for a flat screen tv in the bathroom situated twix bath and shower resulting in a poor view from both! The staff were very attentive and the breakfasts were faultless. The location is superb being minutes from the front of Buckingham Palace and a short stroll from Victoria Train Station.",4,2009,08,02
137,"Complete comfort, luxury and style","This boutique hotel transports you into comfort, luxury and style the moment you walk through the door.
Our Eurostar train from Paris to London had broken down and we were 4 hours late arriving. We felt tired, dirty and frustrated when we got to Hotel 41. Several of the staff immediately jumped into action offering us whatever we wanted to drink before we even began checking into the hotel. I requested a glass of red bordeaux and my husband a specific beer and within two minutes, they were in our hands. Complimentary.
My husband's birthday was the next day and I requested a cake to be delivered to the room before we departed for the airport at 9:30am. Even though it was 6pm when I made the request and the pastry chef had left for the day, the concierge said she would take care of it, and she did. They brought a beautiful - and delicious - cake with coffee to us precisely after we finished breakfast. It was complete with a candle and Happy Birthday and a lovely fondant present decoration on top. My husband was surprised and pleased.
The room was stylishly decorated and immaculately clean. The bed was comfortable and wonderful. I checked the option of aroma therapy pillows when we checked in and they were delivered promptly and were such a nice touch.
The treats in the room were so tasty. And even though we didn't have enough time to enjoy the pantry or the tea service, it looked fantastic.
The only possible criticism I could offer was that our room was rather small, but aren't most of them in Europe?
I look forward to staying at Hotel 41 the next time I'm in London.",5,2009,08,02
137,A luxurious sanctuary  in the west end of London,"I selected  this hotel  for my recent trip to London,  based on the excellent  previous reviews on  the trip advisor  website.  After  a ten day stay , I can confirm all of the wonderful comments.
 I was contacted by email by the manager prior to my arrival to determine whether I needed any theatre or dinner reservations, or transportation from Heathrow. The hotel was easy to find and is conveniently located  a 5  minute walk from Victoria station . (Also very close to the theatres where Wicked  and Billy Elliot  are currently playing)
On arrival we were warmly greeted by reception and escorted upstairs to the Hotel which is on the fifth floor. We were offered a welcoming beverage and check in was very straightforward.

We were in a south facing room for two days , and it was lovely. I had previously requested a room overlooking the Royal Mews and it became available on our third day   Every evening when we arrived back at the hotel there was a cooler with ice and a tray of lemon and lime slices and olives, the beds were turned down, candies left on the pillows and  a candle lit in the bathroom..There was also an invitation to join the staff in the lounge for  sweets.

The room was beautiful. The photos on the hotel website are accurate. The ceiling was high,with lovely multi layered moulding,:wainscotting divided the contrasting textures of the creamy white walls. The draperies , many mirrors and Black and white mofif create  a rich  affect.
The bed was very comfortable with superb quality linens and duvets. all embroidered with the 41 logo
There was a white orchid on the bedside table 
The view over the Royal Mews was lovely and every morning the room was flooded with light.
A hair dryer, iron , ironingboard  was available and in the bathroom,dental kit and excellent quatity toiletries, including shampoo, hair conditioner, shower gel etc.
The room was quiet

The staff to client ratio is high and anything you ask for is accomodated. The manager , Andrew secured excellent seats for us to Wicked and other musicals.

Continental breakfast was included in my room rate  and was excellent- a variety of cereals, fruits ,artisinal breads , good cheeses,  juices ,yougourts, cold cuts,etc.

At night the staff leave out fruits , salad, smoked salmon cold cuts  beads etc in the lounge for the guests.

I loved the location of the hotel. It is in a quiet area and overlooks  the Royal Mews of Buckingham palace and within walking distance for us for all the major attractions.

I would stay here again when I return to London and recommend it highly.",5,2009,08,01
137,Best service of any hotel,"My wife and I stayed here when we went to the Wimbledon finals in July.

We really liked the 'club style' atmosphere and the service was just incredible -it felt like you had 10 personal assistants on call (breakfast was also superb). Rooms are not enormous and may have too much furntiure in them for those who like a minimalist room but they were very nice and bathrooms are suberb",5,2009,07,29
137,Not worth the cost,"Ok - I'm sure people will disagree with this but...

This is a small hotel next to Buckingham Palace. I stayed there for 1 night in July 2009. Frankly the place is massively overpriced - I paid £499 for a suite for one night expecting a really great place. I am not given to complaining but below you will find a copy of the feedback i sent them at their request:

Dear xxx
 
I never normally bother sending feedback - except on Trip Advisor, but as you have sent this email and due to the cost of the room I felt I should.
 
I'm afraid I was not impressed at all with the room I was given (4116 I think - right next to the bar).
 
1) The sitting room area was tiny compared to the way it was advertised on your website (paid for a suite). Barely room to swing a cat, no settee just 2 small armchairs.
 
2) When I arrived I was offered the master suite - I had previously requested it but it was unavailable at the time. When I declined I was asked to wait 15 mins as 'maintenance were just doing something to my room'. No problem, however i suspect that the room had not been prepared prior to my arrival as they expected me to pay extra for the master suite. The room was not clean - dust everywhere, and dare I say it, pubic hairs on the shelf next to the television. Battery for the remote control for the stereo had run out.  The bathroom was also very dusty, in particular the shower enclosure which was very run down. 
The room was very hot - the air conditioning had been turned to 16 C adding to my suspicions that the room had not been prepared, and that this is a room that is used for guests just staying for a night, or for emergencies.
 
3) Within 5 mins of me being in the room I was in the shower when I thought I heard a banging sound downstairs - which obviously I ignored. The sound persisted so I put a towel round me and made my way downstairs at which point the door opened exposing me to the guests that happened to be walking down the corridor at the time. This was someone wanting to give me several 'welcome letters' and a weather forecast, no doubt expecting a tip.
 
To be frank - whilst the hotel has obvious old world charm, I have stayed in cleaner travel lodge rooms, and for £500/night, making it one of the most expensive hotels in London, I would expect much much better.
***********************************************************************
Basically anyone that would pay £500/night for this place when there are so many great (and much cheaper) options in London has more money than sense!",2,2009,07,28
137,Great little hotel,"Stayed just for one night for a romantic weekend in London and it ticked all the boxes, great service, great location and some lovely little touches that made it special. The hotel is a little smaller than I thought it would be - we stayed in room 4101 which was great, only minor complaint would be that the TV was a little too small or too far away making it slightly difficult to watch in bed but this is only a really small complaint. Breakfast was good, as was 'the pantry' offering some really excellent cold meats and bread after 8.30pm.",5,2009,07,27
137,Wonderful hotel,"I had the pleasure of staying at the 41 London in July, with my 9-year-old daughter and my parents, and I have to say it deserves all the good reviews it gets from other travellers.All the staff members are extremely polite. Andrew, the resident manager, will do what it takes to make sure you have a pleasant stay, he is really a nice guy and very professional. Breakfast is delicious, and the complimentary pantry a nice touch. Right next to Buckingham Palace, its location coud not be better. If you don't book this hotel, at least try one of the others from the Red Carnation chain , you won't regret it!",5,2009,07,26
137,Best Hotel I've ever been in,"The 41 truly is the best hotel I've ever stayed in. All the perfect reviews it has, all the awards - they're all well deserved. 

From the moment you enter the hotel, you're treated like a king. 41's small size allows the wonderful staff to give every guest maximum attention.

Too bad I just had a one night stay, I'm looking forward to return.",5,2009,07,24
137,Good Hotel but not sure it lives up to the hype,"We stayed in Hotel 41 for 5 days in June 09. The room was fantastically furnished, very comfortable and unique with the black and white theme although quite small. We booked an executive king. We stayed with another couple who for the same rate were given a much bigger room. There is a lot of road work going on around the hotel which we constantly heard during our stay. The staff were really helpful and friendly but the concierge or desk at the entrance really needs people with more local knowledge. This hotel is in a great position for walking to local tourist attractions but really lacks decent nearby cafes, pubs, shops and restaurants.",4,2009,07,20
137,Highly recommended despite small rooms,"I agree with most of the reviews here at Tripadvisor.  Yes, rooms are small (we stayed in an Executive King) and the layout was awkward, but it was very clean and nicely decorated.  Amenities are great - nice toiletries, wifi, complimentary snacks, candles at turndown.  Service was also top notch - with one exception:  check in.  Granted we checked in early - around 11am after a long flight from Los Angeles.  We were offered drinks right away and were told room is not ready but will be ready in a ""few minutes.""  We knew check-in was 3pm and was fine with that but since we were told room would be ready in a few minutes, we waited in the lounge instead of going out and coming back later.  The room was not ready until two hours later.  They did offer us snacks and drinks while we waited but they should have just given us better time estimate.  Other than that, everything else was great.  Highly recommended.",4,2009,07,18
137,"An experience that will last a life time...incredible, simply the best hotel","Our visit was for a extremely important ocassion of which I hope it would be perfect. It was that and more. The staff, and by that I mean all staff from the bell boy to the manager were welcoming, they could not do enough for you and more importantly you could tell they enjoyed it. 
They wanted our stay to be perfect and were excited for us and nervous to make it as we had hoped. Hotel 41 London surpass our expectations and we will rememeber our stay for the rest of our lives, we will be back and will recommend to all. 
Truly faultless from the rooms, cleanliness and service to rival any hotel.",5,2009,07,18
137,"Terrific staff and location, but not inexpensive","We spent five nights at Hotel 41, and it was a great base for touring London. The staff could not be more helpful, and worked very hard to fulfill our requests. I suggest spending the extra few pounds for the executive room; the standard rooms are pretty small. This is not an inexpensive hotel, but it is London, where everything costs more.",4,2009,07,17
137,Luxury with a Wii,"Oh My God....

This place is fantastic; the advice from them for our show was great.

WILL be staying here again.

Right opposite the Mews, and a stone from Buck House.",5,2009,07,14
137,"Great service, nicely decorated but small rooms","We stayed two nights in an upgraded king room.  First, the hotel is hard to find.  There are no signs.  And the cab drivers have not generally heard of it.  So be ready with the address and be firm that there is indeed a hotel there.  Or tell them to take you to the Ruben hotel next door and walk to the proper private entrance.

The hotel is very nicely decorated, and very private.  They are attentive to service.  We had a small problem with housekeeping and the staff immediately apologised, made an effort to fix, and then checked back later.  So staff and service is very focused, which is unlike many london hotels.

The executive lounge for breakfast, drinks and snacks is nice, as is the decor throughout.  The rooms are well decorated and comfortable -- but too small for the amount of furniture in them.  Many london hotels have small rooms and this hotel would do better to remove the desk or make a pull out desk, and move to flat screen tv to make more space.  It was difficult to get from bathroom to sitting area due to limited space between the desk and bed.  They should just remove some furniture and it would be fine.

overall, nice amenities, comfortable room and very service focused staff.",4,2009,07,14
137,Simply the best,"My husband and I found Hotel 41 on trip advisor and thought it sounded like we should give it a go. I have to say, i can't fault any single element of the experience. 

The location is fantastic, the hotel is full of lovely touches, the service is warm, friendly and professional - and our room, the conservatory suite, was beautiful.

Just go! It's a wonderful experience - the big London hotels could learn a thing or two from this place...",5,2009,07,14
137,"Small rooms, high price, but otherwise incredible hotel","This was the second year in a row I have stayed at Hotel 41 while I was in London.  The first time I traveled alone, but this time I was with my sister.  I have realized that it makes a difference because the King size room is suitable for one person (barely) but it's WAY too small for two people.  They try to do way too much with the small space -- two beds, two lounge chairs, a dining table, a desk, and two large cabinets.  With that said, the service is INCREDIBLE.  They will try to find you anything you need while you're staying at the hotel (and even in advance of your stay).  The main lounge area is very nice and it's easy to waste away the hours there having drinks, reading the paper, using the internet, or watching their flat screen.  There is excellent high speed internet access throughout the entire hotel.  The hotel is in a great location -- right across the street from Buckingham Palace.  The hotel is, predictably, not cheap. Also, no fitness center or spa.  Nevertheless, I rank is in the top 5 hotels I've ever stayed at and will probably continue to stay there in the future.",4,2009,07,12
137,Overpriced - Pokey Rooms,"I cant fault the staff and location of this hotel but the decor and size of the rooms is totally out of line with the exhorbitant rates being charged. I stayed in a split level suite the decor was dated and the room incredibly pokey. For the price I was paying I expected a huge amount more  - There are far better quality  'Luxury' hotels available in Lodon that are better value than this place.

That said the staff were incredibly helpful and the Hotels only standout asset - if only the rest of the hotel could live up to the quality of their staff.......",3,2009,07,06
137,Hotel 41 sets the standard (that you wish other hotels would follow),"It is tough to describe what a perfect hotel this is, as it excels in every way I can imagine.  From the moment you arrive, you are treated like deeply loved family, as if you were arriving at the exquisite home of a dear friend.  Of course the hotel has all of the requisites of a fine boutique hotel: for example, immediately offering refreshments (water, excellent wine or champagne, martinis, liquor, whatever your pleasure) upon arrival, complimentary snacks/hors d’oeuvres delivered to your room every afternoon, fine linens, wonderful beds, exacting décor. Don’t want to deal with check-in when you arrive?  No problem – they’ll take you to your room and you can handle the check-in details when you prefer.   Want something (anything)?  No problem..  they will have it to you immediately (actually, probably before you even think of it) and somehow it appears effortless.  Unfortunately, there aren’t enough hotels that even arrive at level.  But it is the staff that make Hotel 41 above and beyond all expectations.   Their level of consideration, friendliness, and enthusiasm to go out of their way to make your day more enjoyable is just phenomenal – we’ve really never encountered anything like it, no matter where we’ve traveled in the world.   As one example, I’ll offer this: before arriving at Hotel 41, we had been in the UK for a week (we’re from Los Angeles).   A friend of mine in LA had asked me to pick up a few UK sweets for him – a particular chocolate bar and a box of cookies.   During that week, I looked everywhere for the items, but couldn’t’ find them.   So before arriving at Hotel 41, I called and asked them if they could find the items.   ‘Of course’, I was told on the phone, and accordingly when we arrived in our room, there were 20 of the chocolate bars, stacked in a pyramid on a white plate with a big white bow around them, and beside them were 5 boxes of cookies – free of charge.   As I later found out, they were so hard to find, that the manager himself traveled 30 minutes away to the other side of London to find the items.  Of course you could say ‘well, that’s the hotel’s job to make things like that happen’, but it was the warmth that this, and everything else was done with.   The staff is small (although in no way inadequate… actually, quite overly adequate considering the few number of guests they allow) and you really feel like you’re being attended to by a consistent group of personal assistants. 

Other nice touches:   1)  The Great Room (which is effectively the hotel’s lobby) is absolutely fantastic.   Like relaxing in the family room of a wonderful home.   The leather seating by the fireplace, the self service (or full service) bar, complimentary raiding of the excellent pantry, create an incredibly relaxing atmosphere.  2)  Breakfast in the morning.  Usually we like to have room service, but the Great Room is so inviting that we ate there.  It’s such an intimate setting (and intimate hotel) that we would have felt perfectly comfortable eating in our robes (although I can’t remember if we did or not) 3)  Hotel 41 is really one (private) floor of a much larger 5 star hotel, so it’s able to offer all of the benefits of a large hotel (exceptional room service, for example), while offering the intimacy and personal attention of a boutique hotel. 4) we decided on the spur of the moment that we’d like to tour Buckingham Palace (across the street) (btw – you can only do this in summer).   The lines were huge for admission.  However we mentioned it to one of the staff members, and next thing we knew, we had a note from them that allowed us to bypass the lines and basically walk right in.

Bottom line:  of anywhere we’ve stayed in the world, this is the example of how it should be.   We cannot recommend Hotel 41 highly enough.  Stay here.",5,2009,07,06
137,As good as could be,"Remarkable service from start to finish. While the room was modest in size, the amenities were first-rate throughout (including the Penhaglion supplies in the bathroom). Great temperature controls; two showers and a bath; dvd and iPod player. The people could not have been nicer or more helpful. Right at Victoria station. The quoted rates include VAT.",5,2009,07,01
137,"We were spoiled with friendly, thoughtful service and the location was superb","We were in London for 5 nights; my wife and I, and our 7-year old daughter.  From the outset (as I made reservations over the phone), I was impressed with the positive, highly responsive attitude of the staff.  Everyone seems genuinely enthusiastic about his/her job and focused on ensuring a positive experience for the guests.  We had two separate King Deluxe rooms (no connecting rooms in this hotel) right next to each other in a ""private corridor,"" which initially created some apprehension for my wife.  That was laid to rest upon arrival: the hotel is small, intimate, and feels very safe.  Within a matter of minutes, we were meeting the staff and they were learning our daughter's name.  After the first day, we felt very comfortable having our daughter next door, and she frequently availed herself of the well-stocked and enticing ""Executive Lounge"" (be sure to have some of the old-fashioned malted milk balls wrapped in small packets with a ribbon).  It felt very much like staying with an old friend who happened to have a really nice house in a great location, with luxurious bedrooms, and a staff committed to our comfort.  PJ-Lilly, the Guest Experience Manager, was an absolute delight and extremely helpful in arranging transportation, dinner reservations, and theater tickets.  He was appropriately serious in making sure that things ""got done"" and also fun to work with; he is responsive and pays considerable attention to details.  If you visit 41, you can trust that he'll take good care of you.  While all the staff were friendly and helpful, Marta, in particular, was charming.  She made our daughter feel as important as any other adult guest.  The rooms were quite comfortable (the beds are good and comfy; not as firm as Westin ""Heavenly Beds"" and more along the lines of what you'd find at a Ritz Carlton).  The bathrooms were very well done: well-lighted, spacious, and with strong water pressure everywhere (sinks, tub, and in the separate shower---""sunflower head"" for that refreshing drenching experience).  The Executive Lounge is a real treat and excellent for a light breakfast.  We didn't experiment much with room service as we were mostly out and about sightseeing.  Overall, our experience compared very favorably vs. the other hotels I usually frequent (Brown's, The Savoy, Claridge's, and the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park).  This is an intimate, boutique hotel in a great location; I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to my friends and colleagues.",5,2009,06,28
137,Perfect!,"My husband booked a one night stay at Hotel 41 for my birthday, and after reading the reviews it had a lot to live up to - I was not disappointed.    The hotel is in a great location with easy access to Victoria Station, and it's central location makes it ideal for walking around London.  Every member of the staff was friendly and professional, making us feel very welcome.  Our room was very clean, well presented and the black & white decor was pulled off with great style.  There were lots of nice little treats throughout our stay which were lovely including a beautiful birthday cake which was brought to our room shortly after we arrived.  The heart of the hotel, the executive lounge, was wonderful and we enjoyed 'plundering the pantry' when we got back late after seeing  a show.  My only disappointment was that we couldn't stay longer!",5,2009,06,27
137,Great Hotel and Excellent Staff,"Cannot say enough about Hotel 41.  Our room (though small by American standards) was very comfortable and clean,  The bed was big and comfy. Room had water and goodies waiting on our night stand every night.   My wife enjoyed the deep soaking tub and made it a nightly ritual as soon as returned from daily sightseeing in  London.

The staff, especially all the young ladies made us feel special and took time to chat with us at every opportunity.  The breakfast buffet was stocked with fresh fruit, breads, cereals, and other food every morning.   

We have been to London several times and always stay at nice places. However, this is our favorite.  From London we spent time in both Paris and Rome and stayed at nice places in each.  However, neither was like Hotel 41. 

Now that we are home we talk about our trips top London, Paris, and Rome ....and rave to everybody about Hotel 41.",5,2009,06,21
137,A fantastic Experience-only place to stay in London,"Having just returned from a two night stay at Hotel 41, I can say I have never experienced anything like this in London.  All the staff where highly efficient and very polite.  When we entered the hotel we were unsure what was in store for us, but all I can say is thank you Hotel 41 for making our stay a most enjoyable one.  After a delayed check in as the room was not available for us the Guest Experience Manager kindly gave us complimentry drinks.  The room was lovely, highly equipped and exceptionally clean.  The breakfast was delicious with the most friendly staff serving.  After staying at many city hotels I will certainly be staying at this hotel again!!!",5,2009,06,21
137,Only Hotel for us now in London,"We found ""41"" on Trip Advisor.  We were not disappointed.  I almost hesitated writing this review because I feel I am giving away a secret.  We now feel like we are part of a special ""41"" club!   We came to London on a 4 night whim and staying at ""41"" made our 4 days in London just perfect.  Though I have to say the Executive King Room was much smaller than we expected, the service and attention to detail more than made up for the smaller room.  From the moment we were greeted at the front street lobby, the staff at ""41"" made us feel special and that we were their only guests.  They were even kind enough to acknowledge our anniversary. The room had 5 star linens and amentities, lots of towels, decorated very tastefully, good reading light and a very comfortable bed.  We found our room to be very quiet though we were only two rooms from the Executive Lounge.  The hotel is a very convenient walk to the Victoria Station tube.   The Executive Lounge  where we had breakfast and evening cocktails, drinks and treats  is very inviting.  Wonderfully decorated like an English library in blacks and whites.  It was a lovely room to begin and end our day. As respects to the service,  we cannot say enough about the service through out the hotel.  It is obvious the management cares and has taken the time to train their staff properly.  If the staff did not have answers to our questions they found the answers for us.  Without a doubt ""5 star"" service. We were extremely appreciative of the effort the staff took to  handle our food requests and transportation back to Heathrow.  Next time we come to London I wouldn't stay any place else.   What a  jewel to find in a City  that has a hotel on almost every block.",5,2009,06,15
137,"Fabulous, couldn't fault it","We stayed here overnight celebrating our wedding anniversary. The hotel was in a fantastic location, the staff were superb and the hotel everything we wanted.
The staff left 2 anniversary cakes in our bedroom and made our stay very special.",5,2009,06,15
137,Fantastic hotel!,"Amazing service - they do everything they can to ensure you spend your  time in London the way you want to - effortlessly.  Excellent restaurant recommendations, good seats at great shows - anything you need.  Just tell them what you want, and they'll take it from there.  The bed was a fantastic King bed, with amazing linens and nice feather/down pillows.  Two excellent showers in the bathroom.  The room wasn't huge, but there was plenty of room.  Fine breakfasts were served in the executive lounge in the morning - complete with presspots of Starbucks Coffee - other styles of coffee were available as well.  The look of the hotel is stately elegance.  We felt a bit uncomfortable in our casual clothes - we had come from hot Athens, so we had mostly shorts,etc.  But they did there best to make us comfortable.  This would be a fine hotel in which to do business, given it's elegant feel.  The location is excellent - very close to Victoria train and underground station, and an easy walk to St James Park and Buckingham Palace.  Tour buses stopped a half block away.  Youo can take the tube from Heathrow, and you'll only have to carry your luggage up one short fight of stairs.  One knock - pass on the bbar for dinner - it would be a fine place for a drink, but the dinner was very underwhelming.  In their defense, we got the prix fixe menu - but the meal was pedestrian.",5,2009,06,14
137,Not good for business,"This is a nice hotel but if you are in London for business then go somewhere  else.I was there for one night with a colleague and the experience was not as good as I expected.
Our check in took nearly half an hour.
The rooms are very good but not excellent.
The service is very good.
We had to leave early in the morning and it was impossible to get a cab in time in front of the hotel so we had to walk to the next underground station to pick up a cab. The doorman tried his best but was without success. Maybe this was our mistake because having stayed previously in London we were used that cabs are always available in front of the hotel.
The cab issue is the reason why I think that this is not a hotel for business trips.",3,2009,06,12
137,Unbelievably awesome,This place is truly 5 stay. From check in to check out your every need is waited on. I found the room to be very comfortable and the size generous. We truly did not have one problem on our stay.,5,2009,06,10
137,Nice Hotel - Disappointing Room,"We just returned from 6 nights at Hotel 41.  We booked at the hotel web-site about 2 months in advance and selected the king excutive room.  It was so very small and the bathroom was a major disappointment.  We had a bath tub with a small partition to handle the shower spray.  My husband is 6'3"" and when the shower hit him, it sprayed the bathroom.  After 4 nights we were able to change to another excutive king and there was no comparison.  The new room had both a tub and a walk in shower.  It had room in the closet for our clothes for 6 nights.  I would only book through Costco or a big travel site if they could guarantee the standard of room.",4,2009,06,10
137,Absolutely Perfect,"My wife and I stayed at Hotel 41 for four nights during our recent trip to Europe, and had a wonderful time. We arrived well before check-in, and although our room was not yet ready, they were quite accommodating. They offered us our choice of drinks, took care of our luggage, provided us with a place to change after our long flight, and were ready to answer any questions we had about London.

During our stay, we found the staff to be extremely friendly and knowledgeable, and the service was exceptional. One example of this occurred during breakfast. I typically eat peanut butter on toast, and although their breakfast buffet has many tasty options, they did not have any peanut butter. So, I asked a member of the staff if they had any, and she went to check. She then came back and said she would have some for me in five to ten minutes. We are not sure, but my wife and I think they ran out to buy me some! Anyway, a few minutes later she brought it to me, and every morning after she remembered me and automatically brought me peanut butter. It may seem like a small thing, but when do you get service like that?

I have noticed that although the reviews are mostly excellent for this hotel, there are a few negative ones. So, I would like to address a couple of the comments I’ve seen. First, our room was relatively small, but not ridiculously so. And, you’re staying in the middle of London! Anyway, the room felt quite luxurious, was extremely nice and clean, and we couldn’t have been more comfortable. Second, the location is excellent. The hotel is just a couple blocks away from a tube stop, and is practically next door to Buckingham Palace. Also, taxis seem to come by all the time if you need one (and of course the excellent staff can get you one if need be).

This was one of four hotels at which we stayed during our tour of Europe. Though all are worthy of 4-5 star ratings, Hotel 41 stands out as our absolute favorite. We hope to return next year!",5,2009,06,08
137,The Highlight of our trip was Hotel 41!,"The other reviews are all accurate. I will simply emphasize how helpful the staff was in securing us hard to get dinner and theatre reservations, as well as tour tickets. We spent six nights and we were helped with our plans almost every day. Breakfast is superb and returning to the hotel lounge in mid-afternoon and enjoying tea and cookies is what really relaxed me in between busy sightseeing days. This is a cozy little oasis in the midst of a great city. Where do they get so many kind and sweet staff members?",5,2009,06,07
137,"Excellent boutique hotel, great service!","All has been said, but I wanted to say we were on a long trip going to 3 countries and stayed at many cities, and this was by far our best stay in the whole trip.  The hotel is small and rooms are small, but very comfortable. Showers are the best in London, I could bet!  towel warmers in the bathroom etc.  but what makes this hotel the best is the service!.  Everyone is looking at ways to help you, and make your stay a comfortable one.  We loved it, and you will too!  Definitively will recommend it to friends at home.",5,2009,06,05
137,Great Stay - even in winter,This is a wonderful hotel. I will definitely stay here next time we are in London!,5,2009,06,04
137,Absolutely delightful stay,You are met at reception and taken to the fifth floor by a lift. This floor is the entire boutique hotel. There is only about 20 rooms on the floor.  We were seated  while being checked in with a glass of champagne. Then escorted to the room where we were shown everything and informed of breakfast.  The rooms are entirely in black and white. There is even a bedroom with a conservatory roof as you are in the top attic area. The bar dining area is exceptional in decor.  Breakfast was excellent with a variety of choices and also had soya milk available.  The staff were so helpful. Would love to return one day.  Excellent location for sightseeing and for Victoria Station.,5,2009,06,04
137,Best Hotel in London - by a mile,"Not only is the 41 the best hotel in London, I'd go so far as to suggest it's the best in the world.  The quality of service and care provided by each and every hotel employee is amazing.  The food is fantastic and the location is very difficult to beat - great to get around London, shopping, airports or for running the London parks as I like to do.  There's also a good gym/swimming pool for the use of hotel guests.  Finally, and fittingly, the beds are the most comfortable I have ever slept in.  Probably the worst mistake I ever made was taking my wife to stay there during one of my business trips to see how tough working away from home is!  I couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough",5,2009,06,02
137,The best of the best!,"Exceeded all of our expectations, even though we knew the hotel was ranked #1 of all -- mark that, ALL -- hotels in London.  The concierge pool, hosts and hostesses are the very standard of courtesy and competence, and at the same time graciously warm and personable.  The room was the archetype of what a 5-star room ought to be but often is not.  And the location was perfect for our trip plans -- easy walking distance to Victoria Station, Buckingham Palace, Apollo Victoria theatre (where we watched Wicked), some excellent restaurants (The Library, Santini's Italian, BBar South African, Shakespeare's Pub, ASK Pizza, etc.).  Do NOT miss the fabulous breakfasts and especially the cozy evenings with Earl Grey tea and biscuits all in the executive lounge. Upon re-reading what I have written, I realize I sound like one who has a vested interest in this hotel, but this is far from the case. I am quite capable of writing a negative review, but there is simply no way to summarize our experience without using superlatives... Oh, well, just so it won't sound so Pollyanna: it is true that the hallway floor creaked a bit outside our room.  Big deal.",5,2009,05,28
137,"Wonderful Service, Great Location, Very Enjoyable","We stayed in 41 for 2 nights during May.  The hotel is located just 2 minutes walk from Victoria Station and therefore is very convenient to Gatwick Airport.  Buckingham Palace is just down the road.  We were able to walk to Bond Street and Oxford Street in 15 minutes.  Generally speaking, restaurants in the area are of a very high quality.  On arrival we were whisked upstairs and received a very friendly and efficient early check-in.  Not only this but we were offered, and enjoyed, a lovely cup of tea with fresh croissants and pastries, very yum and welcome after our journey (have never been greeted anywhere in this fashion previously!).  Our room was a king, good size, complimentary bottled water, well stocked mini-bar, large bathroom with bath plus walk-in shower, large hallway with walk-in closet and safe, towel robes, great air-conditioning, easy access to light switches.  Overall a very well-appointed room, we had everything we needed and more.  Breakfast was very nice with variety of cold choices buffet style or hot from the menu.  Every evening we came back to the turn-down service, complete with little munchies left for us and candle-lit bathroom, a lovely touch.  Loved the choice of teas available - very English.  Executive Lounge is very relaxing and traditional English in decor.   Finally on the day we left, our luggage was collected from our room and stored for us all day.  On collecting it we enjoyed afternoon tea with champagne, it was superb!!!  I think my partner described one of the pastries as ""obscene"", which translated, means ""delicious, excellent, all the above ..."" !!!  He was a happy camper as was I.  We treated ourselves to a stay in London as we had not had a break for a while and 41 seemed like a good choice for some pampering and relaxation.  IT DID NOT DISAPPOINT!!!!!!  Thank you to all the wonderful staff and management who work there; staying at 41 is unique and fabulous!",5,2009,05,18
137,"Great hotel, personalized service","We spent the weekend at 41 - our first time in London.  The hotel is very nice, rooms were clean and nicely decorated.  The towel warmer in the bathroom was a nice treat!  Our room was a little small, but that is to be expected in large cities.

The loune area is very nice with breakfast and tea served daily as well as complimentary snacks in the afternoon and an extensive honor bar.  If they don't have what you want they can get it from the bar in their sister hotel next door and deliver it to you.

The staff was very friendly and eager to accomodate us.  We had a two issues with waiting a long time for food/dinks, but nothing significant.  The staff recognized us, greeted us by name, and helped with everything from dinner reservations (and printing us a map), to mailing postcards, to delivering drinks to our room.

The breakfast was very good, but I was glad it was included with the price of our room because the price printed on the menu was expensive.  The high tea we had on our first day was also excellent - it was a great way to relax after such a long trip before heading out to see the sights.

The location is both good and bad.  It is very close to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and Parliment.  The sightseeing buses stop right out front, and the underground is a short 3-block walk.  There is also a new shopping center nearby with the essentials - a drug store, a grocery store, ATM, etc.  However, the area seemed deserted in the evenings and on weekends.  The restaurants and even pubs were practically empty.  The bar on the corner wasn't even open on weekends.  That's great if you don't want to wait for a table, but lacking in a fun ""energy"" we were hoping for.

Overall, it was a great experience.",4,2009,05,14
137,wonderful boutique hotel with fabulous service,"Service: friendliest, most attentive service I've seen in any class hotel/inn
Rooms: (king) gorgeous and comfortable
Value: excellent, although at this level should include a bottle or two of water per night in current rates (courtesy pantry is great but water isn't easily available) ... not a big issue, very minor detail though surprising because they seem to think of everything else!
Cleanliness: perfect except for unmistakable odor of cigarette smoke when use AC/heat (spouse noticed it in executive lounge too) 
- front desk staff didn't seem to notice odor when brought to her attention (smoker VIP guest around?) so we resolved by leaving a window open
- booked reservation at last minute so room possibly ""least popular""; even so, lovely room adjacent to lounge, convenient & still quiet",5,2009,05,08
137,Makes you feel like you are at home,My wife and I stayed for the last two nights of our 2 week Europe vacation at Hotel 41...what a great experience.   You walk into the entrance at 41 Buckingham Palace Road and it’s like you have entered someone’s private residence…you just drop your bags and from there everything is taken care of.  The rooms are very well appointed and spotless.  The staff goes out of their way to make sure every single need is taken care of…there is nothing too small.  I can honestly say that I don’t think I have stayed anywhere where each and every staff member we encountered truly cared about our experience and wanted to do anything they could to make our stay enjoyable and worry free.   Great job Andrew and staff!  We will definitely be back.,5,2009,05,07
137,I couldn't have felt more at home,"I always prefer a small hotel and this one really fit the bill. 
I cant say enough about the staff at Hotel 41.  Even when I came in from a long day of work and was a bit cranky, they took care of my every need-with pleasure and a smile.
The hotel itself is lovely-and their executive lounge was the PERFECT spot to have a bite to eat, a glass of wine and to unwind witha book at the end of the day.  
The room was a little small-as is often the case in London,  but it had every amenity.
The location allowed for early morning walks by the palace and green park.
If you want to be in the middle of the 'action' this hotel is not for you- but for business travel -or romance- it can't be beat.",5,2009,05,05
137,Best Stay Ever!!!,"Me and my firend book a 3- night stay at Hotel 41. The experience is truely awesome. The decor is great, staff are nice and very helpful. We had a very memorable stay @ Hotel 41 and would definitely receommend our freinds to stay there to expereience the difference....",5,2009,04,28
137,Very special & romantic with impeccable service,"I booked a week end at the Hotel 41 to propose to my girlfriend.  Having read the comments about the hotel on Tripadvisor (thank you to previous guest for their very helpful comments) I thought this was the ideal place and I wasn't disappointed.  It is in a good location and it is beautiful, but what sets the Hotel 41 apart is the standard of service you receive from the wonderful staff.  Nothing is too much trouble and they deliver this excellent level of service in such an efficient yet unobtrusive manner. If its a romantic week end you are planning I recommend you give the staff a call to discuss your requirements and listen to their suggestions.  You won't be disappointed. I particularly recommend the 'romantic turndown'!!  Don't cringe guys, the lady in your life will love it.  Finally from my fiancee's perspective, this was a perfect experience from the moment we walked in the door until the time we left.
PS She said 'of course!!'",5,2009,04,25
137,What a fantastic experience at 41.,"We really enjoyed our stay at 41.  We selected 41 because of its location, easy walk to some sights and the tube, quick taxi to the theatre and restaurants that we wanted to check out.  The room was bright, comfortable and well appointed.  The staff of 41 worked extremely hard to make sure that our entire stay was a delight!",5,2009,04,22
137,A small haven,"Hotel 41 more than lived up to it's reputation for service. The entrance is discrete and you enter a different world when you step in off the street.  It is miles away from the faceless chain hotels where you are often just a number . The staff were friendly and approachable and nothing was too much trouble. We were greeted with a glass of champagne and while we checked in our bags were taken to our room. We quickly grew accustomed to all  the little extras provided. 

The room was immaculate and well appointed. The bed was comfortable.  A bathrobe as well as a dressing gown together with slippers was great and the cookies on the pillow and the candle in the bathroom each night was a nice touch.

Breakfast was good with hot dishes cooked to order and  a good selection of fruit, yoghurt, breads and cereals. Complimentary soft drinks, snacks and chocolates were available throughout the day. Each evening a small ice bucket with olives and lemon slices was placed in the room.

The only downside  was the size of the room and size of the bathroom. They were both just a little too small to be really comfortable. We kept bumping into each other when we were getting ready to go out and the bathroom was too small to allow two people in at once. The biggest problem was the large desk chair which has large wooden feet on which we kept stubbing our toes when we passed it!  It would have been nice to have had two comfy chairs to relax in at the end of the day but there just wasn't room.

We would return to the hotel again for its location and the peace and quiet it provides together with the excellant service, but we would want to get a larger room next time.",4,2009,04,18
137,4 (1) Seasons!,"It is simple: You will receive a kind of service that only in 4 Seasons, The Peninsula, Mandarin Oriental or in a hotel of such a category you could taste. The breakfast is excellent, the rooms relaly cosy, the location very convenient. but on top of all is the people! They are very well trained and they are ready to offer the best meeting much more than your expectations. I would definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2009,04,18
137,A little palace of your own,"This is the best hotel I've ever been. As soon as they open the door for you, you just step into your own palace. 
My room was spacious, with a very comfortable bed, the ceiling was a little bit low, but that's no problem, it makes it even more cosy. Bathroom just perfect.

The lounge is the best place to stay in this hotel. After a day of shopping the staff will pamper you. The food is perfect, but you can also sit there and just read a book on a comfortable sofa with a good glass of wine.
You can also order roomservice, wich is perfect, but eating in the lounge is even better.
Andrew and the rest of the staff are really the most friendliest hotel staff I've ever met, no question is too much.
It's not cheap, but really worth it!!",5,2009,04,08
137,Deserves to be #1,"We just returned from a 5 night stay at Hotel 41 and everything about it was top notch and exceeded my expectations. The staff really caters to your every need, and the atmosphere in the executive lounge makes you feel like home. When we arrived, it was about 7:30 a.m. and I was concerned that we would be stuck touring around London after an overnight flight in the same clothes and without a chance to freshen up. That fear was soon gone because they greeted us at the hotel with coffee, tea and danish and had our room available immediately. The staff always greeted us when we returned to the hotel after tourning and was extremely helpful with restaurant suggestions and site seeing ideas. We became particularly fond of the managers Andrew and Antoinette who made our stay extra special. The best was when we came back from a shopping spree at Harrods and all of the young girls on staff clamored around my 12 year old daughter to see her purchases, which made her feel very special. The location is really ideal and you can walk to all major attractions and some very good restaurants. The hotel is very quiet, it is really a hidden gem, none of the taxi drivers knew about it so you have to tell them that you are going to the Rubens which is the downstairs part of the hotel.  And it is absolutely true that there are always snacks and drinks available, most of which are complimentary. The breakfast and hors doevres in the afternoon were very good as is the restaurant in the Hotel called the Library. The staff really went out of their way for us and it was very much appreciated. I would highly recommend this hotel and that says alot because I am not always that easy to please!!",5,2009,03,24
137,Special,"My husband and I have just returned from a weekend at Hotel 41.  It was excellent.  We were made to feel very welcome from the time we arrived until we left.  This is not a 'normal' 5* hotel.  You enter through a small but very pleasant corridor, and a lift takes you up the the 5th Floor where Hotel 41 is situated.  You walk past bedrooms to reach a very relaxing and well furnished lounge area, which is essentially the heart of the hotel.  Everything is there for you, and you are welcome at all times - papers, food, bar, tv - and very helpful staff without 'attitude'. 

The interior decor is superb, the food was very good but without a doubt the staff make the hotel - they are brilliant.  

The only thing that let the hotel down slightly was the housekeeping service, who caused us to wait for our room on a couple of occasions - but the staff dealt with this very effectively - plying us with champagne as we waited, so it really was no problem!

We look forward to our next visit.",5,2009,03,23
137,Beyond my expectations,"This  place is everything you would expect and more!  We purchased our trip through Luxury Link. Five nights in an executive king room, breakfasts, champagne, dinner one night and tea one afternoon.  An incredible value for this level of service.  First our room.  We were very pleasantly surprised after reading some reviews that mentioned the small size.  Ours was very roomy (#17), with the bed area to the left of the entrance and the bath down the hall to the right.  More than most hotels we have stayed at.  The bed was very comfortable and we really liked the turndown service, with the music playing and bottled water by the bed.  First class.  Our package included continental breakfast and there was an amazing variety!  I was very partial to the yogurt parfait, but the meats, cheeses, breads,  pastries, cereals, fruit.....something to please everyone!  The service in the hotel was top notch.  Every time we entered the lounge, someone was there to greet us and ask if we needed anything.  We never had to wait to be served drinks or anything else.  Very knowledgable and helpful staff.  Our tea was to be served next door in the Palace Lounge at the Rubens.  We asked if we could instead have it in the lounge at 41. (We loved it so much, we didn't want to go anywhere else!)  They were very happy to oblige and it was very intimate and cozy.  The dinner that came with the package was a 3 course dinner at the Library next door.  It was not from the regular menu, but from a smaller one (prix fix) with limited choices.  It was Ok, but really not the best (my husband's fish was not good). But, again, service was wonderful and the restaurant is lovely.  
Complimentary snacks are out during the day and the ""plunder the pantry"" is very nice to have available later in the evening.  Again, a nice variety of meats, cheeses, fruits and breads.  You will not go hungry here!
The location of this hotel cannot be beat.  We were able to walk everywhere we wished to go and there is a great pub across the street. We were very lucky as it didn't rain until the day we were leaving.  The hotel is a 5 minute walk from Victoria station so very convienent.  I would recommend this hotel to everyone wishing to enjoy a truly luxurious vacation!!",5,2009,03,21
137,This hotel has not won awards for nothing- my best hotel yet in London,"Richard and I recently stayed at Hotel 41 for a 2 night stay following research on Trip Advisor.  The Trip Advisor Best Hotel Award 2008 has been well deserved.
From arrival into the lobby the staff make you feel special and welcoming without being gushing.  The entrance is impressive- striking in black & white theme which dominates all the rooms (we went on a tour to view a selection of the rooms), -everywhere clean and kept at excellent standard.
You are escorted up to the hotel which is 5 floors up a lift from the lobby into a delightful lounge where breakfast and snacks plus bar are.  The touch of an 'honesty' book for serving your own drinks is lovely- but chances are the bar man will ask you first.  I must commend all the staff for their care of us during our stay- Kinga, Monika and PJ in particular - but only because I could remember their names- their job is to enhance your stay and they do that to perfection.  
Breakfast is delightful - so much choice- there is usual cereals, fruits, yoghurts, pastries, different breads etc etc and the staff bring you hot food cooked to order.  Eggs Benedict was to die for!
Come to Hotel 41- you so won't be disappointed.
If I could fault it at all we chose the smallest room -and cheapest and it would have been worth upgrading to size larger as considerably bigger.  Just not quite enough room for us!",5,2009,03,18
137,Absolutely Amazing!,"I stayed with my girlfirend and now fiance (after our weekend at the hotel) and i have to admit this hotel is fantastic from the moment of arrival to leaving the staff, location and quality of the hotel could not have made this weekend any more special.

I opted for the romantic offer advertised on this website, i dont want to give anything away but i recommend it to anyone wanting to make your stay extra special. Extremely romantic and personal. 

The hotel has a whatever whenever policy which belive me is true, anything you ask for is never too big or too small and the quality of service is truly 1st class.

The executive lounge is beautiful and secluded to the outside world in central london. Its difficult to believe you are only 100 metres from Buckingham Palace.

I recommend this hotel to anyone and will definately be staying there again!

Thanks to the people at 41 you can really make dreams happen!!",5,2009,03,17
137,top draw,March 2009 my wife and I have just spent the weekend at 41 and are delighted to recommend the experience to other travelers. The service and courtesy from the staff is outstanding and you are cosseted and spoilt during your whole stay. The rooms although a little on the small side are sumptuously furnished and lots of little complimentary items that feel special. My only complaint is that like so many London Hotels they £25 charge for breakfast.,5,2009,03,16
137,Excellent in every way - a hidden gem,"From the moment we arrived our expectations were exceeded - any we had pretty high expectations!   The staff are so friendly and attentive, and for once the phrase ""nothing is too much trouble"" can be applied.  As your bags are whisked away to your room you take a seat in the lovely comfortable Executive Lounge, which looks like the library in a country house, and are offered a coffee or even champagne whilst the paper work is completed.  The room was spotless, crisp bed linen, beautiful soft feather pillows (from the pillow menu!)  lots of towels and a choice of bathrobes.  At 5 pm an ice bucket, lemon and lime slices and a bowl of olives are delivered to your room - or if you prefer take up the offer of complimentary canapes in the lounge. And don't forget to Plunder the Pantry on your late night return to the hotel - lovely complimentary snacks in the lounge.  So many things to mention but some should remain a lovely surprise as they were to us.  This was a more expensive hotel than we would usually chose, but we felt it was worth every penny.",5,2009,03,15
137,Elegant but yet comfortable with staff exceeding expectations!,"I had the opportunity to visit London last week for the 2nd time in 6 months. My choice of accommodations, once again was Hotel 41.  Hands down Hotel 41 offers the BEST Hotel experience.

The Hotel itself is really quite lovely with a black and white motif.  Very clean and crisp w/o feeling stuffy.  Our room was a 2 story suite with a fireplace, a very cozy king bed, a huge tub with wonderful bath accessories, candles lit in the evening...very ROMANTIC.

The staff at Hotel 41 was outstanding on both occassions...always sensing our needs and taking care of us without hesistation or question.  Example...Every evening @ 6 pm canapes are served.  My husband and I would partake in a cocktail along with these delectibles prior to going out to dinner. One evening, I was running late and sent my husband for a glass of wine.  Upon his return there was a knock at the door with a staff member delivering canapes.  I asked my husband had he requested these and his responded NO.  (Wow, what a thoughtful touch on the part of the staff!)

One morning I woke with what we thought was a mild case of stomach flu (okay, it was a little more than mild...). After sleeping most of the morning I got myself dressed and trudged through London.  Keep in mind I had not eaten since the night before.  Upon returning to our room I asked for a slice of bread, hoping to calm my stomach so I could perhaps eat dinner at some point.  Within moments of my request a basket with an assortment of breads and fresh fruit was delivered to our room. (Nice)

Food... We had the Continental Breakfast every morning and Wow! Lots of fresh fruit, meats, cheeses, yogurt, assortment of juices, pasteries and a number of cereal options.  Canapes were outstanding and I would hate to forget raiding the Butler's Pantry EVERY evening (yes it's included).

I know I am rambling on...but I feel it imperative to express my opinion of what an outstanding stay we had at Hotel 41.  Between the beautiful accommodations, exceptional service and food there is NO other Hotel to stay at while visiting London.  We did not want to go home!

Oops, Forgot to mention location...What a big plus!  The Hotel is within a few minutes walking distance of Victoria Station, Theaters, St. James Park and you are staying down the street from the Queen!  Great restaurants and fabulous Wine Bars are located nearby.

Hotel 41 is my personal FAVORITE Hotel in London. Would NOT even consider staying anywhere else.  Yes, we will return!!!",5,2009,03,06
137,For something a little different,"Discreet location, Tremendous staff, wonderfully appointed rooms (the best surprise - try the bath shower!) and a lounge that you want to make your home. It's all that and more which is why next time we'll stay for more than one night. The conceirge managed to acquire a pair of theatre tickets at short notice (best seats and value..and we mean the best) and recommended a restaurant that was just what we needed. The only disappointing aspect was the length of time we had in London at the 41, which we'll rectify in April! A memorable experience.",5,2009,03,06
137,Great Hotel in a great location,"The hotel is very nice and comfortable.  The location is great, but the service is wonderful.  Everyone was so gracious and helpful.  It was first class without any of the stuffiness you sometimes find in nice hotels.",5,2009,03,03
137,My Favorite London Hotel,"41 is the best hotel I think I've ever stayed in.  It's a boutique hotel on Buckingham Palace Rd. next to Rueben's Hotel, which I suspect is part of the Red Carnation chain although I can't say for certain.  But every single thing about my stay was marvelous.  I don't think I've ever stayed in a hotel and been unable to complain about a thing.  The bed was comfortable, the bathroom fully equipped, there was eveb a fireplace in the split level suite they assigned me.  The breakfast spread was small but perfectly prepared and fresh.  Perhaps the only jarring point was the firedoor opposite my bed, but only because it was a door without a visible lock on it.  (Not that anyone could get in, but as a single female traveller, it gave me pause.)  I'll definitely be going back.",5,2009,02,27
137,Perfect Hotel for London visit,My husband and I stayed at this hotel.  On arrival we were warmly greeted and escorted to our room.  We found the staff polite and very helpful throughout.  Rooms are well proportioned and very tastefully decorated. Hotel deserves a good recommendation and we hope to stay there again this Easter. Nothing to fault. Perfect small hotel for visiting sights of London.,5,2009,02,26
137,Some Parts Excellent others vary,"Check in experience was exactly as another reviewer mentioned, odd.
Room was nice, good size, some excellent touches like hot water bottles, flowers etc.
However room 4105 has a hidden boiler and is very noisy at night beware!!!!!
Visted BBar first night, wish we had gone else where, the Ostrich was like shoe leather, took then so long to cook another that they were closing around us made us feel very unwelcome. On the final morning ate breakfast in the Exec Lounge, found out of datr food on the buffet after I had eaten them, wihtout much by way of an appology, not something that you expect at this level.
Probably suggest going elsewhere.",3,2009,02,26
137,Where's the hotel lobby?,"My boyfriend and I were quite surprised and disappointed upon our arrival.  No hotel lobby to relax in while we waited for our room and the first room they showed us was claustrophobic.  The entire welcoming process was so odd.   They took us to the executive lounge where we checked in, but it felt very old gentleman's club-like, and enclosed.   This hotel is not worth the price in my opinion, and I'm not sure how they qualify for that many stars.  For the same or less you can stay at One Aldwych or the Soho Hotel which both have beautiful lobbies, a health club and Aldwych even has a pool.   Somehow we made the unfortunate mistake of choosing 41.  So many other nicer hotels in London.",2,2009,02,23
137,Simply amazing,"An astonishing hotel.  I can't praise it highly enough.  Service was really wonderful, and also sincere and friendly - you really got the impression that everyone genuinely wanted to make your stay wonderful (and they succeeded!).  The room was very comfortable, if a little small.  On our last night, we moved up a category and I would recommend this if you can as it really made a difference.  ""Plunder the Pantry"" was great - really nice to be able to come and snack - and the lounge is really comfortable and private-feeling.  The location of the hotel is also excellent, very close to Victoria Station but also right next to St James's Park.  We got a ""romantic turndown"" on one night and it was beautifully done, with petals, candles, a red rose and even a bottle of massage oil!  And a bottle of Veuve Clicquot in an ice bucket.   
If you get the opportunity, go to this hotel!  It's very romantic so ideal for a special weekend away.",5,2009,02,23
137,brilliant,"just got home this hotel is worth a stay staff spot on, only downside food, it is not of five star quality but it is london eat elsewhere, but dont let this put you off,",5,2009,02,22
137,Perfect Engagement Location!,"My partner and I had the pleasure of staying at hotel 41 in january 2009. Unknown to me, my boyfriend was planning to propose there and quite frankly, he could'nt of picked a more romantic hotel. 
Upon arriving at the hotel, we were greeted with a warm welcome and were intantly struck by how luxurious the hotel was. Our luggage was taken to our rooms while were offered complimentary drinks and snacks in the hotel bar. When booking the room my finace had pre booked a romance package, which was well worth the money. Upon entering the dimly lit room, music was playing while candles and rose pettles filled the room and champagne was on ice. This was all included in the £70 package. 
The hotel staff were very eager to help and happily explained that the bar was actually an 'honesty bar' which relied on guests writting down what drinks they have had in a book on the bar. I must admitt, in the exitement of just getting engaged, our measures of gin may have been a little miscalculated!
When returning to the room after one too many gins i accidentally spilt the content of the ice bucket onto my new dress. I immediately called room service, who took the dress away and returned it clean and dry within about 20 minutes. 
Room: 
The rooms its self was beautiful, spotless and decorated fairly modern with black and white decor. Although for a room costing over £500 a night I would have expected it to be a fair bit bigger. (A double bed, bedside table and a dressing table were the only furnature that could fit in the room)
If I had to choose a downside to hotel 41 it would be the room service. My fiance and I are very laid back people and very rarely complian but the standard of the room service was very poor. The food we ordered was not only small and overcooked but would have been poor quality despite this. However, this did not detract at all from how much we enjoyed our stay.
Checkout: The checkout time for the hotel was 12pm although staff were happy to extend our checkout to 3 or 4pm if we would have liked. As we wanted to do some shopping, the hotel happily held onto out bags unitll the evening when we came to collect them.
In general the hotel was by far the best I've stayed in. The effort they put into creating a romantic atmosphere for my finace to propose was unforgetable. The staff could not do enough for you. Although, If guests are looking for a large room, thatn hotel 41 is not for you.  All in all i would definately return to hotel 41 and have recommended it to all my friends and family already. It was beautiful!

Charlotte - Birmingham",5,2009,02,20
137,Best stay in a city,"Following the other comments, I must say that our stay in Hotel 41 was perfect. The staff was wonderful and helpful, nice and attentionate. We were there for St Valentine and everything was made to let us have a cosy and romantic stay. The room with the fireplace was perfect, the bathroom was beautiful and we felt very priviliged in that hotel.",5,2009,02,17
137,Loved every bit of this hotel.,"I stayed with my partner for two nights at Hotel 41 for Valentine's day and we truly had an amazing time. Our visit was a surprise for my partner and I had chosen this hotel based on the reviews on tripadvisor and other sites. The defining element in each review that captured my attention was the great staff and the attention to detail. From the moment we entered I knew that this hotel would exceed my expectations. When checking in we were offered a glass of champagne which we could drink at leisure in the nice comfortable lobby. When we entered our room we had a plate of fresh fruit waiting for us, which was a very nice detail. I also loved that there were complementary snacks available during the day, which made the hotel feel even more like home. 

We were upgraded to a junior suite and enjoyed our room very much. The bed was very big and comfortable. The downstairs part with a fireplace was nice to sit at with our complementary morning news paper. The bathroom was spacious and the waterpower was the strongest I ever had. Everything was thought about in detail. We just loved to stay in the room and watch the dvd’s that you could get from the reception. On Friday night after we returned from dinner we found our room emerged in candle light and had a bottle of champagne waiting and one of my favourite cd’s playing (the romantic turndown). It made the room even nicer.  

The service in this hotel is truly best to none. In the beginning we used the whatever/whenever button quite frequently and the staff always responded very quickly and very friendly to our requests and questions. Nothing ever seemed to be a problem. Just the little detail of being called by your name makes a lot of difference when staying in a hotel. The service at breakfast was also really nice. I truly felt that the staff was happy to help with whatever you would like to eat or drink. 

I travel very frequently and often stay in good hotels, so I am used to a certain level of service. However, this hotel really is of a completely different standard because of the way you are treated by the staff. It truly feels like a home away from home. I kept repeating to my partner how happy I was being in this hotel and he fully agreed. Especially if you are looking for a hotel to spend a romantic weekend in London, this is the place to go. You will not be disappointed.",5,2009,02,16
137,Hotel 41 provided an outstanding stay...,"Hotel 41

Incredible friendly staff and a warm welcome from the first introduction.
Great service and never a stone unturned to get us what we needed.
I felt like I was coming home versus a hotel room..
I loved the library, the fire and sitting there at the end of the day to unwind with what has now become my favorite Pinor Noir- Galpin Peak.
I can't wait to go back..best to all

137,"great hotel, but what is it with air conditioning?","My wife and I had a great 3 night stay at this hotel.It was when we went to bed on the first night that our only major problem emerged.Having switched off the air-conditioning in our room we could hear constant machine noise from outside. We were offered a complimentary upgrade to an executive suite at the front of the hotel which we accepted. As I suspected the machine noise came from  the external unit for the hotel's air conditioning.This isn't the first time I've had an issue with this type of noise at a hotel.Ironically,the room to which we were moved was at the front of the hotel but was sufficiently well insulated to prevent traffic noise being an issue. I don't know how the hotel would have handled my complaint if it had been full. My other issue is with the cost of breakfast. It was very good but I thought the price to be too high. It is incongruous to pay for breakfast when in the evening complimentary snacks, including bread,meats,cheese,etc are laid on. Don't let the foregoing put you off. The hotel is excellent and I endorse the compliments found in other reviews. Its failings are of the type I've found in other similarly expensive hotels. Can somebody just find a way to silence air conditioning units?",5,2009,02,09
137,One of the best hotels in the world? I think so!,"Just a quick review or I'll end up writing pages.  

41 is quite unique and worthy of an excellent score.  It had been a goal of mine to stay here for some time and now it has been achieved I can't wait to go back!

Outstanding room, lounge and building. But what makes 41 so special is the amazing staff.  Fulfilling the guests unexpressed wishes (along with expressed ones) seems to be their speciality.

Plus the best gin and tonic ever!",5,2009,02,07
137,The Magic Bell,"I was returning back from Asia on business and my girlfriend had met me at the airport. To my surprise a driver with Merc had met me and whisked me off to the 41. Never heard of the place before! Fantastic, discreet entrance which led into the most incredible luxury. Think sumptious town house, antiques, modern gadets. The room we had was superb with black & white tiling bathroom - think old school mixed with modern. We have since looked at another holiday break but with our pet Jack Russell. We stumbled across the fact they are pet friendly aswell, via www.maps4pets.com and notice that their other hotels are pet friendly also. (We show dogs, so that's good news). The magic bell?

They have a bell on your bedside table with a notice saying: "" Anything, Anytime.""  How cool is that?  I wanted to find out the result to a horserace, and they phoned me back with the answer almost straight away.",5,2009,02,06
137,A Little Gem,"The little simple door set on the pavement , leads to what can only be described as, a perfect heavenly cocoon. You realy do not come across this kind of standard in the UK, it is normally associated with the Far East.. 
Everyone seems to mention the staff, and we can confirm they are absolutely fantastic, taking a real sincere care in your requirements and needs. It is such a pleasure in seeing a young and vibrant team working to such very high standards. Its worth going just to meet the staff.
The hotel without question will meet all your requirements with a ease that seems so simple.
We stay in London for long weekends about 3 times a year, now we have stayed here, we could not imagine staying anywere else.
It is a little pricey but trust us it realy is worth that little extra.
Thankyou to everyone. A Fab time.",5,2009,02,05
137,Lived up to the Reviews,"Great hotel for relaxation and luxury. The staff truly try to make your stay good, nothing too much trouble. There is a real culture amongst the staff of trying to make everything great.

Although not cheap we got a good deal from an internet site which included breakfast on both days and VAT. We chose the 3 course meal in the hotel next door, Rubens, as our inclusive option and it was excellent. This actually made our stay in London very reasonably priced for the top class luxury we received.

The food was really lovely and a cut above other hotels.

Area was good for easy shopping and very close to outstanding sites in London . Convenient for the tube.",5,2009,02,03
137,Almost Perfect in Every Way,"My sister and I stayed for 5 nights at the 41 to celebrate her 60th Birthday with a week of shows in January.  Andrew runs a superb operation.  I assume the Red Carnation Group knows what a jewel they have. 

As others have noted, the service is superlative –the staff takes care of every detail, and always in a friendly and unobtrusive manner. Although neither the rooms nor the bathrooms are large (our last London stay was at the Royal Horseguards--, where curiously the rooms also have a black and  white motif -- and the Horseguards’ room was  probably twice the size of our  41room), but the  41executive lounge (which was literally steps away from our room) became part of our vacation experience.  I miss Anna (who was wonderful) serving tea there each afternoon.

 I don’t remember anyone commenting on the quality of the food, which matches the standard set by the 41 service. One evening we had a mango salad with fresh mint, and the mint tasted as if Andrew picked it an hour ago from his garden.

It is a very special place.",5,2009,01,30
137,a perfect hotel experience... far exceeded expectations,"My husband and I spent a wonderful 5 nights in the very special hotel during the last week of November 2008. We were unsure of what to expect and we were completely delighted by every experience we had  at Hotel 41.

The staff are the best we have encountered in 30 years of International Travel. they were effecient , unobtrusive, professional and friendly at the same time and always there. Nothing was a problem and we felt they always went the extra mile to make sure we were Ok. They would always greet us with a smile and an enquiry as to how our day had been. When we checked in, very exhausted after a long flight from Sydney, they greeted us with a comfortable chair and a glass of champagne in the magnificient  reception room and made sure the whole check-in process was simple, efficient and quick. In fact it was like staying at  a grand luxurious yet understated private home 

We then walked to our beautiful room where  we were greeted by a spotlessly clean, elegant, comfortable room. Not your typical hotel room in anyway, this one , with its  black and white theme had all the comforts and special touches of a home away from home. every detail is taken care of,  fluffy towels, hot water bottle, the most comfortable , clean bed mattress and linen you will ever experience, clean carpet, olives and lemon in your room and complimenary water every night.

It is simply too difficult to write all of the wonderful features of Hotel 41, you need to experience it for yourself. Andrew and team you are the best, please keep up the good work. Thank you for making our stay in Londen ( our 6th)  perfect.",5,2009,01,15
137,Great Hotel Great Service,"The Hotel 41 gets it.

137,Superb Hotel - Great Staff & Location,"What a superb, wonderful hotel this is.
I have only written a review once before for a hotel in Spain....and it was a bad one.
However Hotel 41 is just excellent, from the relaxed and personal check in, to the politeness of the staff(who after we said thank you would always reply ""my pleasure"") which in the UK is unheard of!

I am a London man so to find such a great hotel in my own back yard is heartening. usually this level of service is in seen in the Middle East or Asia but rarely in Europe.

Yes its a little expensive but for a night or two special occasion it is the best you could find in London in my opinion.

Thanks to all the staff for making it such a great start to the New Year....and giving us a night without the kids that we could really enjoy!!",5,2009,01,05
137,Home away from home,"I stay in hotels very frequently and am not normally one to write a hotel review but my 13 year old son and I stayed at 41 over Christmas 2008 and we couldn't have been happier.  We were treated like family from day one and every request we made was responded to quickly and with a smile.  The staff were absolutely lovely, went out of their way to accommodate our wishes and it really seemed that they enjoyed making us feel 'at home'.  The decor was elegant and it was lovely to be able to 'light the fire' in the room after a cold day out.  The little touches like having local SIM cards ready for us (at my request) and my son's favourite magazine along with an iPod, Wii, dvd etc in the room was unexpected. We will most definitely be back!!  Thank you Andrew and your wonderful team...",5,2008,12,31
137,Great place!,"Very friendly and service oriented staff. The relaxed way of check-in while sitting in comfortable arm chairs is unique. No need to hurry at all.
The room was very nice and comfortable, it even had a gas fire place!
A ""must stay there"" hotel when visiting London. The staff truely goes the last mile to make your stay unforgettable!
Highly recommendable!",5,2008,12,30
137,Delighful Christmas Break,"I booked a one-night stay for me and hubby at Hotel 41 on the strength of the superlative reviews it has received via TripAdvisor and hoped my high expectations wouldn't be dashed. Luckily my expectations were exceeded!

The service we received was second to none. We were genuinely delighted that we were treated in such a friendly, accommodating and special manner without the slightest whiff of stuffiness or snootiness from all the wonderful members of staff. It was like staying with old friends. We went out for a rather indifferent dinner in Knightsbridge and just couldn't wait to come 'home' again to the 41. We made good use of the lounge facilities, including the excellent 'plunder the pantry'!

We found it was the little extra touches that made the experience so cherished: ice and a tray of olives and sliced lemon in your room for your pre-dinner aperitif, a toasty hot water bottle at the bottom of the bed which we were delighted to discover upon turning in for the night. We paid extra for the romantic turndown as we fancied having champagne anyway and it was such a joy to come back to our room to the candles and rose petals adorning every surface.

As we booked through Expedia, our room rate included afternoon tea and full English breakfast, which made our weekend break seem rather good value for the luxury we experienced. The room was not particularly large so I'm glad we went for the Executive King. Every inch of the hotel is decorated beautifully in a classic, timeless style that would suit any taste. The lounge was especially sumptious and welcoming.

If I were to be picky, I would mention that the fireplace in our room didn't seem to work and our request for someone to have a look at it went unanswered. The TV was at an awkward angle for watching in bed and the picture was very dark with no buttons to adjust the brightness. The location isn't bad if you like walking (as we do) but if you head towards Victoria station the area becomes rather seedy. However, none of these issues marred our experience in any way.

We seemed to be the only 'locals' staying at the hotel as the other guests we encountered were European or American. We felt very proud that these visitors would be leaving London with such a wonderful impression of the accommodation our capital has to offer. In all, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel and would dearly love to return in the near future.",5,2008,12,29
137,Can't wait to go back,"41 is someplace that everyone should experience. Extremely attentive staff who took care of every need. We looked forward to coming back to the hotel every evening. Exquisite ambiance made even more lovely by the people who work there.
We are defintely staying there on every trip to London.",5,2008,12,12
137,Both a warm and professional experience,"My husband and I just stayed at the 41 Hotel in London for four nights and enjoyed a wonderful experience.  We usually stay at the Capital but had heard of the many positive attributes of the 41 and wanted a change.  The aesthetics encompassing the overall hotel design and culinary skills are admirable.  The hotel staff is definately not the usual superficial standard of a large hotel, but that of the stature of a Relais & Chateau style of affiliation.  Warm, hard working and knowledgeable, they are professionally trained beyond what we have come to expect nowadays. There are many nice touches such as in the evening, ice and a small tray of olives, lemon/lime slices are left in your room in case you would like to prepare a drink.  During turn down service, a floating candle is lit in the bathroom along with some soft jazz playing, a fire turned on in the small gas fireplace and the lights dimmed...not to mention the fantastic bed and plush linens.

The only potential drawback if any is the gorgeous but small public area which does not provide any privacy.  Also, the ""plunder the pantry"" idea is a nice one, however somewhat confusing.  The clientele is upscale and relaxed, but most of us were perplexed (and embarassed to ask) about the set up in general.  The hotel and food prices are very high and most items in the ""pantry"" including water, soft drinks and the like are not  gratis as is standard in concierge spaces.  Management would be smart to rethink this as it slightly cheapens their overall 5 star  service.  This is a small but important factor.",5,2008,12,12
137,what a wonderful place,"We have just returned from a weekend at this hotel. We have stayed at many hotels when visiting London, but this has got to be our favourite.

It is a peaceful place to relax and spend some quality time with family or friends.

The staff are great. The breakfast delicious and the attention to detail first class.",5,2008,12,08
137,Simply perfect !,"I spend 4 nights in this hotel and I have to say that was perfect ! Beautiful and comfortable rooms, kind and professional staff, good atmosphere in the middle of Lindon. Like a peaceful island  in the sea. I can recommend for everybody who really likes the good places. (Antoinette, thank you for your kind help when I was in trouble !)  Mónika from Hungary",5,2008,12,07
137,A Hidden Gem,"Trust me.................this hotel is absolutely wonderful. Mainly because of my job (rather than my wallet!!), I am very well travelled and looked after, but can honestly say that the 41 Hotel is up there with the very best. 

Wonderful, caring staff - you don't get the insincere ""in your face""  bowing and scraping that is often associated with 5 Star Hotels here. Without exception, these guys are genuinely eager to please and appear to really enjoy their work environment and take great pride in their hotel and the facilities on offer. Also discreet, but always around if needed and treated my wife and I as privileged guests from the moment we arrived. Drinks on the house during check in were a nice touch and most welcome after a 2 hour journey from the South Coast.

The room was ultra clean (I'm an extremely fussy git!!) and the turn down service is well worth paying for. After watching the Billy Elliot Saturday matinee (this is a brilliant show by the way), we ate out at La Famiglia in Chelsea in the evening (don't bother going here, it's expensive and over-rated), so wasn't hungry on getting back to the hotel, but still couldn't resist the free supper and the ""honesty book"" drinks that are available every night in the Executive Lounge. 

All in all a truly superb experience and credit crunch allowing I would not want to stay anywhere else in future trips to London. 

One more tip if I may.................go see La Clique at the Hippodrome Leicester Square if you can. This was marvellous entertainment at a great venue and finish off a great evening at the Joy King Lau Chinese restaurant just down the road in Leicester Street. This was recommended to me by a Chinese friend and it was full of Chinese couples and families on the Sunday night (always a good sign) and it didn't disappoint. 

My wife and I had a wonderful weekend - Billy Elliot and La Famiglia on the Saturday followed by the London Duck tour (brilliant!), the London Eye, La Clique and Joy King Lau on the Sunday. But thanks mainly to the 41 Hotel, I now have enough bonus points from the wife to last me a lifetime! We can't wait to go back.",5,2008,11,27
137,Wonderful Staff,"From the minute we arrived the service was wonderful. Whilst checking in, we were offered a glass of wine and then we were shown our room. Not the biggest room we have stayed in (Paris can beat that hands down) but there was everything we could possibly have needed. Spotless and very comfortable!
Within walking distance of Buckingham Palace and theatres it was very nice to just stroll around and not have to look for a taxi. The Victoria theatre was a five minute walk where we saw Billy Elliot.....Fantastic. A stroll home afterwards to a nice cosy lounge and a nightcap! :o) Breakfasts were excellent! No need for lunch as we strolled around sightseeing. It almost felt like we had stayed there before as we felt so welcomed and we will definitely stay there again!!!",5,2008,11,25
137,A special place,"We stayed at 41 on a Saturday night for my partner's birthday treat. This is the second time we have been. 

We couldn't have chosen better- the service is 2nd to none. The staff are wonderful and cannot do enough to help make your stay special.

The rooms, whilst not huge, are beautifully decorated and fitted out in black and white- very stylish. Our room had a working fireplace which made it feel so homely.
The bathroom has a huge shower above the bath, another separate shower and luxury toiletries which smell gorgeous.
We booked the romantic turndown and returned to our room to find flickering candles, rose petals, the fire blazing, massage oil and champagne. Absolute bliss!

The breakfast is unbelievable, very tasty and loads of choice. The orange juice is freshly squeezed, the coffee excellent.

The location is great, about 3 mins walk from Victoria station and at the front of the hotel, overlooks the Royal Mews. Buckingham Palace is less than 5 mins walk up the road.

We had one problem during the night when an extractor fan above our room became faulty and woke us up making a horrendous noise. We contacted reception and within 20 mins it had been fixed. We were offered a glass of champagine each as an apology. As it was 1am we declined, but it was a lovely offer. We also had another apology from Antoinette in the morning. These things happen, and we understand that, but the staff dealt with the problem without fuss.

So, in summary, if you are looking for somewhere special, this is the place. Not cheap, but worth the money, it will certainly be the place we go to for a treat, even if it means working overtime!",5,2008,11,24
137,One of the finest hotels I have stayed in,"There are not enough superlatives to describe this hotel.  I don't think they have forgotten anything.

I have stayed at other Carnation Hotels before and they are all superb and the service is 100%

As an ex Hotel Representative and Travel Agent, I'm fussy and used to five star hotels - the 41 should be a 6 star or more",5,2008,11,24
137,The No1 Boutique Hotel in London,"From start to finish this Hotel was a pleasure to stay in. On arrival we took the lift to the check in desk where we were met by friendly and warm  staff.

Our room was upgraded free of charge to a split level suite, which was being made ready as we arrived. To pass the time we had afternoon Tea in the lounge, by the fire place accompanied  with a couple of glasses of Champagne.

Once ready we were shown to our room, which had the wow factor and every possible luxury. The room was clean and had plenty of space including a massive bed and an ensuite bathroom with two showers.

In the lounge is a bar which has a range of complimentary drinks and snacks as well as a help yourself honesty system if you wanted something stronger.

All in all a great stay and had the feel of a home from home so we will definately be back in the new year to celerbrate something else.",5,2008,11,10
137,Indiviual attention,"This fifth floor boutique hotel attached to the Rueban Hotel is well worth the price.  A fine executive lounge, private elevator and attentive staff offer a great value in London.  The hotel's restaurants and lounges offer quality food and drinks.  We will return.",5,2008,11,02
137,Very poor service for a 5 star hotel,"This hotel has many positive attributes that you can find by reading other reviews on this site.  It is beautiful, has a refined atmosphere, and is in an excellent location.  The reason I gave Hotel 41 such a poor review has to do with service.  After checking out and arriving back in the United States in late July 2008, my wife realized that she left behind a pair of shorts.  

We called Hotel 41 staff two times and e-mailed them three times.  On three separate occasions in September and early October, staff members e-mailed my wife that the shorts were being sent in the mail from London to the United States.  The shorts have not arrived as of early November.  Obviously, the shorts are not being sent to us even though three separate assurances were made that the shorts would be sent.  

I realize this is not monumental, but in general, first class hotels are rated as such because of excellent service (in addition to well above average amenities).  Please judge for yourself if this is first class service.",2,2008,11,01
137,Extremely Attentive Staff,"We went to Hotel 41 for the first two nights of our Honeymoon before flying.  Had a lovely stay, the hotel is everything you would expect of a 5 star London Hotel.  We booked through the Hotel Website, which offered a slightly better deal that some of the hotel booking websites.

The building is wonderful, the entrance is right next door to the Rubens Hotel – very discrete entrance, quite easy to miss, many of the cab drivers did not know the hotel, so ask for the Rubens…

The receptionist gave an extremely warm welcome and even champagne on arrival – which was a nice touch to begin our honeymoon, she also arranged for candles and rose petals in the room upon our return from dinner – which again was fabulous!

Overall staff were extremely attentive and nothing was too much trouble for them…

Just a few minor niggles…. We learned that you need to put the Do Not Disturb sign on your door, otherwise you will be interrupted in the evening – the electronic do not disturb sign did not appear to work in our room, neither the desk lamp.

At check-in we were offered the opportunity to upgrade our room, at a reduced price – which we took.  Whilst the bed was huge, we felt the room to be a little cramped, it was difficult to pass between the bed and the desk – it would have been interesting to see a how much smaller our original room was.

A small bar area was provided in the room, which was cramped, possibly better to leave it with the sofa and table, to give the room a more spacious feel…

Our tea cups were removed in the evening and not returned for our early morning tea – additionally, tea bags were not replenished at all during our stay.

The other issue, was we were disturbed by the occupants of the room next to us (I fully appreciate that this is totally out of the hotels control) – however they had a rather squeaky bed….

Overall a great stay.. with some wonderful touches… especially “Plunder the Pantry”…",5,2008,10,28
137,Ab fab!!,"If you are thinking about staying at this hotel, stop thinking and just do it because there is no way you will be disappointed! I would agree with a previous reviewer that booking through the hotel website will most likely give you the best deal. There are various tempting packages on offer. We stayed in an executive room and had complimentary wireless internet and english breakfast included. The staff were very attentive and polite, without being stuffy. I was a bit dubious about the compact communal lounge area, but as the hotel doesnot seem to encourage access to non-residents, this area serves its multiple functions very well. I am absolutely besotted with this hotel and thoroughly recommend it to anyone who wants a personalised hotel experience, and not made to feel like just another paying guest.",5,2008,10,02
137,Wonderful Hotel but Sneaky Charges - Watch your Bill at Check Out,"I had a wonderful experience at this hotel for my first and only stay.  The registration process was easy and pleasant.  The lobby and rooms was above expectations.  However, when I checked out I noticed all these extra charges.  For example, when I registered they offered me a glass of champagne but when offered a refill they failed to explain that it would cost $30.  Later on I was in the lobby and was offered a glass of wine.  I found on my bill that I was charged over $25 for that glass of wine. The continental breakfast in the lobby which was explained to be part of the room price was $50.  None of these charges had signed receipts with them either.  When I disputed the charge when I left they acted like I made the mistake and no one else seems to complain about it.  After further polite protests, I decided to take my complaints to Centurion Amex Travel who booked it so they can at least note it as I am noting here as well.  My issues were not resolved with the hotel even after requesting a call from the manager.  If it wasn't for the sneaky charges, I would've been able to say it was a perfect 5.0 experience.",3,2008,10,01
137,The nicest staff at the 41 and true 5 star quality service,"I travel a lot with my 18 months old daugher and we always stay at 5 star hotels. Because of that, we are used to good treatment and at least something resembling true luxury. I booked the 41 hotel in London through LuxuryLink and got a good deal on our stay, so I expected a somewhat lukewarm approach upon arrival, but my fears were completely ungrounded. Everybody at the hotel was incredibly welcoming and by the third day, I was looking forward to going ""home"" (the hotel) in the evening and have a tea at the fireplace. Despite the extra work my little daughter presented the staff with, nobody was ever dismissive or impatient with us; from the wonderful waiters to  ""Uncle Andrew"" (the resident manager of the hotel, Andrew Gortchacow, who could not have been more perfect in any way - ever so kind and professional, he even went down to the store one night to buy a pacifier for my daughter!), everbody did their absolute best to make my stay with a toddler enjoyable. The food was good, the rooms were lovely, I liked the design and all the late night snacks we were provided with (such as olives and a fruit basket every evening); and, the location is excellent as well, the hotel being practically opposite  Buckingham Palace. The hotel did a great job on booking us tours and helpings us with suggestions for sightseeing, and the staff even packed us a free lunch basket when we left for our trip (full of fruits and other snacks, things my daughter preferred to eat). All in all, this is a hotel best suited for people who want luxury but also a relaxed, romantic, super friendly atmosphere, along with a very well trained, accomodating staff.  Thank you everyone at the 41 for making my birthday this year truly special - I can hardly wait to go back!",5,2008,09,24
137,I'll never forget London!!!!,"I visited London for the very first time in March 2008 and only stayed for four days and three nights. I'm soooo thankful I chose to go with a friend's reccomendation and stayed at  Hotel 41. The experience was unforgettable and a large part had to do with the fabulous staff whom were all attentive to our every need in a non-smothering way. They were all very cordial and knowledgable about their city, eventhough 70% of them were born and raised in other countries outside of the UK. If we asked them a question that they didn't know the answer to, they told us they would get back to us, and they always did, with the right answer! Not to mention, most the staff is comprised of young people in their early to mid-twenties and yet they were so refined and cordial you would have easily suspected they were long time veterans in the hotel industry. Room service was great, the location is great (right behind Buckingham Palace) and the staff is wonderful!!! My next trip to London will definitely include a stay at Hotel 41.",5,2008,09,15
137,Great Stay,My wife and I stayed at the Hotel 41 for four days in late August 2008 after completing a 2 week European cruise.  The hotel was delightful with a gracious staff.  I particularly liked the exclusivity of the hotel.  It was a great ending to our 3 week European vacation.  I would certainly stay again next time Im in London.,5,2008,09,15
137,Amazing,"I can not speak highly enough about the staff or the hotel itself. Upon arrival they gave us a glass of Champagne and we sat in the lounge while the finshing touches were done to the room. I asked for the 'romantic turndown' to be done for arrival and this was excellent......rose petals all over the room, fire place, more champagne and candles. 

The room itself was great with a massive bed and the bathroom had a wonderful shower as well as a bath. You get a feeling of real modern luxury with the black and white theme. The hotel is only a 3 minute walk to the tube station and right next door to buckingham palace.

We had breakfast in the morning which was included in the package and was again excellent.

I would suggest booking directly through the hotel website as they seem to offer the best rates. 

All in all a great experience and an excellent hotel for couples.",5,2008,09,03
137,Very good but slightly uneven,"So it's hard for me with this one, because I definitely would echo the sentiments of other reviewers in stating that for the most part the experience here was awesome. However, there was some slight uneveness when it came to the stay. There were some slight issues with the room that didn't detract from our experience since we're not fussy, but were a bit of a surprise and worth mentioning since it wasn't just one thing. The safe didn't work, the luggage stand was broken, the sink didn't drain very well, the TV remote had anemic batteries, and some other such minor annoyances. The room otherwise was lovely and unique. The service in general was outstanding, in particular Andrew. However, there was some unevenness here. We arrived on a flight from the US early in the morning, and our room was not yet vacated or ready. No problem, not the hotel's fault as check in isn't until 3pm. We did a little sightseeing and came back at noon. We were told that the room was vacated and was being serviced at that moment. We were told that it would be ready in 15 to 20 minutes, so we sat in the beautiful lobby lounge and waited. We weren't re-approached to be led to our room until one hour later. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining since this was before check-in still, but I found it strange to be told 15-20 minutes and then have it be an hour. Then we were led to the wrong room on the opposite of the hotel from our room first before being led to the correct room. When we got to the room, I requested bags to be brought up by the porter twice before it was finally delivered 35 minutes after the first request, too long I felt for a small hotel. And we were missing a bag that the porter could not find on a couple of additional tries until I went down personally to the bag check room to show him which bag it was.

The location of the hotel is great, in a quiet area, yet adjacent to Buckingham Palace. 

So, don't get me wrong, I would definitely stay here again and would recommend others to stay here, I'm simply pointing out the unevenness of some things.",4,2008,08,27
137,Faultless!,"We spent 5 wonderful days in London in August 2008, and Hotel 41 helped make the visit out of this world. 

The hotel is well situated very close to Buckingham Palace, and an easy walk to Trafalgar Square and on to Covent Garden and the West End. It is also only a couple of minutes walk from Victoria Station.

The Hotel is almost invisible from outside (we asked cab drivers to take us to the Rubens Hotel, Hotel 41's sister hotel, which is right next door).

You could not be made to feel more welcome. The ""whatever, whenever"" button on the room phone reflects the hotel staff's willingness to make your stay as perfect as possible. The rooms are well equipped with iPod docking stations and a series of complimentary extras are offered on the hotel website, including a choice of pillow types.

The executive lounge is wonderfully decorated and the larder is stocked with delicious complimentary snacks.

Don't get me wrong, the rates at the hotel are by no means the cheapest you will find in London - but if you are looking for that special get-away, you won't go wrong with Hotel 41.",5,2008,08,21
137,A little gem,"My stay at 41 was short but was certainly long enough for this boutique hotel to make a huge impact on me.  The staff are attentive, welcoming, friendly and at all times professional, nothing is too much trouble.  On arrival I was given a warm welcome and shown around the hotel, the decor is tasteful which much attention to detail.  The lounge area is welcoming, stocked with complimentary snacks and a well stocked honesty bar.  I was taken to my room, again beautifully decorated and scrupulously clean with a huge bed dressed in crisp white sheets and sumptious bedding.  41 has a whatever/whenever policy and there is even a 'whatever/whenever' button on the phone in the bedroom.  As a femail travelling alone I felt I was in safe surroundings and was well looked after, when I returned from my evening out I found my bed had been turned down and candles had been placed in my bathroom.  The attention to detail at 41 is second to none and I look forward to my next visit.",5,2008,08,20
137,Luxurious retreat with private club atmosphere,"I simply have nothing bad to say about this wonderful hotel with a fantastic location. We went for the romantic turndown service (which I highly recommend if you want to impress someone special) which was immaculatly executed with champagne, rose petals, candle light and a roaring real fire - truely 'Wow'. They have so many exceptional complimentry services available I simply can't list them all here, and the service and staff were wonderful. Second to none.",5,2008,08,17
137,Wonderful Property,"I stayed at the Hotel 41 with a friend of mine and we were extremely happy with the hotel itself, the design of it and the staff. All around friendly people, the check in staff greeted us with a glass of champagne and allowed us to use their hospitality suite while waiting for our room, which was very helpful! The room was considerably large for London and the rain shower was fantastic. We didn't have time to enjoy breakfast the next morning, due to a very early flight home, so the hotel sent up some early morning coffee on the house. We can definitely recommend this hotel for any trip to London! 100% fantastic service!!",5,2008,08,11
137,Incredible Hotel & Excellent Service,"I recently stayed at Hotel 41 with my mum for a 'special' Birthday (we made a weekend of it) and had simply the most fantastic stay.  The staff are so welcoming and helpful I can't recommend it enough. 

The Executive Lounge is beautifully decorated and has snacks and drinks on hand, an honesty bar (lovely selection of champagne if you fancy a glass, or two…) and they serve the best Earl Grey tea I've had in a long time - you hardly want to leave the tranquility of the place and face the hustle and bustle of London - Mum and I were quite happy sitting in there chatting to the friendly staff and flicking through 'coffee table' books. It's also nice to have your own secure private entrance to the hotel  - no queueing to check in/out etc.

Our room was decorated in a tasteful black and white style with lots of unique pieces, not just the standard hotel stuff - they have actually put some thought into the ornaments, lamps and pictures so it's very inviting and has a home-from-home feel (if only my home was actually like that!). -oh and spacious rooms which is a rareity in central London. Well insulated walls & windows so it's very quiet day & night, air conditioned (thankfully as it was very humid when we were there - such bliss to kick your shoes off and relax - in a cool room with comfy hotel slippers and a choice of bathrobes too! (fluffy toweling or waffle)

They seem to have thought of everything you could want (and probably didn't even know you wanted!) - a choice of 12 pillows from the ""pillow menu"" and lots of little extras that you can ask for (scented candles, face wipes, moisturisers) - nothing seemed any trouble at all, they even pointed out that the telephone had a button called ""whatever, whenever"" ( no need to search the literature to find out where you're supposed to dial).

The staff are extremely customer focused and really do go the extra mile(s) here and make it seem so effortless.  They left a beautiful birthday cake in the room for mum and a card for her - she was so touched and it made for an extra special stay.  By pressing “whatever/whenever” the leftover cake we didn’t manage was quickly wrapped up so we could take it away and eat later, well you wouldn’t want to leave something that nice to waste.

Once we'd checked out they kept our luggage there all day, lent us an umbrella  (if only the UK weather was reliable!), and when we returned (from a hot,  sticky, stressful tube journey) were invited in for a cup of tea in the lounge before we continued home - I know some relatives who wouldn't even make us feel that welcome!

I just wish we’d stayed longer and will definitely be returning. Happy to give advice to others thinking of staying here – my advice: do it now, you won’t regret it, I simply can't sing it's praises enough.",5,2008,08,04
137,Fantastic Hotel,"There is no reason why this hotel should not be ranked #1 - it is a fantastic gem.  My wife and I were in London celebrating (coincidentally) my 41st birthday and booked three nights at Hotel 41.  Located close to all central London attractions as well as an open-top bus tour stop, Hotel 41 is nearly a perfect property.

From the moment we arrived were treated exceptionally well.  The staff went out of their way to assist us with tour bookings, dinner reservations, taxis, etc.  They even sent a delicious cake to our room in honor of my birthday.  Fresh fruit and other snacks were also in abundant supply.  The room was wonderful; large by European standards with a very comfortable king size bed, small desk, and sofa.  Free wireless was a plus.  Complaints?  Other than the lack of outlets in the bathroom (according to my wife, a necessity) I can't think of a thing that is wrong with this lovely hotel.  We will certainly stay there again.",5,2008,08,01
137,Personalized Service in London!,"Centrally located on Buckingham Palace Road the Hotel 41 is a very comfortable, well appointed boutique hotel. Top attributes: incredibly helpful staff, relaxing environment, and top notch service! Highly recommend it.",4,2008,07,28
137,Luxurious stay at Hotel 41,"My wife and I stayed at the hotel in May to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. The room was excellent and had the most comfortable beds we have ever slept in.  All staff were excellent, friendly and very attentive. They were always willing to assist in any way they could. On our first night's stay we arrived back at the room to find rose petals scattered around the room and bath, together with numerous lit candles. Chocalate covered strawberries had also been provided. These were really lovely touches given that it was our silver wedding anniversary. It just demonstrated how thoughtful and caring they are in looking after their guests. We ate at Reubens Library restaurant next door and were equally well looked after.
We would recommend both to anyone.",5,2008,07,27
137,wanted to move in and live there forever,"well, I was staying at the Sheraton Park Lane (total dump, btw) and searched for a cool boutique hotel. This tiny gem is nestled on the fifth floor and next door to the Ruebens Hotel. To say it was nirvana is the understatement of the world. I had this amazing black and white adorable room, superb linens, a heated floor and a heated towel rack in the bathroom (as well as a flatscreen television.) I was so in love with the hotel that I did not even want to go see the sights of London, just wanted to curl up with the body pillow they brought me and listen to my tunes on my Bose sound deck. Feel free to contact me. I cannot even rave enough (oh and free snacks all day long...)
truly delightful and wonderful. You will love it.",5,2008,07,21
137,"Liked it, and would return.","Great hotel and very good location.  Free food around the clock -- they keep snacks out all day long.  Small, but nicely appointed rooms.  The hotel is a boutique with only one floor.  Check-in, lounge and dining are all the same general area, which is not the norm.  But the service is great.  Very individualized attention if you like that sort of thing.  We've stayed twice and would probably return again.",4,2008,07,20
137,Be Careful,"Hotel 41 is a very beautiful property, directly across from the Mews at Bckingham Palace.  The property is small with very attentive staffing.  BE CAREFUL _ breakfast was 20 pounds which is $40 for cereal, fruit, yogurt, and some cold meats.  We were under the impression it was included after reading the reviews and also an article they had on display in the lounge.  We brought this to their attention but they staunchly refused to reduce the cost which was disappointing. They told us the article was 'older'  I suggested they remove it. The rooms are very expensive and therefore I believe the breakfast should have been included.  Check out the Ruben - which is the same building - using different floors, and less expensive.",4,2008,07,11
137,What a gem!!,"I cannot recommend this hotel enough.  The staff were very courteous, friendly and seemed genuinely interested in each guest.  They  remembered earlier conversations and picked up on them later.
We arrived early afternoon & so our room was not ready(checkout is not until noon); we were offered a glass of champagne & were happy to pass a plesant hour in the lounge reading the paapers.
We had a room overlooking the palace (and would strongly recommend that you request this).  It was pristine and, although the decor was black and whire, it was a warm and inviting room.  The lighting system was unfathomable as the bathroom light that we'd turned off when we went to bed was mirculously on the following morning.  This is by no means a criticism as the mood lighting was excellent - just an observation and a challenge to crack!
Nothing was too much trouble and often the staff outnumbered the guests in the ""executive lounge"" .
We stayed for the weekend of the concerts in Hyde Park and made full use of the ""butler's pantry"" when returning each evening.  The spread was superb; meat,cheese, fish and shell fish, followed by fresh fruit.  With a large glass of red wine from the honesty bar this made for a perfect end to a perfect evening!
The continental breakfast was magnificant; simple but first class in every way.
Andrew, the manager, went out of his way to make guests feel welcome, in a quiet gentle way - he never appeared hurried and seemed to be on duty from dawn until midnight!
Yes, it is expensive, but it is very special and I will return as soon as funds allow.",5,2008,07,02
137,Great Hotel,"What a nice hotel, very central to eveything.  We were treated like king and queens. I would reccomend this hotel to anyone traveling from the US.
We will be back",5,2008,06,16
137,Won't stay anywhere in london but here,"We had a 2 night stay here at the end of our 3 week europe trip and it was probably our favorite hotel of the trip.  Upon arrival we were met by the head concierge and taken upstairs to the lounge to check in to our room.  We were met by 2 other staff members who offered us champagne and asked if they could help us find our way around the city.

After we checked in we were taken through a very cool, but very narrow hallway to our room.  The room itself was one of the coolest rooms i've stayed in.  The living room was very small but had a table for 4.  In the living room there was a small, narrow set of stairs that led up to the bedroom.  The bedroom itself was very spacious and the glass ceiling was amazing.  Falling asleep under the stars right in the middle of london was incredible.  The bathroom was great too, a huge jacuzzi and rainfall shower were both taken advantage by me and my fiancee.  

We were only at the hotel for 2 nights but I already know where I'm staying during my next trip to london.",5,2008,06,14
137,Fantastic Experience!,"My husband and I stayed for a couple nights in London after our trip to Paris and had a wonderful stay.  The staff is very attentive and they tend to your every need.  My husband needed a band aid and with in virtually seconds they were at our room with several band aid options!

The room was nicely decorated - lots of attention to detail.  We had booked the Romance Package and when we got home from a night out our room was sprinkled with rose petals, soft music, massage oil and candles.  It was so beautiful and a lovely way to end the evening!

You do at times feel more like you are at home rather than in a hotel.  The Executive Lounge is a wonderful place to sip a glass of champagne, read a magazine and relax outside of your hotel room.

The location was great - we walked most places since the weather was nice.  You can virtually get anywhere in just a few minutes via cab.

If you are looking for a flawless experience stay here.",5,2008,06,04
137,Good alternative for the more established 5-star hotels in London,"The reviews on Tripadvsior were the main reason for us (usually staying at Claridges), choosing this hotel for our short stay in London.
First of all, the taxidriver had a hard time finding this hotel. (Ask for the Rubens Hotel which is located next door).
Having found the front door, a friendly welcome awaites you entering  the small lobby of this hotel. An elevator takes you to the fifth floor where you walk through some narrow corridors before entering the lounge (beuatifully decorated). Very personalised welcome and we believe the other reviewers wehen saying that this place is or can be a home away from home.
Only one remark; the Executive Double room we booked is really quite (say too) small for a hotel of this standing. Really everything (and I mean EVERYTHING up to the last detail) you need is in there and the room again is beautifully decorated (mainly in black and white), but one hardly can turn is this room of let's say max 15m2. If you're with your partner, do not start walking around in this room the same time; you keep on bumping into eachother.  The size of the bathroom was even worse. 
However, a nice change to the more established 5-star hotels in London. The staff are great and the Romantic Turndown service we got was most attentive. Roseleaves everywhere and some 20 candles burning. Great surprise.
We'll be back (but will book a suite next time)",4,2008,05,31
137,great time,"Stayed here for a short break. Fantastic place! Clean, cosey, well mannered staff and loverly food.",5,2008,05,28
137,AMAZING service and location!,"I arrived at this hotel based on the reviews of Trip Advisor, and it surpassed my expectations.

First of all, it is a tiny hotel that is hard to find.  The taxi driver went up and down the street until he decided to call and find out where it was.  So, if you go, tell the driver it's next to The Rubens (The Rubens at the Palace) and you will avoid him a lot of turns :-)

The hotel is located on the second floor, so when you come in, the concierge (young and very knowledgeable) greets you and calls somebody to accompany you to the reception.  This was incredible.  The attention to detail, the politeness of the staff, the courtesy....

In the hall they have a container with apples, so if you are EVER hungry at night (like I was) and feel like having a snack, you can always go out and help yourself.  In the evening they also have drinks and snacks at the library, but I can't comment on that since I didn't attend.

The hotel is *very* cozy.  The decoration is classic in the library, but the rooms have a nice contemporary style.  Everything they do is to make you feel very comfortable.  

The registration process was painless, they brought me juice while I was filling out some papers, and then they showed me to my room.

The room was a surprise.  Beautiful, and full of wonderful details that made my stay extremely enjoyable.  First, a little blanket that seemed to decorate the bed, but that I could also use to cover while I took a nap.  At night, when they went to turn down the bed, they would light a candle that looked very romantic and showed that they cared about my well being (it gave a sensation of peace).  There was also a small spray bottle that I could use on my pillow to help me relax and sleep better.  Wow....!  

Breakfast was excellent.  There was variety and the food was fresh.  The staff was sooooo friendly, you never felt at a hotel!  It was like being at a friend's house, almost with family.

Internet was also provided above the ""library"" (the place where everything happened), and they had games and books you could borrow if you felt like enjoying your afternoon ""at home"".

Now, what I liked the MOST (besides the service that beat the hotel in Dubai).... the button on the phone that read: WHATEVER WHENEVER.  This was for ANYTHING you might need.  Absolutely incredible.  They got me tickets to the theater (great seats!), directed me to the stores I wanted to visit, a casino.... WHATEVER, whenever.  They said it and they meant it.

You can't go wrong with this hotel.  I've been to London several times and NOTHING compares to this service.  In addition, the location is great and the room is very very comfortable.

If you have any questions, ask!  But I'll tell you that WHENEVER I go to London, this is the place where I'll stay!!!!!!

Congratulations and THANK YOU to the staff!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5,2008,05,26
137,"Fantastic, chic and cosy!","It was a toss up between the Marriott County Hall or 41 Hotel for our weekend in London to celebrate my birthday and I am so glad we chose the 41 Hotel! 

Firstly, the location was superb - just a short 3 minutes walk from the Victoria tube station and a stone's throw from Buckingham Palace. A great way to start your sightseeing tour of London. The sightseeing tour buses also stop right outside the hotel for you to hop off after a day of sightseeing. 

The service at 41 Hotel was impeccable (and I am rather hard to please!). The staff are proactive and genuinely interested in their guests, going the extra mile to make you feel special. It was my birthday on the day we checked in and the hotel arranged for a cake in the room as a surprise. A really nice touch. Upon check out, knowing that we have a long drive ahead of us, the staff rushed to pack us fruits, pastries and chocolates for our journey home. 

The hotel's turn down service was second to none. When we got back to our room after a long day, classical music was playing, chocolates waiting on our bed and the next day's weather forecast was all ready on the bed for you to start the next day. 

Try to also get breakfast included in your room rate, as you can choose from a full english breakfast or waffles, bagels etc to fuel your energy tank for a day of walking around London. 

The only gripe that I have is that the hotel is easy to miss, if you are driving. Just look out for the Reuben's along Buckingham Palace road and there is a 41 flag (rather inconspicuous!) next to it. The concierge at the Reuben's will park it for you for approx 28 pounds per day, excluding the congestion charge. 

Will not hesitate to stay at this hotel again. In fact, cant wait to return! 

PS: for smokers, they only have one smoking room in the entire hotel. So do indicate way in advance if you really need a smoking room as the entire hotel is non smoking.",5,2008,05,19
137,The best hotel for a dream weekend in London,"Every time I go for a week-end in London, I stay in the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel. This time my choice was for the 41 Hotel because I saw a lot of good reviews and positive pictures on the tripadvisor. To make my reservation I used the hotel website and had a very good internet rate discount.

The first good thing when you enter this hotel is the reception : they give you a complimentary wine or champagne and you just relax before going to your room. The second thing is the room (the cocoon ?) : the executive room was absolutely amazing ! the decor, the atmosphere, the fire place, the king bed, the tv, the bathroom and all the details were just charming.

As soon as I tried the bed, I just fall asleep... The temperature of the room is perfect, the room more than clean, I find french news paper ""le monde"" and the staff was great all time.

Every time you need something, you just have to push the ""whatever/Whenever"" button and you have what you need.

The weekend with my Fiance was so romantic and so relax in this Hotel and I recommend it to everyone.

It's my preferred hotel in London and I will continue to go in everytime.",5,2008,05,19
137,awesome,"We spent three nights at 41 and the experience was beyond best expectations. Hotel and the staff were so good, that instead of queuing to sights and musicals we spent lovely evenings in our room.
When planning our next trip we will check if there is this groups hotel near somewhere.. or decide to travel to a place where is a Red Carnation hotel.",5,2008,05,11
137,Sleeping on a cloud,"My husband and I recently visited London and stayed at this lovely botique hotel for a return visit. The experience was even better than our first stay, we were welcomed as if we were returning to our home. The staff is wonderfully attentive, without being cloying, a welcome drink is served in the lounge, where you can totally relax by the fire, or use the business center to catch up on e mails etc. The lounge also serves tasty canapes in the early evening. The staff is truly able to obtain a reservation at  most any place you wish to dine, or show you wish to see; and it  is made clear that it is truly is their pleasure to help you.  The location of the hotel  puts you in  an easy walk or cab ride to everything.The room are lovely  always with a  delicious fruit tray  upon arrival and but the really exceptional features are the beds. It  is the best sleep and rest I have ever had while travelling!!!! The sheets and linnens are cloud - like. The baths are exceptional containing everything  you need to complete a restful stay. I am looking forward to another return visit",5,2008,05,01
137,Exemplary Accommodations & Service,London was the final destination of our trip before returning home to the U.S.  This was a casual business trip taken by my wife and I along with two employees.  We were met with an attitude of sincere graciousness and hospitality.  The hotel staff was friendly and eager to assist no matter the question or challenge we posed to them.  The overall atmosphere was top notch and the rooms were outstanding.  The private lounge was a very relaxing rallying point for our group that provided for conversation and/or access to high speed internet.  I honestly cannot think of a single constructive criticism that would contribute to this company's performance.  We will be back and encourage others to enjoy the experience whether in London for business or pleasure.,5,2008,04,16
137,Definitely lived up to lofty expectations.,"Having read previous reviews before the trip, I wondered if Hotel 41 could be as exceptional as described.  I am happy to say that it deserves all the praise and high ratings.  

The room was as expected, very comfortable and tastefully appointed.  The bed was heaven at the end of a long day.  I would have liked free internet access in the room, but the business center is very convenient and was always available.  The housekeeping staff does a great job of making sure that you'll miss your hotel room once you've returned home.

What sets this hotel apart is the staff.  They are a superb group that caters to all your needs.  Everyone was friendly without feeling forced.

The location isn't perfect for late night activities as it's pretty quiet on buckingham palace road after dark.  But at the same time, it's probably the safest place you can be in all of London.   Everything is just a short walk away and, with Victoria tube station just around the corner, whatever you can't walk to is easily reached by the underground in minutes.",5,2008,04,16
137,Excellent,"We always stay in 4 or 5 star hotels and have done for many years.This hotel is beautiful , small , homely, old English gentelmens club.Our room was beautifully decorated in black and white and the bed and pillows were wonderful.They had everything and more than you need in the room. The bathroom was beautiful , the staff genuinely friendly and very knowledgable and all very well groomed.The breakfast room was great, we also had a quick room service meal on our arrival which was wonderful.The location is great just behind Buckingham Palace.
It is just what i imagined a British Boutique Hotel to look like.Yes it is exspensive but London is the most exspensive city for hotels at the moment and you have to pay top dollar for anything good in London.It was wet and cold and after a tourism day we got back in our room and did not want to leave to Mr. Chow for dinner.
Just great.",5,2008,03,31
137,Outstanding hotel.....,"We stayed here for the weeked in March 2008 to celebrate my birthday - my husband booked this as a surprise and I was definitley not disappointed.  

The hotel is fabulous and is worthy of its 5 star status.  We stayed in an executive  king room which was outstanding.  They had a birthday cake and champage in the room, with lots of extra little touches such as fresh fruit, bucket of ice, little bowls of olives.  There was 3 plasma tv's in the room, including 1 in the bathroom!

They really go out there way to make you feel at home.  The bed was huge and so comfortable.  They turned it down for you at night and left a little bottle of lavendar mist on your pillow.  They also put a little card on top of the bed with the next day's weather forecast and left fresh towels in the bathroom twice a day.  

I cannot say enough about the personal touches.  They greet by your name and cannot do enough to ensure you enjoy your stay.  They do this very well without making you feel uncomfortable.  

As expected, the hotel is in a great location.  With Buckingham Palace literally being on your doorstep.  

This is an excellent hotel and surpassed my expectations.  I cannot recommend it enough and will definitley go back soon.

Book this hotel with confidence.  You will not be disappointed.",5,2008,03,30
137,Fantastci!,Myself and boyfriend stayed at 41 Hotel last night and it totally lived up to its great reputation! Though the bedroom was a little small this did not mare the experience at all. The staff were lovely and friendly and unlike some other 4 or 5 star hotels we have stayed in were not at all stuffy or snotty!!!,5,2008,03,30
137,"Amazing Service, Fabulous English Charm","Planning our first trip to London was quite overwhelming.  What part of town should we stay in? What amenities are most important? How do you make a choice, easy, count on the Tripadvisor community.  If it weren't for Tripadvisor, we would have never found the most amazing hotel.  Located on Buckingham Palace Road, we were perfectly situated to see the city.  Prior to our arrival, we were contacted by the amazing manager, Chantal.  She met every need before and during our stay.  Personalized service is what she specializes in.  We were greeted by a doorman who knew our names.  We were taken up the elevator to a beautiful room with mahogany wood, a fireplace, a library, beverages, snacks and much more.  We enjoyed breakfast here each morning.  The honor bar was fabulous, although the staff butlers never allowed us to carry a drink to our room!  The rooms are beautiful black and white marble.  Bowls of apples filled the hallways.  Housekeeping and turn down service were impeccable.  The rooms are air conditioned (not common in London) which was very important as we experienced more than a week of very warm weather.  Every question was always answered, every need was always met from theatre tickets to child care to dinner reservations.  The 41 Hotel is truly amazing (recently listed in Travel & Leisure's best 500 hotels in the world).",5,2008,03,15
137,Lived up to our expectations,"Hotel 41 delivered excellent service.  We were met at the front door by the manager who helped us check in and offered us a free drink and snacks while we were waiting to get into our room (we were early) .  The staff were very attentive, they offered advice on places to go and things to see, we had our every need catered for.  

The 'romantic turndown' service we ordered as an optional extra was fab - rose petals and candles were left in the room, along with a chilled bottle of verve clique champagne (this service came free if you ordered via the 'our offers' section of the hotel's website - there were lots of other things to choose from too, I'd recommend you have a look).

The room was lovely - tastefully decorated in black and white.  The room felt a tad small but we did go for the cheapeast option which was the executive double.  If you have long legs you may have trouble using the loo in a room of this type as there's hardly any room between the loo and the bath - we're not tall so it wasn't a problem for us.

The hotel was in a really good location, just a few minutes walk to Victoria tube station, there was no need to use taxi's at all.  The park next to Buckingham Palace was really close by - we had a nice walk around the park on the Sunday just before checking out.

I would recommend this hotel if you fancy a bit of luxury.  We booked this one as it was our anniversary - we normally don't splash out so much but the free extras (i.e. the champagne and the breakfasts which would have cost £25 pp per day if we'd booked through the regular section of the website) meant it turned out to be really good value.",5,2008,03,12
137,Loved it! Loved it! Loved it!,"Stayed with mother and sister.  This is the perfect hotel for ""girls"" out on their own.  The morning breakfast was better than any restaurant breakfast we had.  They take your request for tea/coffee/ toast in addition to the small buffet with nice offerings.  The breakfast every morning offered eggs, sausage and/or bacon, potato, fruit, rolls.  If you are walking all over London, then breakfast is the essential starter.  Plus with the time difference we all woke up hungry.

The hotel is pricey, so look for package deals.  Ours included breakfast, one dinner in the restaurant, fresh flowers in the room, and a bottle of lovely wine.  

Although we had no view, the room was more than large for a London hotel.  The bathroom was small , but luxuriously appointed. The shower from the ceiling was torrential if you desired. A nice change from flow regulators that so many hotels have installed.  Separate bath, heated tiles in front of the sink, small flat screen, and blue subtle lighting for accent.

The staff is the best point of the hotel.  Eager and engaging.  They remember you and really try to meet your needs. The concierge procured no wait in the line type of tickets to several  attractions for the price of a regular ticket.  

One of the hop on/hop off tour buses operates next door.  There is  a gift shop across from the tour bus stop to exchange money at a more favorable rate than in the hotels.  No hotel in Europe we have ever stayed in had good exchange rates.  Find the gift shops with a window in the back for exchange!

Walk to the palace--this hotel is on the same block basically.  Walking distance to green park, and plenty of shopping within walking distance.

The day we left we saw two grand carriages with footmen and horses leaving the Buckingham Palace Mews to pick up some dignitaries.  Quite a site!

Some reviewers here noted the small hallways and lower ceilings, but come on, this is London.  They must work with the existing structures.  Hotel 41 has done amazing things with the space they have.

The library type of lobby is cozy.  Plunder the pantry is free at night (I believe after 9pm) and usually stocked with some nice foods.  It is set up in the same area as breakfast.  Bread and cheese, salad, and often some chicken, turkey, or some other rolled meat offering.  Chips or potato salad, etc.  Usually some fruit.  After enjoying a breakfast at the hotel, we would have lunch late while touring.  Then back for plunder the pantry in cozy surroundings before bed.  We rarely ate an actual dinner.  

Make every attempt not to pay rack rate.  Do some homework and find a deal.  This hotel has a luxurious feel and is in a suburb location!

Like I said: Loved it!",5,2008,02,17
137,everything they say,"Lovely hotel good location,stayed one night. Fireplace in rooms good staff.Very expensive to eat there . really nice hotel.",5,2008,02,17
137,A Very Special Hotel,"My husband and two daughters stayed at this hotel for one night to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday.  From the moment we arrived the staff were wonderful - they were so welcoming and friendly and the service we received was faultless.  It was lovely to be greeted by name on every occasion and nothing was too much trouble for them.  
I booked this hotel on the back of reviews from Tripadvisor and would have no hesitation in recommending it - somewhere very special and personal and with a standard of service which would be very hard to beat.",5,2008,02,13
137,It's undeniably the best,"Hotel 41 the manager and the staff should be praised for such high levels of service they set.  Upon booking in we we're provided with true silver service, my wife and I wanted to take the hop on, hop off bus to get acqainted withthe city.  Upon mentioning it to one of the staff, this lovely girl immediately organised our tickets and promptly showed us where to meet the bus and main attractions worth visiting.

At Hotel 41, they certainly made my wife and I feel welcome and relaxed.  The retaurant/library/check-in is very quaint but warm and friendly.  Also the breakfast served was fantastic.  The rooms were first class and every amenity you could possibly need on a holiday and somethings you thought you didn't need was provided.

I also needed to arrange for a suitcase to be sent back to Melbourne as we we're well overweight with our luggage.  I organised through reception to have my luggage sent unaccompanied.  Again this wasn't too much for the staff, and upon returning to the hotel we we're informed that our luggage had been sent with complete details as to the time and the by whom.  Again an amazing quality hotel with first class staff.

The location is right opposite Buckingham Palace and just near Victoria Station a great location to get around.  I do suggest that when sightseeing to access the hop on, hop off bus it's a great way to get your bearings and make your way around the city.

This is one hotel I will definately continue to stay at when visiting London.  Also Iwant to thank the staff for making my stay an amazing holiday break and making my wife and I feel very comfortable.",5,2008,02,10
137,lovely Formal hotel,"Stayed here whil on a course in london, on 23rd Jan 08.  Very formal place, staff are all lovely, nothing is too much trouble.  A  lovely friendly young man welcomes you at the door, then another member of staff takes you up to resception.

Room was lovely, very clean.  Everything you need is there.

And you have a nice selection for breakfast.

I cannot fault this place.",5,2008,01,25
137,OK but...,"Stayed here in a double for one night. Loved the feel of the place - relaxed and luxurious. The service is first class in that it is attentive and all staff are friendly and helpful. I especially like the executive lounge and butlers pantry

Issues
I booked a double without breakfast from the hotel web site at best rate guarenteed £199 without breakfast (extra £25) plus vat

I then saw an offer with Hotels.com for a city break in the hotel for £224 including breakfast and afternoon tea) plus vat - getting afternoon tea at not more cost was a better deal

I emailed the hotel and asked about taking up ths offer and the email response was that I would have to cancel the reservation with the hotel and book with hotels,com.

When I came to do this there wasnt a double available in the offer - it was available but for a dearer room - not suprising as there were no doubles left in the hotel as I'd booked one!

I phoned the hotel and explained the situation and the lady said she would investigate and phone me back - which she didn't do even though she asked for my mobile number

When I got to the hotel and checked in I explained about this and asked whether it had been sorted and they said they had me down for the £199 booking. I asked whether I could have the offer and this was brushed aside - the lady neither offered the city break deal nor offered to investigate - I got a feeling they didnt like to interfere with the booking system. I couldnt be bothered to persue it - however I expected a more proactive level of service

Other minor niggles - not particuarly a problem but should they be happening in a 5 star hotel? - there was a welcome letter from the manager - very nice touch but he welcomed me back - 'nice to see you again' and this was my first visit
I had been asked on the web site about my favourite fruit and there was none in the room
The room was fine - but some noise from the road, no view and some issues again eg I couldnt turn the light off from my bed as the beds bedhead was jammed on the light switch

These are minor things but jarred as my expectations were high and not me I dont think I should have to ask/query things. No one ever said is everything OK , can I have some feedback, there was a feeling of isnt this wonderful here
Breakfast was nice but my scrambled eggs were not piping hot - they have to cook next door and it was £25 which I think is expensive for what it was
Overall a lovely experience but not particulary good value for one and I probably woudnt stay with them again, especially if I am in a room by myself",3,2008,01,25
137,It could have been a disaster…,"I traveled to London with my mother over the Christmas 2007 holiday season, and promptly got very sick with the flu! This could have made for a real travel disaster.
Fortunately, though, the Hotel 41 staff swung into action to make both Mom and myself comfortable. We ended up ""staying in"" for much of the trip, and 41's club-like atmosphere made it a pleasure to do so. Meals were delicious and varied, the surroundings were luxurious but far from fussy, and the staff were friendly and accommodating (and sympathetic to me being under the weather!). The concierge desk truly went above and beyond, juggling our scheduled events around my energy level and staying in close contact to make sure we weren't overdoing it.
I couldn't recommend this hotel more highly. It truly became a home away from home for our two-person family, and we'll definitely be back… sans flu next time, with any luck.",5,2008,01,10
137,"Friendly, personalised service","If you are looking for service that not only gives you a smile, but surpasses you expectations, this is the place for you.  We stayed over Christmas and had a lovely time.  

The hotel takes well behaved dogs, so we were allowed to share the holiday with our dog.  The room was well appointed  and spacious.  The lounge was a great place to relax by the fire after a day walking around the city.  

This is a good place for tourists and has some of the best business facilities that I have seen.  (Even though it was Christmas, we had to keep in touch with clients).  There are excellent transport links close by and if you are travelling with the dog, two of the prettiest parks in London are a short stroll away.

We travel to London frequently and have stayed in other 5 star hotels.  41 is the best.  We will be returning again, and  recommend this property highly.",5,2007,12,31
137,Your own London club,"Looking for a hotel room at the last minute, I was highly influenced by previous TripAdvisor reviews of this property. I have seldom felt quite this comfortable with my eventual choice. ""41"" is a gem of a place, near to Victoria Station geographically and close to an old school London club in ambience - think Boodle's or White's with a contemporary twist.  

The staff were, without exception, friendly and efficient. The manager greeted us as we checked in and the receptionist showed us to our room. When we returned from our evening out, we stopped in the Executive Lounge for a nightcap of port from the honour bar and some (complimentary) cheese and fresh fruit. 

Cheese before bed is supposed to give you nightmares. 41 is a dream.",5,2007,12,20
137,Wonderfully Relaxing,"After a previous slightly disappointing stay  we were invited back by the lovely manager, Andrew, so the hotel could prove itself to us. And it did! Our room was beautifully comfortable and elegantly appointed. From the moment we arrived, every member of staff was attentive without going over the top. Andrew made every effort to ensure we enjoyed our stay and another member of staff, Ashley, also deserves mention as being kind and attentive to us. The 'plunder the pantry' idea is wonderful for post-theatre snacks and sitting having a drink in front of the fire in the beautiful library is just superb. The breakfast was superb (go for the buffet, it is brilliant!) and we just had the most relaxing time. I would definitely return here and our previous stay was obviously just a blip. All establishments can have off days, the mark of a manager is how he deals with problems and Andrew dealt with ours perfectly. 

Stay here if you can, it's worth every penny!",5,2007,12,16
137,Perfect Vacation,"This hotel is very close to Buckingham Palace, right across from the Royal Mews.  The room we first booked was small, way too small for a 5 night stay.  We stayed there 2 nights and then upgraded to the 2 story Conservatory Suite which was wonderful.  The price was astronomical but for a very special occasion it was worth it.  The ceiling was glass and absolutely beautiful. The breakfast each morning (included) was wonderful and the service was over the top.  The hotel is small (ceilings in the halls are very low, kind of claustrophobic).  It is a unique place done up in all blacks, whites, and wood with red touches throughout.  Very close to the tube and there's a couple of nice pubs within walking distance.  We highly recommend this place for a romantic getaway.",5,2007,12,15
137,41=100%,"Hotel 41 definitely deserves the five-star rating. 

The entrance is situated right next to the Reubens (actually, above the Reubens, on the 5th floor), having a private, key-card access. In fact, it is part of the Red Carnation/Reubens hotel chain. It is all of a 5-minute walk over to Victoria Station and directly across from the Mews. We found the room was more than lovely; they surprised us by upgrading our room at no additional charge. Two types of robes, full-length mirror, flat-screen TV, everything from shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, toothbrush & toothpaste, hair-dryer, iron, ironing board,lemon & water, and other miscellaneous ammenities plus the complimentary ""Plunder the Pantry"" as well as the demeanor of the staff put this boutique hotel up at the top in our book. Oh, another thing that was complimentary were free passes to the gym nearby--LA Fitness Center.

There is no question that 41is on the pricey side, but all things considered, I think you get what you pay for. There certainly were no surprises in the end-price by tacked-on additional charges which weren't known when booking. We liked the breakfast--the food was hot and delicious and fresh. There are also complimentary computers, so you don't necessarily have to bring one, and newspapers and a welcome drink--choice of champagne, wine, juice, or whatever. 

The staff treats you like you want to be treated and are genuinely interested in each guest, even remembering your name. Rooms are extremely quiet and peaceful. At night when the beds are turned down, they even put a small water candle in the bathroom. If you are a single female traveler, you cannot ask for a more perfect place as it is so centrally-situated, safe, and peaceful. 

I asked the manager whether it's better to book online or by phone, and he said by Internet as that has the better prices. They have a 
'lowest fare' guarantee where if you do find a price better than the one you already have, they will honor the lower price. 

I was surprised to see somewhat negative comments by other travelers concerning 41 as we experienced only top-rated service, attention, and
satisfaction. However, 41 is certainly not cheap and if you have a weakening American dollar, the price per night can turn you off. Do think again, though, as to how to budget. If you are able to do a splurge on your hotel room, you can always find ways to save on funds through eating cheap and traveling via the Tube--even to and from Heathrow. 

On one of the days of our stay there, we stayed in during the entire morning and into the early afternoon instead of fighting the crowds outside. Just 'hanging around' like that made our whole stay even more
enjoyable and gave us a bit more mileage for what we paid.",5,2007,11,26
137,The best hotel I have ever stayed at!,"My boyfriend took me to this hotel as a surprise for our anniversary and I can honestly say it is the best hotel I have stayed in. I just dont get the negative reviews listed for it and am sure that some people just have to find something to complain about...(maybe its them and not the hotel..!)
We were treated amazingly throughout  - you cannot fault the service. They make you feel like nothing is any trouble at all and cannot do enough to make you stay special.
The room that we had was a king room with a fire place. Granted it wasnt the biggest room, but your in London so I wouldnt expect it. The furniture and decor is gorgeous and everything you could think of is provided in the room - including 2 types of bath robe and an I-pod deck.
There is an honesty bar and free snacks avaliable through out the day that you are encouraged to take.
I cant say how much I loved this place and at the moment I am trying to convice my boyfriend to take us back but this time for longer..!",5,2007,11,19
137,"Satisfied, not overwhelmed.....","I normally stay at the Lanesborough when in London however following great reviews of Hotel 41 on Trip Advisor  I thought I would try it.

Hmmm, nice enough but I didn't quite see what made others on this site so estatic. The staff were very good which as we all know is a rareity in London. The food in the Library Bar was good but should have been at the fairly high prices. 

The Superior Room I booked was quite small but nicely furnished. The TV reception was poor and the remote had no backing so the batteries kept slipping out. When I mentioned it the staff quickly brought another but it didn't work either. The TV reception was so poor so it didn't really matter anyway I suppose. 

We had breakfast in the Hotel 41 (not in the Library Bar which is really another hotel next door / part of the same building) and this involves ordering from the menu which I suppose means it gets cooked next door. The omlette was quite nice and probably had been hot when it started its journey to me but was cool by the time it arrived - not quite 4* service.

I may stay here again if on business and want to save £100 over the Lanesborough but then again, probably not.",4,2007,11,18
137,Outstanding Boutique Hotel,"We have just returned from spending one night at Hotel 41 and it was quite simply superb!

Could not fault the hotel or the staff who were most attentive, polite and very professional. Gorgeous large modern bathrooms and the best bed we have ever slept in. Everything was spotlessly clean - just wish we could of stayed for a week!!!",5,2007,11,18
137,Beautiful hotel,"We stayed in this hotel for one night in November and it was fantastic from the second we arrived. The hotel staff were excellent and made us feel welcome and relaxed throughout our stay. I have stayed in 5 star hotels before and have sometimes felt uncomfortable by the snobby attitudes of some of the hotel staff when they know that you have booked the hotel at a discounted rate and are not as wealthy as some of the other guests. That was far from the case in hotel 41. 

We were given complimentary champagne when we checked in  and then taken to a beautiful room overlooking buckingham palace. The room was immaculate and had all mordern facitlites you would expect and more. The shower was incredible! Our breakfast was inluded and we were told we could have it in the room for no extra charge. We simply filled in our breakfast choices and hung it on the door before we went to bed with the time we wanted it to arrive. The next morning it was brought to the room exactly at the time we ordered - delicious! The location of the hotel is perfect, just a few minutes walk from victoria station and the underground. There are also lots of resturants surounding the hotel which offer lots of choice if you want to eat out.  
 
I cannot praise this hotel enough it was well worth the money and was a treat for both of us.  I would definately stay here again.",5,2007,11,12
137,I love this hotel!,I hate London! But going to Hotel 41 makes it all worth while! The hotel is the best in London for me. The staff are friendly and welcoming and the rooms are home from home. The lounge area is great and the chefs pantry and honesty bar are great touches. If you need to go to London go to Hotel 41!,5,2007,10,24
137,a true oasis,"I stayed at this hotel about 2 years ago and previously wrote a review based on that stay, saying i thought the value vs. price was not worth it, that it was overpriced for the caliber of hotel it was purporting to be, but I TOTALLY retract my negative comments.  i just stayed there again on my last visit to London and couldn't have stayed at a finer hotel. the price is very comparable to other luxury hotels in London and what you actually get in return is tremendous, beginning from the warm welcome by the friendly and extremely knowledgeable staff, to the welcome glass of champagne and array of snacks, to the invitation to join them for canapés and drinks in the evening and the turndown service with candles, robes and slippers laid out.  it's a true oasis from the rush of central London.  you won't regret it!",5,2007,10,17
137,are you getting what you pay for?,"Will start with the room as that is where you spend most time. Interesting that there are few pictures of the normal (non suite) rooms. Ours was quite small with limited space down the sides of the bed and virtually no storage space for clothes. We were there only one night but would be a major problem if you were there any longer - and paying those prices why should you have to live out of the suitcase?
The bathroom in the pictures must again be for a suite as ours was much smaller with great showers, but the bath was too small for two!
Then it's silly things like the travelodge style tea and coffee tray (perhaps they should go to some of the Radissons I've stayed at to see their espresso machines) and the delay in getting the champagne to the room and the dreadful view- things which detract from what is supposed to be 5 star.
The outside areas were amazing - yes you do feel like you are in a private club in an oasis of calm away from normal London. The service is generally very good. Not sure about the concierge concept. I gave a list of several places I would like to go for dinner and only one was available and at too early a time.

Overall a great experience - just don't look for the sock drawer!",4,2007,10,16
137,Loved it!  Loved it!!  Loved it!!!,"Think that says it all!  We spent 5 glorious nights at 41 and would return without reservation.  It's like being a guest in an English estate.  The staff is superb!!  We arrived from Scotland, by train, on my birthday.  As we checked in we were offered a glass of champagne and comfy couch -- this was check-in, if you can imagine!!   From that moment on it was heaven.  We had dinner in the library and returned to our room to find it covered in red rose pedals -- a red heart on the bed -- a cake, a bouquet of flowers, and red floating candles all over the entire room!  Andrew and Frederic were wonderful!!  Breakfast each day was so relaxing -- every whim was attended to!  Can't wait to return!!",5,2007,10,07
137,Hotel 41 deserves the accolades,"What an amazing experience in London! The hotel reminded me of a Kimpton, very comfy beds and great amenities. The staff (Sofie was great!) did their best to make my stay and my parent's stay fantastic. They couldn't have been warmer and more accommodating.  I would definitely select this hotel again while in London--and the location couldn't be more convenient for all tourist activities.",5,2007,10,07
137,Sheer Pleasure,"We had booked 41 for a birthday weekend. Having stayed at many 5* in London we have been searching for a more personal touch and 41 has it in plenty. From the moment you arrive you are made to feel very special. The black and white decor is perfect for deco lovers. The atmosphere is private club rather than hotel, peaceful and classy.
Room stunning, gleaming clean, fabulous bedding of Egyptian Cotton crisp and inviting to say nothing of the comfort of the mattress!
Breakfast in the Lounge where every whim can be accomodated with discreet loving service from the gorgeous staff. You are always known by your name and you really feel you are part of the ""family"" not just passing through.
Every member of staff knows who you are and greets you with the same warmth.
Few little negatives, wrong type of room had been allocated, this was soon dealt with but we did feel a little uncomfortable as if we were trying to upgrade ourselves, which was not the case. 
There was no fruit in the room although this was advertised as being included, this was rectified later when we mentioned it. few other little niggles but not really want to focus on them as the whole experience was so beautiful and if anything is not right it is rectified and apologised for straight away.
A wonderful birthday cake was left in our room, such a lovely surprise, we were too full to eat so it was boxed carefully for our journey and put in a lovely hessian bag, wonderful touches like this make for a very special experience.
This is not the hotel for you if you like to remain anonymous as the level of interaction may be too much for you but if you love to be pampered and made to feel very special, stay at 41 we will be returning soon, spoilt for other hotels now as they may be lovely but where else would you get the service level!! Go on treat yourself without hesitation!!!",5,2007,10,01
137,Impeccable,"The 41 is impeccable. The moment you step in the door you feel as if you are entering a private residence. The excellent decor combines traditional elegance with a twist. Black and white dominates the bedrooms, and the lounge (think elegant private Library) with it's large conservatory style roof, repeats the theme adding in a discreet bit of animal print. The young polished international staff provides finely tuned personal service.
I don't want to emphasize the smallness of the room or property -it happens to be a huge part of the charm. Guest rooms provided everything imaginable and then some. I spent about 20 minutes aquainting myself with the immense list of turn down ""gifts"" special bath elixirs, relaxing pillow spray, lengthly pillow menu (this list goes on) and if your cherished pet is fortunate enough to be traveling along, 41 has special meals, signature bedding, welcome baskets, and numerous treats for your companion. NO request is too large as evidenced by the self explanatory ""Whatever/Whenever"" button on the phone.
Back to the room, heavenly bedding (and bed), fireplace, small writing desk, two chairs and cocktail table, a hefty stack of great magazines, simply the best map and listing of local attractions I've seen, small ice bucket and slices of fresh lime and lemon alongside a bamboo skewer (great touch). A place for my iPod Yay! Speakers tucked in all the corners! The bathroom was well stocked too with lovely smelling Blenheim bath bubbles and soap, nice big soaking tub with rain showers in tub and separate shower, heated towel bar with loads of fluffy towels everywhere (amazing how so many hotels miss this item and only give you 2 large bath towels and pairs of hand and wash cloths). The lovely ebony wood fitted closet also provided for every need, desire, and luxury. 
On arrival the young lady checking us in provided us with a pre-dinner welcome cocktail and small nibbles in the room while we unpacked our things. When returning to the hotel after dinner we were greeted by scented lit candles, fluffy robes, and faux fur bed throw-can you spoil us more?  Ironically on check-in we were asked if we were celebrating any special occasion during our stay and we said ""no""-I can't wait to return for a special day just to see what 41 has in mind for those ""special"" occasions!
Breakfast is served in the Lounge (or your guest room) and the attention to detail continues.  A.M. food choices such as fresh fruits, berry compote, gorgeous baked goods, juices, numerous cereals (organic too), cooked english breakfast, and a la carte menu.
Phew! Now I know what life is like across the street at the castle.",5,2007,10,01
137,Worth Every Cent,"Hotel 41 is an expensive hotel but our 4 night stay was beyond our expectations. The rooms were excellent/fantastic, everything that was required to make a stay enjoyable was included. Attention to detail in all things and a level of service which was both practical and yet not suffocating.
The lounge was a fantastic place to escape and relax.
The location was perfect.
You do spend alot of money but hey! Its one of those rare times when the final product far exceeds the expense paid.
Well done!!
The hotel photos represent what you actually get.",5,2007,09,30
137,Great hotel,"Fantastic hotel - shame we only had one night here.  The staff were friendly and efficient and we felt completely relaxed and pampered.  We had a pot of tea brought ot our room when we arrived and it came with lovely pastries ( a welcome surprise).
The concierge even managed to get us top tickets to a top show which has a 2 -3 month waiting list.
The location is great.  Would definitely reccommend it.",5,2007,09,28
137,Our wonderful home away from home,"We spent 7 wonderful nights at the Hotel 41 the first week in September celebrating our 41st anniversary. The hotel and the staff made our stay better than we could have ever hoped for. Chantal and her staff made for a fun, relaxing stay. After long days of seeing the sights of London it was always a real treat to return the 41. The moment we walked through the private entrance we felt like we returned home, safe and secure. 
Our room was luxurious comfort with a wonderful bed. The free wireless internet was fast and the flat panel TV was a pleasure to watch. Any request we made were taken care of quickly and always with smiles. The morning breakfasts were a great relaxing way to start each day. Wonderful food and conversations with the staff about what we had planned for the day.
We found the location ideal. Close to Victoria Station for the Tube and a block from Buckingham Palace and St. James Park for a walk. We saw Wicked while we were there and the theater was a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Lots of shopping and dinning options close to the hotel.
It was by far the best hotel stay we have ever experienced anywhere. We really look forward to our next trip to London so we can stay at the 41 again.",5,2007,09,27
137,None can compare,"We just returned from a month-long trip and bookended our travels with 2 stays at the 41. What a great ecperience this was. Firstly, the staff are exceptional. Friendly, attentive and loads of fun. From the sassy Chantal to the lovely Daphne and Antoinette, we were well cared for and coddled. The accomodations are well appointed and luxurious. The beds are a dangerous enterprise as they are so comfortable they could hold you hostage. Superb ammenities and wonderful touches such as fresh ice and lemon every evening along with the well stocked and always open pantry to plunder. Meals were superb and again, the staff could not be more efficient or lovely. We now have a new home in London. Thanks again for everything.
",5,2007,09,13
137,It's the people who make this hotel so wonderful!,"We are leaving Hotel 41 today.  Our stay here has been perfect.  The staff""s energy and eagerness to please and help have been beyond our expectations.  The rooms are typicaly European in size but lovely appointed.  The fluffiest towels ever!  Enjoy this gem.  We would definitely stay here or at any Red Carnation Hotel again.
",5,2007,09,11
137,Wow!,"We love to spend a few days in London  and have stayed at many hotels, non however surpassing the wonderful experience of 41.
Chantal and all of her staff were attentive in every detail.The room we had was great, and although everything was very luxurious we were made to feel relaxed and at home.
We are so pleased to have found 41, we now don't need to look anywhere else,I can't wait until the next time!
",5,2007,09,04
137,"Fab, Fab, Fab!!!","Wow - what an amazing find this hotel turned out to be!  Discreetly located next door to its bigger sister the Rubens, this hotel offers attentive, yet unobtrusive levels of service seldom found. All areas are tastefully furnished and it really does feel like a home from home.  We found all the staff without exception to be extremely welcoming, friendly yet utterly proffesional - nothing is too much trouble.  Masses of fluffy white towels in the lovely rooms, gallons of hot water, and the breakfasts......ooooh the breakfasts are amazing.   A small but perfectly designed hotel where attention to the tiniest detail  make this a great place to stay.  Can't wait to go back.
",5,2007,08,28
137,Hotel 41 is GREAT!,"Staying at Hotel 41 while we were in London was the best decision we ever made.  From the moment we stepped onto the property, we were made to feel as if we were the most important people in the world.  The entire staff pampered us.  They granted our every wish.  The best part was being able to completely relax and let someone else tend to our needs...from making us afternoon tea to arranging tickets to the London Eye.  Bottom line, if you want true personalized attention, Hotel 41 is the place to stay.  Keep in mind, though, it is very expensive.
",5,2007,08,23
137,Gorgeous Hotel!,"This was without doubt the best hotel we have ever stayed in. Not only is it beautifully clean and well looked after, the room was gorgeous and very stylish and the staff are so polite, interested and very keen to be of service. The attention to detail is fantastic and the food is delicious! 

We stayed there on our wedding night and the following night before flying off on our honeymoon. When we arrived in our room at 1am. The lights were dimmed and lighted candles in lovely red glasses had been placed throughout the room. Petals scattered everywhere, including a heart shape of petals on the bed! Classical music was playing and there was a bottle of veuve clicquot on ice (we booked a sparkle weekend which included a bottle of champagne - I have never known a hotel to serve veuve clicquot as part of a booking deal - what class!). It was a perfect end to a perfect day. We had also booked breakfast as part of our booking deal which they happily served the next day in our room - again room service breakfast, in our experience, has always been extra but not in this case!

Even if it is not your wedding night the hotel is fantastic and we would, with out doubt, highly recommend it!
",5,2007,08,20
137,What more can I say?,"There's nothing significant to add but I just wanted to reiterate that yet another couple found this to be a truly nice hotel.  It is polished to a lovely glow, both the furnishings and the staff.  The people who work in this hotel are the nicest and most helpful I have encountered.  Hopefully, Hotel 41 will continue to epitomize London style and grace.
",5,2007,08,07
137,swish,"My wife and I have been using Trip Advisor for the last 2 years, but we have only just 'joined up' and decided to post some reviews from our 'relatively' recent travels.

We stayed at Hotel 41 in early April of 2006. We actually overnighted there on the way to Paris and then spent five nights on our return to London.

The Hotel and its staff is simply lovely. We had just spent a wonderful couple of nights in Windermere in the Lake District, and thought it impossible to experience the kind of gentile, personalised luxury we encountered up north, but we were to be proved wrong.

The rooms, service, location etc, are all just like the positive reviews of this hotel indicate and NOTHING is too much trouble. The service truly is extraordinary.

For instance, having travelled to the UK for the better part of two weeks from our home in the Caribbean, we had quite a bit of luggage, and therefore enquired of the manager at 41 if it would be alright for them to keep the majority of our luggage while we went on our weekend jaunt to Paris, knowing that we would return to spend the rest of our vacation with them. It was simply not a problem, and it enabled us to travel relatively light (as light as my wife will travel!) for the weekend.

We had one issue when I returned back home with an existing/extra charge on our credit card - which was in fact the reservation/security deposit - which they had forgot to remove, but they sorted it out and promised that if we came back they would upgrade us for the inconvenience. 

Upgrade offer or not, I will find it hard to put another hotel ahead of 41 in our choice of accommodation in London.
",5,2007,08,06
137,home away from home,"I took my daughter fro her 10th birthday to Europe for the first time. Thank you to all the friendly staff at this hotel. I will come back anytime to visit.  Thanks for the apples every day. And thanks for taking good care of us. The last day we saw the carriages of the queens  across street. How thrilling to get a glance right from your hotel. Very homey and personal. The bar and piano is great each night
to end your evening.
",5,2007,07,29
137,The Best Hotel in London,"There is a reason why this hotel was voted so high up on the 100 Greatest Hotels in the world. I cant say enough good things about this hotel. My wife and I stayed here for our wedding anniversary and it was a great experience.The best feature of the hotel is the staff. EVERYONE went out of their way to make you feel welcomed. Chantal and Antoinette were exceptional, friendly and responsive to all our needs. The morning breakfast really was great with many things to choose from. The Library is a nice quiet area to relax. Free high speed internet is located in each room and the rooms arer nicely decorated. The room was a tad small but if that is the worst I can say then that is saying something. The hotel restaurant in the connecting hotel the Rubens was a bit pricey so we traveled over to the connecting B Bar. The food and service in the B Bar was absolutely great. The hotel is located near Victoria Station so you can take the Gatwick Express and walk two blocks. The central area to all attractions is a big plus. Again I cant say enough about how truly amazing this hotel is. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for perfection!
",5,2007,07,27
137,Loved Hotel 41,"This was a fabulous hotel. The concierge was extremely helpful, and the library sitting room is a nice refuge. Rooms are very nice, and include a Bose speaker for your Ipod. The turndown service included soft slippers and robe, lavender pillow spray, chocolates, and a candle.  The location is great as well for the London tourist.  Highly recommend this hotel.  Maybe not for families, but definitely for couples, or families with older children.
",5,2007,07,11
137,A Wonderful Stay,"We were very impressed with this hotel. The staff were extremely helpful, polite and professional. We booked dinner in the Library Restaurant and staff and food were excellent. Rooms are extremely well equipped - everything from an umbrella to a stapler! The turndown service included soft slippers and robe, lavender pillow spray, chocolates, and a candle. We thoroughly enjoyed this whole experience and, despite the cost, will try to visit again.
",5,2007,06,27
137,The best.,"We booked this hotel at the last minute - and what a pleasant surprise.  It is more expenseive than we would usually pay - but it was worth every penny.  The staff were ever so helpful and the suite had everything you could think of.  The hotel is well located for business in the West End and for shopping - we  will be back.
",5,2007,06,17
137,Brilliant small hotel with the best service anywhere..,"My wife and I spent 5 days at 41 in May. We selected this hotel after extensive research and were not disappointed with what we found. We booked through the Unique Small Hotels website which worked fine.
The service here is simply outstanding. All the staff are excellent but the Resident Manager, Chantal is brilliant. Not only does she bring a breath of charming energy and efficiency to the place but simply works hard to make you feel really welcome - My wife's birthday occurred while we were there and we came back from dinner to find the room sprinkled with rose petals - a Chantal touch that will bring us back.
The hotel is small and clubby but seems to attract a cross section of  guests across the age groups - no old gentlemans club feel here - just a nice intimate atmosphere where you feel that you are known after only 1 or 2 days in the place
We had an Executive King room and yes - I agree with previous reviews that the room, whilst beautifully decorated and with a most comfortable bed (we had no issues with the black and white decor) is slightly on the small side, but the bathroom is great and the plumbing wonderfully effective for England.  The Executive Lounge is a great place to end the day after pounding around London and compensates largely for the slightly small room. Breakfast is great and included the room rate, a real benefit. 
Location is fine - 3 minutes walk from Buckingham Palace and  Victoria Station / underground and a beautiful 10-15 minute walk down Birdcage Walk to Westminster
No - it's not cheap (but where in London is) and it does lack an on site gym, but if you want to stay at a large 5 star monolith then that's where you should be - for us- we would rather be  at 41.
",5,2007,06,10
137,Location!,"One-night stay while returning from a tour of the UK, with my wife.  Due to some sort of problem with Expedia's reservation system (I think they oversold), we were upgraded to a junior suite.  Wow!  It was two stories (though 6'2"" ceilings on the top story), gas fireplace, sitting room, and a super bathroom with separate tub & shower.

This location is just a few blocks from Victoria Station in one direction, and Buckingham Palace in the other direction.  It's several stories up on a very busy street, so you can hear some street noises.

The hotel is very nicely decorated.  A feature is a sitting room, which doubles as the reception area and breakfast area.  Enjoyable and, again, nicely decorated.  It looks like the 15' ceilings allowed rooms to be split into two stories, as for our suite.

The street noises and relatively cramped feeling of the hotel (narrow hallways, short ceilings) were the only real drawbacks I noticed.  Overall, this is a top-quality hotel in a very desirable location.
",4,2007,06,02
137,Great Service but...,"Spent 5 nights at the Hotel 41 after lots of research (especially due to positive reviews on this site).  I won't rehash everything that's already been written but here are the pro's and cons:

Pros:
 - Service was EXCELLENT, I mean bend over backwards polite service for anything you could ask for.  I've stayed in many great 5 Star hotels (I'm writing this from a 5star in Madrid now) and the employees at Hotel 41 are the best I've encountered.  I can't say enough good things about the staff they work very hard to make their guests comfortable.  Requests were met almost instantly via the whatever/whenever button on the phone.  So fast it was almost freightening!   One employee, Chantel was particularly charming and enjoyable to meet.  
-  Food was also very good and breakfast in bed was well done every morning. (Included in rate).  Plunder the pantry was also a nice touch each night.  The BBar was excellent but for some reason is only open on weekdays.

Neutral:
- Location - right near Buckingham Palace  but not really in the middle of ""too"" much in London.  The neighborhood is basically residential once you walk a block or two.  If you are flying in from Gatwick, the hotel is in walking distance to the Gatwick Express Train that is a godsend going back and forth.  There is actually a show within easy walking distance to the hotel - Billy Elliott - which was wonderful.

- Size of hotel - it does feel like you are entering a private club however you miss out on big hotel features like a spa or gym (although they do have free gym passees to LA Fitness just down the street)

Cons:
- The rooms.  The room (executive King) nearly drove me crazy.  Upon entering the room for the first time my instant reaction was that I made a mistake in choosing this hotel (The level of service from the staff made me stay and I have to say I enjoyed my stay overall).  Maybe I needed a better room category or something but the photos posted online make the rooms look so much bigger and welcoming than they really are.  Although the rooms have everything you could ask for (including great water pressure and even an IPod player) there is so much crap and decor and extra furniture that you bump into something on any trip across the room.  I felt like I was in a rickety old cruise ship not in a 5-star hotel.   

Although everything was very very clean, to me, it just felt ""old"" and not charming.   

I hope someday they renovate with a slightly more modern and less cluttered decor.  The black and white seemed charming at first but after 5 nights I slowly started to lose my mind ....I don't think I'll ever get the vase of dried BLACK roses perched atop of the fireplace out of my mind!
",4,2007,06,02
137,Loved this small charming hotel,"I loved this hotel it was more then I expected.   The service was very personal and the staff did everything they could to help you with whatever you needed.  There were four of us so we had two rooms the room we had was lovely with a small fireplace and sitting area and a very nice bathroom with everything you could ask for.  Our sons room was a little bit smaller but just as nice.  Our room was 4101 and our sons was 4102.  The little things they did really made it lovely like lighting a floating candle in the bathroom at night  when they turned down your bed and speaking of the beds they were the best  we had on our 3 week trip from the two pillows each to the big fluffy duvet we slept so well.  We stayed for 4 nights - whenever we go back to London this will be our hotel of choice.  It is only 28 rooms if you want personal service  with alot of charm then this is the place for you.  We loved it -  you cann't go wrong if you choose this hotel.  I booked  it after reading the reviews - the people that gave it a bad rating must have stayed at a different hotel then we did.  I cann't say enough about this hotel it was excellent.
",5,2007,05,09
137,Returning Guest,"41 is still the hotel I was always hoping to find. My partner and I have just recently returned from our third stay at 41, encompassing nine brilliant and warm days in April, and what we found wonderful about 41 on previous visits is still wonderful, and that a few improvements have been made as well.

What is still wonderful is that after a day in London absorbing all the sights, sounds (and moisture) of a vibrant capital, the calm of 41’s Executive Lounge is where you can put your day into perspective. It really is a retreat in a busy world, and nowhere do I feel the need for a quiet spot than in London. As always, the staff has learned your name (which seems to happen always, whether you stay one night or several), the greeting is warm and the service impeccable. It is a wonderful place to quietly unwind at the end of the day.

New since my last visit, the English Breakfast is now included in the room rate and the “Plunder the Pantry” program in effect from 20:30 onwards now offers more variation in its salads and cold meats from night to night. One evening there was some beautiful parma ham, the next some very good pâté. Green salads alternated with a cucumber or beet salad, and fresh bread was always available. 

What brings me back to 41 is the feeling of genuine welcome I experience when I walk through the door, from the incomparable resident manager, Chantal, to the entire staff. It is rare to find true hospitality in the hospitality industry, but 41 has made it into a comfortable art.
",5,2007,05,01
137,If you want the experince of a private club in London this is it,"The 41 is an absolute gem,its cosy with very attentive genuinely friendly staff.

It feels as though you are in a private house with a gathering of old friends

The hotel rooms are small so if you like oceans of space this hotel is not for you but they have every possible personal desire in the room includng ipod speakers,personal robes-let your imagination roam!

Its perfectly siutated opposite Buckingham Palace and undoubtedely one of the best hotels in London.
",5,2007,04,29
137,One of the best,"My wife and I stayed for one night in March (Saturday) and had an excellent stay.  

First, let me put my star rating in context - it is not my interpretation of how many stars it should have above its door or in a guide book.  It is a rating relative to price and expectations.  We had high expectations of the hotel and if it had met those expectations, we would have given it 3 stars (i.e. neutral, as expected).  I only rate above 3 if the hotel exceeds expectations.  

The booking was simple and direct through the hotel website.  I paid £240 for an ""Exectuive King Room"".  My wife arrived before me as I was travelling back from a business trip and she was first given a tour or the hotel, some champagne, some fruit and shown to our room.  When I arrived I was offered the same experience, declined the tour but accepted the champagne!  

The room was very nice.  Not huge, but as described on the web-site.  What the web-site doesn't convey are the little touches that really impress.  The quality of the beds, furniture, audio/visual equipment was excellent.  Toiletries were also at the 'luxury' end.  Style was on the modern side.  

During our stay the hotel sorted out lunch, dinner and theatre arrangements with ease.  All the staff knew our names and room numbers even if we hadn't met that particular member of staff before.  All were very polite and helpful.

The location is quite good for tourists - very near the Palace, Parks and London Victoria Travel interchange.  

The only reason I can't give 5 stars is that, since I only stayed for 1 night and spent a lot of time around London, I didn't get to experience the whole of the hotel facilities.  On check-out we used the lounge (very nice), and the free internet and printer facilities to check in for our flights.  

I will definitely be back if I return to London.

137,Appalingly poor service and tiny rooms,"I haven't written a review for some time, but felt after what i had experienced i should put pen to paper. If you dont mind paying £250.00 for a room that is clean, pleasantly decorated and are not looking for anything else then this might be the hotel for you. However if you expect to be able to get out of either side of the bed
when the curtains are shut, require an edible breakfast and competent
staff, then you will be as bitterly disappointed with this hotel as i was. 

From the ridiculously laid out room, to no turn down service, to neither of the papers we had requested being delivered in the morning
even after complaining the list goes on and on. But the piece de resistance was being presented with a cold preformed, precooked rubber pancake for breakfast, which i promptly sent back to be returned hot, yet ended up waiting around an hour for a new one before giving up on breakfast entirely. No appology given by any member of staff, who seemed to busy chatting to each other than to their guests.

Would i return - not on your nelly!",1,2007,04,06
137,"A bit of style, not a lot of substance","This is a small boutique hotel with cozy, chic rooms that is ideal for a weekend visit to London. But if you are looking for a hotel that has all the usual mod cons this isn't it. Hotel 41 relies on the hotel next door (The Ruben) for a lot of its services which makes the hotel incredibly inefficient. Things you take for granted in other hotels are an absolute chore here (and the staff make it feel that way too). The porter has to run from the hotel next door to greet you if he's not too busy and food takes forever to arrive either to your room or in the club lounge. If you just need a nice looking room for a night  this fits the bill - otherwise look elsewhere - there are much better alternatives for the same price.

137,Great Place!,"We had a wonderful time at this hotel.  Great atmosphere & service.  The rooms are tastefuly decorated with 24 hour service.  My husband needed some assistance with the internet at 2 am, and they sent someone up immediately.   Room service took a while to come but other than that everything about this hotel is top notch.

",5,2007,04,02
137,Very good hotel,"Stayed here recently for one night, weekend break in London to see Billy Elliot - great location as the Victoria Palace theatre is practically next door.

The hotel has a very clubby atmosphere, all the staff were very polite and you really felt as though nothing was too much trouble (the room service button on the telephone in your room is called 'whatever, whenever').

Loved the special touches, like complimentary supper and a help-yourself-but-put-it-in-the-honesty-book, and the turn-down service was spectacular, as hotels go - candle lit in the bathroom, tv remote and tv guide open on correct night, slippers and robes laid out, soft music switch on.  Very nice indeed!

If I had to be picky, I could say that the rooms are a little small, and some of the room service items listed as available for 24 hours were not - but I am being picky, and didn't think to even mention it on checkout.

If you go for the pre-theatre dinner at the Old Masters restaurant (attached to the hotel) be aware that it's a carvery only affair, and we did feel a little over dressed. I'd have preferred a more intimate, restaurant meal, but in the end again I had no complaint - the roast rib of beef was superb!  

I would consider staying at this hotel again. It is a fraction out of the way, being up the wrong side of Buckingham Palace, which meant a few walks down the Mall to a more lively environment, but all in all it's a very good hotel, very smart.  Staff make you feel special, and not so expensive either. Recommended!",4,2007,04,01
137,Quintessentially English,"We stayed at this hotel for only one night, and it was definitely too short an experience! We would have asked to stay another night but unfortunately we had to leave that day.

The service and the smiles that you get with it are the characteristics that set this hotel apart. You get the feeling that the staff are really looking out for you, and genuinely want to to make your stay exceptional. There is no austerity nor pretentiousness about the place.

We stayed in an executive double, which was small but perfectly formed. The room reflected on the hotel as a whole: quintessentially english but with all modern conveniences and luxuries too. I particularly liked the fact that nothing was stingy - there were more than ample toiletries (Penhaligon's), complimentary snacks etc. We went out after a light tea and returned at midnight starving so plunder the pantry was fantastic for us; the breakfast was also delicious.

All in all, this hotel is onto a winner: 5 star facilities and service, in a great location, with a distinctly personal touch!

137,"Great staff, oasis of class and calm","We stayed for one night midweek. From our arrival to departure the staff were friendly, helpful and very polite. The rooms are excellent so is the breakfast in the execuitive lounge. It is so quiet you could imagine not being in central London.
",5,2007,03,20
137,Gorgeous Boutique Hotel,"I stayed in this hotel for one night in February with my boyfriend & thought it was gorgeous. Unfotunately we were only in London for one night,  I would definitely like to stay in this hotel for a longer period.
The staff were attentive & friendly & the room was beautiful, if slightly small. The location of the hotel is perfect for sight seeing in London - so close to Buckingham Palace you can see it.
I'd definitely recommend staying here for a treat.
",5,2007,03,09
137,Great experiance,"Great Hotel. We stayed here for 3 nights in a split level suite and it was a true pleasure. Staff was very attentive and room was outstanding. Breakfast was very good. Hotel sits adjacent to sister property Reubans, directly across from the Royal Mews @ Buckingham Palace. I would  stay here again and recommend to others. Bag of Nails Pub across the way is pretty good for quick bite and a pint.

137,A Jewel In The Crown,"What a lovely surprise in Victoria.  41 resembles an elegant private club with beautiful furnishings and outstanding service.  The rooms are elegant and very thoughtfully fitted.  Mine had a huge marble bath with separate shower and a working fireplace.  The bed is comfy and has down pillows and high quality linens.  Chantal and Andrew were terrific in making it an exceptional experience.  Although there's not much around in the area such as restaurants it is a hotel I would recommend to anyone.
",5,2007,02,26
137,If you want to splurge it's a nice place to stay,"We were looking for a hotel to stay at for two nights before our cruise in July.  We were going back and forth between paying for the 41 or staying at it's little brother Rubens at the Palace.  We decided to save the extra money and stay at the Rubens.

When we were checking in to the hotel, the desk agent mentioned that they had some rooms available at the 41 and would we want to upgrade?  Well, I'm a sucker and said yes.  It was not a mistake.

We were told to wait in the lobby while they send someone from the 41 (located a quick elevator ride updstairs) to come get us.  Everything else was handled from there.  We were always recognized and greeted by name.  Our room was lovely.  Small, but very well appointed and a VERY comfortable bed.  The bathroom was roomy and hot water abundant.

The common rooms were beautiful and for the two nights we were guests, we felt as if we were visiting some friends at their estate.  Great honor bar and wonderful snacks in the pantry.

The breakfast buffet was fabulous (yummy french yogurt) and one night we ordered dinner and it too was great...and not too pricey.

We would stay here again if we return...
",5,2007,01,14
137,ok,"I dunno, I stay at alot of fine places and decided to stay here on a whim. Normally, you would find me at the Lanesborough, Claridge's, 51 Buck Gate. 
We booked the conservatory suite for a short 2 night stay. Yeah, I found it relatively inexpensive for a London suite (about 1k a night), but it was cluttered and claustraphobic with only 1 window other than the glass roof.
Location is good, lounge is nice, the staff...way over the top. However, as good as they are, I don't think that they can make up what the hotel lacks.
",4,2006,12,14
137,Very nice hotel for a great price!,"Last September we visited London and stayed at Hotel 41, a very nice boutique hotel that was recommended by our friends. We looked on the internet for the best rate and found it on UniqueSmallHotels. This is a very exclusive hotel but it was still affordable thanks to this website.
Everything was nice about this hotel, excellent service, good breakfast and a very nice concierge who arranged theatertickets for us. The London underground is close by and so are all the nice shops. This is a hotel you definitely have to see!
",5,2006,12,13
137,"Great service, let down on the small things","Third time we've stayed here now. Great location, service is a good as you'd expect for this type of hotel - discrete, polite and prompt. Very clean and comfortable.

It gets 3 stars from me because it delivers what I expect from a world leading hotel.

But, I almost gave the hotel 2 stars because of some little things, for example :
Internet access is no longer free. This used to be complementary, but now they charge for it. Not big thing I know, but it was one of the USP's of this hotel
The fire in our room didn't work. House keeping were quick to come & fix it, but she couldn't get it to work. We never heard from anyone else again about it and as far as I know it still doesn't work.
You can listen to a wide variety of music through the TV from the hotel ""jukebox"", but for £2.99 per CD.

The hotel seems to be losing the little things which made it stand out from the competition and some of it feels like penny pinching. When staying in top class hotels ( £400+ per night ) I expect some of the services which the big chains charge for are included in the price.",3,2006,11,20
137,Very nice,"I stayed at the Hotel 41 for three nights and four days.  The hotel is small, but very, very nice.  My cab driver did have trouble finding it since he never heard of it.  The hotel is actually a higher end hotel on top of another affiliated hotel. You have to go through a maze of hallways and doors and elevators just to get to the fifth floor lobby.   My room had an extremely comfortable bed with a very nice down comforter.  The  bathroom was very clean and very nice.  The staff was great and the service was perfect.  The hotel is in a great location, with two nice bars/restaurants down stairs.  I would highly recomed this hotel to anyone going to London.
",4,2006,10,26
137,Loved this hotel!,"I hate london! but when you have this kind of place to stay - where you can hide in the bar where you could be anywhere in the world, then I don't mind going occasionally!

There's  an honesty bar - wow! and free food every night in plunder in the pantry. Calling direct can get you a great deal. Recommended if you travel alone or for a romantic weekend.

137,41 Wonderful Escape in Westminster,"September 15-18, 2006. Small group of 4 couples spent three nights at 41. My experience there was fantastic! All rooms are similar but different. Great linens, toiletries, wonderful atmosphere! It was so awesome to return to the hotel each day after touring busy London and feel that we'd entered a private home and were visiting friends for cocktails and catching up on the day's activities. The individual Butler Service was a special treat (my husband returned to the room after leaving to grab a soda and was followed by our Butler carrying a silver tray with two sodas and glasses with ice). I would reccommend 41 to anyone wanting a big city experience but needing down time to recover each day.  

The entrance to the Royal Mews (Buckingham Palace) is directly across the street. A short 2 city-block walk and you are at the front facade of the palace and are ready to see the Changing of the Guard. Victoria Station is 3 blocks away and makes it easy to access Gatwick Airport via the Gatwick Express or the rest of the city via the Tube.
",5,2006,09,27
137,Staff Unbelievable,"Stayed at this wonderful property 11 days in July.  The staff was the most courteous I have ever encountered.  Every day, morning, end of work day, and night, this exemplerary  staff met any and all of my needs.  They had my coffee waiting just the way I liked it, each day as I left in the morning, I only had to tell them once how I liked my coffee.  Every morning, it was ready for me.  Every night, I had a bucket of ice at 9pm, (I asked once) and never had to ask again.  The turn down service, and daily snacks were very nice touches.  The bathroom amenities Penhaligan's were exclusive.  The location is great.  Close to Victoria station, and the Palace.  Walked to different resturants each night.  Around the corner from Victoria Palace Theatre.  Excellent shopping nearby.  Chantal and her staff will take care of the smallest details to ensure that you have a pleasant stay.  I would definitely stay at this property again.
",5,2006,09,24
137,Fabulous Hotel,"We stayed at the 41 for the third time in May of 2006.  I cannot say enough good things about the hotel.  First and foremost, the personal service that you receive at the 41 is incredible.  The staff all remembered our names and were always willing to go that extra mile to help us during our stay.  From teaching me how to make a Pimm's cocktail to sprinkling rose petals in our room on our anniversary.  They also obtained excellent seats for two shows and made reservations for dinner as needed.

The hotel itself is beautiful.  More like staying at a private club than a hotel.  The lounge is a great place to relax after a busy day (or evening).   The rooms are beautiful with their black and white decor.

We will definitely be back.  As soon as we can.
",5,2006,07,03
137,Location and service great!,"We spent 3 nights at this hotel and loved it! Right across from the Royal Mews and a short walk to the underground at Victoria Station. Had a few blips getting our luggage delivered as the elevator was out of order, but Rubens elevator was available to us. No wi-fi, but there was a computer in the lounge to use. Loved the snacks and drink availablity especially after theatre. Would definitely stay there again.
",4,2006,07,01
137,Lack of attention to detail makes this hotel expensive for what you get,"My wife and I have just spent the weekend in this hotel and I am afraid that it did not impress us too much and I sincerely hope it is not the 5th best hotel in London, which is its rating on Tripadvisor at time of writing. 

Hotel 41 claims to offer a 'small hotel' service where everything is tip-top and well-run. This is not true:

The rooms are lovely - quite big and well appointed - but started to lose a bit of contemporary quality feel (and we have stayed in the VERY expensive master suite too so this is not a one-trip review). Some examples: old model TV's, the grout starting to lift from between the tiles, the electrical blinds not working. 

The service is always delivered with a smile but there is really no care behind the smile - we thought that as 41 is adjoined to the Reubens they must share staff etc. and therefore they have lost that small hotel feel, which we wanted.

The room service food is adequate. Nothing else to say on this.

The breakfast that is served in the library is no more than you would expect to get in any other 5 star hotel. In fact, you may even say it would be less.

Other small criticisms that are speicific to our stay:

We had an 8am alarm call on Sunday morning that we never asked for.

Our pass key expired after one day for no apparent reason

we did not recieve our newspaper on Sunday morning - not a crime but if you are asked if you want one, why not deliver it?

The electirc blinds in our room did not work. No great problem in itself but in the 'making the room dark' scheme of things, quite important. Reported the problem to an unconcerned reception and then have 3 different people fail to make them work whilst we are eating our adequate room service meal. Had to ask the 3rd person to leave as repeating the actions of previous 2 people was probably not going to make it work...

When I came to pay the bill, not only had they got it wrong but also I realised that the rate I had been quoted was exclusive of VAT - thank you for another £100 on the bill, which by this time was looking quite large in relation to what we had received. I would like to count myself as someone that would make the connection between 'exclusive of VAT' and another £50 per night and am 100% sure that it was not mentioned to me at time of booking.

Anyway, I think that my wife and I are pretty easy going people and I would not have bothered to write this review if it weren't for the fact that this hotel is so expensive and I would not want people to think that this is the best that London has to offer. I got the impression that the place was set-up for overseas visitors, especially Americans, to get some idea of a throwback to the empire and upper-class living. What I found was a place that is not representative of modern London and surely there are better ways to blow your money in London?

The long and short of it is that you will always have a pleasant stay here but I wonder if there are better places to go?
",3,2006,06,19
137,Superb hotel and suite,"41 is an excellent hotel, offering something different than the larger london hotels. The hotel is entirely set on the 5th Floor of 41 Buckingham Palace Road ( it used to be the grand ballroom for the Ruebens next door).

Everthing is based around the Excecutive Lounge which has the feeling of and Gentlemans Club. Breakfast is served, as well as evening drinks, and if you are feeling peckish at any time you can 'raid the pantry'.

We had a split level suite, which had a small seeting area downstairs with a desk, chairs and a flat screen TV. This area was overlooked by a small gallery which was the bedroom. The bed was hugely comfortable. There was another flat screen TV in the bedroom.

The bathroom was very large. A very good size walk in shower with very good pressure. The jacuzzi bath was wonderfull. Very long, wide, deep and another flat screen TV to watch while you soaked.

Staff are attentive, but not intrusive, making the effort to remember names. We had a 'Romantic' Turn Down Service which consisted of a heart made from rose petals on the bed, as well as two roses, bottled water and the next days weather forecast. Also canpes are offered in your room early evening which was a very nice touch.

The only fault we had was at breakfast. I had to ask for an English breakfast (rather than being asked for an order) and when it arrived it was pretty much stone cold. They staff were of course extremely apologetic and  immediately offered a fresh replacement.

Overall this is a superb choice if you want that personal touch, in intermit surroundings.

137,Fab hotel for my 50th,"I went to this hotel with 3 long time friends for my 50th birthday. We had a really fantastic time (and for the lady who questioned whether she could book twin beds, you can!) We especially loved the bathroom - lots of fluffy towels, 2 types of robes and Penghalion smellies. We enjoyed the lovely lounge area and the staff could not have been kinder. Would be a great hotel for a lady holidaying alone. My only negative comment is the buffet breakfast - never hot enough for me, and cooked to order would have made it perfect.
",5,2006,05,18
137,my home from home!,"I adore 41! 
I stay here on average twice a month for business and I even choose this hotel for weekend breaks in London too! It's a very rare thing to find somewhere that you can go back to time and again and never be disappointed.
Service is superb and you won't find a better, friendlier or more helpful team than Chantal and her staff. Nothing is too much trouble and the attitude is summed up by the button on the room phone which just says ""whatever, whenever""...
The rooms vary in size (I think I've tried them all now), but no matter which one you get, you will be delighted by the quality of the room and all the nice little touches. Smaller rooms can be quite compact, but the bed will still be large and comfortable and the rooms are so cleverly designed that even the smallest one lacks for nothing...
There is no formal restaurant (except next door at the Ruebens), but you can have anything from a snack to a full meal in the lovely lounge.
There is only 1 tiny thing that could be an issue which is that the nearest parking is a good 10 to 15 minute walk away at Victoria Coach Station. However, call the hotel and advise when you are arriving and they will happily valet park your car - problem solved!
41 is fantastic - stay here , you'll love it!

137,Superb place in London,"Excellent staff, rooms, and service. Pefect combination of service without snob. Rooms are wonderful with excellent beds and amenities. Staff are helpful and professional at all times. Any need is met with timely and high level service. Don't want to rave too much as would like to be able to get a room there in the future! Thanks to all the fantastic staff at the 41.
",5,2006,04,05
137,Delightful place,"If you are looking to stay in a palace of ornamental pomp and ceremony - this isn't your place. Instead, this hotel is calm, charming and deeply comfortable in every quarter. A distinctive black & white colour theme (tiles, carpets, drapes, etc), and walls decorated by limited edition Vanity Fair cartoons, all help create an air of elegance yet gentle playfulness. (One imagines staying in the home of a kindly and midly eccentric Victorian gentleman.) Consistently excellent, thoughtful yet friendly service is delivered in a way that left us feeling like the staff possessed a rare, genuine wish to make our visit a special one; echoed by a ""Whatever/Whenever"" room service button on the phone. Food is relatively simple but tasty fare and reasonably priced at about £12-£15 for a main course. Breakfasts are excellent. Those who appreciate a good cuppa will most certainly find it to their taste. Overall, this a special place which should be hugely enjoyed by those wanting to unwind in some style, but without the precious formalities of larger five-star hotels.

137,wow wow wow wow wow!!!!,"wow what a fabulous hotel!!
great location right by buckingham palace (its on buckingham palace road)
we stayed in the conservatory suite which was very stylish, comfortable, big, and full of amenities.  3 t.v.s including one one the small first floor of the suite by a quaint dining table.  the second in a sort of bureau that went up and down(flat screen lcd phillips tv w/ dvd player. and the third in the bathroom which was another large flat screen phillips.  the bathroom was huge with big jucussi bathtub + a handhelp shower, very comfortable and relaxing!!!! as well as a shower with a wonderful waterfall spray.  the bed was king-size, great bedding, and extremely cmfortable. and the best was that there was sliding plastic covers (similar to pool covers only white) taht revealed a beautiful atrium and so we could watch the sky all day (hence the conservatory suite)  the room service was incredible, beautifully served, and great food, very quick.  the people were always friendly.  the lounge was very useful and afternoon tea always came immediately and  was delicious even if we asked for it at 7:00 pm.we originally were at the rubens right next door and thought it was absolutely horrible so we went next door to 41 and it happened to be owned by the same company so our room was considered an upgrade. best hotel ever!!!!!!

137,Chantal and 41 are absolutely lovely!,"Having just returned yesterday from our stay at 41, I have to admit that I will never, ever, look for another place to stay while visiting London.  My partner and I went for my 30th birthday, had booked 3 days at 41 London, and 2 at a B&B called the Main House.  It suffices to say that we cancelled our reservation at the Main House and spent the entire trip with Chantal and the rest of the fabulous staff at 41 London.  

The rooms were perfectly appointed, spotlessly clean, with service that goes unrivaled.  The bathroom was stocked with Penhaligon's, and each nite, turn down service inlcuded a lovely carnation.  Adding to the hotel's ambience is the beautiful and charming Chantal.  It was funny to go back and read reviews today, I had no idea she was so popular, but it does not surprise me... stay at 41 and then tell me if you can possibly not fall in love with this young lady.  She makes staying at 41 worth every last cent, thank you Chantal and thank you 41 London for making my 30th birthday the best one yet.

137,Chantal made our stay!!,"We stayed for just one night at the hotel and wished we could have stayed longer. Chantal welcomed us on arrival and we were shown our rooms. From the outset we were given the impression that nothing was too much trouble. All the little extras were duly noticed. It's nice to stay at a hotel that isn't impersonal and I can't reccommend this highly enough. We never stay at a hotel twice as we are a bit picky and always find something to moan about, be it the mildew around the bath or the shards of glass left on bathroom floors. I can quite honestly say that I couldn't find anything to complain about. We really enjoyed our trip to London. (If you like peppermint tea try theirs!!) We seriously plundered the pantry on our return from seeing Cirque du Soleil at the Albert Hall, and it was a lovely end to the evening.

The Tower of London is well worth a visit and costs £14 for adults. Buckingham Palace is open from September and we will return to visit it.

Please note ladies that during sale season shops open at 11am!! and 12 noon on Sundays. (Not at 10 as I thought).

Chantal if you ever read this....you make the hotel what it is thank you for being so kind to us.

137,Wonderful Hotel,"Beautiful small hotel within five minutes walking distance of Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station. We picked this hotel because of the reviews I read on Trip Advisor and were not disappointed. The rooms were beautifully decorated and immaculately clean. There were delicious snacks always available at no extra charge in the library,as well as great tea, coffee, continental breakfast, and sandwich makings were availble after 8PM. Wines and other alcoholic beverages were of course, extra, but always available.

The staff was wonderful, very friendly and helpful. There was someone available 24/7 in the library to offer any assistance needed. There was always a fire in the fireplace and fresh flowers. The Assistant Manager, Lonneke Verhaegh was especially helpful and enjoyable.

We used the free internet connection in the library loft to access our email and surf the web daily, which was very convenient.

My only reservations in recommending this hotel is that it could be a for anyone who has difficulty with stairs. You have to go up about four steps to get to the elevator to take you into the hotel, which is located on the 5th floor of The Rubens Hotel. The computers are located in the loft which is up some stairs from the library. But the main reason I mention this is that the bathtubs are raised and require some care and agility to get in and out safely. However, there was a separate shower in our bathroom, and I think in all rooms. The bathrooms were exceptionally nice.

137,Loved the room but stay away from drinks or food in the lounge,"The room was one of the best I've stayed at in London, and for the price you can't beat it for a weekend getaway. The only downsides were that the kingsize bed was made of two singles put together in the frame which gave an uncomfortable seam down the centre, and the fireplace was not working and we did not feel like having anyone interupt us to try to fix it.

The rooms were top notch, and the service was just as good. the bathrooms have everything you could ever need and are kitted out with plush towels and robes as well as some of the best toiletries I have ever seen in a hotel.

137,Unbelievable london hotel,"We stayed here on our wedding night for two nights and had a fantastic experience that we will remember for the rest of our lives.

We arrived around 2am after our wedding reception had finished.  Upon arrival, we were greeted by the butler/receptionist who congratulated us and took us straight to our room.  The room had been decorated with rose petals on the bed and bunches of roses, floating candles everywhere! Very romantic and just what we needed to end a very exciting day.

We informed our butler that we were absolutley starving (having eaten very little at the reception) and she quickly put together a tray of goodies (cheese, toast, chocolates, yoghurts etc) and brought it to our room.

The bed was the most comfortable bed on the planet!  The bathroom equisite - two showers, heated towel rail, large sink, lots of lotions etc.

In the morning we were brought breakfast in bed, I was still sleeping, and didn't even notice the butler bringing in our breakfast and placing it on the bed in time for me to wake up.  The breakfast is huge and delicious.  I really didn't feel like I was in the middle of central london.

We would definately stay here again, just need another excuse given that we actually live in London.",5,2005,12,09
137,What a treat!,"We stayed one night here at the end of a month-long European tour.  Compared to the average hotels we had been staying in, this was heaven.

We were spoiled from the moment we pressed the buzzer.  There is a private entrance, which they buzz you into, then they come down the elevator to greet you and lead you up to your room.  

We were seated in our room in front of the fireplace, given our choice of complimentary glasses of wine, and given an orientation to the room.  

Then we were shown to the executive library and the butler’s pantry (stocked with goodies, and complimentary after 8:30 pm).  Oh yes, and we were shown the ‘anything, any time’ button on the phone, which would summon our personal butler.

The room was very nice, and the turn-down service was lovely.  They turned down the bed, of course, with chocolates on the pillows, and slippers placed beside the bed in such a way that when you get out of bed in the morning, your feet would slide right in.  They lit the candles in the bathroom, and turned on the towel warmer too!  Lovely.  The bed was the most amazing bed I’ve ever slept in and I found it very comfortable.

It was so convenient being able to walk to do siteseeing.  It was such a fantastic location.  I was a bit disappointed that I paid for a view of the Palace, and what you see is the far back end of the complex.  You don't have a view of the front, where you stand and see Buckingham Palace as a tourist.  That is really the only negative comment I have though.

The complimentary breafkast was delightful.  We ordered dinner into the room, and were surprised by how delicious it was, and the really good prices.  I was expecting higher food prices, given the type of hotel.  

We used the executive library to send a few emails, and enjoyed the peace and quiet there.  We didn't run into too many other guests.  It was very private and quiet.

We managed to get an excellent rate, so I feel that we definitely got more than we paid for.  I would definitely come back again.

137,Loved 41 & Chantal,"The hotel was in a great location.  We loved the small feel and attention to guests.  Chantal, the manager, was over the top.  She welcomed us and assisted with our every need.  She and her staff really do make you feel special.  The room was very spacious, clean, large, and comfortable. Will stay there again when in London.

137,Elegant and sedate...,"As we walked out of the hotel on the morning we were leaving the Queen drove by in one of the Royal car’s (a Bentley) – complete with Lady in Waiting in attendance - obviously on her way to an official engagement.

This should give some indication of how close to the Royal Mews/Buckingham Palace Hotel 41 is located. However, if you are hoping for sneak peak from your hotel window of the royal ‘goings-on’ you’ll be in for a disappointment, none of the 16 rooms has a view – certainly not towards the Royal Mews.  

Arriving at the hotel, the entrance is next door to the Reuben’s Hotel, we rang the intercom and a member of staff came down to meet us. Standing for several minutes in the wind and rain was less that wonderful, but maybe I missed the opportunity to actually gain entry to the foyer…or security ensures a member of staff actually lets you gain access to the building on the first occasion? Anyone concerned with safety should note this door is always locked and your room key swipe-card is needed to enter. The only way up to the hotel floor is via a lift. 

The entrance hall is a pre-curser to the style of the hotel with wood panelling, brass and marble fixtures and a couple of antique style, high back black leather chairs. The lift takes you up to the 5th floor (not small, not huge dependant on your luggage) and, as our room was ready, Hette escorted us straight to our Executive Room (number 4111).  I have to say it was a first to actually go through the check-in process sitting at the desk in our room. After she had shown us around the various features and their operation we were free to explore our surroundings for ourselves.

The black and white, animal print, dark wood furniture décor is very much the ambience of a gentleman’s club come colonial theme. Our room was a reasonable size with a small window looking out to the office block opposite and onto Bressenden Place. A voile curtain ensures daytime privacy and there’s both a roman blind and curtain (drapes) for the evening.

There was a large 6’ bed – one mattress not two together as another reviewer noted – with plenty of pillows, a black chenille throw and a selection of toning throw cushions. A little on the firm side but otherwise comfortable. The main room included a small round table and 2 chairs, large desk with a fax machine, internet connection, in the drawers a bijoux selection of little black leather boxes containing an eraser, paperclips, pencil sharpener (no pencil though!), post-it notes, scissors plus a stapler and hole-punch. The kettle, tea & coffee supplies are hidden in the cupboard and there is a large mirror on the desk - useful for anyone needing more of a dressing-table than a desk. 

The working gas fireplace is a nice touch although we didn’t need to use it. The air-conditioning seemed efficient for anyone staying at the hotel in the summer months.

A large corner cupboard contains the flat screen TV (no DVD but we didn’t request one) which also has an internet facility. There’s also an Honour Bar and, for once, a good selection of glasses (champagne, wine and tumblers).  Around 6pm the Butler arrived with an ice-bucket and ice plus lemon slices and a few canapés. No cork screw, only a bottle opener, but I’m sure the ‘Whatever, Whenever’ call button on the phone would see one arriving fairly quickly.

The wardrobe will be a squeeze for anyone travelling with more than a few items to hang up. This is largely due to the amount of items stored in the closet...a folding luggage rack, iron and ironing board, hairdryer, 2 umbrellas, shoe-horn and clothes brush and the safe plus bags for laundry, ironing and dry cleaning plus a few drawers. All very useful but the lack of storage (in this room at least) could be an issue for some. One ball-gown and you’re done for! There was a decorative chest in the room which would work as a place to leave a small suitcase.  

We had a complementary ‘mobile (cell) phone’ but this is for use within the hotel ie should you be expecting a call and think you may sitting in the Executive Lounge or The Reuben’s next door not for when out-and-about.

Again the bathroom was not huge but of a reasonable size, very bright and very clean and continued the black and white theme with monogrammed Hotel 41 linens. One bath tub with a huge shower rose plus a hand held shower attachment. The bath fills up very quickly, but for anyone with mobility issues it might be a struggle to get into, and out of, safely I fear. Rather high-sided, but at least long enough and deep enough to relax and follow the Jet Lag avoidance tips on the note on the bathroom shelf once you do manage to get in. There was a good-size walk-in shower (with the same shower rose plus hand held attachment combo) and both the bath and shower had full-size bars of Penhaligon’s soap as well as a plentiful selection of Penhaligon’s toiletries. Good supply of tissues (Kleenex) cotton wool and so on too. On our return that evening there was a bowl of water with a floating candle and soft lighting left on in the bathroom. The bathroom also contains the biggest and most efficient magnifying mirror I’ve come across in a while – a tad scary to see oneself in such close-up! 

There where numerous elegant and thoughtful touches during our stay. A selection of fresh fruit left in our room during the afternoon. The 6pm ice and canapés delivered to the room by the butler. On returning from our evening out, along with the bathroom candle mentioned above, the bed was turned back, the robes left lying on the bed with slippers on a linen mat on each side of the bed. The Room Service menu was left open at the cocktails page and the TV Guide on that night’s TV, bottled water and glasses on each bedside table along with the Room Service breakfast menu and the next day’s weather forecast and a little bag of marshmallows and the Evening Standard newspaper with classical music playing on the radio. 

There has been some confusion about the Plunder the Pantry facility in previous reviews of this hotel. It seems quite simple once you know, after 8.30pm anything you take food wise is free – drinks are always charged, whatever the time of day - and food and snacks at all other times, other than the included breakfast.

We did take advantage and plundered the pantry on our return that night. The offerings included breads, ham, chicken, salad, relishes, nuts and nibbles, fruits and yoghurt. A very nice young man, called Rollof, was on hand to offer assistance or make drinks or cocktails if required. 

Breakfast is taken in the Executive Lounge – I fully expected to find Aubrey Beardsley in one corner and Oscar Wilde in the other (actually that would be The Cadogan Hotel!) again with the gentleman’s club décor and feel. The included breakfast is tea, coffee, juices, toast, pastries, fruit, cereals, cheeses and hams. A cooked English breakfast is available for 15 pounds.  

Overall if you like a sedate and elegant atmosphere with attentive staff and good attention to detail this is the place for you - it does give the feel of staying at a private club.

If you want something a little more lively and hip - along with glorious views - maybe not.

137,Nice but Suite not worth the $$$,"My boyfriend and I just returned from a three night stay at Hotel 41. Overall the hotel was great but I would like to pass on a couple of tips.

We stayed in a suite for about $700 cdn/ night( 335 GBP). The room was nice but there was no view. We asked if we could change to a room that wasn’t looking at the roof but the manager told us there were no rooms in the hotel with a view. The suites are split level but the downstairs portion was just not functional. There was a TV, mini bar and a very small uncomfortable sofa downstairs but we spent all of our time upstairs because it we found downstairs very uninviting. Basically, I would recommend not getting a suite but just a normal room. My boyfriend spent a lot of time (while I was getting ready etc…) in the Executive Lounge, snacking, drinking etc. He preferred to go to the lounge than hang out downstairs in our suite.

Another problem we had was with the beds. They look big and great but were actually two beds pushed together. I have often seen this in European hotels but this bed was extremely uncomfortable. The mattresses were not level, creating about a ½ height difference in the middle of the bed. We had to sleep on opposite sides of the bed which kind of defeats the purpose of a romantic getaway. We did ask if there was a better bed but they said they would fix it. By the third night the gap/ height difference was so bad that I couldn’t wait to have a good night sleep in my own bed at home.

The staff was pretty great. Always eager to serve and please. The location was also great- across the street from the Royal Mews and a quick walk to Victoria Station. This hotel does have room for improvement though. I would suggest to the management to invest in larger and more comfortable sofas in the downstairs of the suites. Other wise, having the split level just becomes a nuisance of running up and down the stairs. The beds should also be made to be on the same level.

Anyway, overall, the hotel was good. My boyfriend and I travel a fair bit and like to stay in nice boutique hotels. This hotel did not rank amongst the top of our list but it was a sweet hotel with many unique features. Hopefully with some improvements, the hotel will progress in several areas including making the suites more functional. 

P.S- I did not want to write this review to be negative. However, I just wanted to pass on some tips. If you already have booked this hotel and are reading this review… don’t panic!... you’ll have a lovely time, it’s a great hotel in a fabulous city.

137,"Wonderful, cozy rooms at 41","We stayed at Hotel 41 in late September based on reviews from this site and were very pleased with our choice. 

After long days of touring London, it was such a treat to come ""home"" to our wonderful room. The bed, with its fluffy white duvet and pillows, was so comfortable and inviting. Every evening when we'd return to our room, the bed had been turned down, slippers and robes were laid out, and soft classical music was playing on the bedside radio. A floating candle was lit in the bathroom and a tray of canapes was left on the table. It was such a treat and so soothing!

The only thing that was possibly a negative for us was how quiet the whole place is. We rarely ran into other guests, even in the executive lounge. This could be a plus for some, but we prefer a little more lively atomosphere. But the rooms were so wonderful (staff great too) that we would stay there again.",5,2005,10,21
137,A minus,"The positives are that the staff is very helpful, and you can reach someone 24 hours a day with any questions you may have. Also, breakfast is included in the price of the room, and they will deliver it for no extra charge. The room we stayed in was beautifully decorated and had a great bathroom with a big tub and separate stall shower.  However, the TV was only average, and we did not have a DVD player (as it seemed we would from other reviews.)  In fact, when I called to request one, I was told it was already being used in another room.  There was internet access in the room, but for a fee.  (You could go into the lounge, though, and use it for free.)  In fact, the drinks and some of the food you get from the ""Plunder the Pantry"" program are charged to your room, not free--it's almost like a fancy honor bar.  The Executive lounge is nice (that's where the internet access, pantry, and helpful staff can be found), but it's kind of remote.  For example, when you walk into the hotel, you enter a tiny and isolated lobby--no people to be seen.  You then take an elevator to the 4th floor and have to walk down a corridor of rooms to enter the Executive lounge--so it's a feeling of being a roomer in a large private home, more than a hotel vibe where you might actually meet someone and have a conversation--it's very much a feeling of you being alone with the staff.  I'm glad I got the room with my miles and didn't have to pay for it--there was just a very unlively feel to the place.  On the other hand, they were great with directions, currency exchange, etc.  (I stayed at the Dorset Square and found the staff just as helpful for much less $$.  If I were PAYING my own money, I'd probably opt to go there over the 41.)  It was really nice, but I guess I'm just surprised that it's rated #4 right now on Tripadvisor.",4,2005,10,07
137,A Hotel to Remember,"Luxurious and lavish accommodations made our two night hotel stay a memorable one.  The welcoming hotel staff, awesome room amenities, and cozy bed helped make our visit to London enjoyable.  The extra touches including a complimentary bowl of fruit, bottled water placed at your nighstand in the evening during turndown, night light in bathroom and the ""whatever whenever"" button available for our every need contributed to making our stay from great to outstanding.  The comfortable and cozy bed provided one of our best night's sleep which was genuinely needed after two weeks in Europe.  The location was perfect as our first tour was right across the street at Buckingham Palace.  There were restaurants, shops and transportion close by including the tube and Victoria Station.  This hotel has made it to the top of our best hotels to stay at and we are looking forward to staying there on our next visit.  Although the price is overly expensive, we got our money's worth and will always remember our stay at the Hotel 41.

137,diamond in the rough,"What a wonderful little find this hotel is.  My husband and I stayed here both pre and post cruise when we took our cruise on the Queen Mary 2 this August.  From the second we arrived the service was  impeccable.  We were offered a cold drink, asked if we needed any dinner plans, and were given a hot towel.  It was more like a family member greeting us than hotel staff.  The room was a delight! (a little small like all european hotels) and one of the best equipped rooms I ever stayed in.  There was  everything from 2 different types of bath robes to even a pencil sharpener in the desk drawer.  The bed was comfortable with 350+ theard count sheets.  I can go on and on about the room.  Even at turn down, they left a lighted candle in the bathroom and glasses of fresh bottled water at the bed side.  If you are discerning clientele this hotel is for you!!
",5,2005,09,07
137,Service and room beyond compare,"My husband and I stayed here in January 2005 and it was the best hotel we have ever stayed in.  It was more expensive than what we typically look for, but every day we were there was better than the previous one.  Plus every hotel in London is expensive, so we resigned ourselves to the fact that we would be spending a lot of money.  

We walked with our luggage from Victoria Station which is very close by.  It was early on a Sunday morning since we had flown from the US, but we were given a temporary room to freshen up before we started our day on the town.  The temporary room was beautiful!  The manager discovered it was our first visit to London and suggested a doubledecker bus tour to acquaint ourselves with the city.  She arranged with the concierge to get the tickets and send us on our way.  By the time we returned to the hotel later that day our room was ready.  

All of the rooms are black and white.  We had a corner room with about a 15 foot ceiling and a fireplace. The bath had a tub/shower and separate shower.  The bed was sooo comfortable.  The first night I couldn't get the fireplace to work because the pilot light had gone out.  The manager herself came to the room with one of the butlers in tow.  She apologized for her appearance - she was in an evening gown and about to go to a party.  She swept down to the floor and got the fireplace lit for us.  We received this same level of service throughout our stay.  

The staff of butlers was wonderful and extremely helpful.  They man the library/lounge all day and attend to drink needs and anything else you want.  Every night when we returned to our room something was a little different.  One night there were floating candles lit in a crystal bowl in the bathroom.  Another night I had a white orchid by my bedside.  One evening a butler brought a selection of canapes to our room.  I mentioned that I liked a marmalade served at breakfast every morning and found a small cache of them wrapped up my room that night.  We felt priviliged to stay here.  The location was wonderful and the hotel is very cozy, but not in a creepy bed and breakfast way.  It was very quiet and peaceful (of course, it was January).  I would love to stay here again when I return to London.

137,wonderful,"We have just returned from a stay at no 41. 

From the moment we arrived we were treated as if we were special, the staff were fantastic, my special thanks to Chantel (the inhouse manager) who made our stay magical.

when we arrived we were asked why we were visiting london, I explained it was our anniversary, and we were treated to to Champayne and canape's.

There are only 18 rooms at no 41, we stayed in room 4111 which was fantastic. Decorated in a black and white theme with the most amazing, comfortable large king size bed, I counted 3 telephones and fax machine ect, plasma TV, DVD player and even a Marble working fireplace. and fresh orchids. The bathroom has no less than three showers, two in the large bath and a seperate shower cubicle,  luxury soaps and bubble bath, shampoo's ect are supplied as well as bathrobes and slippers. Tea and coffee making facilities as well as a full bar and 24 hr room service.

We booked seats at the theatre through the hotel, and when we got back in the evening, we helped ourselves to the (pantry) free of charge, this included fruit, breads, cheeses, and meats.  a perfect end to a perfect day.

When it was time to check out, Chantel, presented us with a card and lovely gift.

We have stayed in hotels all over the world, most rated in the top ten best.  However the service here was unrivaled, and the staff could not do enough to ensure we had a fantastic time. 

I did not want to leave, and will deffinately return.",5,2005,08,18
137,very boaring,"For how much money they charge the hotel is very boaring....The entrance looked like entering a old egyption tomb...all the staff were young and act like they ard doing a summer job.. the black and white theme didn't work for us at all...we had to find a diffrent hotel for the rest of our visit to london..
Now if you like to be very very very slow place, the hotel would be great for you...after all big disappointment",3,2005,08,18
137,Fabulous service and great location,"I stayed at Hotel 41 with my daughter and we were made to feel like a princess and a queen!  The room was charming and extremely well appointed with plasma TV, candlelit turndown and a butler to deliver whatever we wanted (and whenever). 

The executive lounge was lovely (but I was taken aback to be charged for a few things that I believed were complimentary).

Planning to return in November!

137,Absolutely Loved this Hotel!,"My wife and I stayed at 41 for our anniversary in July and absolutely loved it!  After much research on hotels in the city, I decided to take a chance based partly on the reviews from this site.  We were so pleased upon arrival!  The location was outstanding, room extremely comforable and cozy, staff so nice, and general feeling in the hotel very, very comfortable.  My only concern is the same as another reviewer on this site, and that is the time beverages and snacks actually cost something as opposed to being 'free'.  My wife and I were very confused as well, and the hotel should address this.  Otherwise, this was a perfect stay in a wonderful city!  I would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone!!
",5,2005,08,08
137,A suberb boutiuqe luxury hotel,"The 41 Hotel is a delightful and unique hotel experience.  Conveniently set across the street from the Buckingham Palace Mews, this is a small, boutique luxury hotel with an enthusiastic commitment to servicing, indeed pampering, its guests.  The elegant two-floor atrium lobby-dining room abounds with skylights, leather bindings, and padded chairs; there is a serene club-like atmosphere which permeates throughout.  The richly appointed rooms (typically on the European smaller side) have an innovative, contemporary flair which contrasts well with the building's older architechture. The rooms are extremely comfortable with many design features that impressed me.  Lighting, internet connectivity and in-room ""home theater"" are state of the art. The marble bathrooms are brillilantly designed and the shower must be one of the best I have ever had...anywhere!   In short, this was a very, very memorable hotel experience.  I came to London on this visit for two days for a very important business meeting.  The 41 provided a calm, relaxing and luxurious setting for which I was very grateful.  I can't imagine staying anywhere else on my next trip to London.
",5,2005,08,06
137,Best Ever,"My husband and I stayed at 41 for four nights in late July and found it to be everything the brochure said it was.  I believe the gentleman who said there was no food available during ""plunder the pantry"" hours just didn't look in the glass-fronted refrigerator below the counter--it was fully stocked with sliced meats, cheeses, yogurts, fruits, etc.  At breakfast there was a beautiful array of fruits, cheeses, yogurts, fresh European-style breads, pastries, meats, etc., plus coffee, tea, cappacinos, juices all served  by friendly polite staff.  In general, the staff was superb--we arrived mid-morning and as our room wasn't quite ready we sat down in the sky-lit lounge and enjoyed coffee and short bread.  As soon as our room was ready (well before the stated check-in time) we were asleep in the luxurious bed.  The room was rather small, but the bedding was very high quality and the bathroom well-appointed.  Each night, fresh bottled water and a sweet was delivered.  My only complaint was the lack of communication as to when you were being charged for food in the lounge.  Upon check-out there was 50 pounds of food charges from our afternoon teas and snacks.  So, I think that between the hours of 11am and 8pm you're charged, but not before or after.  In any event, I highly recommend this hotel if you want to feel special and pampered.  The staff took care of everything.  We stayed at The Milestone for three days after 41 and while it is a lovely hotel, it's not nearly as special as 41.
",5,2005,08,04
137,Nice but not at the price,"After staying at the Rubens hotel several times and hearing the buzz on 41 next door, I decided to try it this time out. Unfortunately, I did not feel it was worth the rate paid. The staff was courteous, but the room and amenities just seemed lacking. Our ""suite"" was split-level, but the lower level of the suite was tiny with a little loveseat across from the tv that was too small to comfortably sit back and relax for one person and certainly not big enough for two (and we are not large people.) So, consequently, we had no use for that part of the suite except to pass through it on our way in and out. The rest of the time in our room was spent upstairs, which was equally difficult to navigate as there is absolutely no room for baggage. A fold out baggage stand would have helped with one of our bags, but alas, we didn't even have that. So... our bags had to remain in the middle of the floor as there was no where else in the room to store them. We tried to hang as many of our clothes in the closet as we could so as to avoid even having to open our bags, but we couldn't take everything out and so had to have the bags literally stacked up taking up most of the floor space. The views from the windows in the room amounted to nothing. The other thing that bothered me were the little amenities that everyone, including our friends who have stayed at 41, seem to rave about but were lacking in our stay. The lit candle each night was received on our first night only and not again on any of the other four nights. The jelly beans, dvd, cd... all of those little extras... non-existant in our room.  The plunder the pantry in the lounge each evening was truly nothing more than a few bags of nibbles (some cheese crackers, crisps, and the same wrapped candies that they put on your pillow with turn-down each night.) Disappointing and not much to plunder at all. If you have a drink whilst in the lounge, it is charged to your room. The days of all-inclusive, as it was when our friends visited, are over. With that said, this just becomes a very nicely decorated but over-priced hotel with service/amenities you could get at a number of hotels throughout London for the same, or possibly less, in price. It makes me wonder if some of the glowing reviews posted on this site are legit. I would only recommend 41 if perhaps you can get a stellar deal via internet. Paying full price will only leave you feeling slighted. My favourites in London will continue to be the Rubens and the Draycott where at least if you pay for a suite, you truly get one.
",3,2005,07,10
137,Outstanding!,"The biggest jewel in London is not going to be found in the Tower of London but at 41 Buckingham Palace Road! This hotel will become for me, the benchmark upon which all future stays will be measured. I recently spent four days in London.  Each and every staff member went out of there way to help make our stay incredible. The room was immaculate, the housekeeping, top-notched.  

Recent stays at The Rancho Mirage, The Ritz in Phoenix, and the St. Francis in San Francisco cannot even reach the level of service I enjoyed here.  (I think the big names in the business need to send their managers here to see how a  hotel should be run.) 

The location is absolutely perfect, especially if you are coming in from Gatwick. This hotel is discreetly located next to the Ruben.  

The 30 minute walk the first time I arrived ended up being no more than 5 minutes once I mastered the route. The trick is to disembark from the Gatwick Express and walk straight out of the station. Once outside, make a left for a half a block to Buckingham Palace Road. (There is a black iron gate along this road which sets it apart form all the others.) Turn right and proceed for three short blocks. The last block has a passageway that goes under the road but just take the crosswalk that is a few yards down.)

If you are looking for something special, this is the place. It truly is. Thank you Chantel and all of the staff for being so kind and helpful.  We look forward to many happy returns on future trips to Europe. Enjoy!

137,"Amazing Personal service, amazing location, great rooms.","I travel 40-60 days per year. Always on a expense account. Always for buisness. I usually only stay at Westins if I can.

137,The best hotel I have stayed in!,"I stayed here with my boyfriend for his birthday. We stayed in an executive room which was perfect. The best part was the 'turn-down' which included leaving a candle lit in the bathroom, fruit, ice bucket, slice of lemon and lime for drinks and a newspaper on the table, robes and breakfast menu placed on the beds and slippers placed near the bed and the lights dimmed and curtains closed. They also open the tv guide on the correct page and put it on a bedside table. The show pillows had been taken off the bed also. This was brilliant to come back to after a long day around london. The hotel seems to think of everything they even have an unbrella in the wardrobe and lots of stationary in the desk. It is near victoria underground station which was useful, but it was very hard for us to find going on the directions we were given when we booked. I don't know any other hotel like this it was a good change from the ""classical English"" design that most london hotels have. The bathroom was also great. Our room was always restocked with anything that we had used. The service was also great. The staff were friendly and always smiled. The manager seemed to know all her guests names. Things like this would be impossible in a big hotel. However they didn't put fresh flowers in the room and there was not a dvd library or cd library in the room. I was not bothered about this I didn't go to London to watch dvds but they should provide what they say they will. Overall 41 seemed so personal compared to other hotels. I would stay here again without a doubt.
",5,2005,06,05
137,Perfection!!!,"Stayed at the Hotel 41 for the first 3 nights of our European honeymoon and found it to be the best hotel either of us have ever stayed in.  You feel as though you're staying at a private club and the service from all staff members was excellent.  The room was very nice and a very good size.  The bathroom contained both a tub and seperate shower with a huge powerful showerhead (high-end toiletries were also provided).  As it was our honeymoon, we were given a welcoming bottle of champagne (Veuve - not the cheap stuff I expected).  The hotel's location was very good - 3 minute walk to Victoria tube and the Palace.  The breakfast included was a very good continental (cereal, fruit, yogurt, pastires etc.).  You can order a full breakfast from the Rubens Hotel (sister hotel attached to 41) kitchen but you'll pay dearly - 15 pounds!  We had a dinner in the Library restaurant and high tea in the Lounge of Rubens - both were excellent.  We saw the Billy Elliot musical which is playing at a theatre 5 minutes from 41 - it was very good and highly recommended.  Elton John wrote the music and was sitting 5 rows behind us on the night we were there.  If you would like a small intimate hotel in a great location with great service stay at the 41!!!

137,Simply fabulous,"I'm in the midst of a two night stay at the 41.  I don't have much to add that hasn't already been said by other reviewers, but I wanted to throw a positive review out for the 41 as well.   The lounge area is incredible - not sure why more guests don't seem to take advantage of it.  Staying here is definitely like staying in a private club - it's been a relaxing wind-down to my European trip.  When I return to London, I will definitely return to the 41.

137,All the comforts you need,"Stayed at Hotel 41 end of March, beginning of April 2005.  Staff is incredibly helpful and accomodating.  Chantal, PJ, Tonya, and Pierre made our stay lovely.  Hotel 41 occupies one floor of the Reubens hotel.  It is very intimate, quiet and enjoyable.  Because this was off peak travel time, I was able to get a room for around $325 a night through Expedia.  Usually, the rooms start well over $400.  Rooms are elegant and the bathroom is very spacious by European standards.  The best part of all is the Executive Lounge.  Continental breakfast is included in nightly rate.  Later in the evening they also provide cheeses, fruit, ham, bread, nuts and chips.  Very easy to make yourself a sandwich if you don't feel like eating out.  Easy access to Victoria Underground station.  Walking distance to many theaters and attractions.  The executive lounge also has a computer station available, free of charge, with internet access.  It is rare to find so many extras included in such a distinctive, elegant hotel.

137,"Best hotel, ever!","This is the best hotel I've ever stayed in (and I've stayed in quite a few)! The room was beautifully decorated in black & white, with an amazing bathroom.  The staff were very friendly and attentive, they couldn't do enough for us (just try the 'Whatever Whenever' button on the phone). What really made the stay special was the attention to detail: fluffy bathrobes laid out on your bed, scented candles, staff addressing you by name etc. The location is also ideal for exploring the sights of London, right across the road from Buckingam Palace.",5,2005,03,23
137,True excellence!,"After much research, I decided to stay at Hotel 41 on my visit to London (March 13-17).  The location and wonderful accolades on this website were the deciding factors for me.  The location is incredibly convenient.  It is literally 2 blocks from Victoria Station so if you are arriving at Gatwick Airport you can take the Gatwick Express to Victoria Station and walk to the hotel.  More importantly, it is walking distance to a mother load of tourist attractions.  The most obvious is Buckingham Palace which is 2-3 blocks away.  The Mews and the Queen's Gallery are directly across the street from the hotel.  I walked down the Mall from Trafalgar Square on a lovely day and admired the beautiful St. James and Green Parks.  In addition, I walked to the War Rooms, Westminster Abbey, Parliament and the London Eye.  Those attractions are a bit farther but only took me about 20 minutes.  Now to the facilities and staff...As mentioned previously on this site, 41 is not very well known by cab drivers so always ask them to let you off at Rubens.  The entrance to 41 is simply a foyer and an elevator which you take to the 5th floor.  We arrived mid-morning and were greeted.  The manager, Chantal, offered us a larger room which was not available until later in the afternoon; however, she offered us the use of another room to freshen up and store our bags while we visited the Mews.  The first room was really on the small side so I am grateful for the offer.  The room that we actually stayed in was very nicely appointed.  The beds really are as comfortable as people claim and it was a nice effect to have a fireplace.  The hotel food is quite good and service very prompt.  The hotel uses the Rubens concierges who are quite helpful and knowledgable.  We were able to get very good seats to The Producers with a weeks notice.  It was an absolute pleasure to stay here.  I was especially grateful for the truly nice staff after dining at Claridge's and having to deal with a very snooty doorman who wouldn't even look you in the eye.  No question, you will be happy with the quiet and convenient location and very attentive service.",5,2005,03,22
137,Fantastic,"I travel frequently for business, and am always staying in hotels.  I can safely say that this hotel is the best I have ever stayed in. 

The service is very personalised, everyone knows your name, you are made to feel as if you are the most important guest they have ever had staying there.  The resident manager, Chantal, takes an interest in each guest, and takes time to chat with you.  

The rooms are really luxurious, each with its own computer.  Strikingly decorated in black and white, someone comes around each evening with an icebucket for any drinks you intend on mixing, as well as to turn down your bed, etc. 

There is a pantry, which is great for after you have been out or at a show, to come back at midnight and have all this really healthy food in a refrigerator in the lounge.  

The location is fantastic - directly opposite Buckingham Palace, no less on the boundary of exclusive Belgravia.  And the clincher - you will get more bang for your buck here than staying at the Dorchestor or Claridges.",5,2005,02,05
137,Wonderful new years,"Me and my girlfriend, both teenagers stayed at the 41 over new years. The hotel is extremely intimate and the room was quite small but very delicate with the black and white decor. The staff is very nice, serving our every need. We really were spoiled and will be back in the future.
",5,2005,01,03
137,want to feel like a princess?????,"The rooms are on the small size, ish!!!  but are intimate, big enough, with everything you could need. The staff are not only attentive but personal and friendly. The lounge is fantastic and as a birthday treat the choice was perfect. Couldn't recommend it ENOUGH. The self service bar, pantry, friendly staff, and fire in the room made a great trip  better. We both thoroughly recommend it.
",5,2004,12,22
137,Stay here and not anywhere else!,"Spent one night for my 40th birthday at the wonderful 41 in Victoria (Buckingham Palace Road).  Having only 18 rooms means that the service is personal at all times.  All staff know, and address you by, your name.  Constant supply of fresh towels.  A nice selection of fresh fruit in the room too.  The bathrooom was stunning with an amazing walk in shower plus full bath with yet another shower.  The bed - where do I start?  Huge, sumptuous, incredibly comfotable, lovely bed linen.  Lovely selection of freshly squeezed juices for breakfast, starbucks coffee, leaf tea and whatever combination of breakfast items you desire.  We checked out at 11am but they were happy to look after our bags until later in the day.  In fact we returned, exhausted having trawled round London at 6ish.  They insisted we sit down and chill out in the lounge for a while and brought us coffee and biscuits for no charge.  OK, yes it is expensive at £300 a night or thereabouts.  But plenty of London hotels charge that amount of money and do not give the kind of service or attention to detail that the 41 gives.  41 is a haven of tranquility just a stones throw from hustle and bustle of central London.

137,most awesome hotel on earth,"when you enter, you might feel you have gone to heaven! we were escorted to our room and welcomed by at least 5 of the staff who knew us by name! we were immediately brought a snack and drinks to our luxurious jr. suite. i have travelled all over the world and this is the most intimate hotel i have ever stayed in. it is the smallest  (only 18 rooms) 5 star hotel in london. everything was taken care of and all our needs were met before we knew we had them! i wanted a drink that they did not have the supplies to make and the staff went to the bar next door and brought me a drink from them. the next day, they had the supplies to make my drink. the beds are heavenly and the shower is incredible. can't say enough about this hotel--- if you have the chance, well worth every penny spent to stay at this hotel!!!!
",5,2004,10,21
137,A bit disappointed!,"I was quite disappointed with our stay at Hotel 41.  I think what caused this was that the website promises comfort after comfort.  Little things like jelly beans and coffee making facilities in the rooms which weren't there to bigger things like not bringing us our champagne that was part of our package or having a non-working fireplace led to an overall feeling of dissatisfaction.  

The website promises fresh flowers and a DVD player in every room, which we had neither.  There was no afternoon tea, which was specifially mentioned in our package.  The personal butler who is supposed to see to all your needs was a very nice young man, but obviously wasn't trained on mixing drinks.  No CD or DVD library, also high-lighted on the website.  The plunder the pantry consisted of some pretzel mix and a couple mini snickers bars set out on a glass plate.  Little disappointment after little disappointment led to our being two very unhappy guests.

The rooms were gorgeous, and the bathroom was luxurious, but we would never stay there again.  They promise a lot, but the only thing they can deliver is very nice rooms.",3,2004,10,19
137,Great Little Base - Has a Few Problems,"I really wanted to give the 41 Hotel a 5 star rating (after reading all of the previous reviews I couldn't wait to get there). While everything was extremely nice, there were some glitches with the hotel. 

1) Several service problems required more than one call (and more than one day) before anything was even done. Small example (there were others)- we paid for champagne to be in our room upon arrival = 3 days after we we were there (and after several requests), our champagne was brought to our room. This might be a small item to complain about, but if you're paying for that item shouldn't you get it when you're supposed to. You don't order a pizza thinking that maybe the person will bring it 3 days from now.

2) Contrary to everything that is written in their brochures etc., dvd players and cd players are not in every room. In fact, we requested both items several times for 2 different rooms - we were denied them every time (in both rooms) we requested them. I'm not trying to nitpick, but why advertise that you can utilize their extensive dvd/cd library to be used with your room's dvd/cd system if you're not going to be given a dvd/cd system. It's not that I want to spend my time in London in my hotel room, but it would have been nice (late at night or early in the morning) to have been able to utilize the system that they advertised in several of their publications.

3) The first room we were given was a king deluxe room w/fireplace. While the room was charming, there was absolutely no room to put luggage away. I'm not exaggerating here - there was none (we had to stack it up in front of the window).

4) The second room we were given, after the neighbors across the hall turned our section of the hotel into one big noisy party and we requested another room, had no fireplace (it did have a little room for some luggage), but the desk and chair were positioned so as to make getting to one side of the bed very difficult (especially in the middle of the night when you have to go to the bathroom). I stubbed my toe 3 times.

I'm not trying to say that we didn't have a good time at the 41 Hotel (it was our first visit to London and the whole trip, including the trip to Paris prior to our trip to London, was simply awesome). Chantal was extremely nice, the lounge was a nice place to sit and have a drink, everyone was  extremely friendly, the rooms were appointed very well - but the problems above shouldn't be happening if you're paying top dollar (at least if you want to get 5 stars from me). I want to like it a lot more (maybe you all received the type of room and the ameinities we thought we were going to receive and for some reason, even though we paid for a king deluxe room, we were given the so-so rooms with no added amenities). Whatever the case may be, it is a nice hotel, but it does have some kinks that need to be worked out.

137,perfect,"Mu husband and I were on a short layover in London and we stayed here for one night. We will be back!! Great location, it is only on one floor next to another hotel. Private, quiet, wonderful service and very spiffy decor! Look on the internet for good deals
",5,2004,10,07
137,Super clean and friendly,"Read the reviews on this site and couldn't agree more.  The only reason I gave it ""4"" instead of ""5"" is that the staff needs a geography lesson.  And, the staff needs immersion in the attractions of London, including restaurants.  Almost every time we asked for directions, they were wrong.  Also, all restaurant recommendations were TERRIBLE.  We loved ""BBar"" downstairs but, its closed on the weekend.  The breakfast was not good.  But, I, unlike most on this site, really don't expect a good breakfast at any hotel if it is included in the room rate.  Still, great decor, fresh and clean.
",4,2004,10,03
137,Reviews are Absolutely On Target,"Our 6 night stay at Hotel 41 in early August  was the key to a memorable London trip.  I was a first time Tripadvisor user and suspicious that the site had been ""Amazon'd"" with phony reviews.  Hotel 41 absolutely lives up to the raves. We slept extremely well due to wonderful beds and a quiet location (interior courtyard room for 4 nights and facing the Buckingham Palace Mews for 2)  My husband & I still long for the terrific bathrooms and ""deluge"" showers.  Our 8 year old son was made to feel at home by the caring staff (who  indulged him with fresh-made fruit smoothies and happily compared notes on favorite Gameboy games). The spacious common library was a welcome refuge for all of us throughout the day.   We found the location (5 minutes walk to Victoria tube) quite convenient.  There is no question that we will return again and again to Hotel 41.
",5,2004,08,27
137,It's All True!,"I can't say enough about the comforts offered at Hotel 41, both the outstanding physical comforts and the tender loving care provided by Chantal, Jacques, Martin, and Anna.   It is a lovely facility made even better by lovely staff.  It is quite convenient as well.  The bedding is of the highest quality, the decorating is most pleasing as well.  Truly, all the conveniences of home, but considerably posher.  I highly recommend this hotel to any and all, but most particularly to women travelling alone. On my second evening, I just could not adjust to the clock and went to the lounge where Jacques offered everything from tea to movies to help me get to sleep. Chantal greeted me at all times with a smile and warm words insuring that I was happy. Be sure and ask for them to prepare you a picnic in the park!  Can't wait for a reason to return.  It was all that was promised and more.

137,Superb: London's 41,"I want to sing the praises of 41, a wonderful small hotel overlooking the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace in London. Very luxurious with superb service. All the trappings of a private club. There is a discreet private entrance and no sign. A personal butler attends to your every need. Despite its classic charm, 41 has every modern 21st century technological feature. There are only 16 very stylishly decorated 16 rooms and four suites at 41. My favorite is the glass-ceilinged conservatory suite. The bathrooms are all marble, the mattresses all hand made and divine. Best of all is the mahogany-panelled Executive Lounge for round the clock dining. Check out www.-----------------------------

137,A Royal Treat,"41 is a darling boutique-style hotel situated above their sister hotel Rubens at the Palace.  41 is absolutely beautiful with classy black and white decor.  Our kingsize bed was so comfy we had no trouble falling asleep at night.  The lighting was state of the art which took a bit to figure out but once figured out it was lovely.  There was even a brass switch on the wall above the night table that when turned on lit a small light outside our room that stated we did not want to be disturbed.  There was also the traditional do not disturb sign (wooden)as well that you hung on the door.  The room was beautifully furnished and had a wardrobe with a programmable safe in it.  The air conditioning worked great as well.  The only thing I could say that I wasn't fond of the electronic system.  I am not an electronic buff and it took some figuring out to get TV, music, dvd player, computer, internet (wireless keyboard), etc to work. 

The bathroom was truly gorgeous and spotless.  We had a huge soaking tub with a shower, plus an additional shower with a huge showerhead, a large vanity and a towel warmer.  There was always plenty of hot water and an endless supply wonderful toiletries which the staff had meticulously placed on the shelf.  The linens were exceptional. Large thick white towels with a black 41 monogram on some of them.  Two kinds of bathrobes, terry and waffle.  

The staff were wonderful and very professional.  Chantal the Resident Manager is a perfectionist and this carries over to her staff.  The staff in the executive lounge where we had breakfast each morning were so meticulous (but very friendly) even your plates were placed so that the 41 logo was at the top.  Nothing dared to be out of place.  
The turn down service was a nice touch, with a candle being lit in the bathroom each night as well as slippers and robes being layed out for you. 

41 is located less than 2 blocks from 
Buckingham Palace, Victoria Rail and Tube Station, and across the road from the Royal Mews.  Yes the Queen is your neighbor! 

 I could go on and on about 41!!  41 has spoiled us for life!!

137,Utterly fantastic!,"     After several months of planning and research to find the perfect London hotel, 41 was what I hoped it would be and more.  This was a birthday trip to mother and sister and I wanted everything to be as perfect as possible.  Chantal, the resident manager, made it all happen with the most warm and personal touches, including balloons, champagne, a cake, and gifts waiting in our room upon our arrival.  Chantal and I had been emailing each other in the weeks preceeding the trip and I felt as if I knew her as a friend when we finally arrived.  
     This was by far the best hotel I have stayed at in London out of my previous 4 stays.  The hotel itself is quaint yet beautiful with a cozy, at-home feeling.  From the street, the entrance is quite inconspicuous and private which is very nice.  The overall style is what I would describe as contemporary old-world style meets traditional English.  The ""executive lounge"" is a large, gorgeous living room type of space with multiple seating areas that are also for the morning breakfast sittings.  In the evenings, a well stocked bar is set up for evening cocktails.  The very unconventional ""reception area"" is also here in this room as a mere executive desk with a flat screen computer monitor and two guest chairs.  There's also an open loft in this room with additional seating, desks, and computers for business use. 
     The bedrooms themselves are absolutely lovely, consistent with the look and feel of the rest of the hotel and very well equiped with everything you could possibly need.  A web-tv type of set-up with cordless keyboard makes e-mail and internet access so very convenient.  There is a fax machine, mini bar, cordless telephone to use anywhere in the hotel, spacious closets, and bathroom large enough to accomodate 3 of us ladies staying in the same room (now that is important!).  There was a separate shower and bathtub and a lot of counter space.  
    I could go on and on about this place.  Chantal and her staff could not be any more cordial and accomodating.  We had originally planned to stay 4 days and 4 nights but ended up staying and extra day since we were having so much fun.  Needless to say I would stay at the 41 again and again and highly recommend it!

137,Great but not perfect,"A fantastic hotel that would be perfect if not for housekeeping weaknesses.
From the moment I arrived I was made to feel welcome, it really does make a difference when the staff always refer to you by name.
When I wanted to surprise my fiancee on her birthday by upgrading to a suite, Chantel made it happen whilst we were out so that the first my partner knew about it was when we returned and I took her to a different room.
The housekeeping issues were not serious but just took a bit of the shine over what is a superb hotel.

137,The Royal family should stay here.,"My husband, myself and our 13 year-old daughter stayed here for 4 nights in May, 2004.  Our niece and her 13 year-old daughter joined us a day later. We did not arrive till midnight our 1st night, very tired and much needing a bed.  We were greeted very warmly and immediately checked into our room.  Our room was beautiful.  Small, but everything we could want was there.  The bathroom was just awesome.  The beds were the best we found during our 11 day stay in England.  Breakfast was the same everyday and limited, but we found items we liked.  The receptionist/concierge , Chantal, was very helpful and very friendly.  They say that location is everything, and we believe it.  We were a block from the tube station and a block from the palace.  We were able to take walks in the evening by the palace, thru the parks and out into the city very easily.  The only complaints were that the drink prices were a little high and a complaint from the 13 year-old's that there was no instant messenger service on the computer.
",5,2004,06,14
137,We loved every minute,"Before we even arrived at ""41"", I'd had numerous communications with Chantal, the resident manager.  Our emails had been so warm that I felt my 23 year old daughter and I were arriving in London to meet a friend.  We were not disappointed.  Chantal was wonderful (including being a surrogate doting mom to me when I arrived at the hotel suffering from food poisoning- she personally brought me chicken soup!)  I've never felt more at home in a hotel than at this one.  Our suite was perfect, from the heated towel rack and enormous tub in the bathroom, to the overall stunning decor.  The beds were comfy and cozy and the room had lots of high tech appointments (tons of light switches!).  Breakfasts were plentiful and good.  I'd recommend this hotel in a heartbeat. ",5,2004,06,14
137,Lovely Hotel - One of the best,"We stayed here with friends for a weekend in March and had a superb time. It started off well when the manager rang me shortly after I'd made my booking. Through no fault of mine, the accommodation I'd booked for my family wasn't possible. They went to such friendly lengths to reassure me and even gave me a second room free - it was beautifully done. That's real customer service. It's a little bit difficult to find your way in - there's a special door next to the Rubens and the reception is not well marked from the place on the 5th floor where you exit the lift, but these are minor quibbles. The rooms are excellent - absolutely luxurious in the true meaning of the word. They're not big, but they are superbly equipped. The television/video/internet access was wonderful and the girls loved it. The bathroom was gorgeous. The bed linen was the best I have ever encountered and I know my bed linen! 
Its the only place I know where they leave you both towelling and waffle bath robes - you can take your pick. A candle was lit for us in the bathroom every night, it was all great. We had breakfast in the Club Lounge every morning and it was excellent - the butlers offered us fresh fruit smoothies and they were delicious. Service from everyone was extremely friendly but absolutely first class. Not stuffy though. 
You felt very relaxed - as though it was a private club that you were an established member of. There were also board games, books, dvds and videos which you could use. The Plunder the Pantry feature was ok but nothing special - bit disappointing really. I couldn't really find anything I wanted to plunder! Would love to stay here again and have no hesitation in recommending it highly. I personally prefer the Draycott Hotel, I think, but it is a very tight balance.",5,2004,04,21
137,Absolutely Fantastic!,"Aug/Sept 2003- My husband and I wanted to splurge a little as we had celebrated our 25th anniversary while getting our 2 kids settled at their respective colleges. We decided on a trip to London. I did a little surfing on the internet and kept pulling up ""41"" with key words such as ""romantic, location, service, etc."" I have stayed at many Ritz Carlton and Four Season Hotels and I must say, ""41"" was exceptional! We arrived at 7:30 am, were met at the enterance by a wonderful gentleman who relieved us of our luggage and led us to a warm and comfortable sitting area. We were offered breakfast immediately while they checked us in. We were in our room within a 1/2 an hour. The staff was exceptional, room and bed were wonderful, location wonderful. The staff all addressed us by name, asked how our day had been and enquired about future plans and if they could help us plan. They offered suggestions for dining and other activities and made arrangements for us when we requested. ""41"" is within 2 blocks of Victoria Station, the Gateway to London! My husband was having difficulty with allergies, the staff was quite concerned even going as far as having their trademark (beautiful) orchids removed from our room in case they were the culprit. We had internet access in our room, which was wonderful, as we could check in with our kids and other family members without incurring long distance charges. When I travel in the future, I hope I am fortunate enough to find a hotel as wonderful as ""41"".",5,2004,04,07
137,Quiet and Convenient,"Our five night stay was perfect. The staff at the 41 were exceptionally helpful and friendly from the moment we showed up -- 8:00 a.m. after an overnight flight from Detroit Metro to Heathrow -- insisting that we have breakfast and coffee and making sure we were quickly checked into our room for a shower and a nap. Our room was very quiet and the twice daily maid service w/evening turn down was a nice touch. The bed and bed linens and the bathroom all rate high marks -- VERY NICE indeed. 
Given the small size of the hotel, you will feel coddled, not crowed. 
The Rubens at the Palace is next door and its bar/restaurant provide good, reasonably priced options for a quick snack or meal, too. This hotel's location can't be beat -- 3 blocks from the Victoria tube station, 1-1/2 blocks from Buckingham Palace. If you're taking a cab in from the airport, tell the cabbie to go to the Rubens, as he/she may not know of the 41. The 41's entrance is about 10 feet from the Rubens' entrance.",5,2004,01,04
137,Across from Buckingham Palace and treated like Royalty,"I first made reservations at the Rubens because of this website, but wanted a bigger accommodation and was so charmed by my phone conversation with Chantal Morand, the Manager, that I changed my booking to the 41.

The hotel's door is adjacent to the Rubens and the Rubens' concierge takes care of you. You can walk from one hotel to the other with your key (inside). The 41 is like an exclusive concierge level of the Rubens. It is 3 long blocks from Victoria Station to the hotel and across the street from the back of the Palace.

Upon arrival, the Rubens' concierge, Dave, whisked away our baggage and checked a list and let us in to a lovely hallway, directed us to the elevator.We were met at the elevator and brought into a lovely wood paneled, glass ceilinged lounge (very large) and offered a cocktail of our choice..we were offered another and another as well as something to eat and finally we went to our room, a suite. The suite was 2 levels. 
There is a black and white marble foyer with a large walk in closet under the stairs and a living room about 12X8 with black and white capeting , a desk, 2 cahirs, a hassock, a table and a corner cupboard with a tv, dvd player and integrated computer. There was also a fireplace in the other corner. Sadly, it was not serviced and could not be used. There is a very large window in this room which had no view.

Upstairs, there is another desk, a built in closet, a king size bed and ample draweer space. Lighting is excellent. There is a full length mirror in the closet and a free standing mirror as well as a makeup mirror on the desk. There is a comfortable, black afghan on the bed. 
There was a sky light in this room and low ceilings (I don't think a very tall man (over 6'5"" would be comfortable). There is lovely and detailed crown molding and a large tv set with another internet connection. The bed was VERY comfortable and the heat/AC easy to control and efficient and accurate.

The bathroom was huge...replete with black and white marble. It contained a large shower a large jacuzzi (with a TV to watch at the end of the tub), a long vanity with one sink, a bidet and of course a toilet. There were plush towels and a large heated towel rack. There was also a skylight in this room. All skylight drapes are remote controlled.

Amenities included: 2 types of robes (one think terry and one waffle robe, very lovely slippers, Pehgaligon toiletries (both full size and mini size),bath loofas, swabs, cotton balls and make up remover pads.

Full breakfast was included and anything you could want was available left as well. After 8, they stock a refrigerator with yoguort, vegetables, fruit and cheese which you can ""plunder."" Beverages in the evening are extra. However, on XMAS day Chantal opened up champagne and treated everyone in the lounge to munchies and drinks. A full selection of DVDs are available as well as some board games and magazines.

The service was lovely and warm. The staff was terrific. We ate in the Ruben's restaurant for dinner on XMAS. The food was very good, but our waitress was very poor. We also ate at the sister hotel, the 5 star Milestone, and enjoyed a wonderful dinner there. Service and atmosphere were impeccable. We asked to see the rooms which were lovely as well.

The 41 has a classic but modern feel and is wonderfully located compared to the more country traditional feel of the Milestone. We look forward to our stay here again. We were made to feel both welcome and comfortable.",5,2003,12,28
137,"Traveling on business, stay at the 41","I traveling frequently to London on business and have stayed at many hotels, but I always go back to the 41 for several reasons. Small, luxurious, private hotel which feels like a private club. Responsive staff who go the extra mile to know you and your needs. Comfortable, well appointed rooms with in-room computer system. No need to bring your laptop. I can check my e-mail, surf the internet, work on documents, print or fax them--all from my bed. THe lounge is inviting and well stocked with drinks, snacks, sandwiches, fruits etc. Before going to my room at the end of the day, I always stop in the lounge for a drink. The one minor drawback is the 41 is not conducive for meetings. They do have a state-of-the-art meeting room for guests to use, but there really isn't come meet me at my hotel kind of place. 
Access to fitness club is right around corner and complimentary. I know this hotel well and think about staying at other hotels for variety, but why when the staff knows me and I always have an excellent stay.",5,2003,09,17
137,Good but not perfect,"I have just stayed at No 41. The staff are excellent, the rooms classy, the beds wonderful and the food good. I would have given it five stars except for a few little niggles which shouldn't happen in such an up-market hotel. In my room (08, rather small for a double) only one of the four speakers for the television seemed to work, the mouse for the internet wouldn't move properly and the air conditioning was extraordinarily noisy. Relatives who stayed in another room couldn't sleep because of constant noise from rooms above.

Overall a very good hotel which I would stay at again but they do need to watch out for some of the little things.",4,2003,09,13

Never in my life have I so thoroughly enjoyed a hotel stay.Somehow, they do everything right. It is luxurious and extremely comfortable, yet not at all intimidating. The staff are unobtrusive and professional as can be with zero attitude. Rooms are amazingly clean, beautiful, and chock full of amenities. And the BEDS! Oh my goodness. A hotel review I read before our trip stated that the beds were handmade at a cost of $4000 apiece, and after sleeping on one I believe it. Heavenly! We stayed there for several nights and never once saw or heard another guest. It was just like living in our own little flat in the heart of the city, but with the added bonus of great room service.And in case you should ever want to leave your comfy, relaxing hotel room to explore London, the location is great to boot. Victoria tube station is a couple of minutes in one direction - walk the other direction for a couple of minutes and you'll be standing right in front of Buckingham Palace and Hyde Park.I would move in there if they'd let me. It was fabulous; I cannot recommend the 41 more highly.",5,2003,06,06
137,Fabulous hotel,"One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at -- the staff was very friendly & the rooms are amazing.  We were travelling with our 14 month old son, and were afraid we'd be turned off by a snobby atmosphere.  Just the opposite!  They were very kind & went out of their way to make us feel at home.  I'd go back in a second.",5,2003,02,25
137,Hotel 41 means you feel completely at home‼️,"The hospitality in the very personally run Hotel 41 is unique - the staff is very warm and helpful.

At Hotel 41, no guest's wish is left unfulfilled. The entire staff literally reads the guest's every wish from their eyes.

The rooms are very well maintained and well equipped!

The à la carte breakfast is excellent and prepared with a lot of love!",5,2024,05,12
137,A jewel - hotel like in a fairy tale,"As soon as you enter the entrance lobby with its black and white marble floor and wood-paneled walls, guests are transported to another world. London's big city hustle and bustle is forgotten. An elevator takes you from the hallway on the ground floor to the 5th floor. It is more of a large private salon for the guests of the 41 than a hotel, as it is more like a kind of membership executive lounge - you have to know that. After all, the big famous sister, the Hotel Rubens At The Palace, is directly below - and can be reached by guests of the 41 via a (secret) side door. You feel like you are in a small palazzo when you enter the executive lounge, which also serves as reception. A fireplace, candlelight in the evening from the countless (real!) candles, the glass roof dome, the oversized elegant globes - the ambience - it seems like a fairy tale! From the afternoon until 1 a.m. there are free meals at regular intervals, and from 10 a.m. there is also a small warm buffet... it is all these little things, the incredibly friendly, hard-working staff, that have brought my husband and me to Hotel 41 for the second time. As we are fans of classy boutique hotels, Hotel 41 is just perfect for us. Especially after a long day of sightseeing, it is above all the central location of the hotel (400 meters from Buckingham Palace, 300 meters from Victoria Station) and the quiet of the lounge, which is only accessible to hotel guests, that we appreciate.",5,2024,05,08
137,Great house with style and everything. Very friendly staff.,"Extremely stylish and noble house. Skillfully and competently done. Countless little things that delight everyone. For example, a hot water bottle by your bed in the evening. The humming of the ventilation system is only slightly annoying and hardly spoils the overall impression. It remains at five stars",5,2024,03,21
137,Fantastic stay with impeccable service all round,Our stay at Hotel 41 was a wonderful experience: The rooms are elegant and beautifully decorated with an eye for detail. The friendliness and warmth of the staff is unrivalled. You are looked after and pampered from the very first moment. Your every wish is anticipated and everyone tries to make your stay special. The helpfulness and attention to individual care is fantastic. We left with a tear in our eye and will definitely come back.,5,2023,09,03
137,Königliches Ambiente nahe dem Buckingham Palast,"Das Hotel ist ein wahres Juwel, ein Service Wunder seines gleichen ! Hervorragende Lage , exquisiter Service und alles eingebettet in einem wunderbaren Ambiente ! Man vergisst dort ,dass man in einer der hektischen Großstädte zu Besuch ist - eine Wohltat nach einem anstrengenden Tag !
Selten das all diese positiven Attribute auf einem Ort zu finden sind !",5,2023,07,22
137,Eine Ruheoase im Trubel von London,"Das Hotel ist eine Wucht! Eingebettet in den Trubel des Buckingham Palace, thront es im 5. Stockwerk ruhig und gediegen und lädt zur Entspannung in der geschäftigen Stadt ein. Das Personal war überaus aufmerksam, freundlich und hilfsbereit. Die vielen Kleinigkeiten, wie ""Turn down service-Süssigkeiten"" zum Beispiel in Form von Flugzeugen zum Geburtstag des Königs, werteten unsern Aufenthalt perfekt auf. Die Speisen waren ausserordentlich lecker, das Frühstück sehr vielfältig, die Desserts zum sterben gut. Die Dachterrasse besticht zwar nicht mit Aussicht, jedoch ist sie ein wunderbares Plus bei diesem Aufenthalt.",5,2023,06,19
137,Eine Oase der Ruhe mit echtem 5 Sterne Service.,"Die besondere Konzeption des Hotels ist, dass es eine Etage im Rubies Hotel ist. Die Rezeption im EG ist klein, aber man wird immer sehr freundlich begrüßt und verabschiedet und die <Taxen werden sofort besorgt und natürlich hält der Doorman die Tür auf.
Der Raum, in dem sich außerhalb des Zimmer aufhält, ist typisch englisches Clubzimmer. Zunächst genießt man den Champagner und leckere Köstlichkeiten zur Begrüßung. Unsere Zimmer war sehr stylisch und von vernünftiger Größe. Unseres hatte auch eine schöne Aussicht, denn das Hotel liegt direkt gegenüber der königlichen Stallungen und der Buckingham Palace ist 2 Minuten zu Fuß.
Aus der extrem umfangreichen Frühstückskarte  sucht man sich das passende aus, dass dann nach wenigen Minuten komplett serviert wird. Eine der Mitarbeiterinnen war sehr schüchtern und schlecht zu verstehen, aber die andere war sehr herzlich und wir haben an den 3 Morgen uns sehr gut und intensiv austauschen können.
Insgesamt eine uneingeschränkte Empfehlung und angesichts einer sehr frühen Buchung auch „preiswert“, wenngleich 400-500 Pfund/Nacht im DZ nicht billig ist. Vergleichbare Luxushotels in London sind jedoch deutlich teurer.",5,2023,05,28
137,Übernachtet als Paar,"Wo soll ich anfangen, nachdem ich über einen Monat nach einem  hotel  im london gesucht habe und der Auswahl ist wirklich sehr gross bin ich auf hotel 41 gestoßen, und ich bin froh mich dafür entschieden zu haben. 41 hotel ist eine kleine Boutique hotel im bakingham Str. Der beste Platz im jeder hinsicht  die man sich vorstellen kann, nah an alles was seheneürdig im london ist, eine Oase 
der wohl tun mitten im london, Darf man aber mit Rubins hotel überhaupt nicht verwechselt das gehört zwar zu Hotel Rubins hat aber absolut nicht mit Rubins zutun... mir gefällt nämlich die style von Rubins  überhaupt nicht. Im Hotel 41 fühlt man sich wirklich wie im eine Gentleman club an, das ist wie im einer zeit reise. Es ist  sehr englisch elegant aber trotzdem auch modern mit ein Tuch afrikanische Akzent. Im dieses Hotel stimmt einfach alles: super freundliche Mitarbeiter, die dir alle Wünsche erfüllen, man wird mit champagner empfangen, es gibt eine 24 std snackbar mit alle art Getränke die man sich nehmen kann. Die Zimmern schauen toll aus wobei ich erwähnen muss dass das alle günstigste zimmer mit französischen doppelt bett und keine kingsize bett ziemlich sehr klein ist, man kann sich kaum bewegen für große menschen wird das eventuell nicht so ganz bequem da es sogar das bett viel zu schmal wäre für zwei Personen. Wir hatten tatsächlich das kleine Zimmer gehabt war auch ok da wir ja kaum zeit im zimmer verbringen hätten aber nicht destotrotz hatten wir das glück gehabt ein Upgrade zu bekommen da wir etwas reklamieren müssten. Die Mitarbeiter an die Rezeption haben ohne Diskussion und hin und her uns sofort eine Upgrade gegeben sogar die gesamte Umzug hatten sie übernommen das hat uns wirklich von Service absolut begeistert. Der zimmersevice war eine von der besten und perfektesten  die wir je im ein hotel hatten auch die turn - out Service am abend war super schön und englisch. Über das  Frühstück kann ich nicht sagen da uns das Frühstück ziemlich teuer vor kamm aber allgemein wollten wir uns auch nicht festlegen sondern der ziel war Abwechslung zu haben und auch andere Sachen ausprobieren. Wir können dieses tolles Hotel zu 100% empfehlen, ihr wird das nicht bereuen. ",5,2023,05,02
137,Dieses Hotel hat etwas magisches,"Von außen ist es eher unscheinbar, doch betritt man den Eingang ist man überwältigt, eine kleine luxuriöse Eingangshalle erwartet einen. Das Personal ist ausgesprochen zuvorkommend und freundlich. Besser habe ich den Service kaum erlebt. Die Lounge im 5. Stock ist überwältigend. Man erwartet einen so prächtigen Raum nicht am Ende des Ganges. Das Frühstück ist sehr, sehr gut und einfach gemütlich. Die Zimmer sind sauber und gemütlich und mit vielen tollen Extras präpariert. Wir waren über den Valentinstag dort und am Abend fanden wir Rosenblätter, Kerzen und einen herzlichen Spruch am Spiegel. Hier gibt sich wirklich jeder Mühe und natürlich ist auch die Lage das Hotels ausgezeichnet. 

Wir kommen definitiv wieder.",5,2023,02,18
137,Una vera coccola,"Mi sono sempre domandato il motivo delle recensioni entusiastiche di questo hotel e dopo avervi soggiornato tre notti ad inizio dicembre l’ho capito.
Lo staff è stato pieno di attenzioni durante tutta la nostra vacanza, accontentandoci in ogni richiesta senza battere ciglio.
Ad titolo di esempio, non c’è stato alcun problema nel modificare la data del nostro Afternoon tea per il quale ci siamo presentati nella executive lounge con un giorno di anticipo 
Fantastiche anche le attenzioni verso le mie figlie durante tutto il soggiorno e, in particolare, dopo aver assistito al musical di Frozen.
Le camere sono davvero accoglienti ed arredate con grande gusto, così come è fantastica la lounge, genuinamente British.
Talvolta il servizio è stato un pochino lento (ad esempio per un toast ordinato per mia figlia piccola), ma questo non ha in nessun modo inciso sulla gradevolezza del soggiorno.
Mi unisco, quindi, con convinzione alla schiera dei fan dell’hotel 41",5,2022,12,28

Las habitaciones y sala común por demás cómodas, la ubicación inmejorable, la comida deliciosa. Cada ser humano debería conocer este lugar. Les deseo profundamente que puedan pasar por aquí. Ni un segundo de duda! A propósito (soy argentina) los argentinos casi no lo conocen. Es hora!",5,2019,09,05
137,Einmalige Erfahrung,"Das Beste an diesem Hotel ist seine Kleinheit und das Personal. Nach einem anstrengenden Stadtbesuch war es die gemütliche Wohlfühloase, in der man seine Energie wieder auftanken konnte. Anders als in anderen Hotels war hier nicht nur das eigene Zimmer ein Ruhepol, sondern auch die fantastische Executive Lounge. Diese war wirklich wie ein Wohnzimmer, in dem man die kleinen Gratissnacks (Chips, Popcorn, Lindor, ab 14 Uhr Scones und ab 20.30 Uhr kalte und warme Kleinigkeiten) naschen oder was trinken konnte. Dabei wurde immer zuerst das Gratiswasser angeboten, nie hatte ich das Gefühl, man will uns die doch relativ teuren Getränke aufschwatzen (billigstes Bier: 10 Pfund). 

Beim Frühstück wurden wir immer nach unseren Plänen für den Tag gefragt und Stefan gab uns dann hilfreiche Tipps mit auf den Weg. Das Frühstück war übrigens ebenfalls fantastisch: es gab leckere warme Speisen (z. B. typisch englisches Frühstück, Pancakes, weichgekochte Eier mit dem speziellen Marmite auf Brotriemchen usw. - ich persönlich empfehle den Lachs auf Avocado mit Rührei) und ein Büffet mit tollem Müsli, Muffins und dem sonstigen typischen Angebot. Ich habe es an vier Morgen leider nicht geschafft, alles zu probieren!

Wie gesagt ist das Personal sehr aufmerksam und hilfsbereit, fragt immer wie es geht und ob man etwas benötigt. Man muss in diesem Hotel also ein bisschen kommunikativ sein. Wer nicht so gut Englisch spricht, ist da vielleicht etwas überfordert und wird vielleicht den Gang in die tolle Executive Lounge scheuen, weil dort überall Personal steht und man ganz sicher angesprochen wird. Dasselbe gilt beim Verlassen oder bei der Rückkehr ins Hotel, man wird immer gefragt wie der Tag war und wie es geht, und da muss man höflicherweise ein paar nette Worte antworten. Wir fühlten uns dadurch allerdings in keiner Weise bedrängt, sondern eher warmherzig willkommen geheißen. 

Manchmal standen mir aber ein bisschen zu viele Bedienstete direkt beim Gratisbuffet, an die man sich vorbeischieben musste, um ein paar Leckereien zu schnappen. Man machte zwar bereitwillig Platz, aber der ein oder andere Gast könnte dann vielleicht gehemmt sein, sich zu bedienen.

Alles in allem aber eine tolle Erfahrung, mit abendlichem Turndownservice, der Kerzen hinterlässt mit Rosenblättern oder kleine Snacks, Kissenparfum (!), es wurde sogar mein Ladekabel ordentlich aufgewickelt und ein Brillenputztuch unter mein Brillenetui gelegt!

Beim Einchecken war übrigens unser Zimmer noch nicht fertig (waren vor 12 angekommen). Daher wurde uns ein „Courtesy Room“ angeboten, in dem wir uns so lange ausruhen konnten wie wir wollten, wir durften sogar die Dusche benutzen! Habe ich so noch nie erlebt!",5,2019,05,30
137,Una experiencia única ,"Estuvimos una semana hospedados en éste legendario hotel ubicado frente al palacio de Buckingham.

No creo que sea una exageración decir que es uno de los mejores del mundo, el servicio y atención al detalle es difícil de superar.

El diseño de las habitaciones, elegante, moderno y acogedor.  El servicio del cuarto es obsesivo compulsivo con el orden y la limpieza. 

Sencillamente, no puedes encontrar defectos, todo es perfecto!

137,"too bad there is no 6 stars - schade, dass man hier nicht 6 Sterne geben kann","This way way the best hotel stay I had in the last years. No wish too big, everything perfect just into the smallest detail - I am definitely in love with this hotel and whenever I will be in London again, this is my first choice to stay. Not only the location is perfect (calm, close to the underground, neighbor to the Queen) but the hotel itself: the staff is extremely friendly and never intrusive at all. Top service in every detail includes even a candle in the bathroom at night, a hot water bottle in bed, welcome card and drink, all-day buffet, ....you name it, they have it!
Especially David was of great help as he knew all the answers to our questions, whatever they concerned - thank you!

The only tinydrop of bitterness is the fact, that sometimes the staff stands in groups of 4 to 5 people together so you nearly do not dare to disturb them. But commenting this is critics at highest level.

Definitiv das beste Hotel, das ich in den letzten Jahren hatte. Kein Wunsch war zu groß, alles einfach perfekt bis ins kleinste Detail - ich bin definitiv in dieses Hotel verliebt und wenn ich wieder in London bin, dann ist dies meine erste Wahl. Nicht nur die Lage ist perfekt (ruhig, nahe der U-Bahn, in Nachbarschaft zur Königin), sondern auch das Hotel selbst: Das Personal ist äußerst freundlich und niemals aufdringlich. Der top Service in jedem Detail beinhaltet sogar eine Kerze im Bad, eine Wärmflasche im Bett, eine Willkommenskarte und ein -Getränk, ein ganztägiges Buffet, ... Was auch immer man wünscht, es ist da!
Besonders David war sehr hilfreich, da er alle Antworten auf unsere Fragen wusste, was auch immer sie betrafen - danke!
Der einzige Wermutstropfen lag darin, dass das Personal manchmal in Gruppen zu 4-5 Personen beisammen stand und man sich kaum traute zu stören - aber das ist definitiv eine Kritik auf höchstem Niveau.",5,2019,03,16

que ocupa el mismo lugar solo que el ""41"" esta  en el 5to piso y se entiende hotel boutique o seria la zona VIP del rubens , es un laberinto de pasillos para llegar a tu habitacion no es un hotel nuevo y tiene el area de recepcion en el mismo espacio donde se desayuna o te tomas una copa , una nieve , esta area es bonita con una decoracion clasica estilo una bliblioteca , el personal es lo mas valioso de este hotel , estan siempre dispuestos a ayudar y lo hacen de extraordinaria manera , la habitacion que tuve es de una decoracion en base a a blanco y negro bien pero la alfombra estaba rota de tanto uso al salir del baño , las instalaciones electricas dejan mucho que desear  en especial los contactos y apagadores nada funcionales , el baño bien pero pequeño , no tiene resturant y el desayuno se queda corto para el precio de hospedarse aqui , es caro para lo que ofrece y la zona esta un poco fuera de lo mas importante de londres con excepcion de buckinham que esta a 2 cuadras , es un hotel para llegar a tu cuarto y ya , ir al area comun o lobby no es para nada espectacular . insisto el servicio y el personal es lo mejor del lugar",4,2018,12,04
137,Außergewöhnlich ,"Nach vielen Empfehlungen aus dem Bekanntenkreis, haben wir uns dieses Mal das Hotel 41 in London ausgesucht.

Die Lage des Hotels ist toll, direkt hinter dem Buckingham Palace, gegenüber der Royal Mews, sodass wir wieder viel zu Fuß unternehmen konnten.  
Das Boutique-Hotel ist nicht groß, aber die Zimmer sind wunderschön. Wir bekamen dazu noch ein Upgrade in eine wundervolle Suite mit Glasdach.

Alle Mitarbeiter waren entzückend, die im Bibliothek-Stil gehaltene Lounge ist einen Besuch zum Tee oder Aperitif wert und auch gleichzeitig der Frühstücksraum.

Wir kommen sehr gerne wieder und empfehlen diese Hotel-Perle uneingeschränkt weiter. ",5,2018,11,20
137,"Authentisch, Besonders, Herzlich!","Wir kamen über Tripadvisor auf das Hotel 41 weil wir nach vielen Jahren im selben Hotel nach einer neuen Erfahrung suchten. Wir legen wert auf Besonderes und Komfort, tollen Service und gute Lage und möchten dennoch nicht auf Herzlichkeit und Wohlfühlambiente verzichten. Nichts ist uns unsympatischer als in Jeans und T-Shirt naserümpfend betrachtet zu werden :-)
Das Hotel 41 war diesbezüglich eine wirklich außergewöhnliche Erfahrung! Schon ab der ersten Sekunde haben wir uns herzlich, professionell und außergewöhnlich umsorgt gefühlt. Das Ambiente ist ein richtigtes Erlebnis, luxuriös und dennoch urgemütlich. Die Zimmer sind grandios und individuell ausgestattet, es gibt alles was das Herz begehrt (Eiscreme, Snacks und Getränke durchgehend in der Lounge). Alle Mitarbeiter agieren höchst professionell jedoch ohne aufgesetzt zu wirken. Auch die Gästeschicht war gut durchmischt, von Jung bis Alt, keine Snobs. 
Die Lage ist unheimlich gut, man erreicht das Hotel schnell über die Viktoria Station (max 5 min Fußweg), ist auch direkt am Buckingham Palace und damit gleich an allen wichtigen Punken in der City, direkt nebenan ein modernes Viertel mit vielen Bars und Restaurants.
Wir haben definitiv wieder ein Hotel gefunden in das wir sicher zurückkehren werden!",5,2018,11,20

La cama es excepcional es un verdadero océano de comodidad.   Los baños muy amplios y cómodos.   El servicio fue excepcional!   Incluso tienen un buffet gratuito de fruta, queso, pan y platos calientes durante todo el día. Y helado gratis.   Esto último para algunos pide ser una tontería pero algunos otros tener helado gratis todo el día es un plus adicional muy importante.

La ubicación es excepcional en el corazón de londres y en definitiva el trato personalizado y la sensación de de Star mejor que en casa hacen de esta experiencia toda una maravilla.

137,struttura di livello,"la struttura fa parte dell hotel Rubens ( 4 stelle lusso) , ha un entrata a parte ed è ubicato al 5 piano questo è il 41 london hotel.

Tutto è arredato con stile , ma secondo me i mobili sono troppo grandi per gli spazi infatti non è difficile inciampare , ma questo chiaramente è il mio punto di vista, l impatto è bello . C'è tantissimo personale tutto gentilissimo ad eccezione di una ragazza dai capelli rossi salutava poco ed aveva un atteggiamento sempre supponente ma si sa la pecora nera c'è sempre . La mia esperienza è molto positiva unico neo , lo devo dire è stato quando abbiamo pagato il conto c'erano circa 100 sterline in più di costi che non avevamo autorizzato ma abbiamo pagato senza troppe storie.

Los cuartos son muy elegantes pero las camas son INCREÍBLES ya que las almohadas están hechas de un material que te va ha dejar descanzar deliciosos, en tu cuarto tienes cafetera lo cual te permite disfrutar la mañana para planear tu día ( el café es magnifico).  Todos los cuartos tienen wi -fi.

El hotel te trata como Rey y al llegar te sorprenden con una copa de  champán y aperitivos gratuitos. La conserjería es de lo mejor que he tenido en mi visita a varios lugares, se conocen de pies y cabeza Londres y te dan toda clase de tips, además te concienten y te hacen sentir en casa.  Hay un magnífico restaurante donde los desayunos son EXQUISITOS.

137,Ich würde auch 6 Punkte geben,"Unauffällig, aber zentral gelegen am Buckingham Palace wird man sofort freundlich am Eingang begrüßt.
Das Hotel besticht mit Eleganz, die modern und nicht allzu britisch mondän wirkt.
Champagner und Snacks empfangen einen herzlich.
Das Zimmer war sauber und total gemütlich. Ein richtiges Zuhause in London. Die vielen Kleinigkeiten machen das Hotel zu einem Vorzeigebeispiel an Gastfreundlichkeit. Alle möglichen Amenitykits erwarten einen auf dem Zimmer (Zahnbürste, Rasierer, Kissensprays, ja sogar die Wahl eines Aromatherapiekissens). 
Das Frühstück bietet eine reichhaltige Auswahl frischen Obsts, Joghurt, Säfte, Kaffeespezialitäten, Brot, Croissants, Marmelade und Eierspezialitäten.
Tageszeitungen liegen aus.
Nachmittags gibt es im Preis kostenfreies Eis und Naschereien.
Der Service ist sehr freundlich, unaufdringlich und perfekt. Viele hilfreiche Tips erhält man hier. 
Besonders hervorzuheben ist auch das Anschreiben vor dem Besuch und die persönliche Rückmeldung danach. 
Dieses Hotel ist absolut empfehlenswert. Wenn London, dann nur mit Hotel 41!",5,2017,04,26
137,Precioso,"Un lugar  magico el mejor hotel para pasar unas vacaciones en familia , el hotel tiene toda la comodidad que una familia necesita, el trato de las personas que trabajan ahi es unico, uno se siente en casa",5,2017,04,14

-sehr familiär
- nur 28 Zimmer
- über und über kleine Nettigkeiten wie Wärmflasche im Bett, Rosenblätter, Sweetsbuffet,...

Muss man Wissen:
- kein Spa (aber externe Masseuse kommt ins Haus)
- kein Pool
- sehr verwinkelte und tlw. unkonventionell geschnittene Zimmer- ich mag es gerne
- Stil eher britisch-konservativ denn neu-modern

Komme ich wieder? 110%!!!",5,2017,03,15

137,Ein Traum ,"Unser Aufenthalt im Hotel 41 in London war einfach spitze. Wir haben einen 4-Tage-Kurztrip gebucht. Vorab wurden wir bereits gefragt ob wir separate Kissen haben möchten (Schaum, Feder, usw.), ob wir einen Luftbefeuchter benötigen oder sonstige Extras die meist kostenlos reservierbar waren. Im Zimmer war dann natürlich auch bereits alles vorbereitet.

Frühstück war sehr sehr lecker und in einem tollen Ambiente hergerichtet. Über den ganzen Tag verteilt war es möglich Getränke zu holen oder sich ein paar Leckerein mitzunehmen.

Als wir am ersten Abend ins Zimmer kamen waren Kerzen aufgestellt und Rosenblätter verteilt.

Service war definitiv eine 1 mit Sternchen. Kein Wunsch blieb offen.

Lage super zentral. 3 Minuten zum Buckingham Palast. 3 Minuten zur Vicoria Station.

Wenn wir wieder nach London kommen, werden wir definitiv wieder in dieses Hotel gehen.

137,Oh Yeah,"Aufgrund der Bewertungen hier habe ich für meine Frau  und mich vier Nächte im Hotel41 London gebucht.

Der Servcie, die Aufmerksamkeit und Hilfsbreitschaft ist wie in den anderen Rezensionen beschrieben hervorragend. Man fühlt sich bestens um- und versorgt. 

Das Hotel liegt zentral in der Nähe des Buckingham Palace und Victoria Station. 
Man ereicht von dort die meisten Ziele mit dem Taxinach kurzer Zeit.

Mein einziger Kritkipunkt wäre das Zimmer. Wir hatten ein Executive Zimmer gebucht und es war doch recht wenig Platz im Zimmer. Nächstes mal schau ich nach einem Zimmer in einer höheren Kategorie.

Ansonsten:
- Frühstück erstklassig
- Duschmittel/Kosmetik erstklassig (Penhaligon's Blenheim Bouquet!!)
- romantische Aufdeckservice erstklassig (am Hochzeitstag: meine Frau hatte fast Tränen in den Augen vor Freude)
- Iphone Ladastation/Radiowecker im Zimmer
- Concierge überaushilfsbereit bei Restaurantbuchungen/Bordkarten drucken/usw.

Kulinarische Tips in der Nähe (5-10min Fußweg): 
- Afternoon Tea im naheliegenen Hotel Goring (sehr distinguiert)
- Lunch im Restaurant ""Bank Restaurant Westminster""

Fazit:
Jederzeit wieder!!!",5,2015,09,22

137,Muy recomendable,Nos encantó este hotel desde el primer momento. La atención es exquisita y la ubicación muy buena junto a Victoria Station (la llegada es fácil y luego te mueves en metro). El hotel es pequeño pero con muchísimo encanto. 100% recomendable.,5,2015,06,08
137,No podria ser mejor,"No es la mejor opcion para niños y es por eso que la tranquilidad y calidad de descanso es ampliamente superior a la media en su clase. Lo recomiendo mas que nada por la ubicacion, la accesibilidad es un punto a destacar.",5,2015,06,05
137,"Bello, ma (troppo?) caro","Allora, volevo qualcosa di speciale per il nostro breve soggiorno a Londra, e così ho prenotato una Junior Suite presso questo hotel, che è situato in pieno centro, davanti alle scuderie reali e a due passi da Victoria Station (comodissimo per la metro), da Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park, da tutto... Arredato molto in stile, colori bianco e nero, personale molto attento anche in fase di prenotazione a soddisfare le richieste dei clienti, con un questionario inviato qualche giorno prima.
Colazione piccola ma di livello (vi è anche una carta) comunque a pagamento (magari vista la spesa ingente, far pagare 20-25 sterline a colazione per ogni ospite si potrebbe evitare....).
Camera e bagno (molto grande, con vasca e box doccia) ok, su due piani, molto puliti ed ordinati, unico neo le finestre che comunque lasciavano entrare luce al mattino (c'è anche un lucernario sopra al letto, quindi era impossibile far qualcosa....). Wifi così così, al piano di sopra segnale non buono.
Nel complesso: sicuramente bene/benissimo, prezzi molto alti (per carità, come tutta Londra), ma la prossima volta forse proverei un altro hotel....",4,2015,05,15
137,La perfezione!,"Non sempre le primissime posizioni su TA soddisfano al 100% (forse per aspettative troppo alte) ma nel caso di Hotel 41 non c'è niente ""assolutamente"" niente da dire!

137,"Ein Club als Hotel, klein und fein mit Schwächen","Das 41 ist ein originelles Konzept: die obersten Stockwerke eines in die Jahre gekommenen Hotels werden üppig ausgestattet und für wenige Gäste mit hohem Servicegrad verkauft. Ein wunderbarer Platz in exzellenter Lage, perfekter Service (wobei die wirklich vielen jungen Kräfte nicht immer ganz ausgelastet schienen und sich gerne auch im Gästebereich angeregt unterhalten haben)- das alles ist wahr. Viele Zimmer sind sehr klein; der Blick auf den unwirtlichen Innenhof nicht gerade eine Inspiration. Kein Spa, nicht mal eine Sauna. Das Essen hat ein ordentliches Niveau ,die Honesty Bar, an der man sich selbst bedienen kann ist immer wieder eine schöne Einrichtung. Room und Special Services werden offensichtlich vom benachbarten (Vier-Sterne-) Mutterhotel mit abgedeckt. 
Da das ganze zudem einen selbst für Londoner Verhältnisse stolzen Preis hat, kann ich es nur mit 'befriedigend' bewerten. Große Baustelle gleich nebenan. Zimmer mit Blick  verlangen!",3,2015,04,06
137,Excelente,Me aloje en el hotel junto a mi familia y ha sido una experiencia inolvidable. Excelente lugar de alojamiento la atención del personal es muy buena y las instalaciones muy pintorescas. Sin lugar a duda me alojaria mil veces mas en el hotel 41.,5,2015,03,30
137,Traumhaftes Hotel in perfekter Lage,"Über den Valentinstag 2015 haben wir dieses Hotel zum ersten Mal besucht. 
Das Hotel 41 ist etwas ganz besonderes. Es handelt sich um ein in Westminster sehr zentral gelegenes, kleines und persönliches Hotel. Das Personal ist durchweg hilfsbereit und kompetent. Zur Begrüßung gibt es ein Glas Champagner und da meine Frau und ich vor kurzem geheiratet hatten war das Zimmer mit Kerzen entsprechend dekoriert. In der Executive Lounge gibt es jederzeit kleine Köstlichkeiten, von kleinen Süßigkeiten bis hin zu frischen Jakobsmuscheln. Dieses Hotel ist ein Traum und kann von unserer Seite nur zu 100% empfohlen werden.",5,2015,02,15
137,41 volte contento,"Prenotato in questo splendido hotel grazie alle positive recensioni trovate, ho avuto subito il riscontro di essere arrivato nel posto come descritto dalle altre esperienze. La gentilezza e cordialità degli inservienti ti aiutano a sentirti come nel proprio salotto o camera (anche se la struttura non è proprio ""recente"" è dotata di ogni confort). Unica attenzione agli ""Extra"" non sempre ben in evidenza. Prezzo non economico. Il camino della Hall è stupendo.",4,2015,01,02
137,Un pequeño hotel con personalidad en pleno centro de Londres,"Se trata de un pequeño hotel situado en la planta 5 del numero 41 de Buckingham Palace Road, justo al lado de Victoria Station, tan cerca que puedes ir fácilmente andando desde la estación del tren que te trae del Aeropuerto . Asi que es realmente comoda la situación y por otra parte también te permte ir andando a los principales puntos del centro de Londres, aunque sea con una buena caminata.
Como digo es un hotel pequeño pero encantador especialmente por lo amable que es el servicio. Gente joven y guapa, muy profesional y siempre atento a cualquier necesidad, 
La recepción al llegar por primera vez es muy amable con una copia de champagne mientras haces cómodamente el checking.
Las habitaciones son muy comodas y tranquilas y puedes descansar perfectamente sin ninguna molestia.
En general el servicio es de primer nivel como todo en el hotel teniendo en cuenta que es un pequeño hotel boutique, con una decoración muy bonita y con muchos detalles tanto en las zonas comunes como en las habitaciones y cuartos de baño.
En fin volveremos a este Londres la próxima vez que vayamos a Londres.",5,2014,12,19
137,Phantastisches Hotel - the best ever,"Wir waren letzte Woche zum Christmas Shopping in London und haben vier Tage im 41 gewohnt. Es ist ein absolutes Spitzenhotel.

Unkomplizierter Service der Spitzenklasse ausgeübt von sympathischen Menschen aus den verschiedensten Ländern. Ich reise sehr viel - ich kann mich nicht erinnern das besser gesehen zu haben.

Für geräuschempfindliche Menschen ist das Hotel allerdings nichts. Das alte Gebäude knarrt und knierscht schon einmal wenn jemand durch die Flure läuft. Ich komme wieder...!",5,2014,08,17
137,EXCELENTE ESTANCIA,"Todo cuidado al detalle, el staff muy amable. Nos trataron con mucha familiaridad, sin duda volvaria a hospedarme en el Hotel 41. Nos gusto mucho, super recomendable para pasar unos días en London!!!!!",5,2014,07,17
137,"Außergewöhnlicher Service, schönes Boutique-Hotel","Wir verbrachten anlässlich eines Konzerts vier wunderschöne Tage im 41 Hotel. 

Es liegt nahe der Victoria Station in der Nähe des Buckingham Palace und erstreckt sich über eine einzige Etage, die über 4 Stufen und einen schnellen Aufzug zu erreichen ist. Die Lounge ist sehr schön und der zentrale Ort des Hotels. In ihr werden Frühstück, Lunch, Afternoon Tea (eine vollwertige Mahlzeit) und Cannapees serviert. Zusätzlich gibt es abends noch ein kalt-warmes Imbissbuffet (""Plunder the Pantry""), so dass man nach dem Konzertbesuch noch etwas zu sich nehmen kann. Die Getränkeauswahl der Bar ist sehr gut. Das Frühstücksbuffet sieht auf den ersten Blick klein aus - die Auswahl ist jedoch groß und man vermisst nichts. Die zusätzlich bestellten Eggs Florentine waren sehr lecker.

Das Zimmer war stylisch, wenn auch klein, mit großem, gemütlichem Bett und nicht zu kleinem Badezimmer mit Dusche und Badewanne. 

Das Highlight dieses Hotels ist der Service: Es war jederzeit jemand ansprechbar und bereit, zu helfen, sei es mit Tischreservierungen oder Restaurantempfehlungen. Das Personal ist ohne Ausnahme außergewöhnlich aufmerksam, herzlich und gleichzeitig höflich zurückhaltend - wunderbar. 

In Anbetracht der Lautstärke in London und insbesondere der Großbaustelle in der nahegelegenen Victoria Station war das Hotel für uns immer eine Oase der Ruhe.",5,2014,07,13
137,Hotel 41.... Grazie !,"Per la seconda volta al 41....come tornare indietro nel tempo, ma con tutti i confort dei nostri tempi, camere bellissime e curate nei minimi dettagli, accoglienza calorosissima, il personale è cordiale gentile e sempre molto, molto disponibile. Incredibilmente piacevole trascorrere un po' di tempo nella Hall non Hall (il cuore della struttura) davanti al caminetto, coccolati dalle attenzioni del personale.
Inoltre la posizione è centralissima, proprio accanto al palazzo Reale, consente di raggiungere molti dei luoghi di maggiore interesse passeggiando nel parco.
Ottima anche la cucina..... Che dire Hotel 41 ..""Grazie!""",5,2014,05,16
137,QUASI PERFETTO,"Devo dire che la decisione di prenotare al '41 era stata determinata per buona parte dalle buonissime recensioni lette su Tripadvisor.
All'arrivo tutto bene, camere (due stanze executive una per me e mio marito l'altra per i miei figli) con finestre solo su cortili interni ma stanze  carine e personale affabile e disponibile. Poi abbiamo fatto una doccia veloce prima di uscire a cena e sono incominciati i problemi: la doccia non era per niente comoda con una pressione eccessiva se utilizzata solo con il doccione o solo con il doccino e che quindi non consentiva una doccia veloce senza bagnarsi completamente i capelli.
La prima notte poi il disastro! Dalle 4,30 di mattina abbiamo incominciato a sentir camminare su e giù per i corridoi con passi non proprio felpati a causa dei vecchi pavimenti di legno a listoni (si sentiva scricchiolare dappertutto!) e la confusione è continuata fino a quando ci siamo alzati sconsolati con delle belle borse sotto gli occhi. 
Avvisato il personale di questo problema, si sono però dimostrati comprensivi e ci hanno offerto lo spostamento in una junior suite che non dava sui corridoi principali e dove abbiamo potuto riposare tranquillamente nei giorni successivi.
Ogni pomeriggio abbiamo potuto sorseggiare un ottimo tè con gradevoli spuntini e la colazione alla mattina era adeguata alle nostre aspettative (meraviglioso il salmone affumicato).
Tutto sommato quindi bene, ma le 5 stelle secondo me le merita più il personale che  la struttura che si è rivelata tutto sommato sopravvalutata",4,2014,05,06
137,Gran confort,"Muy bien situado, con todo tipo de servicios y atenciones. El hotel es silencioso y tranquilo con lo que el descanso está garantizado. El staff amable y profesional. Muy recomendable tanto para viajes de negocios como de placer!",4,2014,05,06

137,non ci torno,"tutto molto bello e di grande effetto appena arrivi... ma dopo un po' ti accorgi che è tanta ""fuffa"" ... un esempio? l'hotel offre spuntini dalle 20 all'una di notte, con lo slogan molto ""friendly"" di ""svuota la dispensa"" o qualcosa del genere ... premetto che si tratta per la maggior parte delle stesse cose da bere e da mangiare che trovi al buffet la mattina per la colazione... comunque, fin qui tutto bene, a parte il fatto che in questi spuntini serali non è per niente chiaro ciò che è gentilmente offerto dall'hotel e compreso nel prezzo, e ciò che è considerato un extra da pagare... insomma ti senti libero e pensi che sia una ""coccola"" gentilmente offerta e giustificata dal prezzo piuttosto alto, e invece il conto lievita inaspettatamente e con rammarico... se il personale ti offre ripetutamente da bere anche se tu dici no, e poi ti invita a servirti da bere da solo se hai voglia, poi non ti aspetti di ritrovartelo sul conto
ps personale affettato e fintamente cordiale...allora meglio un sano distacco",3,2014,05,03
137,Fuori dal comune ma caro,"Non è un albergo standard, con hall e reception all'ingresso. Tutto si svolge al quinto pianto di uno stabile antico vicino a Buckingham palace, dunque posto centrale ma senza stradine gradevoli per passeggiare e fare shopping. L'idea è quella di riprodurre una vecchia casa inglese con tante stanze, tutte molto curate e accoglienti, dotate di ogni confort. Ma proprio come una vecchia casa inglese non è insonorizzata, i tubi a volte fanno rumore, i pavimenti scricchiolano e il wi-fi può fare cilecca. Detto questo, 750 £ per due notti sono un po' troppi. Aggiungo che il servizio non è solo accogliente, è gentilissimo ed efficiente. Forse i ragazzi all'arrivo dovrebbero mettere gli ospiti a loro agio parlando e ponendo domande in modo meno ossessivo. Ma è un dettaglio: sono bravissimi e gentili.",4,2014,04,01
137,Very good indeed,"Albergo super considerando gli standard di Londra.

Posizione strategica, camere molto accoglienti, servizio super.

Anche di fronte a qualche piccolo inconveniente (istruzioni dell'aria condizionata non user friendly, chiusura elettronica della safety box che non voleva saperne di aprirsi al momento della partenza) l'eccellente livello di servizio, la cortesia e la disponibilità del personale sono stati più che all'altezza.

Colazione ottima, come anche snack e stuzzichino h24.

Menzione speciale per Simone, che tiene alto l'onore dell'hotallerie italiana nel mondo",5,2014,03,30

137,english ... very english ma senza l'italiano....,"Un albergo di charme accanto ad uno classico. Appena si entra si ha l'impressione di aver sbagliato posto: una piccola scrivania ed un corridoio danno l'impressione di non essere a fatto in un posto chic. Poi arriva Simone, il nostro ""angelo"" e tutto cambia. Ci fa salire al 5° ed unico piano di questo ""atipico"" hotel dove ci sono poche stanze ed una ""Hall non-Hall"" perchè in questa stanza si svolge tutto...è il punto di riferimento ma anche il punto per fare colazione e per chiedere infonrmazioni. Veniamo fatti accomodare e ci viene servito subito un Rosè con bollicine ottimo e fresco mentre Simone, un gentilissimo romagnolo a Londra, ci spiega tutto l'albergo e la filosofia e poi ci accompagna in stanza. la Stanza che ci è stata assegnata era la 4109 grande con arredo very english...calda ed accogliente... la sera ci avevano preparato il letto con petali di rose, champagne, candele e caminetto acceso...romanticissimo! Comunque, l'ambiente è bellissimo ed i servizi al TOP ma senza il nostro Simone non sarebbe satata la stessa cosa. Quindi vi consiglio di chiedere la sua presenza al vostro arrivo (speriamo che non se la prenda per il surplus di lavoro che gli sto portando!!!). senza scherzi la sua assenza noi l'abbiamo notate e le attenzioni verso di noi quando non c'era lui erano eclatanti. Per finire la posizione proprio accanto al Palazzo Reale ed a 10 minutio a piedi da Piccadilly o da Big Ben e tre minuti da Victoria Station. Un bell'Hotel veramente. consigliato",5,2014,03,18

137,Excellency in jeder Hinsicht auf oberstem Niveau - es gäbe mind. eine 6,"Wir waren als Geburtstagsüberraschung für unseren 11 jährigen Sohn 3 Tage im 41. Bereits die Vorbereitungen für diesen Anlass - alles per Email - zeigte eine äusserst persönlich bezogene Ansprache, Frage nach Details und gekoppelt mit einem Frageformular welches von Bettfüllarten über kleine Aufmerksamkeiten bis zur Organisation von Anlässen alles beinhaltete. 
Spezielle Wünsche wie das Organisieren von Musicaltickets welche im Hotel bereit sein sollen; Restaurant Buchungen etc. wurden prompt auch rückbestätigt. 
Die Ankunft im Hotel wurde von einer mehr als freundlichen und persönlichen Art gestaltet. Unser Sohn wurde gleich mit Namen genannt und dies war während des ganzen Aufenthaltes immer so...immer sich erkundigend wie es uns geht, ob man was machen kann usw. Das ganze Personal vom Doorman über die Service Leute, Concierge und den Verantwortlichen war immer bemüht uns wie zu Hause fühlen zu lassen. Unser Sohn fand einen grossen Kuchen vor mit Ballonen, Süssigkeiten und eine Geburtstagskarte, welche das Personal individuell mit Ihren Glückwünschen ausstattete. Zu jedem Zeitpunkt wurden wir liebevoll, professionell und mit jeglicher Aufmerksamkeit betreut. Spezielle Wünsche wie z.B. Zigarettenbeschaffung, welche nur noch in England erhältlich sind wurden mit Eleganz und Zuvorkommenheit erledigt. 
Wir haben die Suite 4128 gebucht, welches erlaubte,dass unser Sohn sein eigenes Bett hatte. Das Zimmer hat seinen grossen britischen Charme, war mit äusserst vielen kleinen Details ausgestattet z.B. wurde ein Elektroconverter bereitgestellt; Büromaterial war vorhanden und Sauberkeit war hervorragend. Wir hatten eine moderne Dusche/WC wie auch ein Bad/WC, welches zwar sehr klein war, aber funktionell. Eine extra Dusche stand zur Verfügung. Simple und einfache Bedienung des Fernsehgerätes ist so nebenbei zu erwähnen. Das Frühstück wird in einem sehr schönen Raum/Lounge mit Cheminees serviert und besteht aus einen kleinen aber feinen Buffet plus die Möglichkeit diverse Speisen zu bestellen. Die Egg Benedikt sind zu erwähnen. Nach dem Frühstück werden diverse kleine Leckereien hingestellt, welche man z.B. auch für die Ausflüge mitnehmen könnte. Für Lunch oder einem kleinen Nachtessen hat es eine passende Karte und wer mal den Clubsandwich bestellt ...Geduld haben, dann jedoch kommt ein ganz frisch erstelltes Sandwich in einer Uebergrösse an. 
Die Lage sehr nahe der Victoria Station wie auch des Buckinghams ist auch für generelle Ausflüge sehr passend. Man ist z.B. in wenigen Gehminuten im einen oder anderen grossen Park. Das 41 ist auch behilflich diverse Dinge zu organisieren. 
Für uns war dieser Aufenthalt ein Highlight unserer Reisetätigkeiten. Mit dem ganz speziellen laufenden persönlichen Touch welche alle Mitarbeiterinnen an den Tag gelegt haben gehört es für uns zur absoluten Spitze was ein City Boutique Hotel betrifft. Wir erachten das 41 als mehr als empfehlenswert.",5,2013,11,08
137,Mejor imposible para una pequeña joya escondida,"Si tienes algún motivo especial para celebrar algo y quieres que sea en Londres, no hay mejor sitio que el 41. Tras cinco años de nuestra primera estancia, hemos vuelto de nuevo para celebrar algo muy especial.  Se trata de un hotel pequeñito. Si vas buscando un hotel grande con amplios salones y pasillos interminables este no es el sitio. Pero si lo que buscas es un escondite donde tener una experiencia diferente, y también diría, única, el 41 es la mejor opción, sin dudarlo. 

UBICACIÓN

El hotel se encuentra a escasos minutos de Victoria Station y en la parte trasera de Buckinghman Palace, junto a las caballerizas. 

CHECK-IN

Teníamos reservado el traslado desde el aeropuerto de Heathrow al hotel, y lo hicimos en un fantástico y lujoso coche en unos 40 minutos aproximadamente.

El hotel está en la planta superior de otro de la cadena RCH, The Rubens at the Palace. Pese a estar en la planta alta del edificio, tiene su entrada propia desde la calle, bastante discreta, sólo reconocible por unas banderolas con el anagrama del hotel. Al entrar ya te das cuenta de que vas a alojarte en un sitio diferente, donde te van a tratar con una exquisita pero cercana amabilidad. 

Al entrar desde la calle hay una pequeña recepción, donde se quedan con el equipaje mientras te acompañan a la planta superior del edificio para hacer el check-in. 

LOUNGE

Toda la vida del hotel gira en torno al pequeño pero agradable y apetecible lounge. Allí se hace el check-in y el check-out mientras te ofrecen una bebida durante la espera. También es la zona para el desayuno, para disfrutar de manera gratuita del “plunder the pantry”  (saquear la despensa): snacks, canapés, helados,… pedirse una copa junto  a la chimenea, o tomar algo de la carta para comer o cenar. O simplemente para sentarse frente a la chimenea para pasar el rato, deseando que pase lo más lentamente posible.

HABITACIÓN

Habíamos reservado una Executive King. Era una habitación grande y espaciosa, con un mesa escritorio en la entrada junto al armario, que era de tamaño más que suficiente para poner equipaje de varios días. 

La cama, tamaño King, era bastante confortable, con unas estupendas sábanas de un blanco inmaculado. En un armario junto a la cama estaba la tv y el minibar.

Tenía también una bonita chimenea de gas que se maneja con un mando a distancia , que tuvimos la suerte de poder usar porque el clima ya lo permitía. Completaba la habitación un sofá frente a la cama. 

La decoración de la habitación, el mobiliario, sábanas, toallas, etc…todo es en blanco y negro, marca de la casa. 

BAÑO

Espacioso y completo. Tenía una bañera grande y una ducha de plato. En los dos sitios podías usar tanto el mango de ducha como la cascada que caía del techo. Ni que decir tiene que la presión del agua es magnífica. 

Dispones de muchas toallas y de unos agradables albornoces y zapatillas. En cuanto a las amenities, son muy completas, de Penhaligon´s  Blenheim Bouquet. 

DESAYUNO

Hay una gran variedad de elecciones a la carta para desayunar, desde el típico desayuno inglés completo, hasta tortitas con auténtico sirope de arce, diferentes tipos de platos elaborados con huevos, etc. Y de buffet hay varios tipos de panes, zumos, bollería francesa, embutidos, quesos, yogures…En cuanto a las bebidas te preparan al momento el té o el café que quieras, con una presentación muy cuidada.

LIMPIEZA

Impecable en todo el hotel

WI-FI

Incluido en la tarifa de la habitación, y de alta velocidad. 

STAFF

La principal razón de que el 41 sea un hotel diferente y excepcional es sin lugar a dudas su personal. Desde que llegas al hotel y te atienden en la planta baja hasta que te marchas, todo el mundo se desvive para que los huéspedes se encuentren a gusto y a ser posible mejor que en su propia casa. Te dan un trato cercano pero siempre respetando la intimidad que tú necesites. Están abiertos a conversar contigo en la medida en la que tú quieras, y siempre con un trato exquisito. 

Se prestan a solucionarte cualquier cosa que necesites. A nosotros nos hicieron unas reservas para cenar el día de la llegada y comer al día siguiente, tan solo les dijimos el tipo de comida de queríamos y que no estuviesen muy lejos del hotel y se encargaron de reservar unos estupendos restaurantes,  e incluso nos dieron la reserva en una hoja con los datos de los sitios y nos facilitaron el taxi. 

Por la tarde al final del día llegabas a la habitación y te habían hecho el descubierto, el turndown, y en la cama tenías una bolsa de agua caliente y una tarjeta con el tiempo del día siguiente. La chimenea estaba calentando la habitación y la música estaba puesta de fondo. 

No somos capaces de recordar los nombres de todo el personal del hotel que nos ha atendido, así que desde aquí le damos las gracias a Mónika y a todo su fantástico equipo por un fin de semana inolvidable.

En definitiva, ir al 41 es disfrutar de una experiencia diferente, porque deseas volver al hotel cuanto antes para quedarte en el lounge y dejarte llevar. Una joya escondida.",5,2013,11,02
137,Very british,"Piccolo Hotel davanti alle scuderie della Regina. Si trova in zona VIctoria/Westminister ottimo punto di partenza per visitare la città. Personale sempre molto disponibile e gentile (un grazie particolare  a Simone che ha reso il nostro soggiorno ancora più bello), la mia camera era una King Excutive con il camino, fantastica e super accessoriata, molto apprezzato il servizio di turndown serale (luci soffuse, candele accese, camino acceso e musica classica), fiori e frutta fresca tutti i giorni, pulizia eccellente, apprezzato il menu dei cuscini, molto meno il materasso e il coprimaterasso che non ho trovato particolarmente confortevoli. 
Ho cenato un paio di sere nel ristorante dell'hotel e devo dire onestamente che non è il migliore  dove mangiare a Londra, ma se proprio non avete alternativa, evitate le zuppe, il fish&chips e l'hamburgher! buonino invece il piatto del pescato del giorno, nonostante tutto i camerieri sanno fare bene il loro lavoro e vi faranno passare una piacevole serata!
Molto buona la colazione, il buffet comprende yogurt, cereali, brioches, pane, marmellate, frutta fresca, salumi e formaggi, poche cose ma di qualità.
Durante il giorno, il buffet della colazione diventa una piccola dispensa per gli ospiti dove potrete trovare snack e dolcetti sempre a disposizione anche fino a tarda notte. 
Se siete giovani e avete come me e mio marito uno stile ""sportivo"" potrà capitarvi di sentire parecchi occhi puntati su di voi, a me non ha recato particolare disturbo, se volete evitare certe situazioni vi consiglio di puntare su un look meno casual del nostro.
Ad ogni modo è un albergo che consiglierei vivamente a tutti per l'arredamento, la pulizia e lo staff!",4,2013,10,23

137,Das perfekte Wochenende im besten Hideaway Hotel Londons,"Wir waren semi-privat vier Tage in London und haben uns hierfür das Hotel 41 ausgesucht. Wir haben die Suite gebucht - was sich super gelohnt hat.

Das Hotel liegt direkt um die Ecke vom Buckingham Palace rund 2-3 Fussminuten weg von Victoria U-Bahn Station.

Das Hotel selber entspricht den allerhöchsten Standards an Service; auch für sehr anspruchsvolle Gäste. Der Empfang ist sehr persönlich. Man wird direkt unten an der Türe begrüsst. Im Lift geht es dann in den 5. Stock in die executive lounge (Rezeption).

Die Suite ware sehr gepflegt, individuell designed und selbst für Londoner Verhältnisse sehr geräumig. Wir hatten noch einen Connecting Room mit separatem Badezimmer und Wohnzimmer. Das Zimmer hat einen begehbaren Kleiderschrank. Leider gab es für uns nicht genügend Bügel ... :-) Das Badezimmer war romantisch mit einer Kerze beleuchtet, am Abend jeweils einzigartig blau ausgeleuchtet. Das Bett ist sehr gross und die Matratze ist sehr angenehm, was in London nicht immer der Fall ist...

Als Begrüssung bekamen wir ein leckeres Stück Kaesekuchen und eine Flasche Champagner. Eine handgeschriebene Willkommenskarte hat die persönliche Note abgerundet. Wir haben täglich Wasser und Kaffee vom Hotel bekommen.

Der Service war stets freundlich und immer hilfsbereit. Was uns sehr gefreut hat, waren auch die persönlichen Gespräche am morgen beim Frühstück. So kamen stets 1-2 Damen und Herren von der Rezeption zum Tisch für ein kurzes Hallo. Es lohnt sich, den Mitarbeitern zu erzählen was man für ein Programm hat. Wir haben echt wertvolle Tips bekommen!

Das Frühstück ist klein in der Grösse aber dafür umso besser: Qualität vor Quantität! Es gibt u.a. geräucherten Lachs aus Schottland, italienische Salami und diverse Schinken. Das Spezielle ist aber die Auswahl an super frischem Brot (unser Favorit war das Nussbrot) und die Anzahl frischer verschiedener Früchte (Brombeeren, Himbeeren, Erdbeeren, Kiwi, eingelegte Orangen etc etc). Das kalte Buffet wird ergänzt durch warme Speisen (a la carte).

Die Suite eignet sich auch optimal für eine Roadshow, da man Gäste separat empfangen kann.

Für Hideaway Liebhaber ist das Hotel die perfekte Alternative zu den Grosshotels! Klein aber Oho und wir freuen uns auf das nächste Mal!",5,2013,04,22

137,Speciale,"Siamo stati all'Hotel 41 per circa una settimana nell'Agosto 2012. All'arrivo, nella piccola lobby al piano terra, abbiamo trovato una gentilissima ragazza italiana ad accoglierci. Da quel momento in poi abbiamo ricevuto mille attenzioni da parte del personale (una menzione speciale per Rita, molto simpatica e prodiga di consigli), attenzioni mai esagerate né troppo formali, evidentemente sono in grado di interagire in modo diverso a seconda della tipologia di ospite che si trovano davanti: noi siamo piuttosto amichevoli e così è stato il loro rapportarsi a noi. 
Camera bellissima, ampia, pulita. Prodotti da bagno Penhaligon's (i miei preferiti), attenzioni extra (tipo il turndown serale) non richieste e molto apprezzate. Ogni mattina uscendo dalla struttura ci venivano consegnate bottiglie d'acqua, mele, anche la piantina di Londra.. attenzioni semplici ma che non si trovano quasi mai, nemmeno in alberghi della stessa categoria. 
Colazione ottima, e molto apprezzato l'honesty bar.
In sostanza un'esperienza davvero piacevole e un'accoglienza non comune.
Ci torneremo sicuramente.",5,2013,04,06
137,Meglio di così...,"Ho soggiornato presso l'Hotel 41 per un paio di settimane lo scorso settembre.
Altri problemi mi hanno impedito, fino ad oggi, di scrivere una recensione su Tripadvisor, attraverso il quale avevo scelto l'Hotel.
Finalmente riesco a farlo ora (e ne sono bel lieto) e, come si intuisce dal titolo, il mio grado di soddisfazione è stato massimo.
La posizione per visitare Londra è perfetta (Victoria Station vicinissima); l'Hotel è davvero un piccolo gioiello, a partire dall'arredamento che lascia immaginare di trovarsi in un aristocratico Club inglese.
Le camere ed i bagni sono dotate di ogni comodità, il Personale è di una gentilezza e disponibilità quasi ""imbarazzanti"" (non faccio nomi per timore di dimenticare qualcuno) e non c'è nessun problema per chi, come me, non conosce per nulla l'inglese, essendo sempre possibile trovare un interlocutore con cui parlare tranquillamente in italiano.
La colazione è ottima, così come il buffet messo gratuitamente a disposizione dal tardo pomeriggio.
Il rapporto qualità/prezzo assolutamente adeguato.
In conclusione, il mio è stato un soggiorno assolutamente indimenticabile e, superfluo dirlo, tornerei in questa splendida piccola (altro enorme vantaggio) struttura qualora avessi l'opportunità di soggiornare ancora a Londra.",5,2013,04,02
137,"Perfektes Service, ideale Lage","Wir haben das ""41"" aufgrund der exzellenten Bewertungen für unseren Kurzaufenthalt in London ausgewählt. Kurz gesagt: Unsere Erwartungen wurden nicht nur erfüllt, sondern sogar noch übertroffen. 
Die Lage des Hotels ist ausserordentlich günstig sowohl als Ausgangspunkt für Spaziergänge Richtung Buckingham Palace und Houses of Parliament als auch für Touren mit der U-Bahn aufgrund der Nähe zur U-Bahnstation Victoria Station. Das hotel selbst ist schon von seiner Ausstattung ein Schmuckstück. Klein und fein! Das Service ist exzellent - der Empfang kompetent und freundlich. Das Zimmer ist sehr schön  ausgestattet und hatte einen offen Kamin (gemütlich!). Besonders hervorzuheben sind die kleinen Aufmerksamkeiten, die wir am Zimmer nach unseren Ausflügen vorgefunden haben - einmal verschiedenevsorten von Oliven , das andere Mal eine kleine Auswahl von Süssigkeiten.
Das Abendessen im Gesellschaftsraum des Hotels - dieser beinhaltet auch die Rezeption - war vom Service und von der Qualität des Essens hervorragend. Die ausstattung erinnerte and die gute alte viktorianische Zeit und vermittelte die Atmosphäre von ""good old British"".

137,Pentita della scelta,"Quando viaggio mi piace soggiornare in hotel di lusso,sono socia LHW e riconosco di essere molto esigente attratta dalle recensioni su tripadvisor, ho soggiornato in questo hotel dal 20 al 23 agosto 2012.Londra ci è' sembrata bellissima,il tempo in quei giorni e'stato molto buono,ma l'hotel si è' rivelato molto al di sotto delle nostre aspettative.La stanza assegnata la 4128 era piuttosto grande ,il pavimento irregolare era scomodo e pericoloso.Letti molto grandi ma entrambi molto scomodi (mal di schiena), con piumoni invernali, di notte ci svegliavamo in un bagno di sudore,sarebbe stato logico,data la stagione, mettere trapunte primverili( col solo lenzuolo faceva freddo)Lenzuola di qualità  scadente ed ordinaria,negli hotel 5stelle le lenzuola sono di lino o cotone pregiato e col monogramma del l'hotel:nulla di questo al 41.Asciugamani buoni e tanti ma accappatoi lisi e sfilacciati(migliorati quando l'abbiamo fatto presente)La cosa peggiore erano i bagni vecchi e poco funzionali, non c'era bidet,c'erano ben 3 docce e una piccola ,ordinaria, vasca col flessibile per lavarci, ma l'acqua o era bollente o gelida ,impossibile regolar la, si regolava solo l'acqua delle docce il cui getto partiva dal soffitto senza tubo flessibile,i rubinetti perdevano pezzi di cromatura appena si aprivano,l'acqua scorreva lenta,ma la cosa più sgradevole e' stato trovare tra vasca e lavabo,la prima mattina, due piccoli insett(scarafaggi?),nonostante il ribrezzo li ho uccisi, messi in un bicchiere e fatti vedere a Magda,in maniera riservata(solo io lei è Alessandra che faceva da interprete)da sole nella stanza,con gentilezza le ho esposto i problemi oltre al fatto che non era stata tolta la spazzatura(parte della frutta fatta trovare in omaggio nella stanza era marcia e puzzava)nel riordino serale delle stanze,ma quando le ho chiesto che soluzione si potesse trovare, mi ha proposto di andarmene(???????)al Rubens(4stelle) le ho chiesto di parlarne  con Friederick ,ma questi per tutto il soggiorno non ci ha mai avvicinati ,Monica era in ferie .Gentilissimi Michael,Rita e Vivien,ci ha un po' delusi  Alessandra alla quale avevamo chiesto ,sia telefonicamente che per mail,di visitare backimgham palace,rispondeva sempre che non c'erano problemi ed invece non ci ha ne' detto ne' prenotato i biglietti, bastavano 3-4giorni di prenotazione.Altri del personale davano indicazioni inesatte sui vari siti turistici.Buona la colazione ma nemmeno paragonabile ai grandi hotels italiani.Molto apprezzata l'acqua offerta ,abbiamo preso poche cose dal buffet gratuito perché' eravamo quasi sempre fuori ,ma anche perché  era quasi tutto al formaggio ed io sono allergica.La terza sera non ci hanno cambiato le lenzuola,nonostante il biglietto messo e nonostante avessimo specificato chele volevamo cambiate tutti i giorni.Certo non è stato bello pagare più di 700 euro per ricevere questo trattamento,tutti gli altri hotels dove ho soggiornato avevano bagni lussuosi, non avevo mai visto bagni così malmessi.Tuttavia,dato l'enorme divario tra il servizio da noi ricevuto e quello decantato su tripadvisor,e' possibile pensare ad una serie di sfortunati eventi?devo però' dire che dopo avere constatato l'inutilita' dell'aver parlato con Magda quella volta non mi sono mai più lamentata dei disservizi e c'è ne sarebbero tanti altri ancora. Magari un giorno ci tornerò' per verificare se è' possibile cambiare idea.",3,2012,09,28
137,molto piacevole,"io e mio marito siamo stati a Londra per lavoro; rientrare in albergo era un piacere per le attenzioni e la cortesia dello staff. Molto gradevole la stanza anche se a volte si sentivano delle vibrazioni; molto romantico rientrare in camera dopo lo spuntino serale e trovare candele, rose ed altre piccole attenzioni. Unico neo: ordinare piatti dalla cucina, seppur una semplice insalata, ha avuto costi stratosferici!!! imparata questa lezione, ci piacerebbe ritornarci ancora!",4,2012,09,11
137,Fantastico,"Discrezione e lusso, grande servizio all'altezza del prezzo.
Colazione fantastica ed il conto non ha avuto sorprese.
Le stanze sono curate ampie ed il bagno è molto spazioso.
La posizione è molto centrale",4,2012,09,09
137,"Hervorragender Service, gute Lage, Zimmer etwas klein","Aufgrund der Bewertungen hier habe ich für meine Frau  und mich vier Nächte im Hotel41 London gebucht.

Der Servcie, die Aufmerksamkeit und Hilfsbreitschaft ist wie in den anderen Rezensionen beschrieben hervorragend. Man fühlt sich bestens um- und versorgt. 

Das Hotel liegt zentral in der Nähe des Buckingham Palace und Victoria Station. 
Man ereicht von dort die meisten Ziele mit dem Taxinach kurzer Zeit.

Mein einziger Kritkipunkt wäre das Zimmer. Wir hatten ein Executive Zimmer gebucht und es war doch recht wenig Platz im Zimmer. Nächstes mal schau ich nach einem Zimmer in einer höheren Kategorie.

Ansonsten:
- Frühstück erstklassig
- Duschmittel/Kosmetik erstklassig (Penhaligon's Blenheim Bouquet!!)
- romantische Aufdeckservice erstklassig (am Hochzeitstag: meine Frau hatte fast Tränen in den Augen vor Freude)
- Iphone Ladastation/Radiowecker im Zimmer
- Concierge überaushilfsbereit bei Restaurantbuchungen/Bordkarten drucken/usw.

Kulinarische Tips in der Nähe (5-10min Fußweg): 
- Afternoon Tea im naheliegenen Hotel Goring (sehr distinguiert)
- Lunch im Restaurant ""Bank Restaurant Westminster""

Fazit:
Jederzeit wieder!!!",5,2012,07,18
137,Lusso,"Hotel molto elegante, camere dotate di ogni comfort e personale molto cordiale e disponibile. Il bagno per gli standard di londra era spazioso ben curato e con la tv. Molto consigliato",5,2012,06,24
137,La Mejor Opción en Londres,"Hotel 41 va más allá de las expectatiivas de cualquier viajero. Es el lugar perfecto para quedarse en Londres. 

Si prefieres los hoteles boutique y aprecias un servicio verdaderamente de primera, un lugar impecable y una atención personal que va más allá de cualquier descripción posible, that´s the place to go.

Gracias a Frederick, Remus y el resto del equipo por brindarnos una estancia fuera de este mundo. Volveremos tan pronto como podamos.",5,2012,06,14
137,Very British,"Mein Mann und ich haben in diesem Hotel ein wunderbares Wochenende verbracht. Hier stimmt einfach alles, vom hervorragenden Service bis zu den tollen Zimmern. Wir haben noch nie einen so aufmerksamen Service in einem Hotel erlebt. Man hat den Eindruck, die Mitarbeiter könnten die Wünsche der Gäste erraten. Wir hatten uns z.B. über den Rückflug unterhalten, schon bot man uns an, die Bordkarten für uns vorzubereiten. Dieser herausragende Service rechtfertigt auf jeden Fall den Zimmerpreis. 

Das Frühstück lässt keine Wünsche offen. Die Abende am Kaminfeuer in der Executive Lounge, in der auch das Frühstück serviert wird, waren sehr stilvoll, ohne abgehoben zu sein. Man fühlte sich mit einem guten Whisky wie in einem alten englischen Club. 

Ich hatte in der Zeit unseres Aufenthalts Geburtstag. An diesem Tag überraschte man mich zum Frühstück mit einer kleinen Geburtstagstorte. Der Butler, der über profunde Kenntnisse über Speisen und Getränke verfügt, empfahl uns den dazu passenden Champagner.

Abends waren wir im benachbarten ""Rubens"" im Restaurant ""The Library"" sehr gut essen. Die Karte ist erfreulich übersichtlich, bietet aber exzellente Speisen. 

Das Hotel liegt so zentral, dass wir keine U-Bahn benutzten, sondern vieles zu Fuß erreichen konnten. 

Das Hotel hat auf jeden  Fall ""Suchtpotential"". Auch wir werden beim nächsten Besuch in London wieder hier wohnen!!!",5,2012,06,03
137,perfect place,"ich komme seit nunmehr 10 Jahren regelmässig in das 41. Es ist ein Oase, ein wunderbares Rückzugsgebiet, perfekt organisiert und zum Wohlfühlen, sowohl auf Geschäftsreisen wie auch privat. Ich würde es nur aus einem einzigen Grund nicht weiterempfehlen: weil dadurch die Gefahr wächst, dass es bei meinem nächsten Besuch ausgebucht ist.",5,2012,05,15
137,Elegancia y Tradición,"Con el antecedente de haber estado catalogado como el número 1 en Tripadvisor, buscamos este hotel con altas expectativas y como tal, el hotel es esplédidamente confortable y acojedor. Bien ubicado en cuanto a restaurantes y transportación. Accesible caminando a las atracciones que rodean el área del Big Ben. El personal es muy amable, aunque esde notar que para la categoría del hotel, nadie hablaba español. Es sumamente recomendable, aunque evidentemente tiene un costo considerable y la atención excesiva puede llegar a ser incomoda.",5,2012,04,30
137,Mein absolutes Traumhotel,"Nach mittlerweile 5 Aufenthalten im 41 kann ich  andere Tripadvisor- Nutzer nur warnen: es besteht absolute Suchtgefahr! 
Ich reise viel, aber ich kenne kein anderes Hotel(im 5 Sterne- Bereich), in dem man sich sozusagen fühlt wie im Märchenland.Wohin man auch schaut,man sieht nur edle, schöne Dinge; die Betten sind riesig und weich, das Kaminfeuer prasselt,die guten Feen in ihren schwarzen Uniformen mit den roten Nelken im Knopfloch lesen einem jeden Wunsch von den Augen ab und man hat das wohlige Gefühl, sich um nichts kümmern zu müssen.Kaum äussert man einen Wunsch, wird er auch schon erfüllt.Überall gibt es kleine Aufmerksamkeiten: der Champagner beim Check-In,die Petit Fours im Zimmer ,der traumhafte Turndown- Service,die Penhaligons Fläschchen im Badezimmer,die ""Plunder the pantry""-Idee am Abend...
Ein Traumhotel, der Traumstadt London mehr als würdig!",5,2012,04,13
137,Ein Traum,"Freundlichkeit, Aufmerksamkeit und Komfort sind seit unserem Aufenthalt im 41 neu definiert. Das 41 ist kein Hotel im klassischen Sinne, man fühlt sich ein wenig wie Zuhause, nur mit dem Unterschied, dass einem stille Geister im Hintergrund alle Wünsche abnehmen und mit der Erfüllung von unausgesprochenen Wünschen immer wieder überraschen. Man will das 41 also am liebsten gar nicht verlassen. Aber wenn man das doch tut, dann ist die U-Bahn in 5 Minuten zu Fuss erreichbar, zur Queen sind es auch nur 5 Gehminuten, alles sehr zentral und gleichwohl ruhig im 5. Stock des Gebäudes. Wir kommen definitiv wieder!",5,2012,04,09
137,Very good,"Abbiamo passato dei giorni a Londra e la nostra scelta, grazie a trip advisor è ricaduta su questo hotel. Siamo rimasti soddisfatti della cortesia del personale, del confort delle stanze... ad esempio ottimo lo schermo piatto della tv, il frigobar e  il bagno molto bello e pulito..L'albergo si trova a pochi passi dalle principali attrazioni e per questo ci torneremo. Londra è sempre magnifica, e lo sarà ancora di più da quando abbiamo scoperto questa struttura.",4,2012,03,27
137,Indimenticabile,"L'hotel 41 è sicuramente il posto migliore dove soggiornare a Londra, prima di tutto la cortesia di ogni singolo membro dello staff è semplicemente eccezionale, l'impegno con cui tutti cercano di rendere il soggiorno dei loro ospiti  indimenticabile è continuo in particolare vorrei segnalare l'assistant Manager Monika la cui gentilezza lascia senza parole. Per finire il capitolo personale farà piacere sapere agli italiani che non si sentono sicuri del loro inglese che potranno trovare chi capisce la nostra lingua.
 Le camere sono spaziose  e molto pulite con una vasca da bagno degna di questo nome, sono inoltre dotate di ogni confort (aria condizionata, frigobar, televisore piatto, prese di corrente adatte ai nostri elettrodomestici, ferro da stiro, stereo Ipod...) Il letto e molto comodo e si possono scegliere vari tipi di cuscini, su richiesta le camere vengono rifatte più volte al giorno e le stanze sono molto silenziose. La colazione è abbondante e moto varia, nella sala dell'hotel ( che tra le altre cose è bellissima, ci si sente catapultati in un vero club inglese) è allestita una zona dove poter prendere gratuitamente snack e dolcetti per tutto il giorno.
L' albergo si trova in pieno centro e potete scegliere di girare Londra come volete, a piedi oppure a 100m c'è la grande stazione di Victoria da dove partano alcune linee della metropolitana e Bus.
Io ero in fuga romantica e ho scelto il pacchetto romantico veramente carino.
Il rapporto qualità prezzo è ottimo, certo non è un hotel a buon mercato, ma vale ogni singolo euro/sterlina spesi. Quando tornerò a Londra tornerò all'Hotel 41.",5,2012,03,16
137,"Like coming home - understatment, luxury and service at its best","My wife and me spend extended weekends for Christmas in London on a regular basis. After several times beeing in Le Meridien we chose 41 because of the fabolous comments on trip advisor. In a nutshell we can approve that nothing what is and was written about 41 is lie; it is all true and better than you can imagine. Frederic Dallot the resident manager and his team are so polite and offer a reserved but very attentive service that you have the feeling like beeing at home and that they are all capable of anticipating our every wish. 
Decoration and location are in the very best of taste. We can also recommend the champagne afternoon tea; delicious - you really feel that the owner take care of all details. 
It is not a ordinary hotel and this begins at the entrance. ""Checking in"" this word is to ordinary for what follows in the upper floors. You take a seat, drink a glas of champage which the manager offers to you and talk about the details, plans etc. of your stay. When coming ""home"" (back to 41) in the evenings you have open fire, soft music and other pleasantness in your hotel room.
So to cut a long story short if you want to do a special trip to london whether alone, with friends or as a couple visit 41. Life is too short to spend leisure time in ordinary hotels with plain vanilla service. After 41 there will be no other hotel in London that you want to visit in the future.",5,2012,01,08
137,Un sogno,"Siamo tornati a Londra dopo tanti anni ed e' stato meraviglioso riscoprirla partendo da questo hotel boutique.

Le camere, la pulizia e il servizio sono impeccabili.Torneremo sicuramente.",5,2011,11,17
137,Wonderful Boutique Hotel,"Super location gleich hinter dem Buckingham Palast. Wunderschoene Zimmer, toll eingerichtet. Der Service ist erstklassig und individuell, Details werden gepflegt.

Im gleichen Haus befindet sich die BBar, sehr gute Gerichte mit einem Hauch von Suedafrika. ",5,2011,10,16
137,London's Top Hotel,"Ein Traum! Wir waren hier auch weil das Hotel so gut auf Tripadvisor bewertet wird. Leider waren nicht über unseren ganzen Reisezeitraum (während der Hochzeit :-() ein Zimmer zu Verfügung - hier wären wir gerne länger geblieben. In der Nähe der Victoria Station liegt dieses kleine, aber wirklich feine Hotel. Es hat nur 25 Zimmer und könnte fast auch ein Privathaus sein. Der Service ist unvergleichlich und die Einrichtung ist wirklich top. Hier würde ich sofort wieder hinfahren.",5,2011,05,06
137,Unvergleichliches Hotel; Perfekter Service,"Meine Frau und ich haben 3 Nächte in einer Junior Suite verbracht und wir können nur sagen: Dieses Hotel ist wirklich einmalig!
Beginnend mit der Ankunft fühlt man sich perfekt umsorgt. Wir wurden in der Lobby mit einem Glas Champagner begrüsst und haben die Formalitäten erledigt. Anschliessend wurde uns von unserem Butler (sensationell: Li Long) das Zimmer gezeigt. 
Die Zimmer sind wirklich sehr schön gestaltet. Alles ist auf dem neuesten technischen Stand aber trotzdem sehr dezent und detailverliebt. Das Design ist in schwarz/weiss gehalten, die Möbel in edlen Hölzern. In unserer Suite gab es einen Kamin was natürlich per se schon eine einzigartige Atmosphäre schafft. Das Badezimmer ist sehr geräumig (was in London eher selten ist) und absolut sauber. Die Fotos auf der Website können leider nicht den gesamten Charme der Zimmers und des Hotels wiedergeben finde ich, aber es ist wirklich der Tempel des Wohlbefindens. 
Das wichtigste ist aber der durchweg perfekte Service. Man hat nie das Gefühl das der Service aufdringlich ist, trotzdem ist immer ein dienstbarer Geist zugegegen der wirklich JEDEN Wunsch möglich macht.
Das Frühstück und der abendliche Run auf die Bar  sind ebenfalls exzellent.
Für meine Frau und mich gibt es weltweit kein vergleichbares Hotel und wir werden definitiv wiederkommen (nachdem ich mich von der Hotelrechnung erholt habe...).",5,2011,03,03
137,Ein ganz spezieller Ort,"Das ""kleine"" Hotel liegt in der Nähe der Victoria Station und des Buckingham Palace und ist daher sehr gut zu erreichen.

137,Wohlfühl-Hotel,"Das 41'er liegt in der Nähe der Victoria Station und man wird von ausgesprochen freundlichen Mitarbeitern empfangen (der Champagner war hervorragend) und über den gesamten Aufenthalt hin begleitet. Das Zimmer (executive) war sauber, großzügig und (wie auch die Flure) ohne störende Gerüche. In der Lounge-Bar galt neben aufmerksamer Bedienung auch Selbstbedienung: einfach ""honestly"" in's Büchlein eintragen, was man sich von der umfassenden Auswahl an (Nicht-)alkoholischen Pretiosen nimmt. Das Frühstück ist völlig ausreichend umfangreich, wir hatten u.a. das Full English Breakfast, das von einem allein kaum zu schaffen ist. Die 24h-served-snacks sind ebenfalls reichhaltig und lecker. Über die Preise braucht man sich wohl nicht wundern - man ist eben in London. Erwähnenswert ist auch noch die kleine Computerecke, in der man surfen, oder sich die Flugbuchung ausdrucken oder mit dem Ipad herum spielen kann. LAN/WLAN ist natürlich ohnehin im Zimmer. Jeder unserer Taxifahrer kannte übrigens das Hotel.",5,2010,10,17

Eine prächtige Eingangstür, die aber  aber auch in ein Privathaus führen könnte, ein Concierge und dann mit dem Lift in den fünften Stock. Nur 25 Zimmer, davon 4 Suiten, alle vom Charakter einer edlen Privatresidenz. Fireplace, sehr gepflegtes Mobiliar, bequemste Betten, eine kleine Study mit Arbeitstisch, das Interior in schwarz-weiss gehalten. Ganz ruhig, Fenster zum Innenhof. Bose-Soundsystem, TV etwas klein. Highlight ist die zentrale Conservatory mit Glasdach. Hier ist die Reception, Bar, antiquarisches Mobiliar vom Feinsten, Fireplace, eine Pantry tagsüber, die Gäste plündern dürfen. Service ist freundlich, sehr aufmerksam, dennoch unauffällig. Ideal für einen verschwiegenen Aufenthalt auf höchstem Niveau.",5,2010,09,02
137,Merece ser el #1 en TripAdvisor,"La verdad este hotel me encanto, me encanto.  Es muy lindo, muy bien decorado, tipico glamour Ingles pero sin ser arrivistas ni finjidos.   La hubicacion es muy buena y la servicio es muy bueno.  Los empleados son relajados y cordiales, no se esfuerzan tanto por impresionarte pero hacen su trabajo bien hecho.  El lobby es muy lindo y comodo, y tienen pasabocas siempre afuera para que cuando llegues o salgas cojas un bocadillo rapido.. chocolates, caramelos, nueces, gomas, etc.  Nuestra suit fue comoda y decorada buen bien, simple y elegante pero sin sobrepasarse. 
La verdad aqui volveria sin pensarlo dos veces.",5,2010,08,04
137,"Kleines Juwel, very English und mittendrin !","Es ist ein Juwel, aber es ist wirklich klein: Zimmer sind gekonnt in Szene gesetzt, so dass die spärliche Fläche auf den ersten Blick nicht ins Auge fällt. Wer kann, sollte sich die Suiten leisten. Englisches Personal gewohnt service-orientiert und sehr höflich, ausländisches Personal sehr bemüht. 
Traditionelles British Breakfast mit allem ,was dazu gehört in wunderschönem Raum, der jedoch am weekend unter Überfüllung leidet und man sich daher auf Wartezeiten einstellen sollte. 
Betten sehr gut. 
Lage ideal, 3 Min. Fussweg zur Victoria Tube and Railway Station sowie ebenfalls 3 Min. bis Buckingham Palace.",4,2010,06,21

137,Sencillamente maravilloso,"No me equivoqué al elegir este hotel como regalo sorpresa para el cumpleaños de mi novia. Desde nuestra llegada al aeropuerto, donde nos recogió un chófer para llevarnos al hotel en un lujoso coche, hasta que salimos del hotel camino de vuelta a casa, todo ha sido extraordinariamente maravilloso, exquisito e inolvidable. 

¡¡Gracias a Andrew y a todo su equipo, te sientes incluso mejor que en tu casa!! No te sientes un cliente más de un hotel, sino que tienes la sensación de que ya te conocen desde antes de hacer el check-in (acogedor el momento del check-in, donde tomas el primer contacto con el Lounge mientras te ofrecen algo de beber). Cuando vamos de viaje al extranjero procuramos no pasar mucho tiempo en el hotel, pero en este caso estábamos deseando volver al 41 para pasar un agradable rato en el Lounge junto a la chimenea y tomar una cerveza con la agradable música y el staff que estaba siempre pendiente de ti y dispuesto a tener una conversación informal contigo. 
Merece la pena alojarse en este pequeño hotel. Hemos estado en muchos hoteles por Europa y sin  duda aquí es donde menos nos ha importado gastarnos el dinero, y eso que es el más caro en el que hemos estado. Pero no importa, siempre que vaya a Londres intentaré alojarme en el 41. 

¡¡¡Muchas gracias !!!

137,Bello.non bellissimo,"Un week end a Londra verso la fine di novembre.
Ammagliato dalle recensioni e da abili foto,scelgo il 41 hotel.
Risultato:belle le zone comuni,in particolare la sala principale con tanto di caminetto acceso.Stile molto club british:leggermente carico ma,nel complesso,apprezzabile.
Camere più modernose ,in assoluto contrasto con la lobby:tema bianco/nero ricorrente.Stanze un poco piccole ma dotate di vari comodità ( per lo più a pagamento).Corridoi labirintici e buietti.
Colazione nella norma per l'ambizione dell'albergo ma un poco ridimensionata rispetto le foto presentate sul sito internet.
Personale gentile e disponibile.Tariffe discutibili altrove:adeguate per Londra.
Dislocazione molto buona: accontenta le esigenze del turista.
Conclusione:un'esperienza abbastanza positiva,senza pecche macroscopiche,ma,sinceramente non credo che vi ci ritornerò.",4,2008,12,22
137,Fantastisch,"Meine Freundin und ich haben im Dezember ein Wochenende in London verbracht und haben anhand der Reviews dieser Seite das Hotel 41 gewählt. Ein Glücksfall!!! Vom ersten Moment an bis zur Abreise war das Hotel einfach traumhaft. Der Service war tadellos (inkl. kleiner Aufmerksamkeiten rund um die Uhr, das Zimmer hervorragend geschnitten und eingerichtet (wenn auch nicht wirklich geräumig - bei weitem aber mehr als nötig) und das Bett war ein Traum...
Wir hatten das Glück, daß wir eines der wenigen Zimmer mit Blick auf die Royal Mews bekommen, auch wenn man im Gegenzug auf den Kamin (wohl in den meisten Zimmern enthalten) und eine seperate Dusche (Badewanne mit Dusch ecke) verzichten muss. So war es nicht ganz so schlimm, dass ich ca. 90 % der Zeit im Zimmer verbringen musste - da mich eine Influenza aufs übelste erwischt hatte.
Insgesamt ein wundervolles Hotel...
